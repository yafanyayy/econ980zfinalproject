Hope everybody got a chance to enjoy some of our great products over the holiday with their family and friends. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2015 sales and earnings results.
Before we get started with a review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance with Constellation's stock increasing almost 40% for calendar year 2014. Now this is the third consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. Our stock price has been on fire, increasing almost 400% during the 3-year time horizon beginning in calendar 2012. This tremendous stock price appreciation is being driven primarily by our beer business, which has incredible momentum and we believe strong potential for future growth. And we're making smart investments now to ensure that we have the quality, capacity, control and flexibility to help us meet demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future.
In addition to our ongoing brewery expansion in Nava, Mexico, we recently began implementing our multifaceted glass sourcing strategy, which includes the acquisition of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant, which is located adjacent to our Nava brewery. The formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer to own, operate and expand the Nava Glass plant and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer, Vitro, which will begin to ramp up glass supply in fiscal 2016. Overall, we believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimum solution for this essential component of our beer production process.
Our third quarter beer results are evidence of the great momentum we are currently experiencing for the business as we achieved depletion growth of 8% with strong underlying sales growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, Constellation's beer business generated the vast majority of total U.S. industry volume growth in IRI channels during the third quarter. We're growing both volume and dollar share of the industry at a time when overall beer growth is lackluster for the U.S. beer market. Our entire Mexican portfolio, including Corona Light, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria are all delivering strong growth, which is leading to record sales results, brand by brand, across the entire business.
Corona Extra continues to dominate as the #1 imported beer in the U.S., selling greater than 50 million more cases than the next closest import competitor and growing at the highest trend rate in years. These results are being driven by distribution growth, velocity gains and incremental marketing support, including the general market and Hispanic, Find Your Beach and Epic Moments advertising campaigns, as well as the return of the O Tannenbaum on English and Spanish language TV during the holiday season.
Modelo Especial how continues to perform beyond expectations and is expected to soon surpass Heineken across all channels as the #2 imported beer in the U.S. Continued investment in national Hispanic TV helped propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail takeaway volume trends of more than 20% in IRI channels during the quarter.
Corona Light posted solid growth during the quarter driven by the continued success of Corona Light draft, which entered 3 new markets, as well as increased distribution for bottles and cans. Ongoing marketing support featured national football retail promotions, which helped merchandise the draft's format in the non-premise channel during football season. Overall, the strong shipment volumes of the beer business generated in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015. Keep in mind that distributors also increased their inventory levels during the quarter in order to return them to more historical levels as well as to support the ongoing growth opportunities for our product portfolio going forward. As a result, the second time this year, we are increasing our fiscal 2015 forecast for the beer business and now expect beer sales to grow in the low teen range with operating profit growth of mid- to high teens.
From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Our second can line, which was installed in late summer, has become operational and is expected to significantly supplement our canned product availability as we continue to pursue this market opportunity. Major structural steel erection for the packaging building was completed on schedule in mid-December, and the remaining beer tanks were installed in the brewhouse in late November. We initiated investment activity for the recently announced $5 million hectoliter capacity expansion, and we have progressed with rail, logistics and site infrastructure additions resulting from this incremental capacity expansion.
Finally, the glass joint venture has ordered materials for the construction of the next glass furnace to be built on site at the newly acquired factory.
Overall, I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by the dedicated efforts of our sales marketing and operations teams as well as our distributors who are collectively working together to deliver winning results.
And now I would like to focus on operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the third quarter, we achieved EBIT growth for the wine and spirits segment that is expected to drive results for the year at the upper end of the low to mid-single-digit guidance range that we previously provided. Our spirits business performed exceptionally well, posting sales growth of more than 25%. We began integrating the Casa Noble Tequila brand into our portfolio, and the brand is quickly gaining traction and beginning to contribute to our spirits business. The superpremium tequila is a fantastic fit with our business and helps us to attract new consumers as tequila and Mexican beer share similar drinking occasions, both on and off premise. We experienced excellent sales growth for our existing spirits brands during the third quarter driven by new flavor line extensions across our portfolio, including SVEDKA mango pineapple and strawberry lemonade as well as the recent introduction of Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy peach flavor. In addition, we gained IRI volume and dollar share off the 3 spirits categories that represent our market participation, including imported vodka, Canadian whiskey and brandy.
From a wine perspective, outside the U.S., our Canadian business posted solid third quarter results, although our international business was negatively impacted by a decline in both wine sales and economic disruption in Eastern Europe. In the U.S., although the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rates we anticipated when we set our original estimates earlier this year. Thus, our third quarter U.S. wine results did not meet our growth expectations. In addition, the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels as our premium priced products are growing faster than our superpremium and above products. This has resulted in U.S. market share dollar erosion, especially in the superpremium price segment, which remains highly competitive and currently generates much of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market, and we are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of mind to consumers at all key price segments. For example, the wine consumers' willingness to experiment with new brands and flavors over the last several years has opened a key opportunity for innovation and new product development. And although our recent new product development initiatives have seen mixed results, we remain committed to innovation and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. In addition, we are currently initiating or expanding product releases in the U.S. for new wines such as PopCrush, Tom Gordon Vineyards, Jailbreak, Watchdog and early launch results for these brands are quite positive. We know, however, that the success of innovation cannot come at the expense of the health of our established brands. As such, we have plans in place to concentrate our efforts on an important subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that are mix- and margin-accretive, have scale and growth momentum.
Although our U.S. wine business is not expected to achieve its expected market dollar share goals for the year, as we are falling short of our initial expectation for volumes and depletions, we believe the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned the business going forward. We have negotiated the majority of our exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements, which include improved performance metrics and incremental incentives that are expected to benefit Constellation and enhanced wholesaler and retailer execution. We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast-growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. And I would be remiss if I did not highlight recent awards and accolades for some of our key wine brands. MarketWatch Magazine recently awarded the Best New Wine Product of 2014 honor to Thorny Rose. Constellation Brands received 24 medals across the portfolio at the 2014 Somelier Challenge International Wine Competition. Inniskillin Midol 2012 reached a 99-point score and wine of the year, while Ruffino received 7 medals, including best-in-class distinction, and 96 points for the 2011 Ruffino Modus. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi was featured in the Best Buy section of the November issue of Wine Enthusiast buying guide, while Robert Mondavi, Napa Valley, Cabernet and Robert Mondavi 2012 Pinot Noir Reserve both received 90-point scores. These awards and accolades are a great reminder of the exceptional quality and strength in our portfolio of wines.
In closing, the strong commercial and operational performance of our beer business is driving significant contributions to our overall sales, profit and cash flow results. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery expansion in Mexico, and we've begun to execute our new glass sourcing arrangements, while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. We have a great premium wine business, and plans are in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing. And I am especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was one of the best-performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples Stocks for the third consecutive year.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results."

This result was in",1192,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.23. That's a 12% increase versus Q3 last year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. This result was in line with our 8% depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high single-digit depletion growth target for full year fiscal '15. As expected, we saw a shift of approximately 2 million cases to wholesalers from the second quarter into the third quarter as a result of the previously discussed Corona Extra recall activities. This translated into a benefit of about $37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter. Even after excluding this benefit, beer shipment volume growth came in ahead of depletion growth during Q3 as distributors increased their inventory position during the quarter to be more in line with historical levels and to be better positioned to capture growth opportunities going forward. As a result of this activity, for fiscal '15, we now expect beer segment net sales growth to be in the low teens range versus our previous estimate of about 10%.
Operating income growth for the beer segment is now expected to approximate 30% for fiscal '15. When factoring in an estimated full year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid- to high teens range. We still anticipate the full year operating income margin for beer to approximate 32%.
While net sales performance for wine and spirits was somewhat muted during Q3 for the reasons Rob mentioned earlier, EBIT primarily benefited from lower COGS. For fiscal '15, we see net sales for wine and spirits tracking towards the low end of our low to mid-single-digit range and EBIT at the high end of low to mid-single-digit range. Due to the factors just mentioned, we're increasing our fiscal '15 comparable basis EPS outlook to $4.25 to $4.35 a share versus our previous range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release.
Given those highlights, let's look at Q3 performance in more detail. And my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our earnings release, consolidated net sales for Q3 grew 7%. Beer net sales increased 16% primarily due to volume growth. Excluding the impact of the recall activity that I outlined earlier, net sales increased 11%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis were even with the prior year quarter. This primarily reflected higher spirits volume offset by lower wine volume, higher promotional spend and lower bulk wine net sales. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $59 million, primarily due to the higher volume for the beer business and favorable cost of goods sold for wine and spirits.
Our consolidated gross margin increased just over 1 percentage point to 43.5% for the quarter, primarily due to the favorable COGS and reduced bulk wine sales for the wine and spirits business.
SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. The increase was primarily due to higher SG&A for the beer business. Due to factors just mentioned, Q3 consolidated operating income increased $40 million and consolidated operating margin improved 90 basis points.
Equity earnings increased $3 million due to the strong results for our Opus One joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, down 4% versus Q3 last year. This decrease is primarily due to lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.25 billion, an increase of $295 million since the end of fiscal '14. During Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875% notes due 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024. Our strong credit and financial profile, combined with the favorable interest rate environment, helped us execute this attractive financing activity. Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% notes during the quarter. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million in fiscal '15.
Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 29% and compares to our 28% rate for Q3 last year. We continue to expect that our full year fiscal '15 comparable basis tax rate will approximate 30%.
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '15, we generated $209 million of free cash flow compared to $543 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow for the first 9 months of the year totaled $750 million versus $629 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for the first 9 months of fiscal '15 totaled $541 million compared to just $86 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $435 million and is primarily related to the brewery capacity expansion. For fiscal '15, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $275 million to $350 million and CapEx to be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. Our CapEx projection includes $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for the beer segment. As a reminder, we hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, mark-to-market gains and losses on hedge contracts flow through our GAAP income statement. We exclude these mark-to-market gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a commodity contract is settled, a gain or losses allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with others in the consumer space. For Q3, there was a $20 million loss from this activity, which was primarily driven by the mark-to-market on diesel fuel contracts.
Before we start taking your questions, I'd like to note we are very pleased with how fiscal '15 has progressed so far, and we believe we are well positioned as we head toward the completion of another phenomenal year for Constellation. Our wine and spirits business is on track to generate solid EBIT growth for the year, while our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace, growing well ahead of the total U.S. beer category. We're also pleased to have begun advancing efforts around our beer glass sourcing strategy with the recent formation of the 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois and the JV's acquisition of the Nava glass plant. In addition, our beer production capacity expansion efforts continue to progress as planned. The glass sourcing and capacity expansion initiatives will position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for our beer segment.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

On -- as you saw, we did have a good beer margin -- I'm sorry, wine margin performance in the quarter, and we expect that to continue for the full year. As you know, we just changed our guidance to be at the low end of sales growth, the high end of EBIT growth, which means that we'll see margin expansion this year. On a long-term basis, we still expect the wine segment to maintain margins. I think there was some positive outcomes this year, mostly around cost of goods sold, which are really helping recover margins from the last few years' erosion. But I wouldn't expect big margin expansion in wine -- in the wine segment going forward, but I do expect to at least maintain margins. And I think around EBITDA and free cash flow, we continue to -- as you know, we're spending a ton of money in the beer segment, which we're quite happy to do because the return on capital in that segment is north of 40%. So it's a very quick payback, and the EBITDA growth of the total company will be growing well in excess of the capital spending growth, even though capital spending is going up so much. And again, a lot of that is driven by the beer segment, phenomenal EBITDA growth there. And I think in line with what we've been saying over the last 2 years, as we have pretty good visibility to getting our EBITDA leverage below 4x, I would say that the #1 agenda item for use of free cash flow is returning it to shareholders and probably at the top of that list, would be an initiation of a dividend. We're one of the few people certainly with our financial profile and in beverage, alcohol and consumers, in general -- consumer products in general that don't have a dividend. And we're quite confident that this really good free cash flow generation will continue. So we'll probably be looking for dividend in the very near future."

In the beer segment, and look, in the grand scheme of things, we are very much a North American business and actually very much a U.S. business. And in the grand scheme of things, we are a net importer. So a strong dollar will help us in the grand scheme of things. Now as you can see this quarter, from a translation perspective, there's some hurt because the Canadian dollar is devaluing versus the U.S. dollar. So we translate Canadian earnings. That was about a 1% hurt to our sales. On the peso specifically, our peso-exposed costs are, as you said, Mexican labor, okay, which isn't an enormous piece of our total cost of goods sold, but it's a relatively large piece. And also, as we spend capital, those capital cost, by and large, get capitalized in pesos, so the depreciation in those will also be exposed to foreign exchange, although that's not necessarily cash because it's depreciation.

And we've actually seen very little cannibalization with the draft business. We've introduced it with brands like Corona Light. And in actuality, not only is there not cannibalization, but when we put Corona Light draft in an on-premise establishment, we tend to see a pickup in the bottled or canned product in the area around it because it's really marketing. So we've expanded our Corona Light draft into, for instance, 3 new markets. And we've also been testing Corona in draft as well and are, again, having extremely positive results seeing almost no cannibalization of our glass product when we put draft in, although we're being very careful about that because we want to fully understand what the impact is. Cans, same thing. Great can growth, great can opportunity, represents obviously a very large portion of the market that we haven't participated in. Cans are purchased for consumption. And in cases where glass can't necessarily be used, boats, stadiums, et cetera, and so that also represents a purchase opportunity that largely does not result in cannibalization for us. So these package additions are definitely driving growth in the overall beer business."

And that certainly does not represent full distribution in any regard. The product still skews, from a demographic point of view, extremely heavily Hispanic, even though this penetration in the Hispanic population isn't even where we would like it to be and where it could potentially be. So there's a huge runway in the Hispanic market, and then the general market is very wide open for Modelo Especial and driving distribution and PODs are one of our key initiatives on that brand. And it's going extremely successfully. We've introduced -- this year, because the brand is expanding into the general market now so well, we've introduced general market television advertising, which we think is going to even further accelerate the growth of this product. So the growth runway on this brand is tremendous, and we don't really see any diminishment in growth rates or increases in penetration. Exactly where it's going to get to, I mean, fully distributed product is usually around, I don't know, 90% ACV? So exactly when we get there, I don't know. But we're going to work to get there, and we have everything going in our favor, so the ability to increase distribution and as well as the ability to see velocity per point of distribution increase. So all these things are going to contribute to Modelo Especial continuing to be really the hottest major beer brand in the market of any significance. There's really nothing of that size that's growing like Modelo Especial. And just even anecdotally, as you start -- go around and see what people are drinking, you're seeing all of a sudden Modelo Especial becoming a popular product in the general market as well as in the Hispanic market."

So we're very happy with the top line. The reason for the increasing guidance is more so around the net sales increase, and a lot of that is driven by the distributors bringing in inventories back in line with historical levels. Regarding the economy, hey, look, any time the consumer has more money in their pocket, it's better for consumer product companies. Now whether we benefit more than other companies, I'm not sure.

And not that this affects us particularly, but there's been a lot of pricing being taken in the below $5 commodity segment of the wine business, the popular price.

First of all, spirits is performing extremely well, above our expectations. And that's a real positive in the business, and we're looking at that segment of the business for further investment obviously because it's performing so well for us at the current time. On the wine side, we had a couple of, I'll say, somewhat anomalous things that have impacted us. For instance, Eastern Europe impacted us to some degree this year, even though it's not a very significant piece of our business, it was just so -- that geography was so devastated by everything that would happen. We lost some sales in Eastern Europe. We also exited some bulk wine related to the international market, which did affect the top line, but really didn't have any affect on the bottom line because it's just commodity bulk wine business, and it was a business that we frankly just don't even want to continue doing. And that affected the top line a bit. And then in the U.S., we did take some pricing on some of our low-end products that impacted things on the top line, but obviously contributed to our bottom line growth. And then as far as our promotional activity goes, we expect that we'll be holding that flat pretty much this year. We didn't expect that to have much of an impact. It probably had a little bit of an impact. But again, trying to keep a balanced approach to both the top line and the bottom line, I think that it's worked out pretty well. So all that said, we would like to hold market share, if not grow it, but we're going to keep a balanced approach to growing both the top line and the bottom line."

Because I guess, the big brands do a lot around Super Bowl. Would that affect the trend of this 8% depletions, the fact that you're heading into a time of heavy big brand marketing?"

We aren't necessarily correlating pricing to our ABI inflation -- we're at a higher level there. And you can see what's happening in the category pricing if you look at IRI, if you look at Nielsen. Regarding marketing, there is some timing. So beer marketing is up every quarter. It's up year-over-year. But for this quarter, marketing as a percentage of sales in beer probably came down. That being said, to your point, we are -- NFL is one of our heaviest properties for advertising. So we would expect that to ramp up in the fourth quarter, and we expect marketing as a percentage of sales in beer for the full year to be up. But we feel that, that more than pays for itself, as you can see with the results on the top line. For wine and spirits, we're also increasing marketing. In the third quarter, we increased it, and we expect to increase it again in the fourth quarter, as Rob said, mostly around our already successful Focus Brands, a really slimmed-down version of Focus Brands like Kim Crawford, Mark West, brands like that that have been very successful and have the -- we've seen positive response, and we feel that there's a pretty good payoff for increasing marketing against those brands. So we are continuing to invest in our brands which is working, right? I mean, certainly, in beer, we're going well ahead of the category. And wine didn't have the greatest quarter, but we're still investing in the brands. And those brands have had very good results and have responded pretty well to the marketing investments."

Hope everybody got the chance to enjoy some of our great products over the holiday with their family and friends. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2015 s",1786,"Thanks, Patty, and then good morning and happy new year to everyone. Hope everybody got the chance to enjoy some of our great products over the holiday with their family and friends. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2015 sales and earnings results.
Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation's stock increasing almost 40% for calendar year 2014. Now this is the third consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. Our stock price has been on fire, increasing almost 400% during the 3-year time horizon beginning in calendar 2012. This tremendous stock price appreciation is being driven primarily by our beer business, which has incredible momentum and we believe strong potential for future growth. And we're making smart investments now to ensure that we have the quality, capacity, control and flexibility to help us meet demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future.
In addition to our ongoing brewery expansion in Nava, Mexico, we recently began implementing our multifaceted glass-sourcing strategy, which includes the acquisition of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant which is located adjacent to our Nava Brewery; the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer, to own, operate and expand the Nava glass plant; and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer, Vitro, which will begin to ramp up glass supply in fiscal 2016. Overall, we believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process.
Our third quarter beer results are evidence of the great momentum we are currently experiencing for the business as we achieved depletion growth of 8% with strong underlying sales growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, Constellation's beer business generated the vast majority of total U.S. industry volume growth in IRI channels during the third quarter. We're growing both volume and dollar share of the industry at a time when overall beer growth is lackluster for the U.S. beer market. Our entire Mexican portfolio, including Corona Light, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria, are all delivering strong growth, which is leading to record sales results, brand by brand, across the entire business.
Corona Extra continues to dominate as the #1 imported beer in the U.S., selling greater than 50 million more cases than the next closest import competitor and growing at the highest trend rate in years. These results are being driven by distribution growth, velocity gains and incremental marketing support, including the general market and Hispanic ""Find Your Beach"" and ""Epic Moments"" advertising campaigns as well as the return of the O Tannenbaum's spot on English- and Spanish-language TV during the holiday season.
Modelo Especial continues to perform beyond expectations and is expected to soon surpass Heineken across all channels as the #2 imported beer in the U.S. Continued investment in national Hispanic TV helped propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail takeaway volume trends of more than 20% in IRI channels during the quarter.
Corona Light posted solid growth during the quarter, driven by the continued success of Corona Light draft which entered 3 new markets as well as increased distribution for bottles and cans. Ongoing marketing support featured national football retail promotions, which helped merchandise the draft format in the on-premise channel during football season. Overall, the strong shipment volumes that the beer business generated in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015. Keep in mind that distributors also increased their inventory levels during the quarter in order to return them to more historical levels as well as to support the ongoing growth opportunities for our product portfolio going forward. As a result, the second time this year, we are increasing our fiscal 2015 forecast for the beer business and now expect beer sales to grow in the low teen range, with operating profit growth of mid- to high teens.
From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well under way, with the project expansion on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Our second can line, which was installed late summer, has become operational and is expected to significantly supplement our can product availability as we continue to pursue this market opportunity. Major structural steel erection for the packaging building was completed on schedule in mid-December, and the remaining beer tanks were installed in the brewhouse in late November. We initiated investment activity for the recently announced 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion, and we have progressed with rail, logistics and site infrastructure additions resulting from this incremental capacity expansion.
Finally, the glass joint venture has ordered materials for the construction of the next glass furnace to be built on site at the newly acquired factory.
Overall, I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by the dedicated efforts of our sales, marketing and operations teams as well as our distributors who are collectively working together to deliver winning results.
And now I would like to focus on operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the third quarter, we achieved EBIT growth for the wine and spirits segment that is expected to drive results for the year at the upper end of the low to mid-single-digit guidance range that we previously provided. Our spirits business performed exceptionally well, posting sales growth of more than 25%. We began integrating the Casa Noble Tequila brand into our portfolio and the brand is quickly gaining traction and beginning to contribute to our spirits business. The superpremium tequila is a fantastic fit with our business and helps us to attract new consumers as tequila and Mexican beer share similar drinking occasions, both on and off premise. We experienced excellent sales growth for our existing spirits brands during the third quarter, driven by new flavor line extensions across our portfolio, including SVEDKA Mango Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as well as the recent introduction of Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy Peach flavor. In addition, we gained IRI volume and dollar share of the 3 spirits categories that represent our market participation, including imported vodka, Canadian whiskey and brandy.
From a wine perspective, outside the U.S., our Canadian business posted solid third quarter results, although our international business was negatively impacted by a decline in bulk wine sales and economic disruption in Eastern Europe. In the U.S., although the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rates we anticipated when we set our original estimates earlier this year. Thus, our third quarter U.S. wine results did not meet our growth expectations. In addition, the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels as our premium-priced products are growing faster than our superpremium-and-above products. This has resulted in U.S. market share dollar erosion especially in the superpremium price segment, which remains highly competitive and currently generates much of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market, and we are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of mind to consumers in all key price segments. For example, the wine consumer's willingness to experiment with new brands and flavors over the last several years has opened a key opportunity for innovation and new product development. And although our recent new product development initiatives have seen mixed results, we remain committed to innovation and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. In addition, we are currently initiating or expanding product releases in the U.S. for new wines such as PopCrush, Tambor Vineyards, Jail Break, Watchdog Rock and early launch results for these brands are quite positive. We know however that the success of innovation cannot come at the expense of the health of our established brands. As such, we have plans in place to concentrate our efforts on an important subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that are mix- and margin-accretive, have scale and growth momentum.
Although our U.S. wine business is not expected to achieve its expected market dollar share goals for the year, as we are falling short of our initial expectation for volumes and depletions, we believe the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned the business going forward. We have negotiated the majority of our exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements, which include improved performance metrics and incremental incentives that are expected to benefit Constellation and enhance wholesaler and retail execution. We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast-growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. And I would be remiss if I did not highlight recent awards and accolades for some of our key wine brands. Market Watch Magazine recently awarded the Best New Wine Product of 2014 honor to Thorny Rose. Constellation Brands received 24 medals across the portfolio at the 2014 Sommeliers Challenge International Wine Competition. Inniskillin Vidal 2012 reached the 99-point score and wine of the year, while Ruffino received 7 medals, including best-in-class distinction and 96 points for the 2011 Ruffino Modus. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi was featured in the Best Buy section of the November issue of Wine Enthusiast Buying Guide, while Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet and Robert Mondavi 2012 Pinot Noir Reserve both received 90-point scores. These awards and accolades are a great reminder of the exceptional quality and strength in our portfolio of wines.
In closing, the strong commercial and operational performance of our beer business is driving significant contributions to our overall sales, profit and cash flow results. We are working diligently on the Nava Brewery expansion in Mexico and we've begun to execute our new glass-sourcing arrangements while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. We have a great premium wine business, and plans are in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing. And I am especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was one of the best-performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks for the third consecutive year.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results."

Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.23. That's a 12% increase versus Q3 last year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, with depletion growth of 8%. This result was in",1191,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.23. That's a 12% increase versus Q3 last year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, with depletion growth of 8%. This result was in line with our 8% depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high single-digit depletion growth target for full year fiscal '15. As expected, we saw a shift of approximately 2 million cases to wholesalers from the second quarter into the third quarter as a result of the previously discussed Corona Extra recall activities. This translated into a benefit of about $37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter. Even after excluding this benefit, beer shipment volume growth came in ahead of depletion growth during Q3 as distributors increased their inventory position during the quarter to be more in line with historical levels and to be better positioned to capture growth opportunities going forward. As a result of this activity, for fiscal '15, we now expect beer segment net sales growth to be in the low teens range versus our previous estimate of about 10%.
Operating income growth for the beer segment is now expected to approximate 30% for fiscal '15. When factoring in an estimated full year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid- to high teens range. We still anticipate the full year operating income margin for beer to approximate 32%.
While net sales performance for wine and spirits was somewhat muted during Q3 for the reasons Rob mentioned earlier, EBIT primarily benefited from lower COGS. For fiscal '15, we see net sales for wine and spirits tracking towards the low end of our low to mid-single-digit range and EBIT at the high end of our low to mid-single-digit range. Due to the factors just mentioned, we're increasing our fiscal '15 comparable basis EPS outlook to $4.25 to $4.35 a share versus our previous range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release.
Given those highlights, let's look at Q3 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our earnings release, consolidated net sales for Q3 grew 7%. Beer net sales increased 16% primarily due to volume growth. Excluding the impact of the recall activity that I outlined earlier, net sales increased 11%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis were even with the prior year quarter. This primarily reflected higher spirits volume offset by lower wine volume, higher promotional spend and lower bulk wine net sales. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $59 million, primarily due to the higher volume for the beer business and favorable cost of goods sold for wine and spirits.
Our consolidated gross margin increased just over 1 percentage point to 43.5% for the quarter, primarily due to the favorable COGS and reduced bulk wine sales for the wine and spirits business.
SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. The increase was primarily due to higher SG&A for the beer business. Due to factors just mentioned, Q3 consolidated operating income increased $40 million and consolidated operating margin improved 90 basis points.
Equity earnings increased $3 million due to the strong results for our Opus One joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, down 4% versus Q3 last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.25 billion, an increase of $295 million since the end of fiscal '14. During Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875% notes due 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024. Our strong credit and financial profile, combined with the favorable interest rate environment, helped us execute this attractive financing activity. Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% notes during the quarter. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million in fiscal '15.
Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 29% and compares to our 28% rate for Q3 last year. We continue to expect that our full year fiscal '15 comparable basis tax rate will approximate 30%.
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '15, we generated $209 million of free cash flow compared to $543 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow for the first 9 months of the year totaled $750 million versus $629 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for the first 9 months of fiscal '15 totaled $541 million compared to just $86 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $435 million and is primarily related to the brewery capacity expansion. For fiscal '15, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $275 million to $350 million and CapEx to be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. Our CapEx projection includes $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for the beer segment. 
As a reminder, we hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, mark-to-market gains and losses on hedge contracts flow through our GAAP income statement. We exclude these mark-to-market gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a commodity contract is settled, a gain or loss is allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with others in the consumer space. For Q3, there was a $20 million loss from this activity, which was primarily driven by the mark-to-market on diesel fuel contracts.
Before we start taking your questions, I'd like to note we are very pleased with how fiscal '15 has progressed so far and we believe we are well positioned as we head toward the completion of another phenomenal year for Constellation. Our wine and spirits business is on track to generate solid EBIT growth for the year, while our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace, growing well ahead of the total U.S. beer category. We're also pleased to have begun advancing efforts around our beer glass-sourcing strategy with the recent formation of the 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois and the JV's acquisition of the Nava glass plant. In addition, our beer production capacity expansion efforts continue to progress as planned. The glass-sourcing and capacity-expansion initiatives will position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for our beer segment.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

On -- as you saw, we did have good beer margin -- I'm sorry, wine margin performance in the quarter and we expect that to continue for the full year. As you know, we just changed our guidance to be at the low end of sales growth and the high end of EBIT growth, which means that we will see margin expansion this year. On a long-term basis, we still expect the wine segment to maintain margins. I think there were some positive outcomes this year, mostly around cost of goods sold, which are really helping recover margins from the last few years' erosion. But I wouldn't expect big margin expansion in wine -- in the wine segment going forward, but we do expect to at least maintain margins. And I think around EBITDA and free cash flow, we continue to -- as you know, we're spending a ton of money in the beer segment, which we're quite happy to do because the return on capital in that segment is north of 40% so it's a very quick payback. And the EBITDA growth of the total company will be growing well in excess of the capital spending growth, even though capital spending is going up so much. And again, a lot of that is driven by the beer segment, the phenomenal EBITDA growth there. So I think in line with what we've been saying over the last 2 years, as we have a pretty good visibility to getting our EBITDA leverage below 4x, I would say that the #1 agenda item for use of free cash flow is returning it to shareholders and probably at the top of that list would be an initiation of a dividend. We're one of the few people, certainly with our financial profile and in beverage, alcohol and consumers in general -- consumer products in general, that don't have a dividend. And we're quite confident that this really good free cash flow generation will continue. So we'll probably be looking for dividend in the very near future."

Now as you can see this quarter, from a translation perspective, there's some hurt because the Canadian dollar is devaluing versus the U.S. dollar. So we translate Canadian earnings. That was about a 1% hurt to our sales. On the peso specifically, our peso-exposed costs are, as you said, Mexican labor, okay, which isn't an enormous piece of our total cost of goods sold, but it's a relatively large piece. And also as we spend capital, those capital cost, by and large, get capitalized in pesos, so the depreciation on those will also be exposed to foreign exchange, although that's not necessarily cash because it's depreciation. So net-net, the strong dollar will help us versus our Mexican import costs. That also being said, we do hedge our transaction currencies so we aren't 100% exposed to those peso costs because we will have some hedges going out.

And we've actually seen very little cannibalization with the draft business. We've introduced it with brands like Corona Light. And in actuality, not only is there not cannibalization, but when we put Corona Light draft in an on-premise establishment, we tend to see a pickup in the bottled or can product in the area around it because it's really marketing. So we've expanded our Corona Light draft into, for instance, 3 new markets. And we've also been testing Corona in draft as well and are again having extremely positive results seeing almost no cannibalization of our glass product when we put draft in, although we're being very careful about that because we want to fully understand what the impact is. Cans, same thing. Great can growth, great can opportunity, represents obviously a very large portion of the market that we haven't participated in. Cans are purchased for consumption. And in cases where glass can't necessarily be used, boats, beach, stadiums, et cetera, and so that also represents a purchase opportunity that largely does not result in cannibalization for us. So these package additions are definitely driving growth in the overall beer business."

And that certainly does not represent full distribution in any regard. The product still skews, from a demographic point of view, extremely heavily Hispanic, even though this penetration in the Hispanic population isn't even where we would like it to be and where it could potentially be. So there's a huge runway in the Hispanic market, and then the general market is very wide open for Modelo Especial and driving distribution and PODs are one of our key initiatives on that brand. So -- and it's going extremely successfully. We've introduced this year -- because the brand is expanding into the general market now so well, we've introduced general market television advertising, which we think is going to even further accelerate the growth of this product. So the growth runway on this brand is tremendous, and we don't really see any diminishment in growth rates or increases in penetration. Exactly where it's going to get to. I mean, fully distributed product is usually around, I don't know, 90% ACV? So exactly when we get there, I don't know. But we're going to work to get there, and we have everything going in our favor, so the ability to increase distribution and -- as well as the ability to see velocity per point of distribution increase. So all these things are going to contribute to Modelo Especial continuing to be really the hottest major beer brand in the market of any significance. There's really nothing of that size that's growing like Modelo Especial. And just even anecdotally, as you start -- go around and see what people are drinking, I mean, you're seeing all of a sudden Modelo Especial becoming a popular product in the general market as well as in the Hispanic market."

And actually, depletion growth has been very consistent. The impressive thing is there is sequential improvement because Q3 and Q4 is overlapping higher growth last year. So we're very happy with the top line. The reason for the increasing guidance is more so around the net sales increase, and a lot of that is driven by the distributors bringing inventories back in line with historical levels. Regarding the economy, hey, look, any time the consumer has more money in their pocket, it's better for consumer product companies. Now whether we benefit more than other companies, I'm not sure.

This year, those products are still growing very well, but not at the rate that they were. And not that this affects us particularly, but there's been a lot of pricing being taken in the below $5 commodity segment of the wine business, the popular price. And that's turned into pretty heavy negative territory. So I think that, that's driving the overall market down maybe 100 basis points or something to that effect. It's still trending pretty much sort of consistently, plus or minus 100 basis points, with where it's trended sort of historically over the long term.

As we get off our Transition Services Agreement, we start staffing up in the beer segments, we are maintaining the 32% operating profit margin from the beer segment for the year. So this is in line with what we expected. Regarding the glass contracts, they really won't start to impact us until next fiscal year.

And we have a lot of plans in place around innovation, around NPD, around concentrating our spends against higher growth elements of our portfolio, which we think will address that, largely, however, without spending a lot more money. And I say, consistent with what Bob said, also important is that we maintained wine margins. We do want to see deterioration in that segment of the business either. So we will implement basically plans and programs that will drive the top line but not necessarily increase spending and therefore hurt margins. So we intend to take a balanced approach in that regard, but we definitely don't like and don't want to lose share. Now you look at our wine and spirits segment, okay? First of all, spirits is performing extremely well, above our expectations. And that's a real positive in the business, and we're looking at that segment of the business for further investment obviously because it's performing so well for us at the current time. And on the wine side, we had a couple of, I'll say, somewhat anomalous things that have impacted us. For instance, Eastern Europe impacted us to some degree this year, even though it's not a very significant piece of our business, it was just so -- that geography was so devastated by everything that would happen. We lost some sales in Eastern Europe. We also exited some bulk wine related to the international market, which did affect the top line, but really didn't have any affect on the bottom line because it's just commodity bulk wine business, and it was a business that we frankly just don't even want to continue doing. And that affected the top line a bit. And then in the U.S., we did take some pricing on some of our low-end products that impacted things on the top line, but obviously contributed to our bottom line growth. And then as far as our promotional activity goes, we expect that we'll be holding that flat pretty much this year. We didn't expect that to have much of an impact. It probably had a little bit of an impact. But again, trying to keep a balanced approach to both the top line and the bottom line, I think that it's worked out pretty well. So all that said, we would like to hold market share, if not grow it, but we're going to keep a balanced approach to growing both the top line and the bottom line."

So we would expect that to ramp up in the fourth quarter, and we expect marketing as a percentage of sales in beer for the full year to be up. But we feel that, that more than pays for itself, as you can see with the results on the top line. For wine and spirits, we're also increasing marketing. In the third quarter, we increased it, and we expect to increase it again in the fourth quarter, as Rob said, mostly around our already successful Focus Brands, a really slimmed-down version of Focus Brands like Kim Crawford, Mark West, brands like that, that have been very successful and have -- we've seen positive response, and we feel that there's a pretty good payoff for increasing marketing against those brands. So we are continuing to invest in our brands which is working, right? I mean, certainly, in beer, we're going well ahead of the category. And wine didn't have the greatest quarter, but we're still investing in the brands. And those brands have had very good results and have responded pretty well to the marketing investments."

Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation's stock increasing almost 40% for calendar year 2014. Now this is the third consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. Our stock price has been on fire, increasing almost 400% during the 3-year time horizon beginning in calendar 2012. This tremendous stock price appreciation is being driven primarily by our beer business, which has incredible momentum and, we believe, strong potential for future growth. And we're making smart investments now to ensure that we have the quality, capacity, control and flexibility to help us meet demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future.
In addition to our ongoing brewery expansion in Nava, Mexico, we recently began implementing our multifaceted glass-sourcing strategy, which includes the acquisition of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant, which is located adjacent to our Nava Brewery; the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer, to own, operate and expand the Nava glass plant; and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer, Vitro, which will begin to ramp up glass supply in fiscal 2016. Overall, we believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process.
Our third quarter beer results are evidence of the great momentum we are currently experiencing for the business as we achieved depletion growth of 8% with strong underlying sales growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, Constellation's beer business generated the vast majority of total U.S. industry volume growth in IRI channels during the third quarter. We're growing both volume and dollar share of the industry at a time when overall beer growth is lackluster for the U.S. beer market. Our entire Mexican portfolio, including Corona Light, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria, are all delivering strong growth, which is leading to record sales results, brand by brand, across the entire business.
Corona Extra continues to dominate as the #1 imported beer in the U.S., selling greater than 50 million more cases than the next closest import competitor and growing at the highest trend rate in years. These results are being driven by distribution growth, velocity gains and incremental marketing support, including the general market and Hispanic ""Find Your Beach"" and ""Epic Moments"" advertising campaigns as well as the return of the O Tannenbaum's spot on English- and Spanish-language TV during the holiday season.
Modelo Especial continues to perform beyond expectations and is expected to soon surpass Heineken across all channels as the #2 imported beer in the U.S. Continued investment in national Hispanic TV helped propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail takeaway volume trends of more than 20% in IRI channels during the quarter.
Corona Light posted solid growth during the quarter, driven by the continued success of Corona Light draft, which entered 3 new markets, as well as increased distribution for bottles and cans. Ongoing marketing support featured national football retail promotions, which helped merchandise the draft format in the on-premise channel during football season. Overall, the strong shipment volumes that the beer business generated in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015. Keep in mind that distributors also increased their inventory levels during the quarter in order to return them to more historical levels, as well as to support the ongoing growth opportunities for our product portfolio going forward. As a result, the second time this year, we are increasing our fiscal 2015 forecast for the beer business and now expect beer sales to grow in the low-teen range, with operating profit growth of mid to high teens.
From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well underway, with the project expansion on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Our second can line, which was installed late summer, has become operational and is expected to significantly supplement our can product availability as we continue to pursue this market opportunity. Major structural steel erection for the packaging building was completed on schedule in mid-December, and the remaining beer tanks were installed in the brewhouse in late November. We initiated investment activity for the recently announced 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion, and we have progressed with rail, logistics and site infrastructure additions resulting from this incremental capacity expansion.
Finally, the glass joint venture has ordered materials for the construction of the next glass furnace to be built on site at the newly acquired factory.
Overall, I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by the dedicated efforts of our sales, marketing and operations teams, as well as our distributors, who are collectively working together to deliver winning results.
And now I would like to focus on operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the third quarter, we achieved EBIT growth for the wine and spirits segment that is expected to drive results for the year at the upper end of the low- to mid-single-digit guidance range that we previously provided. Our spirits business performed exceptionally well, posting sales growth of more than 25%. We began integrating the Casa Noble Tequila brand into our portfolio, and the brand is quickly gaining traction and beginning to contribute to our spirits business. The superpremium tequila is a fantastic fit with our business and helps us to attract new consumers as tequila and Mexican beer share similar drinking occasions, both on and off premise. We experienced excellent sales growth for our existing spirits brands during the third quarter, driven by new flavor line extensions across our portfolio, including SVEDKA Mango Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as well as the recent introduction of Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy Peach flavor. In addition, we gained IRI volume and dollar share of the 3 spirits categories that represent our market participation, including imported vodka, Canadian whiskey and brandy.
From a wine perspective, outside the U.S., our Canadian business posted solid third quarter results, although our international business was negatively impacted by a decline in bulk wine sales and economic disruption in Eastern Europe. In the U.S., although the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rates we anticipated when we set our original estimates earlier this year. Thus, our third quarter U.S. wine results did not meet our growth expectations. In addition, the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels, as our premium-priced products are growing faster than our superpremium-and-above products. This has resulted in U.S. market share dollar erosion, especially in the superpremium price segment, which remains highly competitive and currently generates much of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market, and we are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of mind to consumers in all key price segments. For example, the wine consumer's willingness to experiment with new brands and flavors over the last several years has opened a key opportunity for innovation and new product development. And although our recent new product development initiatives have seen mixed results, we remain committed to innovation and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. In addition, we are currently initiating or expanding product releases in the U.S. for new wines such as PopCrush, Tambor Vineyards, Jail Break, Watchdog Rock, and early launch results for these brands are quite positive. We know however that the success of innovation cannot come at the expense of the health of our established brands. As such, we have plans in place to concentrate our efforts on an important subset of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that are mix- and margin-accretive, have scale and growth momentum.
Although our U.S. wine business is not expected to achieve its expected market dollar share goals for the year, as we are falling short of our initial expectation for volumes and depletions, we believe the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned the business going forward. We have negotiated the majority of our exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements, which include improved performance metrics and incremental incentives that are expected to benefit Constellation and enhance wholesaler and retail execution. We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast-growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. And I would be remiss if I did not highlight recent awards and accolades for some of our key wine brands. Market Watch Magazine recently awarded the Best New Wine Product of 2014 honor to Thorny Rose. Constellation Brands received 24 medals across the portfolio at the 2014 Sommeliers Challenge International Wine Competition. Inniskillin Vidal 2012 reached the 99-point score and wine of the year, while Ruffino received 7 medals, including best-in-class distinction and 96 points for the 2011 Ruffino Modus. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi was featured in the Best Buy section of the November issue of Wine Enthusiast Buying Guide, while Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet and Robert Mondavi 2012 Pinot Noir Reserve both received 90-point scores. These awards and accolades are a great reminder of the exceptional quality and strength in our portfolio of wines.
In closing, the strong commercial and operational performance of our beer business is driving significant contributions to our overall sales, profit and cash flow results. We are working diligently on the Nava Brewery expansion in Mexico, and we've begun to execute our new glass-sourcing arrangements while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. We have a great premium wine business, and plans are in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing. And I am especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was one of the best-performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks for the third consecutive year.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results."
258589,279701680,743948,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 08, 2015",2015-01-08,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone.

This result was in",1188,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.23. That's a 12% increase versus Q3 last year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, with depletion growth of 8%. This result was in line with our 8% depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high-single-digit depletion growth target for full year fiscal '15. As expected, we saw a shift of approximately 2 million cases to wholesalers from the second quarter into the third quarter as a result of the previously discussed Corona Extra recall activities. This translated into a benefit of about $37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter. Even after excluding this benefit, beer shipment volume growth came in ahead of depletion growth during Q3, as distributors increased their inventory position during the quarter to be more in line with historical levels and to be better positioned to capture growth opportunities going forward. As a result of this activity, for fiscal '15, we now expect beer segment net sales growth to be in the low-teens range versus our previous estimate of about 10%.
Operating income growth for the beer segment is now expected to approximate 30% for fiscal '15. When factoring in an estimated full year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid- to high-teens range. We still anticipate the full year operating income margin for beer to approximate 32%.
While net sales performance for wine and spirits was somewhat muted during Q3 for the reasons Rob mentioned earlier, EBIT primarily benefited from lower COGS. For fiscal '15, we see net sales for wine and spirits tracking towards the low end of our low- to mid-single-digit range and EBIT at the high end of our low- to mid-single-digit range. Due to the factors just mentioned, we're increasing our fiscal '15 comparable basis EPS outlook to $4.25 to $4.35 a share versus our previous range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed in the release.
Given those highlights, let's look at Q3 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our earnings release, consolidated net sales for Q3 grew 7%. Beer net sales increased 16% primarily due to volume growth. Excluding the impact of the recall activity that I outlined earlier, net sales increased 11%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis were even with the prior year quarter. This primarily reflected higher spirits volume offset by lower wine volume, higher promotional spend and lower bulk wine net sales. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $59 million, primarily due to the higher volume for the beer business and favorable cost of goods sold for wine and spirits.
Our consolidated gross margin increased just over 1 percentage point to 43.5% for the quarter, primarily due to the favorable COGS and reduced bulk wine sales for the wine and spirits business.
SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. The increase was primarily due to higher SG&A for the beer business. Due to factors just mentioned, Q3 consolidated operating income increased $40 million and consolidated operating margin improved 90 basis points.
Equity earnings increased $3 million due to the strong results for our Opus One joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, down 4% versus Q3 last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.25 billion, an increase of $295 million since the end of fiscal '14. During Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875% notes due 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024. Our strong credit and financial profile, combined with the favorable interest rate environment, helped us execute this attractive financing activity. Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% notes during the quarter. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million in fiscal '15.
Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 29% and compares to our 28% rate for Q3 last year. We continue to expect that our full year fiscal '15 comparable basis tax rate will approximate 30%.
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '15, we generated $209 million of free cash flow compared to $543 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow for the first 9 months of the year totaled $750 million versus $629 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for the first 9 months of fiscal '15 totaled $541 million compared to just $86 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $435 million and is primarily related to the brewery capacity expansion. For fiscal '15, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $275 million to $350 million and CapEx to be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. Our CapEx projection includes $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for the beer segment. 
As a reminder, we hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, mark-to-market gains and losses on hedge contracts flow through our GAAP income statement. We exclude these mark-to-market gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a commodity contract is settled, a gain or loss is allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with others in the consumer space. For Q3, there was a $20 million loss from this activity, which was primarily driven by the mark-to-market on diesel fuel contracts.
Before we start taking your questions, I'd like to note we are very pleased with how fiscal '15 has progressed so far and we believe we are well positioned as we head toward the completion of another phenomenal year for Constellation. Our wine and spirits business is on track to generate solid EBIT growth for the year, while our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace, growing well ahead of the total U.S. beer category. We're also pleased to have begun advancing efforts around our beer glass-sourcing strategy with the recent formation of the 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois and the JV's acquisition of the Nava glass plant. In addition, our beer production capacity expansion efforts continue to progress as planned. The glass-sourcing and capacity-expansion initiatives will position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for our beer segment.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

On -- as you saw, we did have good beer margin -- I'm sorry, wine margin performance in the quarter and we expect that to continue for the full year. As you know, we just changed our guidance to be at the low end of sales growth and the high end of EBIT growth, which means that we will see margin expansion this year. On a long-term basis, we still expect the wine segment to maintain margins. I think there were some positive outcomes this year, mostly around cost of goods sold, which are really helping recover margins from the last few years' erosion. But I wouldn't expect big margin expansion in wine -- in the wine segment going forward, but we do expect to at least maintain margins. And I think around EBITDA and free cash flow, we continue to -- as you know, we're spending a ton of money in the beer segment, which we're quite happy to do because the return on capital in that segment is north of 40% so it's a very quick payback. And the EBITDA growth of the total company will be growing well in excess of the capital spending growth, even though capital spending is going up so much. And again, a lot of that is driven by the beer segment, the phenomenal EBITDA growth there. So I think in line with what we've been saying over the last 2 years, as we have pretty good visibility to getting our EBITDA leverage below 4x, I would say that the #1 agenda item for use of free cash flow is returning it to shareholders, and probably at the top of that list would be an initiation of a dividend. We're one of the few people, certainly with our financial profile and in beverage, alcohol and consumers in general -- consumer products in general, that don't have a dividend. And we're quite confident that this really good free cash flow generation will continue. So we'll probably be looking for a dividend in the very near future."

Now as you can see this quarter, from a translation perspective, there's some hurt because the Canadian dollar is devaluing versus the U.S. dollar. So we translate Canadian earnings. That was about a 1% hurt to our sales. On the peso specifically, our peso-exposed costs are, as you said, Mexican labor, okay, which isn't an enormous piece of our total cost of goods sold, but it's a relatively large piece. And also as we spend capital, those capital costs, by and large, get capitalized in pesos, so the depreciation on those will also be exposed to foreign exchange, although that's not necessarily cash because it's depreciation. So net-net, the strong dollar will help us versus our Mexican import costs. That also being said, we do hedge our transaction currencies, so we aren't 100% exposed to those peso costs because we will have some hedges going out.

And in cases where glass can't necessarily be used, boats, beach, stadiums, et cetera, and so that also represents a purchase opportunity that largely does not result in cannibalization for us. So these package additions are definitely driving growth in the overall beer business."

And that certainly does not represent full distribution in any regard. The product still skews, from a demographic point of view, extremely heavily Hispanic, even though this penetration in the Hispanic population isn't even where we would like it to be and where it could potentially be. So there's a huge runway in the Hispanic market, and then the general market is very wide open for Modelo Especial, and driving distribution and PODs are one of our key initiatives on that brand. So -- and it's going extremely successfully. We've introduced this year -- because the brand is expanding into the general market now so well, we've introduced general market television advertising, which we think is going to even further accelerate the growth of this product. So the growth runway on this brand is tremendous, and we don't really see any diminishment in growth rates or increases in penetration. Exactly where it's going to get to, I mean, fully distributed product is usually around, I don't know, 90% ACV. So exactly when we get there, I don't know. But we're going to work to get there, and we have everything going in our favor, so the ability to increase distribution and -- as well as the ability to see velocity per point of distribution increase. So all these things are going to contribute to Modelo Especial continuing to be really the hottest major beer brand in the market of any significance. There's really nothing of that size that's growing like Modelo Especial. And just even anecdotally, as you start -- go around and see what people are drinking, I mean, you're seeing all of a sudden Modelo Especial becoming a popular product in the general market as well as in the Hispanic market."

And actually, depletion growth has been very consistent. The impressive thing is there is sequential improvement because Q3 and Q4 is overlapping higher growth last year. So we're very happy with the top line. The reason for the increasing guidance is more so around the net sales increase, and a lot of that is driven by the distributors bringing inventories back in line with historical levels. Regarding the economy, hey, look, any time the consumer has more money in their pocket, it's better for consumer product companies. Now whether we benefit more than other companies, I'm not sure.

This year, those products are still growing very well, but not at the rate that they were. And not that this affects us particularly, but there's been a lot of pricing being taken in the below $5 commodity segment of the wine business, the popular price. And that's turned into pretty heavy negative territory. So I think that that's driving the overall market down maybe 100 basis points or something to that effect. It's still trending pretty much sort of consistently, plus or minus 100 basis points, with where it's trended sort of historically over the long term.

As we get off our Transition Services Agreement, we start staffing up in the beer segments, we are maintaining the 32% operating profit margin from the beer segment for the year. So this is in line with what we expected. Regarding the glass contracts, they really won't start to impact us until next fiscal year. And even then, the big impact is when we get our own furnaces up and when we get our own production up. So I wouldn't expect glass to have an enormous impact on margins in fiscal '16 either.

And we have a lot of plans in place around innovation, around NPD, around concentrating our spends against higher growth elements of our portfolio, which we think will address that, largely, however, without spending a lot more money. And I say, consistent with what Bob said, also important is that we maintain wine margins. We don't want to see deterioration in that segment of the business either. So we will implement basically plans and programs that will drive the top line, but not necessarily increase spending and therefore hurt margins. So we intend to take a balanced approach in that regard, but we definitely don't like and don't want to lose share. Now you look at our wine and spirits segment, okay? First of all, spirits is performing extremely well, above our expectations. And that's a real positive in the business, and we're looking at that segment of the business for further investment obviously because it's performing so well for us at the current time. And on the wine side, we had a couple of, I'll say, somewhat anomalous things that have impacted us. For instance, Eastern Europe impacted us to some degree this year, even though it's not a very significant piece of our business, it was just so -- that geography was so devastated by everything that happened, we lost some sales in Eastern Europe. We also exited some bulk wine related to the international market, which did affect the top line, but really didn't have any effect on the bottom line because it's just commodity bulk wine business, and it was a business that we frankly just don't even want to continue doing. And that affected the top line a bit. And then in the U.S., we did take some pricing on some of our low-end products that impacted things on the top line, but obviously contributed to our bottom line growth. And then as far as our promotional activity goes, we expect that we'll be holding that flat pretty much this year. We didn't expect that to have much of an impact. It probably had a little bit of an impact. But again, trying to keep a balanced approach to both the top line and the bottom line, I think that it's worked out pretty well. So all that said, we would like to hold market share, if not grow it, but we're going to keep a balanced approach to growing both the top line and the bottom line."

It's up year-over-year. But for this quarter, marketing as a percentage of sales in beer probably came down. That being said, to your point, we are -- NFL is one of our heaviest properties for advertising. So we would expect that to ramp up in the fourth quarter, and we expect marketing as a percentage of sales in beer for the full year to be up. But we feel that, that more than pays for itself, as you can see with the results on the top line. For wine and spirits, we're also increasing marketing. In the third quarter, we increased it, and we expect to increase it again in the fourth quarter, as Rob said, mostly around our already successful Focus Brands, a really slimmed-down version of Focus Brands like Kim Crawford, Mark West, brands like that, that have been very successful and have -- we've seen positive response, and we feel that there's a pretty good payoff for increasing marketing against those brands. So we are continuing to invest in our brands, which is working, right? I mean, certainly, in beer, we're growing well ahead of the category.

Collectively, these accomplishments have driven the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. 
Now let's talk about some of our key achievements for fiscal 2015 and the great initiatives we have underway as we charge ahead to an exciting fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased Casa Noble Tequila, an award-winning, handcrafted super premium tequila, which has been a great addition to our portfolio. This fast-growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure. 
More recently, we hired our new, Chief Growth Officer, Bill Newlands, who is responsible for providing greater focus and coordination and the long-term growth opportunities across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. 
In addition, those accountable for accelerating innovation and new product development initiatives and leveraging strategic insights and customer analytics, while identifying synergies across total beverage alcohol within our national accounts organizations. Bill reports directly to me, and I am happy that he has joined our executive management team. 
One of our major accomplishments for the year was the implementation of a multi-faceted long-term glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with the key industry players which included the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer to own, operate and expand the Nava glass plant. The acquisition by the joint venture of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant located adjacent to our brewery in Mexico and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturing -- manufacturer word, the benefits of which we will begin to fully realize once their Monterey glass plant has been completed. We believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process, while securing future supply of materials in approved and finished products. 
Our commercial side of our business continue to achieve stellar growth in fiscal 2015 outperforming the U.S. beer industry, key competitors and all other imports for the fifth consecutive year with growth achieved by every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. As a result, Constellation Brands beer business was the #1 contributor to growth in the U.S. beer category in fiscal 2015 while delivering market share growth across all channels in 48 out of 50 states. More importantly, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010 and depletion trends accelerating to greater than 8% in fiscal 2015. 
I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2016 in order to maintain this excellent momentum for the business. 
Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona, Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are not only the biggest but have contributed the greatest incremental volume growth. Our flagship, Corona Extra brand, is the best selling imported beer in the United States. This brand sold more than 105 million cases in fiscal 2015 and posted depletion growth of more than 3% for the year. Corona Extra was the only top 5 beer brand in the U.S. to achieve growth last year with volume transfer this brand continuing to maintain their solid momentum. This fiscal 2016, we expect to capitalize on the growth of Corona Extra through increased national TV advertising, sports media, boxing sponsorships and by leveraging our acquisition of Casa Noble. 
According to guest metrics during calendar 2014, Corona Extra continued to be the #1 selling imported beer in the on-premise channel. To further support Corona Extra, we plan to increase our investment to expand activations in on-premise accounts throughout the year. Most importantly, fiscal 2016 will represent the year of the can for Corona Extra. We see great opportunity for growth with cans as this format currently represents 3% of total sales for Corona Extra. 
Last year, we represented another record-setting year for Modelo Especial with depletion growth of more than 16%. The Modelo Especial brand family contributed more dollar growth to the total beverage alcohol category than any other brand family in beer, wine or spirits in fiscal 2015. Modelo Especial has become the #2 imported beer in the U.S. with more than 15% share of the imported beer category, which is nearly double the share for this brand just 5 years ago. Our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 for Modelo Especial include: Increased media and general market advertising; continued execution with Modelo Especial Chelada; on-premise activation, retail sponsorships and promotion and Hispanic marketing and advertising and media investments. 
As you are aware, the best strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our 2 biggest brand.
Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands. So let me provide some examples. 
Corona Light. Corona Light posted record sales in fiscal 2015 hitting the 14.5 million case mark and growing depletions almost 4% versus the prior year. We have had good success expanding the distribution of Corona Light Draft, and we plan to continue building on this success in fiscal 2016 by expanding our national draft footprint with recent launches in 8 additional markets. 
We are also relaunching Corona Light can, supported with redesigned secondary packaging, which will be featured in our new advertising campaign highlighting Corona Light as the light cerveza. Finally, we plan on continuing our partnership with Kenny Chelsea which has been a great asset for this brand. Victoria has become the third best selling beer in Mexico with a 15% market share of that market. In fiscal 2015, U.S. depletions for Victoria increased 60% [ph], driven primarily by the Mexican Hispanic consumer and expanded distribution for this brand into 19 new states. In fiscal 2016, we're excited to introduce Victoria cans into the U.S. market for the first time. Our support strategy for Victoria will focus on continuing to drive distribution and generate awareness for the new can format during key promotional period. 
Overall, I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business this fiscal 2016. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result for our beer business in fiscal 2016, we are targeting high single digit sales growth, which exceeds U.S. beer industry and import trends estimates that is expected to drive operating income growth in the 10% to 12% range. 
From a brewery and operational perspective in fiscal 2015, we achieved our key brewery performance goals related to word, quality and cost. Word of the brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both the budget and timing of completion perspective. The packaging area and high-density warehouses are progressing on schedule as well as utilities and wastewater projects. Fabrication of beer tanks has been completed, and we recently added capacity to our can line in order to reduce our dependence on ABI for can. The new joint venture management team has been establishing the glass plant, and has begun work on the next glass furnace to be built on site at this newly acquired facility. The team has done an amazing job during brewery construction to minimize the impact on commercial business execution in the marketplace. 
As we begin fiscal 2016, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the brewery with the first incremental 10 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become fully operational that's more than a year from now in the summer of calendar 2016. 
Overall, I am extremely pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellent from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs as well as outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico. 
And now, I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2015, we achieved EBIT growth of 6% for our wine and spirits business and increase operating profit margin by 130 basis points. Our spirits portfolio achieved better-than-expected results as well as our Canadian business, which exceeded its financial goals for the year, while growing share across all strategic product categories. Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from positive mix trends and some favorable pricing as we executed price increases in fiscal 2015 for select wine products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. market while also growing distribution at key U.S. retailers. Wine and spirits EBIT growth was primarily driven by positive mix and COGS benefit, including reduced great cost as well as positive impact from ongoing blend optimization initiatives and productivity improvements. In addition, EBIT benefited from distributor performance payment as our exclusive distributor contracts included incentive structure that just based on achievement of specific executional performance metrics for the year. The terms of our overall U.S. depletion performance for fiscal 2015, our distributor sales to retail for consolations total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels remain relatively flat. For this compares to EPS wine and spirits industry depletion growth of approximately 1% across all channels as reported by the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014. As expected, our overall U.S. wine dollar market share eroded slightly in fiscal 2015 driven by the superpremium price segment, which remains highly competitive and currently generates a good deal of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of line for our consumers in all key price segments. 
We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our best growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Mark West, Ruffino, Black Box, Navalo and The Dreaming Tree. The strength of our portfolio begins with quality products and I'm very proud to say that we've achieved over 300 wine competition medals the last year and 52 of our wine design plus point ratings. This includes a 93.4 [indiscernible] for [indiscernible] Winery 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon reserve and the wine enthusiast and a 90-plus rating for our Ruffino reserve and word. And our list of achievements continues. 5 or brands made IRIs top 21 brands in 2014, including by Robert Mondavi, 15 of our brands were winners of the Beverage Information Group 2015 growth trend award, including 2 spirits and 13 wine brands. Many of our other wine brands continue to generate great media attention from a variety of news and lifestyle publications, including The Wall Street Journal Good Wine Magazine and Forbes.com to name a few. 
Earlier, I mentioned that 6 of our wines and spirits brands made Impact Hot Brands List. It's important to note that this list includes well-established brands such as Kim Crawford, which has won 8 years in a row, and Black Box celebrating its 10th consecutive win. This also includes The Dreaming Tree for the second year in a row, which is a testament to the level of success of our innovative efforts -- that our innovative efforts can achieve. 
We experienced excellent sales growth at 8% for our spirits portfolio in fiscal 2015  driven by Paul Masson Brandy and SVEDKA vodka. The recent data received from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014, SVEDKA is the only vodka amongst the top 5 largest volume vodka brands achieved growth for the year. In a category that is evolving as consumer preferences change, SVEDKA continues to win in the marketplace. SVEDKA innovative flavors like Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple are driving current success, and we look forward to seeing the results from our recent launch of our great flavor. 
In addition to success of Paul Masson, Peach Brandy has exceeded our own expectations, and we are currently expanding the product into additional formats and developing other new and exciting flavors for our brandy as we have done with our vodka and our whiskey brands. 
Overall, we gained IRI dollar share of imported vodka and Canadian whiskey categories for fiscal 2015. Our Casa Noble Tequila brand has been fully integrated into our portfolio, and we see significant opportunities to increase awareness and trial of this brand in the coming months. 
As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, you will begin to see crosspromotional activities between Casa Noble and Corona Extra, which will help capture more merchandising and floorspace at retail and in the on-premise channels. From a strategic perspective, in 2016, our goal is to grow profit for the wine and spirits business, while also growing revenue, which is reflected in our fiscal 2016 wine and spirits guidance, to achieve low to single-digit sales growth and EBIT growth for the year. We also expect to maintain the margin improvement we achieved in 2015, and we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality. We will continue to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest potential. These brands include Woodbridge, Kim Crawford and Black Box just to name a few. We remain committed to margin accretive innovation and new product development and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. We have achieved dedicated business process to make sure our innovation is thoughtful and measured and positions us to ultimately win in this area. We believe we have a winner with our new Tom Gore wine brand in the coming year. We believe we plan to improve sales execution and increased points of distribution by delivering more effective feature and display activity at retail and added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors. 
Speaking of our distributors, our renegotiated exclusive as distributor arrangement are in place and will provide increase resources, improved performance metrics [indiscernible] wholesaler and reseller execution. For the second consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases to selected products in the value luxury segments of the U.S. wine market. 
And finally, we plan to optimize our COGS through continued global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower-grade cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to our work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for wine and spirits business. 
In closing, in fiscal 2015, we delivered industry-leading market results for our beer business while exceeding our goals across the board of volumes, depletions, sales and net income. Our wine and spirits business delivered improved margins and earnings growth with the Canadian business and our spirits portfolio achieving better-than-expected results. Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in fiscal 2016 in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. Calendar 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of our business, which has become Constellation Brands. We are excited to build on this success to achieve in fiscal 2015 as we head into the new year with high expectations to create the next wave of growth for our company. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for our financial discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end results."
258589,288278399,788481,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2015",2015-04-09,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year, where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth. Expanded our operating margins in both segments",1930,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year, where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth. Expanded our operating margins in both segments are consolidated comparable basis over the margin increase of more than 200 basis points, and established some all-time highs with consolidated EBIT reaching 1.6 [indiscernible] up nearly 30%, comparable basis diluted EPS, up more than 35%, $4.44, and operating cash flow up [ph] more than 30% crossing the $1 billion mark. We also reduced our overall average interest rate by securing attractive long-term financing, and we advanced our long-term strategy related to beer glass sourcing and made significant progress on our brewery expansion activities. We anticipate fiscal '16 to be another productive year as we expect to generate healthy net sales, EBITDA and EPS growth, while continuing to invest in our world class brewery as part of our efforts to become fully independent from a beer production standpoint. 
In addition, given the financial strength of each of our business segments and the resulting capital allocation flexibility, we're very pleased to be returning cash to shareholders through the initiation of a quarterly dividend. 
Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal '15 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales for the year were up 24%, which included $941 million of incremental net sales due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Organic net sales on a constant-currency basis grew 5%. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Beer shipment volume growth of 10% came in ahead of depletion growth as distributors increased their inventory position during the second half of the year in an effort to be more aligned with historical levels and to be better positioned to meet consumer demand heading into the key summer selling season. Pricing benefits helps beer net sales growth reach 12%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1%. This reflects positive mix combined with a distributor make-whole payment associated with a planned distributor destocking during the first quarter and distributor performance payments recognized during the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower volume for nonbranded net sales and higher promotional spend. For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $630 million. The increase primarily reflects $443 million of incremental benefit from the consolidating beer business for an additional 14 weeks in fiscal '15 as a result of the beer business acquisition as well as volume growth and favorable pricing for the base beer business and favorable mix and COGS for wine and spirits. Our consolidated gross margin increased 260 basis points to 43.8% for the year primarily due to the benefits of consolidating the higher-margin beer business and beer pricing. Favorable mix and COGS for the wine and spirits business as well as the distributor performance and destocking payments also contributed to the consolidated gross margin improvement. 
I would like to note that we have [indiscernible] gross profit and gross margin data in our segment disclosure in our press release and in our segment history file posted on our website. 
SG&A for the year increased $216 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $134 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the base beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $415 million and consolidated operating margin improved 230 basis points. Equity earnings decreased $56 million primarily due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Interest expense for the year was $338 million, up 4% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher-average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates. 
That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, an increase of $281 million since the end of fiscal 2014. As a reminder, during Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875 notes due 2019 and $400 million of 4 3/4 notes due 2024. Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% senior notes. The remaining proceeds helped to fund the acquisition of the glass plant and related infrastructure. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.5% and compares with 31.2% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the benefit of foreign tax credits during the fourth quarter. 
Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.03, up 27%. The tax benefit I just mentioned was a big driver of our EPS growth as our Q4 tax rate came in at 23.2% versus the 34.8% rate in Q4 last year. Beer business results for the quarter finished strong. Depletions for the quarter were up 9 [indiscernible] volume and net sales were both up 11%. While we continue to see a pricing benefit during the quarter, it was essentially offset by certain adjustments to net sales related to the beer recall and other items recorded during the fourth quarter. Operating income was up 9%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis were up 2% for the quarter. This reflects the benefit of favorable mix and distributor performance payments, partially offset by lower volume. Wine and spirits operating income decreased 2% as higher marketing and SG&A costs unfavorably impacted quarterly results. 
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spend. In fiscal '15, we generated $362 million of free cash flow compared to $603 million last year. Operating cash flow for fiscal '15 totaled $1.1 billion versus $826 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the net benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '15 totaled $719 million compared to $224 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled about $600 million and is primarily related to the brewery expansion. For fiscal '16, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. The free cash flow projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and capital spending of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Our CapEx projection includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for the beer segment. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we're targeting a 15% increase in operating cash for fiscal '16. This benefit is being more than offset by the increase in our CapEx spending related to the brewery and glass plants expansions. This activity is timing-related as these projects are progressing as planned from an overall cost and timing of completion perspective. As you'll see in our press release, we've provided an updated table summarizing the spending incurred and estimated future spending for these beer business projects. 
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. Forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.90 our share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting mid-mid-single-digit volume growth, high single digit net sales growth and 10% to 12% operating income growth. Given the fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions, as distributors brought inventories at more historical levels, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth to be above shipment growth and to be in the high single digit range. A result that would continue to far outpace the import category in the total beer industry. Our guidance implies operating margin expansion for our beer business as we're projecting operating margins to be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A infrastructure at a higher rate than our level of net sales growth. 
For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single digit range, and we expect to generate positive mix, again take some pricing and generate additional COGS benefits. Interest expense is expected to be in the $325 million to $335 million range. Tax rate is expected to approximate 30.5%. Our guidance also factors in the initiation of a quarterly dividend. As Rob noted, this represents a significant milestone in our history, returning cash to shareholders demonstrates the confidence we have in the overall growth prospects and the strong free cash flow generation capabilities for both our beer and wine and spirits businesses. We're initially targeting a dividend payout ratio of 25% to 30% of our comparable basis net income. For fiscal 2016, we're anticipating approximately $240 million in dividend payments. We ended fiscal '15 with the net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.1x. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend and the initiation of a dividend, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth has us positioned to meet our targeted 3 to 4x leverage range during fiscal '16. Operating within our targeted leverage range, combined with our strong free cash flow generation, provide us significant financial flexibility. Going forward, as our beer CapEx spend normalizes, this provides us the ability to evaluate opportunities to increase our dividend and resume our share buyback program. 
In closing, I'd say that as we exit an eventful and successful 2015, the future looks equally bright. We're a leader in growing profitable consumer category and are critically important to our distributors and our retailers. At a consolidated level, a strong U.S. dollar and an improving U.S. economy are positive to Constellation, and we have minimal exposure to emerging markets. In wine and spirits, we continue to expect mid-single-digit sales growth for the industry. In fiscal '15, we increased our operating profit margin 130 basis points and finished the year with a margin of nearly 24%. We expect to maintain that margin in fiscal 2016. We have some work to do in order to reinvigorate our top line, but we have put in a lot of efforts against this area as reflected in our guidance. Longer term, we anticipate continued strong category growth, and we expect to at least maintain market share. In the beer segment, we continue to deliver industry-leading sales growth, and we continue to make progress towards our mid-30% operating profit margin goal. We're on schedule with our aggressive brewery and glass plant build outs, which requires us to reinvest most of our consolidated operating cash flow in 2015 [ph]. Our beer business generates very strong margins and very high operating returns on invested capital, so the payback on this investment should be quite fast. In beer, we feel our strong brand equity, marketplace and distributor network momentum, opportunities to increase portfolio distribution and grow sales in the can and draft format and favorable consumer demographics provide us with a very positive growth outlook. In addition to these positive business factors, we believe our strong cash-generation capabilities and our ability to quickly delever should provide us ample future opportunity to increase returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So on the first question -- it was a little bit garbled, but I think you're asking about Q4 pricing and Q4 beer margins. And essentially, what happened, it was really just a timing thing because of the big piece was because of the Corona recall and we got fully reimbursed for that activity that just caused some anomalies as to how we account for that and the difference between what happens in sales and what happens in volume. And then there was another reclass that happened in the fourth quarter. What I would do is I would just look at the full year number to be more reflective of the real price volume [indiscernible]. For the second question, on the dividend. We're just starting out. I think we're very happy for the first time in the company's history to be instituting a dividend. And I think we wanted to start out probably on the lower level of where our peers are. And part of that is the fact that we're still right around the 4x EBITDA leverage ratio. We expect that to come down very fast. But we thought we'd start out a little slow. I'd say that we are focused on 25% to 30% payout ratio, and we feel the combination of pretty strong medium to longer-term EPS growth would allow us to grow the dividend in line with EPS, and in future years, we may actually assess whether where we want to be in that 25% to 30% payout lower at the lower end but certainly, we have room to go to the higher end of that range.

First, they start to depreciate, these are brand-new lines, so the depreciation expense is not insignificant. Secondly, as you bring them on and you're testing them, right off the bat, this lasts for quite a while. You're not getting very good yields, nor you're getting very good asset utilization. So that kind of increases your expenses, right. So it takes a while and these big lines are coming on to get them operating at full optimization. And so as we look at beer margins in '16, it was actually, there's some big movers, right? I mean we expect to save a reasonable amount of money because of glass, okay, because we'll be sourcing more glass from our joint venture location, which has no freight and has the lowest cost of produced glass of all our suppliers. That's a positive. Another big positive is foreign exchange. Offsetting that is an increase in depreciation, not insignificant, and some increased labor cost. You have these start-up expenses, and you're bringing on labor ahead of the time that you're actually getting a lot of usable products from those new production lines. So they're kind of the big offsetting things. That said, we have spent finished this year's operating profit margin pretty much exactly where we said we would, right around [indiscernible], and we're anticipating 100 basis point improvement even though we've got a lot of these new be big production lines coming on stream. So we're pretty happy with that guidance."

In terms of where we're going to see the growth, it's pretty much the same story as historically has been the case, which there's, I think, pretty strong, continues to be very strong premiumization trend, all the growth and more in actuality is occurring and the premium plus category. And probably the thing that's changing is that it continues to move, I would say, upstream. It sort of started with sort of the bottom of the premium segment, $5 above. It moved up into what we call this super premium segment, which is sort that $8 to $10, meaning the growth, that's been very strong. Now we're seeing the very strong growth in segments above that. So ultra-premium and luxury really, I would say, a lot -- you're going to see very strong growth in sort of that almost $13 to $20 range. You're probably going to see double-digit growth. In terms of parietals, I think that you'll see decent lower levels of growth in the most word Cabernet Sauvignon, I think pinot noir is going to continue to be a very stable and hot category in wine. I think in white wine, you're going to continue to see very strong growth in pinot grigio and of course, New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs, I think they're going to continue to be a very hot category. And then I think another phenomena -- or I won't quite call it a phenomena, but a bit of a change in trend is sparkling wines. I think that sparkling wines had become very hot once again or I should say, once again, but again, they haven't been that hot over the last, I don't know, 5, 6, 7, 10 years. And you're seeing some of the more affordable categories in sparkling wines like Prosecco, and some of the domestic California sparklers become hot, and I'd say, more everyday. I mean, people are turning to sparkling wine as an everyday product. So what you don't see as particularly hot is champagne, i.e., French champagne. But I think it's priced itself out of the market largely. And the consumer has turned to I'd say, more reasonably priced and easier drink alternative than champagne. So sweet reds will continue to be, I think, a trend in the marketplace. So sort of big, robust slightly, when we talk about sweet reds, slightly sweeter generic red wines. That's been a pretty significant trend, and we don't see that diminishing in the near future. At the low end, where has been kind of up and down a little bit. So probably going to continue favorably, but not as robust as it was a couple of years ago. So those are the trends, Tim."

So Victoria is one of the -- typical -- is one of the smaller brands in our portfolio. I actually think that it's a real sleeper. It's a brand that has a lot of opportunity for the future, much like we saw Modelo Especial explode that brand. Pacifico, primarily West Coast, primarily Southern California, is it's really big base of business. We're focusing our marketing around things like the World Surfing Championships. We've got advertising campaigns in place around basically discovered by surfers in Mexico, Baja. So -- and we've got a draft program for Pacifico, which has been, I would say, very well received. So a smaller brand in the portfolio, but something with a lot of potential. Victoria, again, a small brand, but the interesting thing about Victoria is it's the third largest brand in Mexico with a 50% [ph] market share, and it's very well-known by the Hispanics -- Mexican Hispanic consumer, which really gives us a huge leg up versus any other new product that could be introduced in Mexico -- from Mexico to the U.S. A lot of these products that -- or 1 or 2  that have been recently introduced are fundamentally made up products that Hispanic consumers never heard of. I mean, that's a tough sell in that demographic. With Victoria, we've also introduced cans.
We're expanding the distribution nationally, and we're seeing some pretty strong growth, as I've commented on initially of 60% growth on that brand in last year, and we see that momentum remaining strong into this year. I mentioned just, in general, cans. Cans is a huge opportunity for us. Across all of our brands, Corona, Modelo Especial, brands, we're really stepping up can introduction, and it's an interesting trend in the beer business, in general, is that cans have gone from being perceived as sub-premium to being perceived as very premium form of packaging. And that's probably driven by the fact that draft portion of the business, which is the other very fast-growing portion of the business other than our portfolio, okay, has really adopted at a very high end can as their primary packaging, and the consumers really accepted that. So that sure kind of opened the window that can is a great form of package for our business. And then you look at our business for can, we have not been cans at all, cans represent approximately 3% of our total business. But if you look at the industry as a whole, is like half of the beer business is in cans. So the growth potential for cans is just absolutely phenomenal in our business, and in our own particular case, as we've introduced cans, we've really seen it expand consumption as opposed to just simply cannibalize other forms of packaging because we haven't had packaging that, I'll say, is appropriate for the kind of venues where cans are particularly strong in the past. So this has been a big, big advantage for us."

We won't be as slow as that. And then as far as when these production lines come up, these are big complicated things.

So -- and we think that, that's been a very effective spend, and the beer marketing guys actually do a very good job of tracking volume with and the effectiveness of the various marketing expenditures.

So I'd say, oil prices is a net positive for us, but when you guys get into the numbers, you'll see that we still had around a $30 million loss on I'll say, unrealized commodity hedges. Most of those was around diesel hedges. Those losses will flow through the P&L over the next 2 years. A reasonable amount will flow through the P&L in fiscal '16, that will have been included in our guidance.

We're being prudent in how we introduce draft for our biggest brand, Corona Extra to see how it impacts the brand where it's traditionally been only a glass on-premise. So we're interested to see exactly what happens in those accounts where we put draft in. I think that sort of the results of our testing, thus far, has been -- the way we put draft in even in high market share on-premise establishments that tends to be market expanding as opposed to purely cannibalistic. So we think that, that's a very positive trend. Of course, everything that we do, we do it keeping in mind that we're not going to cannibalize lower -- higher margin versus lower-margin business can. Draft is essentially the same kind of margin structure as our other package format, in general, so we're not overly concerned with it. But on the other hand, we certainly would -- we like the fact that it appears to be significantly market expanding when we put it. We actually tend to see increased sales of glass in a surrounding area when we put draft, Corona Extra draft into an establishment. And that's sort of been, I think, the traditional thinking on draft, is that it not only has just a benefit from a pure word point of view, the format consumer product, but it also has a marketing or advertising component that helps to sell your other packages off premise, and we are definitely seeing that."

Before I begin the review of our accomplishments for the year and our plans for fiscal 2016, we'd like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today, reporting that our Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly common stock cash dividend for the first time in the history of our company. This milestone is of particular significance because it reflects the confidence that we and our Board of Directors have in our ability to execute against growth opportunities, invest in our businesses and generate free cash flow that can be returned to you, our shareholders.
It is the collective the strength of our businesses that has enabled this action and demonstrated by the impressive results achieved by the company in fiscal 2015. Since the acquisition of our beer business almost 2 years ago, we have had no shortage of milestones. We emerged as the #1 multi-category player in alcoholic beverages, and we are committing significant investment to our world-class brewery in Mexico. And our marquee beer brands continue to achieve outstanding growth and garner accolades for their quality. For example, 6 of our wine and spirits brands and 3 of our beer brands won Impact's Hot Brands award for 2014, as announced in early March. Collectively, these accomplishments have driven the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. 
So now let's talk about some of our key achievements for fiscal 2015 and the great initiatives we have underway as we charge ahead to an exciting fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased Casa Noble Tequila, an award-winning handcrafted super premium tequila, which has been a great addition to our portfolio. This fast-growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure.
More recently, we hired our new Chief Growth Officer, Bill Newlands, who is responsible for providing greater focus and coordination on the long-term growth opportunities across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. In addition, Bill is accountable for accelerating innovation and new product development initiatives and leveraging strategic insights and customer analytics while identifying synergies across total beverage alcohol within our national accounts organizations. Bill reports directly to me, and I am happy that he has joined our executive management team.
One of our major accomplishments for the year was the implementation of a multifaceted long-term glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with the key industry players, which included the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer, to own, operate and expand the Nava glass plant; the acquisition by the joint venture of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant located adjacent to our brewery in Mexico; and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturing -- manufacturer, Vitro, the benefits of which we will begin to fully realize once their Monterey glass plant has been completed. We believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process while securing future supply of materials and improved margins on finished products.
Now the commercial side of our business continued to achieve stellar growth in fiscal 2015, outperforming the U.S. beer industry, key competitors and all other imports for the fifth consecutive year, with growth achieved by every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. As a result, Constellation Brands' beer business was the #1 contributor to growth in the U.S. beer category in fiscal 2015 while delivering market share growth across all channels in 48 out of 50 states. More importantly, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010, and depletion trends accelerating to greater than 8% in fiscal 2015.
I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2016 in order to maintain this excellent momentum for the business.
Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio: Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are not only the biggest but have contributed the greatest incremental volume growth. Our flagship, Corona Extra brand, is the best-selling imported beer in the United States. This brand sold more than 105 million cases in fiscal 2015 and posted depletion growth of more than 3% for the year. Corona Extra was the only top 5 beer brand in the U.S. to achieve growth last year, with volume trends for this brand continuing to maintain their solid momentum. This fiscal 2016, we expect to capitalize on the growth of Corona Extra through increased national TV advertising, sports media, boxing sponsorships and by leveraging our acquisition of Casa Noble. 
According to GuestMetrics, during calendar 2014, Corona Extra continued to be the #1 selling imported beer in the on-premise channel. To further support Corona Extra, we plan to increase our investment to expand the activations in on-premise accounts throughout the year. Most importantly, fiscal 2016 will represent the year of the can for Corona Extra. We see great opportunity for growth with cans as this format currently represents less than 3% of total sales for Corona Extra.
Last year, we represented another record-setting year for Modelo Especial with depletion growth of more than 16%. The Modelo Especial brand family contributed more dollar growth to the total beverage alcohol category than any other brand family in beer, wine or spirits in fiscal 2015. Modelo Especial has become the #2 imported beer in the U.S. with more than 15% share of the imported beer category, which is nearly double the share for this brand just 5 years ago. Our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 for Modelo Especial include increased media and general market advertising, continued execution with Modelo Especial Chelada, on-premise activation, retail sponsorships and promotion and Hispanic marketing and advertising and media investments. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our 2 biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands. So let me provide some examples. 
Corona Light. Corona Light posted record sales in fiscal 2015, hitting the 14.5 million case mark and growing depletions almost 4% versus the prior year. We have had good success expanding the distribution of Corona Light draft, and we plan to continue building on this success in fiscal 2016 by expanding our national draft footprint with recent launches in 8 additional markets. We are also relaunching Corona Light cans, supported with redesigned secondary packaging, which will be featured in our new advertising campaign highlighting Corona Light as the light cerveza. Finally, we plan on continuing our partnership with Kenny Chesney, which has had -- which has been a great asset for this brand.
Victoria has become the third best-selling beer in Mexico with a 15% market share of that market. In fiscal 2015, U.S. depletions for Victoria increased 60% driven primarily by the Mexican Hispanic consumer and expanded distribution for this brand into 19 new states. In fiscal 2016, we're excited to introduce Victoria cans into the U.S. market for the first time. Our support strategy for Victoria will focus on continuing to drive distribution and generate awareness for the new can format during key promotional periods.
Overall, I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2016. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, for our beer business, in fiscal 2016, we are targeting high single-digit sales growth, which exceeds the U.S. beer industry and import trend estimates that is expected to drive operating income growth in the 10% to 12% range.
From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2015, we achieved our key brewery performance goals related to position, quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a budget and a timing of completion perspective. Packaging area and high-density warehouses are progressing on schedule as well as utilities and wastewater projects. Fabrication of beer tanks has been completed, and we recently added capacity to our can line in order to reduce our dependence on ABI for can. The new joint venture management team has been established at the glass plant and has begun work on the next glass furnace to be built on site at this newly acquired facility. The team has done an amazing job during brewery construction to minimize the impact on commercial business execution in the marketplace. As we begin fiscal 2016, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the brewery, with the first incremental 10 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become fully operational thus more than a year from now in the summer of calendar 2016.
Overall, I am extremely pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellent support from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs as well as outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico. 
Now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2015, we achieved EBIT growth of 6% for our wine and spirits business and increased operating profit margin by 130 basis points. Our spirits portfolio achieved better-than-expected results as well as our Canadian business, which exceeded its financial goals for the year while growing share across all strategic product categories. Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from positive mix trends and some favorable pricing as we executed price increases in fiscal 2015 for select wine products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. market while also growing distribution at key U.S. retailers. Wine and spirits' EBIT growth was primarily driven by positive mix and COGS benefits, including reduced grade costs as well as positive impacts from ongoing blend optimization initiatives and productivity improvements. 
In addition, EBIT benefited from distributor performance payments at our exclusive distributor contracts included in an incentive structure that adjust based on achievement of specific executional performance metrics for the year. 
In terms of our overall U.S. depletion performance for fiscal 2015, our distributor sales to retail for Constellations for the U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels remain relatively flat. This compares to U.S. wine and spirits' and industry depletion growth of approximately 1% across all channels as reported by the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014.
As expected, our overall U.S. wine dollar market share eroded slightly in fiscal 2015, driven by the superpremium price segment, which remains highly competitive and currently generates a good deal of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of line for our consumers in all key price segments.
We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our best-growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Mark West, Ruffino, Simi, Black Box, Nobilo and The Dreaming Tree. The strength of our portfolio begins with quality products, and I am very proud to say that we have achieved over 300 wine competition medals the last year and 52 of our wines with 90-plus point ratings. This includes a 93.4 for Robert Mondavi Winery 2011 To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon reserve in the Wine Enthusiast and a 90-plus rating for our Ruffino reserve at the Cala del Oro [ph]. 
And our list of achievements continues. 5 or brands made to IRI's top 20 wine brands in 2014, including Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. 15 of our brands were winners of the Beverage Information Group 2015 Growth Brand award, including 2 spirits and 13 wine brands. Many of our other wine brands continue to generate great media attention from a variety of news and lifestyle publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Food & Wine Magazine and Forbes.com, to name a few.
Earlier, I mentioned that 6 of our wine and spirits brands made to Impact's Hot Brands list. It's important to note that this list includes well-established brands, such as Kim Crawford, which has won 8 years in a row; and Black Box, which is celebrating its 10th consecutive win. This also includes The Dreaming Tree for the second year in a row, which is a testament to the level of success of our innovative efforts -- that our innovative efforts can achieve.
We experienced excellent sales growth at 8% for our spirits portfolio in fiscal 2015, driven by Paul Masson Brandy and SVEDKA Vodka. The recent data received from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014, SVEDKA is the only vodka amongst the top 5 largest volume vodka brands that achieved growth for the year. In a category that is evolving as consumer preferences change, SVEDKA continues to win in the marketplace. SVEDKA's innovative flavors like Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple are driving current success, and we look forward to seeing the results from our recent launch of our Grapefruit Jalapeno flavor.
In addition to the success of Paul Masson, Peach brandy has exceeded our own expectations, and we are currently expanding the product into additional formats and developing other new and exciting flavors for our brandy as we have done with our vodka and our whiskey brands.
Overall, we gained IRI dollar share of imported vodka and Canadian whiskey categories for fiscal 2015. Our Casa Noble Tequila brand has been fully integrated into our portfolio, and we see significant opportunities to increase awareness in trial of this brand in the coming months.
As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, you will begin to see cross-promotional activities between Casa Noble and Corona Extra, which will help capture more merchandising and floorspace at retail and in the on-premise channels. From a strategic perspective, in 2016, our goal is to grow profit for the wine and spirits business while also growing revenue, which is reflected in our fiscal 2016 wine and spirits guidance, to achieve low to mid-single-digit sales growth and EBIT growth for the year. We also expect to maintain the margin improvement we achieved in 2015, and we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality. We will continue to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest potential. These brands include Woodbridge, Kim Crawford and Black Box, just to name a few. We remain committed to margin-accretive innovation and new product development to have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. We have a team dedicated to this process to make sure our innovation is thoughtful and measured and positions us to ultimately win in this area. We believe we have a winner with our new Tom Gore wine brand in the coming year. We believe -- we plan to improve sales execution and increased points of distribution by delivering more effective feature and display activity at retail, added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors.
Speaking of our distributors, our renegotiated exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements are in place, and we'll provide increase resources, improved performance metrics while enhancing wholesaler and reseller execution. For the second consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases to selected products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. wine market.
And finally, we plan to optimize our COGS through continued global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grade cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to our work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business.
In closing, in fiscal 2015, we delivered industry-leading market results for our beer business while exceeding our goals across the board for volumes, depletions, sales and net income. Our wine and spirits business delivered improved margins and earnings growth, with the Canadian business and our spirits portfolio achieving better-than-expected results.
Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in fiscal 2016 in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. Calendar 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of our business, which has become Constellation Brands. We are excited to build on this success achieved in fiscal 2015 as we head into the new year with high expectations to create the next wave of growth for our company.
With that, I would like -- now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end results."
258589,288278399,788534,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2015",2015-04-09,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone.Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year, where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth, expanded our operating margins in both segment",1930,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone.
Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year, where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth, expanded our operating margins in both segments for consolidated comparable basis operating margin increase of more than 200 basis points and established some all-time highs, with consolidated EBIT reaching $1.6 billion up nearly 30%; comparable basis diluted EPS up more than 35% to $4.44; and operating cash flow up more than 30%, crossing the $1 billion mark.
We also reduced our overall average interest rate by securing attractive long-term financing, and we advanced our long-term strategy related to beer glass sourcing and made significant progress on our brewery expansion activities. We anticipate fiscal '16 to be another productive year as we expect to generate healthy net sales, EBIT and EPS growth while continuing to invest in our world-class brewery as part of our efforts to become fully independent from a beer production standpoint.
In addition, given the financial strength of each of our business segments and the resulting capital allocation flexibility, we're very pleased to be returning cash to shareholders through the initiation of a quarterly dividend.
Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal '15 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales for the year were up 24%, which included $941 million of incremental net sales due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Consolidated organic net sales on a constant-currency basis grew 5%. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Beer shipment volume growth of 10% came in ahead of depletion growth as distributors increased their inventory position during the second half of the year in an effort to be more aligned with historical levels and to be better positioned to meet consumer demand heading into the key summer selling season.
Pricing benefits helped beer net sales growth reach 12%. Wine and spirits net sales, on a constant-currency basis, increased 1%. This reflects positive mix combined with a distributor make-whole payment associated with a planned distributor destocking during the first quarter and distributor performance payments recognized during the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower volume, lower nonbranded net sales and higher promotional spend.
For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $630 million. The increase primarily reflects $443 million of incremental benefit from consolidating the beer business for an additional 14 weeks in fiscal '15 as a result of the beer business acquisition, as well as volume growth and favorable pricing for the base beer business, and favorable mix and COGS for wine and spirits. Our consolidated gross margin increased 260 basis points to 43.8% for the year primarily due to the benefits of consolidating the higher-margin beer business and beer pricing. Favorable mix and COGS for the wine and spirits business, as well as the distributor performance and destocking payments, also contributed to the consolidated gross margin improvement.
I would like to note that we have included gross profit and gross margin data in our segment disclosure in our press release and in our segment history file posted on our website. 
SG&A for the year increased $216 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $134 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the base beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $415 million, and consolidated operating margin improved 230 basis points. Equity earnings decreased $56 million primarily due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Interest expense for the year was $338 million, up 4% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates.
That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, an increase of $281 million since the end of fiscal 2014. As a reminder, during Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes, consisting of $400 million of 3.875% notes due in 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024.
Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% senior notes. The remaining proceeds helped fund the acquisition of the glass plant and related infrastructure. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.5% and compares with 31.2% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the benefit of foreign tax credits during the fourth quarter.
Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.03, up 27%. The tax benefit I just mentioned was a big driver of our EPS growth as our Q4 tax rate came in at 23.2% versus a 34.8% rate in Q4 last year. Beer business results for the quarter finished strong. Depletions for the quarter were up 9 [indiscernible]. Volume and net sales were both up 11%. While we continue to see a pricing benefit during the quarter, it was essentially offset by certain adjustments to net sales related to the beer recall and other items recorded during the fourth quarter. Operating income was up 9%. Wine and spirits net sales, on a constant-currency basis, were up 2% for the quarter. This reflects the benefit of favorable mix and distributor performance payments partially offset by lower volume. Wine and spirits operating income decreased 2% as higher marketing and SG&A costs unfavorably impacted quarterly results.
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spend. In fiscal '15, we generated $362 million of free cash flow compared to $603 million last year. Operating cash flow for fiscal '15 totaled $1.1 billion versus $826 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the net benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '15 totaled $719 million compared to $224 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled about $600 million and is primarily related to the brewery expansion. For fiscal '16, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. The free cash flow projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and capital spending of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Our CapEx projection includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for the beer segment.
Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we're targeting a 15% increase in operating cash for fiscal '16. This benefit is being more than offset by the increase in our CapEx spending related to the brewery and glass plant expansions. This activity is timing-related as these projects are progressing as planned from an overall cost and timing of completion perspective. As you'll see in our press release, we've provided an updated table summarizing the spending incurred and estimated future spending for these beer business projects.
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. We're forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.90 our share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting mid-single-digit volume growth, high single-digit net sales growth and 10% to 12% operating income growth. Given the fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories at more historical levels, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth to be above shipment growth and to be in the high single-digit range, a result that would continue to far outpace the import category and the total beer industry. Our guidance implies operating margin expansion for our beer business as we are projecting operating margins to be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A infrastructure at a higher rate than our level of net sales growth.
For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single-digit range, and we expect to generate positive mix, again take some pricing and generate additional COGS benefits. Interest expense is expected to be in the $325 million to $335 million range. Tax rate is expected to approximate 30.5%. Our guidance also factors in the initiation of a quarterly dividend. As Rob noted, this represents a significant milestone in our history. Returning cash to shareholders demonstrates the confidence we have in the overall growth prospects and the strong free cash flow generation capabilities for both our beer and wine and spirits businesses. 
We're initially targeting a dividend payout ratio of 25% to 30% of our comparable basis net income. And for fiscal 2016, we're anticipating approximately $240 million in dividend payments. We ended fiscal '15 with a net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.1x. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend and the initiation of a dividend, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth has us positioned to meet our targeted 3x to 4x leverage range during fiscal '16.
Operating within our targeted leverage range, combined with our strong free cash flow generation capability, provides us significant financial flexibility. Going forward, as our beer CapEx spend normalizes, this provides us the ability to evaluate opportunities to increase our dividend and resume our share buyback program.
In closing, I'd say that as we exit an eventful and successful 2015, the future looks equally bright. We are a leader in growing and profitable consumer category and are critically important to our distributors and our retailers. At a consolidated level, a strong U.S. dollar and an improving U.S. economy are positives to Constellation, and we have minimal exposure to emerging markets.
In wine and spirits, we continue to expect mid-single-digit sales growth for the industry. In fiscal '15, we increased our operating profit margin 130 basis points and finished the year with a margin of nearly 24%. We expect to maintain that margin in fiscal 2016. We have some work to do in order to reinvigorate our top line, but we have put in a lot of effort against this area, as reflected in our guidance. Longer term, we anticipate continued strong category growth, and we expect to at least maintain market share.
In the beer segment, we continue to deliver industry-leading sales growth, and we continue to make progress towards our mid-30% operating profit margin goal. We're on schedule with our aggressive brewery and glass plant build-outs, which requires us to reinvest most of our consolidated operating cash flow in 2016. Our beer business generates very strong margins and very high operating returns on invested capital, so the payback on this investment should be quite fast.
In beer, we feel our strong brand equity, marketplace and distributor network momentum, opportunities to increase portfolio distribution and grow sales in the can and draft format, and favorable consumer demographics provide us with a very positive growth outlook. In addition to these positive business factors, we believe our strong cash-generation capabilities and our ability to quickly delever should provide us ample future opportunity to increase returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

When you talk about ticking up the dividend, is this more about growing in line with earnings or openly see a payout ratio kind of getting towards the higher end of your peer group, which is, I think, around 45% or so?

So on the first question -- it was a little bit garbled, but I think you're asking about Q4 pricing and Q4 beer margins. And essentially, what happened, it was really just a timing thing because of -- the big piece was because of the Corona recall, and we got fully reimbursed for that activity. That just caused some anomalies as to how we account for that and the difference between what happens in sales and what happens in volume. And then there was another reclass that happened in the fourth quarter. What I would do is I would just look at the full year number to be more reflective of the real price-volume relationship. For the second question, on the dividend, we're just starting out. I think we're very happy for the first time in the company's history to be instituting a dividend, and I think we wanted to start out probably on the lower level of where peers are. And part of that is the fact that we're still right around the 4x EBITDA leverage ratio, but we expect that to come down very fast. But we thought we'd start out a little slow. I'd say that we are focused on 25% to 30% payout ratio, and we feel the combination of pretty strong medium- to longer-term EPS growth would allow us to grow the dividend in line with EPS. And in future years, we may actually assess whether where we want to be in that 25% to 30% payout. Right now, we're at the lower end, but certainly, we have room to go to the higher end of that range. The third question, which is more around wine volumes, I'll let Rob answer."

You'll have more of the capacity, I guess, beginning to be tested in such. So could you just dimensionalize for us a little bit how much expense there is, how it's affecting the margins and maybe how long we'll have a dynamic where there are some expenses related to the startup that really don't have revenues attached to them?"

As you bring these big lines on, a bunch of things happen. First, they start to depreciate. These are brand-new lines, so the depreciation expense is not insignificant. Secondly, as you bring them on and you're testing them, you -- right off the bat, this lasts for quite a while. You're not getting very good yields, nor are you getting very good asset utilization. So that kind of increases your expenses, right? So it takes a while when these big lines are coming on to get them operating at full optimization. And so as we look at beer margins in '16, it was actually -- there's some big movers, right? I mean, we expect to save a reasonable amount of money because of glass, okay, because we'll be sourcing more glass from our joint venture location, which has no freight and has the lowest cost of produced glass of all our suppliers. That's a positive. Another big positive is foreign exchange, but offsetting that is an increase in depreciation, not insignificant, and some increased labor cost as you have these startup expenses and you're bringing on labor ahead of the time that you're actually getting a lot of usable products from those new production lines. So they're kind of a big offsetting things. That said, we have -- we finished this year's operating profit margin pretty much exactly where we said we would, right around [indiscernible]. And we're anticipating 100-basis-point improvement, even though we've got a lot of these new big production lines coming on stream. So we're pretty happy with that guidance."

We still have about $700 million authorized by the board, as you know, right before the beer deal. In the previous like 12 to 18 months, we've bought back about 20% of our outstanding shares just $120 a share, so that's worked out pretty well for us. I think it'll be a combination of those 2.

Owens-Illinois has already exhibited quite a bit of expertise in operating these glass facilities, and they tend to think very much like us, so there's no disagreements unlike some other joint ventures that we might recall.

In terms of where we're going to see the growth, it's pretty much the same story as historically has been the case, which there's, I think, pretty strong -- continues to be a very strong premiumization trend. All the growth and more in actuality is occurring in the premium plus category. And probably the thing that's changing is that it continues to move, I would say, upstream. It sort of started with sort of the bottom of the premium segment, $5 and above. It moved up into what we call the super premium segment, which is sort of that $8 to $10, meaning the growth, that's been very strong. And now we're seeing the very strong growth in segments above that. So ultra-premium and luxury really, I would say, a lot -- you're going to see very strong growth in sort of that almost $13 to $20 range, you're probably going to see double-digit growth. In terms of varietals, I think that you'll see decent lower levels of growth in the most key varietals, I think that pinot noir is going to continue to be a very stable and hot category in wine. I think in white wine, you're going to continue to see very strong growth in pinot grigio and, of course, New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs, I think they're going to continue to be a very hot category. And then I think another phenomena -- or I won't quite call it a phenomena, but a bit of a change in trend is sparkling wines. I think that sparkling wines had become very hot once again or I shouldn't say, once again, but again, they haven't been that hot over the last, I don't know, 5, 6, 7, 10 years. And you're seeing some of the more affordable categories in sparkling wines like Prosecco, and some of the domestic California sparklers become hot, and I'd say, more everyday. I mean, people are turning to sparkling wine as an everyday product. What you don't see as particularly hot is champagne, i.e., French champagne. But I think that it's priced itself out of the market largely. And the consumer has turned to I'll say, more reasonably priced and easier-to-drink alternative than champagne. So Sweet Red will continue to be, I think, a trend in the marketplace. So sort of big, robust, slightly -- when we talk about Sweet Reds, big, robust, slightly sweeter generic red wines. That's been a pretty significant trend, and we don't see that diminishing in the near future. At the low end, Moscato has been kind of up and down a little bit. So it might probably going to continue favorably, but not as robust as it was a couple of years ago. So those are the trends, Tim."

Victoria, again, a small brand, but the interesting thing about Victoria is it's the third largest brand in Mexico with a 15% market share, and it's very well known by the Hispanics -- Mexican-Hispanic consumer, which really gives it a huge leg up versus any other new product that could be introduced in Mexico -- from Mexico to the U.S. A lot of these products that -- or 1 or 2  that have been recently introduced are fundamentally made-up products that Hispanic consumers never heard of. I mean, that's a tough sell in that demographic. With Victoria, we've also introduced cans.  We're expanding the distribution nationally, and we're seeing some pretty strong growth, as I've commented on initially, of 60% growth on that brand in last year, and we see that momentum remaining strong into this year. I mentioned just, in general, cans. Cans is a huge opportunity for us. Across all of our brands, Corona, Modelo Especial, as well as the other brands, we're really stepping up can introduction, and it's -- an interesting trend in the beer business, in general, is that cans have gone from being perceived as sub-premium to being perceived as very premium form of packaging. And that's probably been driven by the fact that the craft portion of the business, which is the other very fast-growing portion of the business other than our portfolio, okay, has really adopted, at a very high end, cans as the primary packaging, and the consumers really accepted that. So that's really kind of opened the window to make cans a great premium package for our business. And then you look at our business where cans -- we have not been at cans at all, cans represent approximately 3% of our total business. But if you look at the industry as a whole, it's like half of the beer business is in cans. So the growth potential for cans is just absolutely phenomenal in our business. And in our own particular case, as we've introduced cans, we've really seen it expand consumption as opposed to just simply cannibalize other forms of packaging because we haven't had a packaging that, I'll say, is appropriate for the kind of venues where cans are particularly strong in the past. So this has been a big, big advantage for us."

We won't be as slow as that. And then as far as when these production lines come up, these are big complicated things. And as you know, our brewery is highly automated, so there's a lot of software IT stuff going on. And every line, you can't necessarily anticipate the gremlins that will come up.

So -- and we think that's been a very effective spend, and the beer marketing guys actually do a very good job of tracking volume with and the effectiveness of the various marketing expenditures.

So I'd say, oil prices is a net positive for us. But when you guys get into the numbers, you'll see that we still had around a $30 million loss on, I'll say, unrealized commodity hedges, and most of those was around -- were around diesel hedges. Those losses will flow through the P&L over the next 2 years. A reasonable amount will flow through the P&L in fiscal '16, that would have been included in our guidance.

Before I begin the review of our accomplishments for the year and our plans for fiscal 2016, I would like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today, reporting that our Board of Directors h",2812,"Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin the review of our accomplishments for the year and our plans for fiscal 2016, I would like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today, reporting that our Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly common stock cash dividend for the first time in the history of our company. This milestone is of particular significance because it reflects the confidence that we and our Board of Directors have in our ability to execute against growth opportunities, invest in our businesses and generate free cash flow that can be returned to you, our shareholders.
It is the collective the strength of our businesses that has enabled this action and demonstrated by the impressive results achieved by the company in fiscal 2015. Since the acquisition of our beer business almost 2 years ago, we have had no shortage of milestones. We emerged as the #1 multi-category player in alcoholic beverages, and we are committing significant investment to our world-class brewery in Mexico. And our marquee beer brands continue to achieve outstanding growth and garner accolades for their quality. For example, 6 of our wine and spirits brands and 3 of our beer brands won Impact's Hot Brands award for 2014, as announced in early March. Collectively, these accomplishments have driven the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. 
So now let's talk about some of our key achievements for fiscal 2015 and the great initiatives we have underway as we charge ahead to an exciting fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased Casa Noble Tequila, an award-winning handcrafted super premium tequila, which has been a great addition to our portfolio. This fast-growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure.
More recently, we hired our new Chief Growth Officer, Bill Newlands, who is responsible for providing greater focus and coordination on the long-term growth opportunities across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. In addition, Bill is accountable for accelerating innovation and new product development initiatives and leveraging strategic insights and customer analytics while identifying synergies across total beverage alcohol within our national accounts organizations. Bill reports directly to me, and I am happy that he has joined our executive management team.
One of our major accomplishments for the year was the implementation of a multifaceted long-term glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with the key industry players, which included the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer, to own, operate and expand the Nava glass plant; the acquisition by the joint venture of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant located adjacent to our brewery in Mexico and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturing -- manufacturer, Vitro, the benefits of which we will begin to fully realize once their Monterey glass plant has been completed. We believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process while securing future supply of materials and improved margins on finished products.
Now the commercial side of our business continued to achieve stellar growth in fiscal 2015, outperforming the U.S. beer industry, key competitors and all other imports for the fifth consecutive year, with growth achieved by every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. As a result, Constellation Brands' beer business was the #1 contributor to growth in the U.S. beer category in fiscal 2015 while delivering market share growth across all channels in 48 out of 50 states. More importantly, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010, and depletion trends accelerating to greater than 8% in fiscal 2015.
I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2016 in order to maintain this excellent momentum for the business.
Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio: Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are not only the biggest but have contributed the greatest incremental volume growth. Our flagship, Corona Extra brand, is the best-selling imported beer in the United States. This brand sold more than 105 million cases in fiscal 2015 and posted depletion growth of more than 3% for the year. Corona Extra was the only top 5 beer brand in the U.S. to achieve growth last year, with volume trends for this brand continuing to maintain their solid momentum. This fiscal 2016, we expect to capitalize on the growth of Corona Extra through increased national TV advertising, sports media, boxing sponsorships and by leveraging our acquisition of Casa Noble. 
According to GuestMetrics, during calendar 2014, Corona Extra continued to be the #1 selling imported beer in the on-premise channel. To further support Corona Extra, we plan to increase our investment to expand the activations in on-premise accounts throughout the year. Most importantly, fiscal 2016 will represent the year of the can for Corona Extra. We see great opportunity for growth with cans as this format currently represents less than 3% of total sales for Corona Extra.
Last year, we represented another record-setting year for Modelo Especial with depletion growth of more than 16%. The Modelo Especial brand family contributed more dollar growth to the total beverage alcohol category than any other brand family in beer, wine or spirits in fiscal 2015. Modelo Especial has become the #2 imported beer in the U.S. with more than 15% share of the imported beer category, which is nearly double the share for this brand just 5 years ago. Our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 for Modelo Especial include increased media and general market advertising, continued execution with Modelo Especial Chelada, on-premise activation, retail sponsorships and promotion and Hispanic marketing and advertising and media investments. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our 2 biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands. So let me provide some examples. 
Corona Light. Corona Light posted record sales in fiscal 2015, hitting the 14.5 million case mark and growing depletions almost 4% versus the prior year. We have had good success expanding the distribution of Corona Light draft, and we plan to continue building on this success in fiscal 2016 by expanding our national draft footprint with recent launches in 8 additional markets. We are also relaunching Corona Light cans, supported with redesigned secondary packaging, which will be featured in our new advertising campaign highlighting Corona Light as the light cerveza. Finally, we plan on continuing our partnership with Kenny Chesney, which has had -- which has been a great asset for this brand.
Victoria has become the third best-selling beer in Mexico with a 15% market share of that market. In fiscal 2015, U.S. depletions for Victoria increased 60% driven primarily by the Mexican Hispanic consumer and expanded distribution for this brand into 19 new states. In fiscal 2016, we're excited to introduce Victoria cans into the U.S. market for the first time. Our support strategy for Victoria will focus on continuing to drive distribution and generate awareness for the new can format during key promotional periods.
Overall, I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2016. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, for our beer business in fiscal 2016, we are targeting high single-digit sales growth, which exceeds the U.S. beer industry and import trend estimates that is expected to drive operating income growth in the 10% to 12% range.
From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2015, we achieved our key brewery performance goals related to position [ph], quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a budget and a timing of completion perspective. Packaging area and high-density warehouses are progressing on schedule as well as utilities and wastewater projects. Fabrication of beer tanks has been completed, and we recently added capacity to our can line in order to reduce our dependence on ABI per [ph] can. The new joint venture management team has been established at the glass plant and has begun work on the next glass furnace to be built on site at this newly acquired facility. The team has done an amazing job during brewery construction to minimize the impact on commercial business execution in the marketplace. As we begin fiscal 2016, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the brewery, with the first incremental 10 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become fully operational just more than a year from now in the summer of calendar 2016.
Overall, I am extremely pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellent support from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs as well as outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico. 
Now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2015, we achieved EBIT growth of 6% for our wine and spirits business and increased operating profit margin by 130 basis points. Our spirits portfolio achieved better-than-expected results as well as our Canadian business, which exceeded its financial goals for the year while growing share across all strategic product categories. Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from positive mix trends and some favorable pricing as we executed price increases in fiscal 2015 for select wine products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. market while also growing distribution at key U.S. retailers. Wine and spirits' EBIT growth was primarily driven by positive mix and COGS benefits, including reduced grade costs as well as positive impacts from ongoing blend optimization initiatives and productivity improvements. 
In addition, EBIT benefited from distributor performance payments at our exclusive distributor contracts included an incentive structure that adjusts based on achievement of specific executional performance metrics for the year. 
In terms of our overall U.S. depletion performance for fiscal 2015, our distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels remain relatively flat. This compares to U.S. wine and spirits' industry depletion growth of approximately 1% across all channels as reported by the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014.
As expected, our overall U.S. wine dollar market share eroded slightly in fiscal 2015, driven by the superpremium price segment, which remains highly competitive and currently generates a good deal of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of line for our consumers in all key price segments.
We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our best-growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Mark West, Ruffino, Simi, Black Box, Nobilo and The Dreaming Tree. The strength of our portfolio begins with quality products, and I am very proud to say that we have achieved over 300 wine competition medals the last year and 52 of our wines with 90-plus point ratings. This includes a 93.4 for Robert Mondavi Winery 2011 To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon reserve in the Wine Enthusiast and a 90-plus rating for our Ruffino reserve at Ducale Oro. 
And our list of achievements continues. Five of our brands made to IRI's top 20 wine brands in 2014, including Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. 15 of our brands were winners of the Beverage Information Group 2015 Growth Brand award, including 2 spirits and 13 wine brands. Many of our other wine brands continue to generate great media attention from a variety of news and lifestyle publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Food & Wine Magazine and Forbes.com, to name a few.
Earlier, I mentioned that 6 of our wine and spirits brands made to Impact's Hot Brands list. It's important to note that this list includes well-established brands, such as Kim Crawford, which has won 8 years in a row and Black Box, which is celebrating its 10th consecutive win. This also includes The Dreaming Tree for the second year in a row, which is a testament to the level of success of our innovative efforts -- that our innovative efforts can achieve.
We experienced excellent sales growth at 8% for our spirits portfolio in fiscal 2015, driven by Paul Masson Brandy and SVEDKA Vodka. Recent data received from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014, SVEDKA is the only vodka amongst the top 5 largest volume vodka brands that achieved growth for the year. In a category that is evolving as consumer preferences change, SVEDKA continues to win in the marketplace. SVEDKA's innovative flavors like Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple are driving current success, and we look forward to seeing the results from our recent launch of our Grapefruit Jalapeno flavor.
In addition to the success of Paul Masson, Peach brandy has exceeded our own expectations, and we are currently expanding the product into additional formats and developing other new and exciting flavors for our brandy as we have done with our vodka and our whiskey brands.
Overall, we gained IRI dollar share of imported vodka and Canadian whiskey categories for fiscal 2015. Our Casa Noble Tequila brand has been fully integrated into our portfolio, and we see significant opportunities to increase awareness in trial of this brand in the coming months.
As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, you will begin to see cross-promotional activities between Casa Noble and Corona Extra, which will help capture more merchandising and floorspace at retail and in the on-premise channels. From a strategic perspective, in 2016, our goal is to grow profit for the wine and spirits business while also growing revenue, which is reflected in our fiscal 2016 wine and spirits guidance, to achieve low to mid-single-digit sales growth and EBIT growth for the year. We also expect to maintain the margin improvement we achieved in 2015, and we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality. 
We will continue to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest potential. These brands include Woodbridge, Kim Crawford and Black Box, just to name a few. We remain committed to margin-accretive innovation and new product development and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. We have a team dedicated to this process to make sure our innovation is thoughtful and measured and positions us to ultimately win in this area. We believe we have a winner with our new Tom Gore wine brand in the coming year. We believe -- we plan to improve sales execution and increased points of distribution by delivering more effective feature and display activity at retail, with added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors.
Speaking of our distributors, our renegotiated exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements are in place, and we'll provide increase resources, improved performance metrics while enhancing wholesaler and reseller execution. For the second consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases to selected products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. wine market.
And finally, we plan to optimize our COGS through continued global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grade cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to our work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business.
In closing, in fiscal 2015, we delivered industry-leading market results for our beer business while exceeding our goals across the board for volumes, depletions, sales and net income. Our wine and spirits business delivered improved margins and earnings growth, with the Canadian business and our spirits portfolio achieving better-than-expected results.
Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in fiscal 2016 in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. Calendar 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of our business, which has become Constellation Brands. We are excited to build on this success achieved in fiscal 2015 as we head into the New Year with high expectations to create the next wave of growth for our company.
With that, I would like -- now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end results."
258589,288278399,788610,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2015",2015-04-09,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone.Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year, where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth, expanded our operating margins in both segment",1932,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone.
Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year, where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth, expanded our operating margins in both segments for consolidated comparable basis operating margin increase of more than 200 basis points and established some all-time highs, with consolidated EBIT reaching $1.6 billion up nearly 30%; comparable basis diluted EPS up more than 35% to $4.44 and operating cash flow up more than 30%, crossing the $1 billion mark.
We also reduced our overall average interest rate by securing attractive long-term financing, and we advanced our long-term strategy related to beer glass sourcing and made significant progress on our brewery expansion activities. We anticipate fiscal '16 to be another productive year as we expect to generate healthy net sales, EBIT and EPS growth while continuing to invest in our world-class brewery as part of our efforts to become fully independent from a beer production standpoint.
In addition, given the financial strength of each of our business segments and the resulting capital allocation flexibility, we're very pleased to be returning cash to shareholders through the initiation of a quarterly dividend.
Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal '15 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales for the year were up 24%, which included $941 million of incremental net sales due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Consolidated organic net sales on a constant-currency basis grew 5%. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Beer shipment volume growth of 10% came in ahead of depletion growth as distributors increased their inventory position during the second half of the year in an effort to be more aligned with historical levels and to be better positioned to meet consumer demand heading into the key summer selling season.
Pricing benefits helped beer net sales growth reach 12%. Wine and spirits net sales, on a constant-currency basis, increased 1%. This reflects positive mix combined with a distributor make-whole payment associated with a planned distributor destocking during the first quarter and distributor performance payments recognized during the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower volume, lower nonbranded net sales and higher promotional spend.
For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $630 million. The increase primarily reflects $443 million of incremental benefit from consolidating the beer business for an additional 14 weeks in fiscal '15 as a result of the beer business acquisition, as well as volume growth and favorable pricing for the base beer business, and favorable mix and COGS for wine and spirits. Our consolidated gross margin increased 260 basis points to 43.8% for the year primarily due to the benefits of consolidating the higher-margin beer business and beer pricing. Favorable mix and COGS for the wine and spirits business, as well as the distributor performance and destocking payments, also contributed to the consolidated gross margin improvement.
I would like to note that we have included gross profit and gross margin data in our segment disclosure in our press release and in our segment history file posted on our website. 
SG&A for the year increased $216 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $134 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the base beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $415 million, and consolidated operating margin improved 230 basis points. Equity earnings decreased $56 million primarily due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Interest expense for the year was $338 million, up 4% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates.
That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, an increase of $281 million since the end of fiscal 2014. As a reminder, during Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes, consisting of $400 million of 3.875% notes due in 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024.
Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% senior notes. The remaining proceeds helped fund the acquisition of the glass plant and related infrastructure. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.5% and compares with 31.2% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the benefit of foreign tax credits during the fourth quarter.
Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.03, up 27%. The tax benefit I just mentioned was a big driver of our EPS growth as our Q4 tax rate came in at 23.2% versus a 34.8% rate in Q4 last year. Beer business results for the quarter finished strong. Depletions for the quarter were up 9% [ph]. Volume and net sales were both up 11%. While we continue to see a pricing benefit during the quarter, it was essentially offset by certain adjustments to net sales related to the beer recall and other items recorded during the fourth quarter. Operating income was up 9%. Wine and spirits net sales, on a constant-currency basis, were up 2% for the quarter. This reflects the benefit of favorable mix and distributor performance payments partially offset by lower volume. Wine and spirits operating income decreased 2% as higher marketing and SG&A costs unfavorably impacted quarterly results.
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spend. In fiscal '15, we generated $362 million of free cash flow compared to $603 million last year. Operating cash flow for fiscal '15 totaled $1.1 billion versus $826 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the net benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '15 totaled $719 million compared to $224 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled about $600 million and is primarily related to the brewery expansion. For fiscal '16, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. The free cash flow projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and capital spending of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Our CapEx projection includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for the beer segment.
Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we're targeting a 15% increase in operating cash for fiscal '16. This benefit is being more than offset by the increase in our CapEx spending related to the brewery and glass plant expansions. This activity is timing-related as these projects are progressing as planned from an overall cost and timing of completion perspective. As you'll see in our press release, we've provided an updated table summarizing the spending incurred and estimated future spending for these beer business projects.
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. We're forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.90 our share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting mid-single-digit volume growth, high single-digit net sales growth and 10% to 12% operating income growth. Given that fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories at more historical levels, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth to be above shipment growth and to be in the high single-digit range, a result that would continue to far outpace the import category and the total beer industry. Our guidance implies operating margin expansion for our beer business as we are projecting operating margins to be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A infrastructure at a higher rate than our level of net sales growth.
For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single-digit range, and we expect to generate positive mix, again take some pricing and generate additional COGS benefits. Interest expense is expected to be in the $325 million to $335 million range. Tax rate is expected to approximate 30.5%. Our guidance also factors in the initiation of a quarterly dividend. As Rob noted, this represents a significant milestone in our history. Returning cash to shareholders demonstrates the confidence we have in the overall growth prospects and the strong free cash flow generation capabilities for both our beer and wine and spirits businesses. 
We're initially targeting a dividend payout ratio of 25% to 30% of our comparable basis net income. And for fiscal 2016, we're anticipating approximately $240 million in dividend payments. We ended fiscal '15 with a net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.1x. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend and the initiation of a dividend, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth has us positioned to meet our targeted 3x to 4x leverage range during fiscal '16.
Operating within our targeted leverage range, combined with our strong free cash flow generation capability, provides us significant financial flexibility. Going forward, as our beer CapEx spend normalizes, this provides us the ability to evaluate opportunities to increase our dividend and resume our share buyback program.
In closing, I'd say that as we exit an eventful and successful 2015, the future looks equally bright. We are a leader in a growing and profitable consumer category and are critically important to our distributors and our retailers. At a consolidated level, a strong U.S. dollar and an improving U.S. economy are positives to Constellation, and we have minimal exposure to emerging markets.
In wine and spirits, we continue to expect mid-single-digit sales growth for the industry. In fiscal '15, we increased our operating profit margin 130 basis points and finished the year with a margin of nearly 24%. We expect to maintain that margin in fiscal 2016. We have some work to do in order to reinvigorate our top line, but we have put in a lot of effort against this area, as reflected in our guidance. Longer term, we anticipate continued strong category growth, and we expect to at least maintain market share.
In the beer segment, we continue to deliver industry-leading sales growth, and we continue to make progress towards our mid-30% operating profit margin goal. We're on schedule with our aggressive brewery and glass plant build-outs, which requires us to reinvest most of our consolidated operating cash flow in 2016 [ph]. Our beer business generates very strong margins and very high operating returns on invested capital, so the payback on this investment should be quite fast.
In beer, we feel our strong brand equity, marketplace and distributor network momentum, opportunities to increase portfolio distribution and grow sales in the can and draft format, and favorable consumer demographics provide us with a very positive growth outlook. In addition to these positive business factors, we believe our strong cash-generation capabilities and our ability to quickly delever should provide us ample future opportunity to increase returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

For the second question, on the dividend, we're just starting out. I think we're very happy for the first time in the company's history to be instituting a dividend, and I think we wanted to start out probably on the lower level of where peers are. And part of that is the fact that we're still right around the 4x EBITDA leverage ratio. We expect that to come down very fast but we thought we'd start out a little slow. I'd say that we are focused on 25% to 30% payout ratio, and we feel the combination of pretty strong medium- to longer-term EPS growth would allow us to grow the dividend in line with EPS. And in future years, we may actually assess whether -- where we want to be in that 25% to 30% payout. Right now, we're at the lower end, but certainly, we have room to go to the higher end of that range. The third question, which is more around wine volumes, I'll let Rob answer."

As you bring these big lines on, a bunch of things happen. First, they start to depreciate. These are brand-new lines, so the depreciation expense is not insignificant. Secondly, as you bring them on and you're testing them, you -- right off the bat, this lasts for quite a while. You're not getting very good yields, nor are you getting very good asset utilization. So that kind of increases your expenses, right? So it takes a while when these big lines are coming on to get them operating at full optimization. And so as we look at beer margins in '16, it was actually -- there's some big movers, right? I mean, we expect to save a reasonable amount of money because of glass, okay, because we'll be sourcing more glass from our joint venture location, which has no freight and has the lowest cost of produced glass of all our suppliers. That's a positive. Another big positive is foreign exchange, but offsetting that is an increase in depreciation, not insignificant, and some increased labor cost as you have these startup expenses and you're bringing on labor ahead of the time that you're actually getting a lot of usable products from those new production lines. So they're kind of a big offsetting things. That said, we have -- we finished this year's operating profit margin pretty much exactly where we said we would, right around 26% here [ph]. And we're anticipating 100-basis-point improvement, even though we've got a lot of these new big production lines coming on stream. So we're pretty happy with that guidance."

In the previous like 12 to 18 months, we've bought back about 20% of our outstanding shares just $120 a share, so that's worked out pretty well for us. I think it'll be a combination of those 2.

Dollars, maybe 3% to 4%, sort of consistently with what happened in 2015 depending on exactly what reports you're looking at, you are sort of looking at 1% volume growth in 2015 and again, a couple of hundred basis points above that in dollar growth. In terms of where we're going to see the growth, it's pretty much the same story as historically has been the case, which there's, I think, pretty strong -- continues to be a very strong premiumization trend. All the growth and more in actuality is occurring in the premium plus category. And probably the thing that's changing is that it continues to move, I would say, upstream. It sort of started with sort of the bottom of the premium segment, $5 and above. It moved up into what we call the super-premium segment, which is sort of that $8 to $10, meaning the growth, that's been very strong. And now we're seeing the very strong growth in segments above that. So ultra-premium and luxury really, I would say, a lot -- you're going to see very strong growth in sort of that almost $13 to $20 range, you're probably going to see double-digit growth. In terms of varietals, I think that you'll see decent lower levels of growth in the most key varietals like [indiscernible], Cabernet Sauvignon. I think that pinot noir is going to continue to be a very stable and hot category in wine. I think in white wine, you're going to continue to see very strong growth in pinot grigio and, of course, New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs, I think they're going to continue to be a very hot category. And then I think another phenomena -- or I won't quite call it a phenomena, but a bit of a change in trend is sparkling wines. I think that sparkling wines have become very hot once again or I shouldn't say, once again. But again, they haven't been that hot over the last, I don't know, 5, 6, 7, 10 years. And you're seeing some of the more affordable categories in sparkling wines like Prosecco, and some of the domestic California sparklers become hot, and I'd say, more every day. I mean, people are turning to sparkling wine as an everyday product. What you don't see as particularly hot is champagne, i.e., French champagne. But I think that it's priced itself out of the market largely. And the consumer has turned to I'll say, more reasonably priced and easier-to-drink alternatives than champagne. So Sweet Reds will continue to be, I think, a trend in the marketplace. So sort of big, robust, slightly -- when we talk about Sweet Reds, big, robust, slightly sweeter generic red wines. That's been a pretty significant trend, and we don't see that diminishing in the near future. At the low end, Moscato has been kind of up and down a little bit. So it might probably going to continue favorably, but not as robust as it was a couple of years ago. So those are the trends, Tim."

And as long as the dollar stays stronger than the peso, that will be a bit of a benefit as well. But the good news is, because our end selling price in beer is based in U.S. dollars, we're not very foreign exchange exposed, which is a great place to be, right, because you will remember Australian wine for those years when the Aussie dollar got so strong, it's really hard to maintain a good gross profit margin.

We had a very good year in fiscal '15, and I take my hat off to our operations guys in the wine business, the winemakers blending the wine and the guys in charge of sourcing the grapes and farming the grapes because we did a very good job buying wine and the cost -- the landed cost per ton is kind of flat to even down a little bit. And we've done a very good job on refining our wine blends to make the cost to the consumer a little bit less. So we're looking good on the wine side, which is why -- one of the big reasons why we said we expect to maintain the improved gross profit margins that we experienced in the wine segment in 2015. The question around Victoria and Pacifico, I'll let Rob answer."

So Victoria is one of the -- Pacifico, I'll start with that, it's one of the smaller brands in our portfolio. I actually think that it's a real sleeper and it's a brand that has a lot of opportunity for the future, much like we saw Modelo Especial ex",512,"Yes. So Victoria is one of the -- Pacifico, I'll start with that, it's one of the smaller brands in our portfolio. I actually think that it's a real sleeper and it's a brand that has a lot of opportunity for the future, much like we saw Modelo Especial explode as a brand. Pacifico, primarily West Coast, primarily Southern California, is its really big base of business. We're focusing our marketing around things like the World Surfing Championships. We've got advertising campaigns in place around basically discovered by surfers in Mexico, Baja. So -- and we've got a draft program for Pacifico, which has been, I would say, very well received. So a smaller brand in the portfolio, but something with a lot of potential. Victoria, again, a small brand, but the interesting thing about Victoria is it's the third largest brand in Mexico with a 15% market share, and it's very well known by the Hispanics -- Mexican-Hispanic consumer, which really gives it a huge leg up versus any other new product that could be introduced in Mexico -- from Mexico to the U.S. A lot of these products that -- or 1 or 2 that have been recently introduced are fundamentally made-up products that Hispanic consumers never heard of. I mean, that's a tough sell in that demographic. With Victoria, we've also introduced cans. We're expanding the distribution nationally, and we're seeing some pretty strong growth, as I've commented on initially, of 60% growth on that brand in last year, and we see that momentum remaining strong into this year. I mentioned just, in general, cans. Cans is a huge opportunity for us. Across all of our brands, Corona, Modelo Especial, as well as the other brands, we're really stepping up can introduction, and it's -- an interesting trend in the beer business, in general, is that cans have gone from being perceived as sub-premium to being perceived as very premium form of packaging. And that's probably been driven by the fact that the craft portion of the business, which is the other very fast-growing portion of the business other than our portfolio, okay, has really adopted, at a very high end, cans as their primary packaging, and the consumers really accepted that. So that's really kind of opened the window to make cans a great premium package for our business. And then you look at our business where cans -- we have not been at cans at all, cans represent approximately 3% of our total business. But if you look at the industry as a whole, it's like half of the beer business is in cans. So the growth potential for cans is just absolutely phenomenal in our business. And in our own particular case, as we've introduced cans, we've really seen it expand consumption as opposed to just simply cannibalize other forms of packaging because we haven't had a packaging that, I'll say, is appropriate for the kind of venues where cans are particularly strong in the past. So this has been a big, big advantage for us."

We won't be as slow as that. And then as far as when these production lines come up, these are big complicated things. And as you know, our brewery is highly automated, so there's a lot of software IT stuff going on. And every line, you can't necessarily anticipate the gremlins that will come up.

And as Rob said earlier, we're ramping up some marketing around Pacifico. So -- and we think that's been a very effective spend, and the beer marketing guys actually do a very good job of tracking volume lift and the effectiveness of the various marketing expenditures. So that's the big reason why the operating profit might have come down a little bit.

So I'd say, oil prices is a net positive for us. But when you guys get into the numbers, you'll see that we still had around a $30 million loss on, I'll say, unrealized commodity hedges. Most of those was around -- were around diesel hedges. Those losses will flow through the P&L over the next 2 years. A reasonable amount will flow through the P&L in fiscal '16, that would have been included in our guidance. But net-net, the reduction to oil prices, I'll say, from a fiscal '16 is a positive.

So we think that that's a very positive trend. Of course, everything that we do, we do it keeping in mind that we're not going to cannibalize a lower -- a higher margin business with a lower-margin business can -- draft is essentially in the same kind of margin structure as our other package format, in general, so we're not overly concerned with it. But on the other hand, we certainly would -- we like the fact that it appears to be significantly market-expanding when we put it in. We actually tend to see increased sales of glass in a surrounding area when we put draft, Corona Extra draft into an establishment. And that's sort of been, I think, the traditional thinking on draft, is that it not only has just a benefit from a pure substantive point of view, i.e. another format to consume the product, but it also has a marketing or an advertising component that helps to sell your other packages off-premise, and we are definitely seeing that."

Our business overall, meaning everything combined, is about 20% cans in a market that's, I think, close to about 50% cans. So a huge opportunity there and no capacity constraints whatsoever, and we can supply 100% of our cans at this stage, so it's the year of the can."

As Patty mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by David Klein, Constellation's newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, following the recent departure of Bob Ryder, who served as our CFO for the past 8 years. Bob has been a significant contributor to our organization during his time here. His accomplishments at Constellation are numerous, and I wish him success in his future endeavors. We have an incredibly talented finance organization, which is why we're expecting a seamless transition for David as he assumes his new role. David brings a wealth of experience to this critical leadership position, most recently serving as the CFO of Constellation's beer business, where he was integral in orchestrating our glass sourcing strategy, implementing commodity management processes and instilling production cost management discipline at the brewery. David has also been very involved in the oversight of our Nava Brewery build-out, which includes managing capital expenditures at the facility. Now during the past year, working with the beer team, David has divided his time between Rochester, Chicago, San Antonio and Mexico. I believe that many of you have had the opportunity to meet David, and I would like to publicly congratulate him and welcome him to our executive management team. You will be hearing more from David in just a few minutes.
Before we get started with our quarterly review, I would also like to take a few moments to discuss this morning's exciting announcement of Constellation's planned purchase of the Meiomi wine brand. Meiomi is predominantly a California pinot noir and represents a synergistic, high-growth, high-margin, accretive complementary tuck-in to our existing portfolio of wine brands. Launched in 2006, Meiomi sold about 60,000 cases in the U.S. marketplace in 2010 and has grown to become a nearly 600,000 case brand since then. It is currently the fastest-growing major pinot noir in IRI channels at the $20 luxury price point and has experienced dollar sales growth of more than 50% over the last 52 weeks. In calendar 2014, Meiomi generated more than $65 million in net sales with an operating profit margin profile that significantly exceeds the margin rate of our overall wine and spirits business. The right brands with the right financial profile like Meiomi, Meiomi can be efficiently integrated into our distribution platforms to provide synergies, scale and route-to-market benefits and is very similar to our successful Mark West acquisition.
As I have previously mentioned, tuck-in acquisitions have been identified as one of our capital allocation priorities, especially those that are strategic, synergistic, good value and meet our strict financial criteria. Meiomi is one of these acquisitions. This acquisition does not signal a change in strategic goals for the business or impact our ability to achieve our targeted leverage range. Our top priorities remain unchanged, and they include reducing our debt to less than 4x leverage, which creates significant capital allocation flexibility and opportunity to increase returns to our shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks, capturing the organic growth opportunities we see across all of our product categories, completing the brewery and glass plant expansions as planned, while ensuring that we do not impact the tremendous commercial momentum we have within the U.S. beer market and complementing our organic growth efforts and shareholder cash return focus with the complementary brand acquisitions that enhance our portfolio. These priorities are intact and will remain our core focus for delivering shareholder value over the long term.
And now I'd like to shift the focus of our discussion to our quarterly results, which reflect a great start to our new fiscal year. Overall, our beer business had -- has been unstoppable. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year, and we continue to progress as planned with our Mexican brewery and glass plant expansions. During the first quarter, the beer business generated results that exceeded our expectations, posting double-digit sales and depletion growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, during the first quarter, Constellation beers delivered about 2/3 -- that's 2/3 of the total U.S. beer industry volume growth, leading volume gains among U.S. brewers for the eighth consecutive quarter in IRI channels.
So what's driving this phenomenal level of growth and momentum? We continue to experience robust consumer demand for our iconic portfolio of Mexican beers with our top 5 brands experiencing solid growth across almost all channels and packaging sizes during the quarter. In addition, we are benefiting from strong sales execution and excellent ongoing support from our wholesalers. The introduction of creative new marketing programs that resonate with consumers, increased investment and enhanced media plans, continued distribution gains across the portfolio for our core brands and package types and the expansion of product offerings like Corona Extra cans, Modelo Especial Chelada and Corona Light draft. The beer business conducts the ""120 Days of Summer"" selling season by posting market share gains during the Cinco de Mayo holiday led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial as the #1 and #2 share gainers, respectively, across all U.S. beer brands.
The new Corona cans have been a hit with consumers. We dedicated significant media support behind the launch with English and Spanish-language TV throughout the NBA Playoffs, Univision and Comedy Central. We see great opportunity with the can launch as this format currently represents only a small portion of total Corona extra volume.
Modelo Especial continues to maintain strong momentum as the #2 imported beer in the U.S. and delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the first quarter. Modelo Especial launched its first-ever national English-language campaign with targeted programming, including first-round NBA Playoffs on ESPN and TNT. This effort will continue through the end of summer.
Corona Light draft expanded its launch with 28 new wholesalers and existing markets. We also activated the Kenny Chesney sponsorship during the quarter, which will continue to September. And I am sure that many of you viewed our new dual-branded Corona Extra Casa Noble Tequila TV spot leading up to the Cinco holiday, which was aired on a variety of high-profile TV programs. This advertisement drove new distribution of Casa Noble on select on- and off-premise accounts. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. As such, we now expect beer volumes to increase mid- to high single digits, which should drive net sales growth of approximately 10% and underlying operating income growth of 13% to 15%. Beer operations continue to run smoothly. The brewery and glass plant expansions are proceeding as planned. All key performance metrics and initiatives for the brewery are on or better than target with the first incremental 5 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become operational by the end of calendar 2015.
During the first quarter, we achieved high levels of productivity and record capacity utilization at the Nava Brewery, and construction of the second furnace at the glass plant is underway. And we have begun site excavation and installation of utilities for the previously announced incremental brewery capacity expansion from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters.
Overall, I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. Given the continued strength of this business, we are currently evaluating plans for our next increment of capacity beyond the 25 million hectoliters.
And now I would like to discuss the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the first quarter, we experienced improving depletion and consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine business, posted better-than-expected results in Canada and delivered excellent dollar sales and depletion growth trends for our portfolio of spirit brands. We are benefiting from positive mixed trends across the business. We gained share of feature and display activity at retail, and we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market. We successfully maintained margins for the wine and spirits business in the first quarter after delivering operating margin expansion of 130 basis points in fiscal 2015. And we remain on track this year to maintain the expanded margin achieved last year. As outlined last quarter, one of our key strategic objectives for this year is to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential.
Now let me give you a few examples of what we currently have underway. Black Box will be running 2 commercials championing the exceptional value of this premium boxed wine has to offer. The commercials air this summer, and for the first time, will run in the fall season as well. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi kicked off its Moments TV campaign in June and is expected to garner more than 1 billion LDA media impressions through year-end. You can see the spot on channels like HDTV, Lifetime, Travel Channel, Food Network, TLC, Bravo, TBS and E!. We've created a new, fully integrated, digital advertising campaign for Clos du Bois, which is running now to the end of summer to engage consumers with this French-inspired California Wine. The quality of our wine brands has also attracted some terrific media attention this spring with mentions of brands such as Black Box, Kim Crawford, Mark West, Robert Mondavi Winery, Ruffino, The Dreaming Tree, and our newest brand, Tom Gordon Vineyards in such recognizable publications as fortune.com, Wine Enthusiast, bloomberg.com and E! Online.
Recent ratings further attest to our portfolio's strength. 90-plus scores coming from the Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator for luxury tiers of our Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Ravenswood brands. You may have noticed that beginning with the first quarter, we changed the composition of our reported Focus Brands in order to better align this disclosure with our current brand priorities and the sales and resource focus for the wine and spirits business. We now have 15 brands that comprise our Focus Brands versus 20 brands previously. Notable additions include 2 of our innovation brands, The Dreaming Tree and ultra-premium multi-varietal wine, which was introduced about 3 years ago in collaboration with singer-songwriter Dave Matthews, and Saved, a luxury brand inspired by contemporary artist, Scott Campbell, who is perhaps known best as the tattoo artist to the Hollywood stars. And we experienced overall depletion growth of 3.5% for the first quarter with our Focus Brands growing nearly twice that rate. These results were driven by a number of our fastest-growing brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Simi, Black Box, Estancia, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.
For our spirits portfolio, we experienced excellent net sales growth of 8% and solid depletion trend in the first quarter driven by Casa Noble Tequila, Paul Masson Brand Amber Brandy and SVEDKA Vodka. Within IRI channels, our dollar sales growth in spirits continued to outperform the market during the quarter.
Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to provide some context for the cost-effectiveness plan we have initiated as many of you -- as you may have seen mentioned in this morning's press release. As we transform our business, it's becoming increasingly important to evolve our organizational structure for sustainable long-term growth in a way that can bring out the best in the business today and at the same time position us to adapt quickly and effectively in responding to future business needs. As such, we have shifted resources and investments to long-term growth opportunities across the business as well as improved efficiency by consolidating and streamlining resources in areas where it makes the most sense. The position changes associated with this initiative will be minimal, but the majority will occur within our wine and spirits business. The objective of this effort is to build the best organization that will enable us to be more agile and effective while unlocking growth financial. David will provide a financial overview of the program in a few minutes.
In closing, I would like to reiterate that everything we do at Constellation Brands is guided by one of our most important strategic imperatives to apply rigorous financial discipline. And our financial discipline involves maintaining our commitment to our capital allocation priorities, which include ongoing debt reduction to less than 4x leverage, potential share repurchases and dividend increases and tuck-in acquisitions like Meiomi, Mark West and Casa Noble.
I would also like to remind everyone that during my tenure as CEO for the last 8 years, our team has created significant value by transforming and simplifying our product portfolio through the rationalization and divestiture of business assets in an effort to premium-ize and grow the business. And my plan for the future is to continue to deliver value and generate growth.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our first quarter results."

This is a stellar company with tremendous prospects and a dynamic industry. I believe Constellation offers one of the best combinations of top line growth and profitability in the beverage alcohol space. I look forward to partnering with Rob and the rest of the executive management team as we remain focused on executing Constellation strategic goals and our capital allocation priorities, as outlined by Rob earlier.
I had the pleasure of meeting members of the investment community at investor events in my previous roles as Treasurer or as CFO of our beer business. I look forward to spending more time and building relationships with you going forward in my new role.
With that, let me provide some Q1 highlights. On comparable basis, diluted EPS was up 18%. We paid out a quarterly common stock dividend for the first time in our history. And the continued robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, along with our agreement to acquire the Meiomi wine brand, driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.10 to a range of $4.80 to $5 for fiscal '16.
Let's take a closer look at our Q1 results, and my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on a constant-currency basis grew 8% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 10%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 4%. This primarily reflects higher shipment volume and favorable mix. Net sales benefited from the overlap of a U.S. distributor inventory destocking net of a related distributor destocking payment, which occurred during first quarter fiscal 2015.
For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $68 million, up 10% with gross margin increasing 130 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $65 million primarily due to volume growth and favorable pricing. Beer gross profit margin increased nearly 2 percentage points to 49.2%. This was driven primarily by pricing and COGS favorability.
Wine and spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and mix benefits were effectively offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payment. Gross margin held steady at 40.7% as the benefit from mix and favorable COGS were offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payments.
Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. Beer SG&A was up $16 million, [ph] primarily due to the higher marketing expense. Due to factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $50 million, and consolidated operating margin improved 130 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 170 basis points, while wine and spirits operating margin held fairly steady.
Interest expense for the quarter was $78 million, down 10%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of March, our total debt was $7.3 billion. And factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, a decrease of $51 million since the end of fiscal 2015.
I'd like to take a moment here to note that we're currently in the process of revising our credit agreement to take advantage of the favorable market conditions to extend tenor and to ensure our facilities are appropriately sized and flexible given the recent growth of our business. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% and compares to a 32.5% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by various favorable tax items. We still anticipate our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first quarter, we generated $76 million of free cash flow compared to $101 million for Q1 of last year. Operating cash flow totaled $206 million, which is $232 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of interest payments and an overlap of a tax refund in Q1 FY '15, partially offset by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter totaled $130 million, which was essentially even with Q1 last year. For fiscal '16, we still expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. Our projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion, a CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer.
Before reviewing our fiscal '16 P&L outlook, let me provide a few financial comments related to the Meiomi transaction. We expect to finance the $315 million purchase price with borrowings under our credit agreement. We expect the transaction to close around the beginning of August and to be $0.03 to $0.04 accretive to EPS for fiscal '16. We are only buying the brand inventory and some great supply contracts, but we expect integration of the brand into our wine and spirits business to be seamless.
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. As mentioned earlier, as a result of the continued strong marketplace performance for our beer business and the expected accretion benefit from Meiomi, we're increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection from $4.80 to $5 versus our previous $4.70 to $4.90 range. The beer business is now targeting mid- to high-single-digit volume growth, net sales growth of approximately 10% and 13% to 15% operating income growth. As a reminder, fiscal '15 beer shipments and ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to more historical levels. As a result, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth rate to be above the shipment growth rate and therefore in the high-single-digit range.
We continue to project beer operating margin to expand in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A structure. We expect our beer operating margin to fluctuate throughout the remainder of the year as we start to bring additional brewery capacity online.
During Q2, there will be an annual inflation increase under our Interim Supply Agreement with ABI for the finished beer that they are currently supplying us. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range before any benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. Our fiscal '16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. These adjustments include approximately $20 million of anticipated costs associated with the cost-effectiveness plan outlined by Rob earlier. Cost savings from this initiative are expected to be reinvested in areas of the company that drive growth. We ended Q1 fiscal '16 with a net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.9x. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend, dividend payments and the funding of the Meiomi acquisition, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth have positioned us to be below the 4x leverage range at the end of fiscal '16. Operating below the 4x range, combined with our strong free cash flow generation capabilities, provides a significant financial stability, especially as beer CapEx spend normalizes. This flexibility, combined with our continued focus on our significant organic growth opportunities and strong free cash flow generation capabilities, should provide us ample opportunity to increase future returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

For the rest of the year -- and by the way, the brewery also was operating effectively at capacity in the first quarter, which gives us the better number as well. The rest of the year, we're going to bring on several packaging lines. We're going to bring on part of a new warehouse, and we're going to bring on first 5 million hectoliters of brewing capacity. And once we put them in service, meaning we've run beer down the line or beer through the brewhouse for commercial sale, we then put those assets into service, which means we begin depreciation. However, at that point, there's still a lot of work, as you might imagine, that goes into optimizing the lines in the brewhouse and the warehouse. And any of that expense that happens after we put the assets into service falls right to the bottom line as an expense, right? So we expect that that's going to create some of the choppiness for the rest of the year. And then additionally, as I mentioned in my initial comments, we have an inflation adjustment on the finished goods that we're buying from ABI that actually took effect the first week of June.

Increased marketing and the concentration of that marketing against a smaller subset of brands. As I mentioned, we have initiated TV marketing at fairly significant rates against Black Box, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, for example. And with the way that we can measure very directly now through household-type surveys and pantry studies, the impact of our advertising, we believe quite strongly that some of these campaigns, in particular the Black Box and the Mondavi Woodbridge that we have previously tested, is actually not only good for longer-term brand building, but we think that it pays back in the short run with the incremental increase in purchases and consumption that we've seen in the test markets where we've run these ads. So we are expanding that, and I think that what you're seeing basically is our depletion growth, which was in the 3.5% range, which is an acceleration is indicative that what we're doing is working. And then also from a depletion point of view, which is a little hard to see through our financial results which are shipment-base, we're seeing a pretty significant increase in mix as well against the business.

Hence, we increased our guidance now for the year to the 10% sales growth range on the beer business because, as I said in my -- in the answer to some of the earlier questions, it's just evident to us that our previous guidance is -- was understated relative to current and expected trends for the remainder of the year."

And we think taste preferences are, on a long-term basis, changing towards pinot noir. So Mark West covers sort of the $10 to $12 pinot noir range, and Meiomi covers sort of the $20-plus pinot noir range.

As Patty mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by David Klein, Constellation's newly appointed Chief Financial Officer following the recent departure of Bob Ryder, who served as our CFO for the past 8 years. Bob has been a significant contributor to our organization during his time here. His accomplishments at Constellation are numerous, and I wish him success in his future endeavors. We have an incredibly talented finance organization, which is why we're expecting a seamless transition for David as he assumes his new role. David brings a wealth of experience to this critical leadership position, most recently serving as the CFO for Constellation's beer business, where he was integral in orchestrating our glass sourcing strategy, implementing commodity management processes and instilling production cost management discipline at the brewery. David has also been very involved in the oversight of our Nava Brewery buildout, which includes managing capital expenditures at the facility. Now during the past year working with the beer team, David has divided his time between Rochester, Chicago, San Antonio and Mexico. I believe that many of you have had the opportunity to meet David, and I would like to publicly congratulate him and welcome him to our executive management team. You will be hearing more from David in just a few minutes.
Before we get started with our quarterly review, I would also like to take a few moments to discuss this morning's exciting announcement of Constellation's planned purchase of the Meiomi wine brand. Meiomi is predominantly a California pinot noir and represents a synergistic high growth-, high margin-accretive complementary tuck-in to our existing portfolio of wine brands. Launched in 2006, Meiomi sold about 60,000 cases in the U.S. marketplace in 2010 and has grown to become a nearly 600,000-case brand since then. It is currently the fastest-growing major pinot noir in IRI channels at the $20 luxury price point and has experienced dollar sales growth of more than 50% over the last 52 weeks. In calendar 2014, Meiomi generated more than $65 million in net sales, with an operating profit margin profile that significantly exceeds the margin rate of our overall wine and spirits business. The right brands with the right financial profile, like Meiomi, Meiomi can be efficiently integrated into our distribution platform to provide synergies, scale and route-to-market benefits and is very similar to our successful Mark West acquisition.
As I have previously mentioned, tuck-in acquisitions have been identified as one of our capital allocation priorities, especially those that are strategic, synergistic, good value and meet our strict financial criteria. Meiomi is one of these acquisitions. This acquisition does not signal a change in strategic goals for the business or impact our ability to achieve our targeted leverage range. Our top priorities remain unchanged, and they include reducing our debt to less than 4x leverage. This creates significant capital allocation flexibility and opportunity to increase returns to our shareholder through dividend growth and share buybacks, capturing the organic growth opportunities we see across all of our product categories, completing the brewery and glass plant expansions as planned, while ensuring that we do not impact the tremendous commercial momentum we have within the U.S. beer market and complementing our organic growth efforts and shareholder cash return focus with complementary brand acquisitions that enhance our portfolio. These priorities are intact and will remain our core focus for delivering shareholder value over the long term.
And now I'd like to shift the focus of our discussion to our quarterly results, which reflect a great start to our new fiscal year. Overall, our beer business had -- has been unstoppable. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year, and we continue to progress as planned with our Mexican brewery and glass plant expansions. During the first quarter, the beer business generated results that exceeded our expectations, posting double-digit sales and depletion growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, during the first quarter, Constellation beers delivered about 2/3, that's 2/3 of the total U.S. beer industry volume growth, leading volume gains among U.S. brewers for the eighth consecutive quarter in IRI channels.
So what's driving this phenomenal level of growth and momentum? We continue to experience robust consumer demand for our iconic portfolio of Mexican beers with our top 5 brands experiencing solid growth across almost all channels and packaging sizes during the quarter. In addition, we are benefiting from strong sales execution and excellent ongoing support from our wholesalers. The introduction of creative new marketing programs that resonate with consumers, increased investment and enhanced media plans, continued distribution gains across the portfolio for our core brands and package types and the expansion of product offerings like Corona Extra cans, Modelo Especial Chelada and Corona Light draft. 
The beer business kicked off the ""120 Days of Summer"" selling season by posting market share gains during the Cinco de Mayo holiday, led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial as the #1 and #2 share gainers respectively across all U.S. beer brands.
The new Corona cans have been a hit with consumers. We dedicated significant media support behind the launch with English- and Spanish-language TV throughout the NBA Playoffs, Univision and Comedy Central. We see great opportunity with the can launch as this format currently represents only a small portion of total Corona Extra volume.
Modelo Especial continues to maintain strong momentum as the #2 imported beer in the U.S. and delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the first quarter. Modelo Especial launched its first-ever national English-language campaign with targeted programming, including first-round NBA Playoffs on ESPN and TNT. This effort will continue into the summer.
Corona Light draft expanded its launch with 28 new wholesalers in existing markets. We also activated the Kenny Chesney sponsorship during the quarter, which will continue through September. And I am sure that many of you viewed our new dual-branded Corona Extra Casa Noble Tequila TV spot leading up to the Cinco holiday, which was aired on a variety of high-profile TV programs. This advertisement drove new distribution of Casa Noble in select on- and off-premise accounts. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. As such, we now expect beer volumes to increase mid- to high single digits, which should drive net sales growth of approximately 10% and underlying operating income growth of 13% to 15%. Beer operations continue to run smoothly. The brewery and glass plant expansions are proceeding as planned. All key performance metrics and initiatives for the brewery are on or better than target, with the first incremental 5 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become operational by the end of calendar 2015.
During the first quarter, we achieved high levels of productivity and record capacity utilization at the Nava Brewery, and construction of the second furnace at the glass plant is underway. And we have begun site excavation and installation of utilities for the previously announced incremental brewery capacity expansion from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters.
Overall, I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. Given the continued strength of this business, we are currently evaluating plans for our next increment of capacity beyond 25 million hectoliters.
And now I would like to discuss the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the first quarter, we experienced improving depletion and consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine business, posted better-than-expected results in Canada and delivered excellent dollar sales and depletion growth trends for our portfolio of spirit brands. We are benefiting from positive mixed trends across the business. We gained share of feature and display activity at retail. And we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market. We successfully maintained margins for the wine and spirits business in the first quarter after delivering operating margin expansion of 130 basis points in fiscal 2015. And we remain on track this year to maintain the expanded margin achieved last year. As outlined last quarter, one of our key strategic objectives for this year is to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential.
Now let me give you a few examples of what we currently have underway. Black Box will be running 2 commercials championing the exceptional value of -- this premium boxed wine has to offer. The commercials air this summer and for the first time will run in the fall season as well. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi kicked off its Moments TV campaign in June and is expected to garner more than 1 billion LDA media impressions through year-end. You can see the spot on channels like HGTV, Lifetime, Travel Channel, Food Network, TLC, Bravo, TBS and E!. We've created a new, fully integrated, digital advertising campaign for Clos du Bois, which is running now through the end of summer to engage consumers with this French-inspired California wine. The quality of our wine brands has also attracted some terrific media attention this spring, with mentions of brands such as Black Box, Kim Crawford, Mark West, Robert Mondavi Winery, Ruffino, The Dreaming Tree and our newest brand, Tom Gore Vineyards in such recognizable publications as fortune.com, Wine Enthusiast, bloomberg.com and E! Online.
Recent ratings further attest to our portfolio's strength, with 90-plus scores coming from the Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator for luxury tiers of our Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Ravenswood brands. You may have noticed that beginning with the first quarter, we've changed the composition of our reported Focus Brands in order to better align this disclosure with our current brand priorities and the sales and resource focus for the wine and spirits business. We now have 15 brands that comprise our Focus Brands versus 20 brands previously. Notable additions include 2 of our innovation brands, The Dreaming Tree, an ultra-premium multi-varietal wine which was introduced about 3 years ago in collaboration with singer-songwriter Dave Matthews, and SAVED, a luxury brand inspired by contemporary artist, Scott Campbell, who is perhaps known best as the tattoo artist to the Hollywood stars. And we experienced overall depletion growth of 3.5% for the first quarter, with our Focus Brands growing nearly twice that rate. These results were driven by a number of our fastest-growing brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Simi, Black Box, Estancia, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.
For our spirits portfolio, we experienced excellent net sales growth of 8% and solid depletion trends in the first quarter, driven by Casa Noble Tequila, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and SVEDKA Vodka. Within IRI channels, our dollar sales growth in spirits continued to outperform the market during the quarter.
Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to provide some context for the cost-effectiveness plan we have initiated as many of you -- as you may have seen mentioned in this morning's press release. As we transform our business, it's becoming increasingly important to evolve our organizational structure for sustainable long-term growth in a way that can bring out the best in the business today and at the same time position us to adapt quickly and effectively in responding to future business needs. As such, we have shifted resources and investments to long-term growth opportunities across the business as well as improved efficiency by consolidating and streamlining resources in areas where it makes the most sense. The position changes associated with this initiative will be minimal, but the majority will occur within our wine and spirits business. The objective of this effort is to build the best organization that will enable us to be more agile and effective while unlocking growth potential. David will provide a financial overview of the program in a few minutes.
In closing, I would like to reiterate that everything we do at Constellation Brands is guided by one of our most important strategic imperatives to apply rigorous financial discipline. And our financial discipline involves maintaining our commitment to our capital allocation priorities, which include ongoing debt reduction to less than 4x leverage, potential share repurchases and dividend increases and tuck-in acquisitions like Meiomi, Mark West and Casa Noble.
I would also like to remind everyone that during my tenure as CEO for the last 8 years, our team has created significant value by transforming and simplifying our product portfolio through the rationalization and divestiture of business assets in an effort to premiumize and grow the business. And my plan for the future is to continue to deliver value and generate growth.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our first quarter results."

I believe Constellation offers one of the best combinations of top line growth and profitability in the beverage alcohol space. I look forward to partnering with Rob and the rest of the executive management team as we remain focused on executing Constellation's strategic goals and our capital allocation priorities, as outlined by Rob earlier.
I've had the pleasure of meeting members of the investment community at investor events in my previous roles as Treasurer or as CFO of our beer business. I look forward to spending more time in building relationships with you going forward in my new role.
With that, let me provide some Q1 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 18%. We paid out a quarterly common stock dividend for the first time in our history. And the continued robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, along with our agreement to acquire the Meiomi wine brand, are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.10 to a range of $4.80 to $5 for fiscal '16.
Let's take a closer look at our Q1 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on a constant currency basis grew 8% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 10%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis increased 4%. This primarily reflects higher shipment volume and favorable mix. Net sales benefited from the overlap of a U.S. distributor inventory destocking, net of a related distributor destocking payment, which occurred during first quarter fiscal 2015.
For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $68 million, up 10%, with gross margin increasing 130 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $65 million primarily due to volume growth and favorable pricing. Beer gross profit margin increased nearly 2 percentage points to 49.2%. This was driven primarily by pricing and COGS favorability.
Wine and spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and mix benefits were effectively offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payment. Gross margin held steady at 40.7% as the benefit from mix and favorable COGS were offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payment.
Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. Beer SG&A was up $16 million primarily due to the higher marketing spend. Due to factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $50 million, and consolidated operating margin improved 130 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 170 basis points, while wine and spirits operating margin held fairly steady.
Interest expense for the quarter was $78 million, down 10%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of March, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, a decrease of $51 million since the end of fiscal 2015.
I'd like to take a moment here to note that we're currently in the process of revising our credit agreement to take advantage of the favorable market conditions to extend tenor and ensure our facility is appropriately sized and flexible given the recent growth of our business. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% and compares to a 32.5% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by various favorable tax items. We still anticipate our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first quarter, we generated $76 million of free cash flow compared to $101 million for Q1 of last year. Operating cash flow totaled $206 million versus $232 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of interest payments and overlap of a tax refund in Q1 FY '15, partially offset by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter totaled $130 million, which was essentially even with Q1 last year. For fiscal '16, we still expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. Our projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer.
Before reviewing our fiscal '16 P&L outlook, let me provide a few financial comments related to the Meiomi transaction. We expect to finance the $315 million purchase price with borrowings under our credit agreement. We expect the transaction to close around the beginning of August and to be $0.03 to $0.04 accretive to EPS for fiscal '16. We are only buying the brand, inventory and some great supply contracts, so we expect integration of the brand into our wine and spirits business to be seamless.
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. As mentioned earlier, as a result of the continued strong marketplace performance for our beer business and the expected accretion benefit from Meiomi, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $4.80 to $5 versus our previous $4.70 to $4.90 range. The beer business is now targeting mid- to high-single-digit volume growth, net sales growth of approximately 10% and 13% to 15% operating income growth. As a reminder, fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to more historical levels. As a result, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth rate to be above the shipment growth rate and therefore in the high-single-digit range.
We continue to project beer operating margin to expand in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A structure. We expect our beer operating margin to fluctuate throughout the remainder of the year as we start to bring additional brewery capacity online.
During Q2, there will be an annual inflation increase under our Interim Supply Agreement with ABI for the finished beer that they are currently supplying us. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low- to mid-single-digit range before any benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. Our fiscal '16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. These adjustments include approximately $20 million of anticipated costs associated with the cost-effectiveness plan outlined by Rob earlier. Cost savings from this initiative are expected to be reinvested in areas of the company that drive growth. We ended Q1 fiscal '16 with a net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.9x. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend, dividend payments and the funding of the Meiomi acquisition, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth have positioned us to be below the 4x leverage range at the end of fiscal '16. Operating below the 4x range, combined with our strong free cash flow generation capabilities, provides a significant financial flexibility , especially as beer CapEx spend normalizes. This flexibility, combined with our continued focus on our significant organic growth opportunities and strong free cash flow generation capabilities, should provide us ample opportunity to increase future returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And for us to remain a relevant supplier, we feel that it's strategically important to remain in that business.

For the rest of the year -- and by the way, the brewery also was operating effectively at capacity in the first quarter, which gives us the better number as well. For the rest of the year, we're going to bring on several packaging lines, we're going to bring on part of a new warehouse and we're going to bring on first 5 million hectoliters of brewing capacity. And once we put them in service, meaning we've run beer down the line or beer through the brewhouse for commercial sale, we then put those assets into service, which means we begin depreciation. However, at that point, there's still a lot of work, as you might imagine, that goes into optimizing the lines in the brewhouse and the warehouse. And any of that expense that happens after we put the assets into service falls right to the bottom line as an expense, right? So we expect that that's going to create some of the choppiness for the rest of the year. And then, additionally, as I mentioned in my initial comments, we have an inflation adjustment on the finished goods that we're buying from ABI that actually took effect the first week of June.

I think that we will continue to see 2 things, okay, increased marketing and the concentration of that marketing against a smaller subset of brands. As I mentioned, we have initiated TV marketing at fairly significant rates against Black Box, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, for example. And with the way that we can measure very directly now through household-type surveys and pantry studies the impact of our advertising, we believe quite strongly that some of these campaigns, in particular the Black Box and the Mondavi Woodbridge that we have previously tested, is actually not only good for longer-term brand building, but we think that it pays back in the short run with the incremental increase in purchases and consumption that we've seen in the test markets where we've run these ads. So we are expanding that. And I think that what you're seeing basically is our depletion growth, which was in the 3.5% range, which is an acceleration, is indicative that what we're doing is working. And then also from a depletion point of view, which is a little hard to see through our financial results which are shipment-based, we're seeing a pretty significant increase in mix as well against the business. So pretty much, I'd say that what we're doing here is working pretty well. In fact, I think very well. So we're pretty optimistic about the wine and spirits business for the remainder of the year."

So we see no negative impact or unusual occurrence relative to May on our business. But as I said, yes, some of our competitors have found that period to be difficult. And regionally, the answer continues to be no as well. There's nothing going on regionally for us in terms of a shift of geographic mix or we're not seeing an acceleration in some parts of the country and a slowdown in others. Everything is pretty much steady as it goes. So nothing for us. Hence, we increased our guidance now for the year to the 10% sales growth range on the beer business because, as I said in my -- in the answer to some of the earlier questions, it's just evident to us that our previous guidance is -- was understated relative to current and expected trends for the remainder of the year."

These were classic brands in a category, in this case, pinot noir, which is not trendy but fast-growing and will continue, we believe, to be a fast-growing varietal as people continue to discover pinot noir. And we think taste preferences are, on a long-term basis, changing towards pinot noir. So Mark West covers sort of the $10 to $12 pinot noir range and Meiomi covers sort of the $20-plus pinot noir range. So that puts us in a really strong position in one of the fastest-growing and most stable segments of wine, which is the pinot noir varietal, in particular.

As Patty mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by David Klein, Constellation's newly appointed Chief Financial Officer following the recent departure of Bob Ryder, who served as our CFO for the past 8 years. Bob has been a significant contributor to our organization during his time here. His accomplishments at Constellation are numerous, and I wish him success in his future endeavors. We have an incredibly talented finance organization, which is why we're expecting a seamless transition for David as he assumes his new role. David brings a wealth of experience to this critical leadership position, most recently serving as the CFO for Constellation's beer business, where he was integral in orchestrating our glass sourcing strategy, implementing commodity management processes and instilling production cost management discipline at the brewery. David has also been very involved in the oversight of our Nava Brewery buildout, which includes managing capital expenditures at the facility. Now during the past year working with the beer team, David has divided his time between Rochester, Chicago, San Antonio and Mexico. I believe that many of you have had the opportunity to meet David, and I would like to publicly congratulate him and welcome him to our executive management team. You will be hearing more from David in just a few minutes.
Before we get started with our quarterly review, I would also like to take a few moments to discuss this morning's exciting announcement of Constellation's planned purchase of the Meiomi wine brand. Meiomi is predominantly a California pinot noir and represents a synergistic high-growth, high-margin, accretive complementary tuck-in to our existing portfolio of wine brands. Launched in 2006, Meiomi sold about 60,000 cases in the U.S. marketplace in 2010 and has grown to become a nearly 600,000 case brand since then. It is currently the fastest-growing major pinot noir in IRI channels at the $20 luxury price point and has experienced dollar sales growth of more than 50% over the last 52 weeks. In calendar 2014, Meiomi generated more than $65 million in net sales, with an operating profit margin profile that significantly exceeds the margin rate of our overall wine and spirits business. The right brands with the right financial profile, like Meiomi, Meiomi can be efficiently integrated into our distribution platform to provide synergies, scale and route-to-market benefits and is very similar to our successful Mark West acquisition.
As I have previously mentioned, tuck-in acquisitions have been identified as one of our capital allocation priorities, especially those that are strategic, synergistic, good value and meet our strict financial criteria. Meiomi is one of these acquisitions. This acquisition does not signal a change in strategic goals for the business or impact our ability to achieve our targeted leverage range. Our top priorities remain unchanged, and they include reducing our debt to less than 4x leverage. This creates significant capital allocation flexibility and opportunity to increase returns to our shareholder through dividend growth and share buybacks, capturing the organic growth opportunities we see across all of our product categories, completing the brewery and glass plant expansions as planned, while ensuring that we do not impact the tremendous commercial momentum we have within the U.S. beer market and complementing our organic growth efforts and shareholder cash return focus with complementary brand acquisitions that enhance our portfolio. These priorities are intact and will remain our core focus for delivering shareholder value over the long term.
And now I'd like to shift the focus of our discussion to our quarterly results, which reflect a great start to our new fiscal year. Overall, our beer business had -- has been unstoppable. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year, and we continue to progress as planned with our Mexican brewery and glass plant expansions. During the first quarter, the beer business generated results that exceeded our expectations, posting double-digit sales and depletion growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, during the first quarter, Constellation beers delivered about 2/3, that's 2/3 of the total U.S. beer industry volume growth, leading volume gains among U.S. brewers for the eighth consecutive quarter in IRI channels.
So what's driving this phenomenal level of growth and momentum? We continue to experience robust consumer demand for our iconic portfolio of Mexican beers with our top 5 brands experiencing solid growth across almost all channels and packaging sizes during the quarter. In addition, we are benefiting from strong sales execution and excellent ongoing support from our wholesalers. The introduction of creative new marketing programs that resonate with consumers, increased investment and enhanced media plans, continued distribution gains across the portfolio for our core brands and package types and the expansion of product offerings like Corona Extra cans, Modelo Especial Chelada and Corona Light draft. 
The beer business kicked off the ""120 Days of Summer"" selling season by posting market share gains during the Cinco de Mayo holiday, led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial as the #1 and #2 share gainers respectively across all U.S. beer brands.
The new Corona cans have been a hit with consumers. We dedicated significant media support behind the launch with English- and Spanish-language TV throughout the NBA Playoffs, Univision and Comedy Central. We see great opportunity with the can launch as this format currently represents only a small portion of total Corona Extra volume.
Modelo Especial continues to maintain strong momentum as the #2 imported beer in the U.S. and delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the first quarter. Modelo Especial launched its first-ever national English-language campaign with targeted programming, including first-round NBA Playoffs on ESPN and TNT. This effort will continue into the summer.
Corona Light draft expanded its launch with 28 new wholesalers in existing markets. We also activated the Kenny Chesney sponsorship during the quarter, which will continue through September. And I am sure that many of you viewed our new dual-branded Corona Extra, Casa Noble Tequila TV spot leading up to the Cinco holiday, which was aired on a variety of high-profile TV programs. This advertisement drove new distribution of Casa Noble in select on- and off-premise accounts. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. As such, we now expect beer volumes to increase mid- to high single digits, which should drive net sales growth of approximately 10% and underlying operating income growth of 13% to 15%. Beer operations continue to run smoothly. The brewery and glass plant expansions are proceeding as planned. All key performance metrics and initiatives for the brewery are on or better than target, with the first incremental 5 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become operational by the end of calendar 2015.
During the first quarter, we achieved high levels of productivity and record capacity utilization at the Nava Brewery, and construction of the second furnace at the glass plant is underway. And we have begun site excavation and installation of utilities for the previously announced incremental brewery capacity expansion from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters.
Overall, I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. Given the continued strength of this business, we are currently evaluating plans for our next increment of capacity beyond 25 million hectoliters.
And now I would like to discuss the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the first quarter, we experienced improving depletion and consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine business, posted better-than-expected results in Canada and delivered excellent dollar sales and depletion growth trends for our portfolio of spirit brands. We are benefiting from positive mixed trends across the business. We gained share of feature and display activity at retail. And we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market. We successfully maintained margins for the wine and spirits business in the first quarter after delivering operating margin expansion of 130 basis points in fiscal 2015. And we remain on track this year to maintain the expanded margin achieved last year. As outlined last quarter, one of our key strategic objectives for this year is to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential.
Now let me give you a few examples of what we currently have underway. Black Box will be running 2 commercials championing the exceptional value of this premium boxed wine -- has to offer. The commercials air this summer and for the first time will run in the fall season as well. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi kicked off its Moments TV campaign in June and is expected to garner more than 1 billion LDA media impressions through year-end. You can see the spot on channels like HGTV, Lifetime, Travel Channel, Food Network, TLC, Bravo, TBS and E!. We've created a new, fully integrated, digital advertising campaign for Clos du Bois, which is running now through the end of summer to engage consumers with this French-inspired California wine. The quality of our wine brands has also attracted some terrific media attention this spring, with mentions of brands such as Black Box, Kim Crawford, Mark West, Robert Mondavi Winery, Ruffino, The Dreaming Tree and our newest brand, Tom Gore Vineyards in such recognizable publications as fortune.com, Wine Enthusiast, bloomberg.com and E! Online.
Recent ratings further attest to our portfolio's strength, with 90-plus scores coming from the Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator for luxury tiers of our Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Ravenswood brands. You may have noticed that beginning with the first quarter, we've changed the composition of our reported Focus Brands in order to better align this disclosure with our current brand priorities and the sales and resource focus for the wine and spirits business. We now have 15 brands that comprise our Focus Brands versus 20 brands previously. Notable additions include 2 of our innovation brands, The Dreaming Tree, an ultra-premium multi-varietal wine which was introduced about 3 years ago in collaboration with singer-songwriter Dave Matthews, and SAVED, a luxury brand inspired by contemporary artist, Scott Campbell, who is perhaps known best as the tattoo artist to the Hollywood stars. And we experienced overall depletion growth of 3.5% for the first quarter, with our Focus Brands growing nearly twice that rate. These results were driven by a number of our fastest-growing brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Simi, Black Box, Estancia, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.
For our spirits portfolio, we experienced excellent net sales growth of 8% and solid depletion trends in the first quarter, driven by Casa Noble Tequila, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and SVEDKA Vodka. Within IRI channels, our dollar sales growth in spirits continued to outperform the market during the quarter.
Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to provide some context for the cost-effectiveness plan we have initiated as many of you -- as you may have seen mentioned in this morning's press release. As we transform our business, it's becoming increasingly important to evolve our organizational structure for sustainable long-term growth in a way that can bring out the best in the business today and at the same time position us to adapt quickly and effectively in responding to future business needs. As such, we have shifted resources and investments to long-term growth opportunities across the business as well as improved efficiency by consolidating and streamlining resources in areas where it makes the most sense. The position changes associated with this initiative will be minimal, but the majority will occur within our wine and spirits business. The objective of this effort is to build the best organization that will enable us to be more agile and effective while unlocking growth potential. David will provide a financial overview of the program in a few minutes.
In closing, I would like to reiterate that everything we do at Constellation Brands is guided by one of our most important strategic imperatives to apply rigorous financial discipline. And our financial discipline involves maintaining our commitment to our capital allocation priorities, which include ongoing debt reduction to less than 4x leverage, potential share repurchases and dividend increases and tuck-in acquisitions like Meiomi, Mark West and Casa Noble.
I would also like to remind everyone that during my tenure as CEO for the last 8 years, our team has created significant value by transforming and simplifying our product portfolio through the rationalization and divestiture of business assets in an effort to premiumize and grow the business. And my plan for the future is to continue to deliver value and generate growth.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our first quarter results."

This is a stellar company with tremendous prospects in a dynamic industry. I believe Constellation offers one of the best combinations of top line growth and profitability in the beverage alcohol space. I look forward to partnering with Rob and the rest of the executive management team as we remain focused on executing Constellation's strategic goals and our capital allocation priorities, as outlined by Rob earlier.
I've had the pleasure of meeting members of the investment community at investor events in my previous roles as Treasurer or as CFO of our beer business. I look forward to spending more time in building relationships with you going forward in my new role.
With that, let me provide some Q1 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 18%. We paid out a quarterly common stock dividend for the first time in our history. And the continued robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, along with our agreement to acquire the Meiomi wine brand, are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.10 to a range of $4.80 to $5 for fiscal '16.
Let's take a closer look at our Q1 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on a constant currency basis grew 8% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 10%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis increased 4%. This primarily reflects higher shipment volume and favorable mix. Net sales benefited from the overlap of a U.S. distributor inventory destocking, net of a related distributor destocking payment, which occurred during first quarter fiscal 2015.
For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $68 million, up 10%, with gross margin increasing 130 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $65 million primarily due to volume growth and favorable pricing. Beer gross profit margin increased nearly 2 percentage points to 49.2%. This was driven primarily by pricing and COGS favorability.
Wine and spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and mix benefits were effectively offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payment. Gross margin held steady at 40.7% as the benefit from mix and favorable COGS were offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payment.
Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. Beer SG&A was up $16 million primarily due to the higher marketing spend. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $50 million, and consolidated operating margin improved 130 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 170 basis points, while wine and spirits operating margin held fairly steady.
Interest expense for the quarter was $78 million, down 10%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of March, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, a decrease of $51 million since the end of fiscal 2015.
I'd like to take a moment here to note that we're currently in the process of revising our credit agreement to take advantage of the favorable market conditions to extend tenor and ensure our facility is appropriately sized and flexible given the recent growth of our business. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% and compares to a 32.5% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by various favorable tax items. We still anticipate our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first quarter, we generated $76 million of free cash flow compared to $101 million for Q1 of last year. Operating cash flow totaled $206 million versus $232 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of interest payments and overlap of a tax refund in Q1 FY '15, partially offset by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter totaled $130 million, which was essentially even with Q1 last year. For fiscal '16, we still expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. Our projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer.
Before reviewing our fiscal '16 P&L outlook, let me provide a few financial comments related to the Meiomi transaction. We expect to finance the $315 million purchase price with borrowings under our credit agreement. We expect the transaction to close around the beginning of August and to be $0.03 to $0.04 accretive to EPS for fiscal '16. We are only buying the brand, inventory and some great supply contracts, so we expect integration of the brand into our wine and spirits business to be seamless.
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. As mentioned earlier, as a result of the continued strong marketplace performance for our beer business and the expected accretion benefit from Meiomi, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection from $4.80 to $5 versus our previous $4.70 to $4.90 range. The beer business is now targeting mid- to high-single-digit volume growth, net sales growth of approximately 10% and 13% to 15% operating income growth. As a reminder, fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to more historical levels. As a result, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth rate to be above the shipment growth rate and therefore in the high-single-digit range.
We continue to project beer operating margin to expand and be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A structure. We expect our beer operating margin to fluctuate throughout the remainder of the year as we start to bring additional brewery capacity online.
During Q2, there will be an annual inflation increase under our Interim Supply Agreement with ABI for the finished beer that they are currently supplying us. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low- to mid-single-digit range before any benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. Our fiscal '16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. These adjustments include approximately $20 million of anticipated costs associated with the cost-effectiveness plan outlined by Rob earlier. Cost savings from this initiative are expected to be reinvested in areas of the company that drive growth. 
We ended Q1 fiscal '16 with a net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.9x. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend, dividend payments and the funding of the Meiomi acquisition, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth have positioned us to be below the 4x leverage range at the end of fiscal '16. Operating below the 4x range, combined with our strong free cash flow generation capabilities, provides a significant financial flexibility, especially as beer CapEx spend normalizes. This flexibility, combined with our continued focus on our significant organic growth opportunities and strong free cash flow generation capabilities, should provide us ample opportunity to increase future returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

For the rest of the year -- and by the way, the brewery also was operating effectively at capacity in the first quarter, which gives us a better number as well. For the rest of the year, we're going to bring on several packaging lines, we're going to bring on part of a new warehouse and we're going to bring on the first 5 million hectoliters of brewing capacity. And once we put them in service, meaning we've run beer down the line or beer through the brewhouse for commercial sale, we then put those assets into service, which means we begin depreciation. However, at that point, there's still a lot of work, as you might imagine, that goes into optimizing the lines in the brewhouse and the warehouse. And any of that expense that happens after we put the assets into service falls right to the bottom line as an expense, right? So we expect that that's going to create some of the choppiness for the rest of the year. And then, additionally, as I mentioned in my initial comments, we have an inflation adjustment on the finished goods that we're buying from ABI that actually took effect the first week of June.

I think that we will continue to see 2 things, okay, increased marketing and the concentration of that marketing against a smaller subset of brands. As I mentioned, we have initiated TV marketing at fairly significant rates against Black Box, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, for example. And with the way that we can measure very directly now through household-type surveys and pantry studies the impact of our advertising, we believe quite strongly that some of these campaigns, in particular the Black Box and the Mondavi Woodbridge that we have previously tested, is actually not only good for longer-term brand building, but we think that it pays back in the short run with the incremental increase in purchases and consumption that we've seen in the test markets where we've run these ads. So we are expanding that. And I think that what you're seeing basically is our depletion growth, which was in the 3.5% range, which is an acceleration, is indicative that what we're doing is working. And then also from a depletion point of view, which is a little hard to see through our financial results which are shipment-based, we're seeing a pretty significant increase in mix as well against the business. So pretty much, I'd say that what we're doing here is working pretty well. In fact, I think very well. So we're pretty optimistic about the wine and spirits business for the remainder of the year."

There's nothing going on regionally for us in terms of a shift of geographic mix or we're not seeing an acceleration in some parts of the country and a slowdown in others.

We keep our eye open for these kinds of things that come around every once in a while. They're very advantageous, if it's the right thing at the right time. We try to stay away from some of the, I'm going to say, trendier stuff that has a tendency to kind of go up and down. You take Meiomi. You take Mark West. These were classic brands in a category, in this case, pinot noir, which is not trendy but fast-growing and will continue, we believe, to be a fast-growing varietal as people continue to discover pinot noir. And we think taste preferences are, on a long-term basis, changing towards pinot noir. So Mark West covers sort of the $10 to $12 pinot noir range and Meiomi covers sort of the $20-plus pinot noir range. So that puts us in a really strong position in one of the fastest-growing and most stable segments of wine, which is the pinot noir varietal, in particular. So no, no change in the sort of the frequency or -- of those kind of deals."

Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year, and we continue to progress as planned with our Nava brewery and glass plant expansions.
Let's drag right of our commercial and operational results we saw this quarter for our beer business. During the second quarter, the beer business generated double-digit depletion growth, driven by exceptional consumer demand for our products across the beer portfolio. In fact, the second quarter marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of volume market share growth for our beer portfolio. Constellation beers represented 45% of total U.S. beer industry volume growth during the quarter, as all of our beer brands grew across most channels and packaging sizes.
Excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season with the 120 Days of Summer marketing campaign drove market share gains during the Fourth of July, which continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. 
Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion and consumer takeaway trends during the summer months , driven by continuing velocity growth and distribution gains, including the can launch and ongoing investment in media and merchandising, with the new Always Summer marketing campaign. 
The new Corona cans continued to expand consumption occasions for the brand and are a hit with consumers. Can represented more than a 40% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. 
Throughout the summer, we dedicated significant media support behind the can launch with English- and Spanish-language TV and digital advertising, especially during the July 4th and Labor Day holidays. 
We see great opportunity with this format as it currently represents only about 5% of total Corona Extra volume. 
Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the second quarter, driven by continuing velocity and distribution gains. 
The brands increased media investments, including the continuation of Modelo Especial national English-language TV and video campaign, continued throughout the summer months, reaching the general market and bicultural Hispanic beer drinkers through targeted entertainment and sports programming. 
National Hispanic media included the gold cup broadcast sponsorship on Univision throughout the month of July, including in gain advertising and sponsorships. 
Corona Light continued to gain share with all core Corona Light packages posting growth during the quarter. 3 new brands TV spots were showcased on national TV throughout the summer and the brand sponsored Kenny tour continued with 29 tour dates from June through August. 
For the remainder of the year, we have solid marketing programs in place in order to maintain the excellent brand momentum we are experiencing across the portfolio. 
For Corona Extra, the football season continues to grow in importance through our returning partnership with Coach Jon Gruden and maintenance of key investments with the NFL, the #1 program on TV. 
Boxing also remains a priority with Corona Extra through an integrated marketing plan to support highly anticipated fights. 
The momentum of the Corona can format will be supported through general market and Hispanic TV support into the fall football tailgating season. And you should expect to see our iconic Corona Police TV spot leading into Thanksgiving holiday, which will be accompanied by robust on and off-premise promotional programs designed to drive brand affinity for Corona during the holiday season. 
For Modelo Especial, we have added 6 weeks of live TV sports program on national English-language TV during the start of the NFL season across CBS, Fox, ESPN and ESPN2. 
National Hispanic media will also continue for Modelo Especial with the weekly TV exposure to Spanish-language consumers. 
Before moving on to a discussion of our beer operations, I am pleased to announce today that we're launching our [indiscernible] harmony Whitetail, a craft Belgium wheat beer inspired by the culture and flavors of Mexico. The idea for this new beer brand was developed by our beer team working in conjunction with Chef Rick Bayless. It will be available beginning next week at several of their Rick Bayless Chicago Frontera restaurants and other key Chicago area on premise accounts. 
Our beer operations continue to run smoothly. The brewery and glass plant expansions are proceeding as planned. All key performance metrics related to cost, quality, capacity utilization and service are better than target this quarter. 
New bottling lines are currently being commissioned and will become fully operational by year-end support for the expansion such as cogeneration, wastewater and engine room and fire protection are all on schedule, more continuous on the next expansion phase as we increase production capability from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capabilities around the site. 
Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for 2016. 
We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the 15% to 18% range, which is expected to drive an enhanced operating margin of approximately 34% for the segment in fiscal 2016 versus our previous margin estimates of 33%. 
While we are currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits, which combined are the most significant drivers of the revised beer margin for fiscal 2016, we have also experienced better-than-planned operational results driven by our glass plant performance. 
We are on track to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of capacity online at Nava by calendar year-end. Once these capacity is operational, we will be positioned to bring the next 5 million hectoliters into service by next summer. 
Upon completion of these 10 million hectoliter expansion, the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI for finished goods will no longer be required as we will be fully self sufficient from a supply perspective to fulfill our needs for the U.S. market. 
We expect to receive the full benefits of our targeted mid-30% operating margin goal on a more sustainable basis once we are fully operational at 20 million hectoliters at Nava. 
Longer-term margin targets, we will still have much to accomplish. I would like to remind everybody that the 5 million hectoliters of capacity that we will increase Nava capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters is expected to be completed by calendar 2017. 
Finally, given the continued strength of our beer business, we continue to make progress in evaluating plans for our future capacity needs beyond 25 million hectoliters. And we will have more to say as we finalize our plans in coming months. 
And now, I would like to discuss the business results for our wine and spirits business. In the wine and spirits business during the second quarter, we achieved earnings growth and solid margin expansion while delivering strong spirits performance and excellent overall results for our Canadian business. 
In the U.S., our net sales are benefiting from positive mixed trends, and we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market. 
We have successfully integrated our new Meiomi wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and are working to expand distribution to drive incremental growth for this brand. 
The most recent 4-week IRI trends show that Meiomi is growing more than 80% in multi-outlet and convenience channel, which is contributing to the fact that our premium plus dollar growth improved in recent periods. 
Throughout each quarter, our focus investments within wine and spirits can be seen in the marketplace. 
As a reminder, we're concentrating our investments and our resources are key subset of our focus brands because we believe they have the right combination of scale, higher margins and growth potential to drive our overall business results. 
Let's talk about a few examples of these programs. Our TV advertising for Woodbridge aired over the summer and helps drive strong IRI growth for this brand during this timeframe. This program will rev up again in advance of our winter holiday selling season. 
Our Kim Crawford brand is the unrivaled leader of the New Zealand category with its distinct flavored profile and undue ordinary marketing platform. 
This summer, it kicked off its exclusive national campaign with Cirque du Soleil and executed promotional programs with co-branded advertising offer sweepstakes and sampling events. 
Kim Crawford posted dollar growth of more than 30% in the recent IRI periods. 
Mark West, Americas #1 Pinot won 5x executive winner of [indiscernible] hot brand award is harnessing the power of its unique majority male based with targeted digital Facebook ads and expanded print media in conjunction with its healthy growing campaign. 
And this month's month, we're launching Mark West Black further advantage of the Pinot Noir craze. 
Overall, we experienced depletion trends of more than 6% for our focus brands during the second quarter, which demonstrates that these strategy is paying off. 
We've also taken some exciting steps towards our goal of developing new brands that have potential to win big with consumers. 
The newest wine brand in the portfolio, Tom Gore, is named, for Tom, a second generation grape farmer, who has a passion for cultivating fruit with exceptional flavor and quality from its vines. This brand resonates with consumers search for authenticity of the origin ingredients and people involved in what they eat and drink and we are very pleased with its preliminary results. 
During the quarter, our spirits portfolio experienced excellent net sales growth of 19% at solid depletion growth across the portfolio, driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and the success of its peach flavor offering as well as Ted, led by its hit flavors, mango, pineapple, strawberry, lemonade and grapefruit, jalapeno, 
Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectations so far this year with continuing share gains after particularly strong depletion growth during Cinco de Mayo. And we continue to make focus Casa Noble marketing investments in 4 key local markets: LA, New York, Chicago and Texas where activation programs include tasting, cocktail features and collaborations with our beer portfolio for our local events. 
Print ads targeting millenial consumers are also running in regional publications. This quarter, we launched the national rollout of Serpents Spike, a bold whiskey infused with Apple cider flavors. This product targets the intersection of 3 of the hottest trends in our alcoholic beverages: Flavored whiskey, hard cider and shot occasion. Though it is too early to comment on long-term expectations for this brand, our retailer and consumer feedback has been very positive and we are pleased with what has been a fantastic start to the development of this brand. 
As we head into key holiday systems for our wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our Focus Brands. Our expectation is that you should see improving depletion trends as we progress throughout the remainder of the year. 
As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 80% complete and is expected to be completely finished by mid-October. 
The current California industry estimate is for total harvest yield of  3.6 million to 3.8 million tons versus approximately 4 million tons last year.  While the crop is down this year versus last, quality looks to be very good with excellent color and flavors and our winemakers are smiling. 
From a pricing perspective, we continued to expect great, great pricing to be flat to down slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location and demand with the exception of Cabernet, which continues to be in high demand. 
In closing, we are at the halfway point in the year and I am very gratified with our impressive results so far this year. 
We are working diligently on the Nava brewery and glass plant expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. 
And within our wine and spirits business, we are making good progress overall, and I believe we are well positioned to drive our great portfolio of brand during the upcoming holiday selling season. 
This December marks the 70th anniversary of our company's founding. We are proud of our heritage and look forward to positioning our company for the next 70 years of living our vision to elevate life with every glass raised. 
With that, I will now like to turn the call over to David Klein for our financial discussion of our second quarter results."
258589,311179290,875082,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2015",2015-10-07,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with some Q2 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 41%.

Let's start with some Q2 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 41%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results during the key summer selling season. 
The strong beer performance along with some favorability in our interest expense are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.20 to a range of $5 to $5.20 per share for fiscal '16. 
The beer performance, along with lower than previously expected payments for taxes and interests, are also helping to push our fiscal '16 free cash flow projection up $100 million to a range of $200 million to $300 million. 
And our glass plants and brewery expansion activities continue to progress as planned as we are positioned to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of additional capacity online during the second half of fiscal '16. 
We'll take a closer look at our Q2 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. 
Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 9% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 14% on volume growth of 13%. 
As a reminder, during Q2 fiscal '15, we estimated that beer recall activities resulted in the reversal of approximately 2 million case shipments to wholesalers and a $37 million reduction in net sales. 
If you adjust last year's second quarter for the impact of this activity, volume growth in this year second quarter would have been closer to 9% and net sales growth closer to 10%. 
We replenished the Q2 fiscal '15 recall volume with shipments to wholesalers during the third quarter of fiscal '15. 
In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of last year to bring inventory more in line with historical levels. 
As a result of these activities, we will be facing a difficult beer sales and EBIT growth comparison for Q3 fiscal '16. 
Beer sales growth for the first half of fiscal 2016 totaled 13%. However, the difficult third quarter comparison is a primary driver of why we continue to expect full year fiscal '16 beer net sales growth to approximate 10%.  We continue to expect solid third quarter depletion growth. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. These primarily reflects higher spirits shipment volume. 
For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $93 million, up 13%, with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. 
Beer gross profit increased $89 million, primarily due to volume growth, lower COGS and favorable pricing and our beer gross profit margin increased 310 basis points to 48.4%. 
Wine and spirits gross profit was up slightly and volume and COGS benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. 
Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 41.6%. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $5 million. 
Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $88 million and consolidated operating margin improved 320 basis points.  Beer operating margin increased 450 basis points. 
This improvement reflects the gross profit benefit that I just highlighted, plus favorability and marketing spend on a per case basis for the quarter. 
The marketing spend benefit is timing related as we expect to see higher marketing spend during Q3 and for the full year. 
Wine and spirits operating margin improved 90 basis points, primarily due to the gross profit benefit discussed earlier. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $77 million, down 9%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. 
At the end of August, our total debt was $7.4 billion. And factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.1 billion, a decrease of $144 million since the end of fiscal 2015. 
This activity primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition. 
We now expect interest expense for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. 
The improvement in this target reflects favorably and short term interest rates and timing of our CapEx spend versus our original plan. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 24.6% and compares to a 32.3% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. 
We still expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%. 
As a result, we expect our tax rate for the second half of the year to run above our projected full year rates. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. 
For the first half of fiscal '16, we generated $508 million of free cash flow compared to  $360 million for the same period last year. 
Operating cash flow totaled $803 million versus $668 million for the prior year period. 
This increase was primarily due to the higher earnings generated by the beer business. 
Given higher projected earnings for the beer business and lower projected tax and interest payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal '16. 
CapEx for the first half of fiscal '16 totaled $295 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending during the same time frame last year. 
Our brewery expansion activities continued to progress as planned, but we have seen some shifting in the timing of our CapEx with the higher level of spending expected to come in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we are still targeting CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer. 
Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal '16 free cash flow to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million. 
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. 
As discussed earlier, due to continued strong results for our beer business and lower-than-expected interest expense, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $5 to $5.20 per share versus our previous $4.80 to $5 range. 
The beer business continues to target mid- to high-single digits volume growth and net sales growth of approximately 10%. 
As a reminder, fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to historical levels. 
As a result, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth rate to be in the high single-digit range and above the shipment growth rate of mid- to high- single digits. 
We're currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits along with better than expected glass plant performance that are helping to drive improved operational results. Therefore we now expect the beer business to generate 15% to 18% operating income growth. This guidance has us targeting at beer operating margin of approximately 34% for fiscal '16. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continued to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range before any benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. 
While we anticipate improving depletion trends in the second half of fiscal '16, we expect to see most of the wine and spirits sales growth to be driven in Q4 versus Q3 due to shipment timing and comparisons versus the second half of fiscal '15. 
Our fiscal '16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our results for the first half of the year and our projected sales, earnings and operating cash flow growth for the full year of fiscal '16. 
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

When we pick apart our business and we look at the drivers and drives of our business, we see a little bit of cannibalization but you have to look at our numbers year-to-date and you see that our bottle depletions are up mid-single digits, while our cans have expanded from 3% of our mix last year to 6% of our mix this year. So we are seeing some cannibalization but we're not seeing it affected the overall brand of Corona. In terms of where we think the mix can get to, you know our Modelo brand is more of a can centric brand. We don't really see Corona becoming a can centric brand. The purpose of the can is to just provide incremental consumption occasions for our consumers."

In volumetric terms, it's a large chunk of our portfolio through the sub premium, but in actuality in terms of what's really generating our profits and the bulk of our sales, it's our focused brands. And that's all largely premium. And then to your question, the answer is basically yes, as to what you have described the strategy is definitely about not worrying too much about the masochistic part of the portfolio, which is subpremium. And we did take some pricing very successfully this year in that part of the portfolio. And we are reinvesting against, as I mentioned in my script, a smaller subset of our focus brands. And we think that, that sort of mix of activity will drive stronger overall results, which I believe that it is and I believe that it will.

Okay. and what We do mean by that is we see it thus far as being additive as opposed to just sort of a pure swap out on premise. And then where we do have it, we see some positive effects in the marketplace around it, meaning in the off-premise. There seems to be a positive effect when we have Corona on draft on the on premise and then our off-premise sales in the area. So the test is positive but at the same time, Corona is our -- by far, the most important brand and we're going to be very thoughtful about how we proceed basically with anything new with that brand. So good news is the brand is performing better than ever right now or at least as it relates to shorter term history. So again, beer business is extremely strong."

So I would say that our beer depletion performance exceeds our expectations but realizing that we have some -- continue to have tough overlaps in terms of strong growth last year or 2. I mean, we can only be relatively cautious as to the kind of growth that we're willing to predict. Hey, I hope we far exceeded those numbers but I think that high single digit remains -- depletion growth remains a good estimate. We do have some pricing that we're taking right now in the marketplace in the 1% to 2% range that we talked about historically. While we feel that the brand is an extremely strong position to take that pricing, it's not as if it will have 0 impact on depletion growth. And then in terms of IRI and the disconnect, I think that IRI only measures about half of the business, the half that it doesn't measure is the half that's not necessarily industry-wide performing very well, like the on premise for instance and liquor stores and as an example that are the more sluggish part of the industry. That said, we're performing of course better than anybody else in those channels. But those channels are not the highest performing channels, whereas, the IRI channels being grocery and convenience are some of the strongest channels at the current time.

So we -- the joint venture team on the ground in Nava as well as our partners at Illinois has done an outstanding job of smoothly getting our furnace at Nava functioning well. So as a result of that, we're  seeing better profit performance from the joint venture. And that allows us to shift our mix just a little bit and I don't have the exact numbers, Judy, but to shift our mix a little bit toward our own glass plant as opposed to third-party providers, which gives us near-term, in particular freight benefits as it relates to the glass plant. And we have to get on to the Vitro acquisition question. We have a very strong relationship with Owens-Illinois.

If there's any change in our strategy, I would say that the marketplace is changing somewhat in terms of sort of the makeup of the types of products that are out there. The market -- I mean, the industry is definitively premiumizing while volume remains sort of flat so that there's a shift internally towards more premium products. And I would say that there's probably has given us the opportunity to be less focused on what's going on with competitive products and to be more focused on what we think is good for our brand and what we think will work and won't work. So we continued to be very strategic in our pricing. We're doing it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. Our guidance, nevertheless, hasn't changed. We're still looking at 1% to 2% range. And you can call it leading or not leading, we're sort of, I'll say marching into our own beat as opposed to too worried about what some of our competitors are doing overall. And that's sort of up to them. And we will do what we think the market will bear for our brands and what's good for the health of our brands. So in some cases, that will mean that we will lead pricing. But, as I said, the markets changed. It's premiumizing, 10% of the industry now is craft, selling it at high prices, right? And the other 10% of the market is basically us. And those are the 2 segments, that 20%, obviously, taking share from the other 80%.

They person buying the cheap, Modelo Especial can, is very different from the one that you're advertising to the team for the bottle. And the second question, which is related to this also. Obviously, Modelo Especial is driving the growth. Have you provided ACVs for cans and bottles. Can you give some color in terms of what's the growth in bottles, what's the growth in cans? I understand the bottles is starting from a lower base, but the reason I asked the question is that when you say 65% ACV for Modelo Especial, I'm not so sure there's a big market for Modelo Especial in states like Alabama or South Carolina. So perhaps your ACV has already capped on Modelo Especial in the cans or maybe not. I mean, obviously, given the growth rate is hasn't. But just give some color there.

I think we have seen a shift somewhat at least in the growth from cans to bottles. The can is only slightly priced less than the bottle. It's really almost irrelevant, the pricing difference. Interestingly enough, cans have -- in general, taken out a very premium image, so it's becoming the package of choice in the craft segment of the market so the whole view towards cans in general, I would say, is shifting quite significantly from a consumer perspective. So we don't see any difficulties in marketing the cans and the bottles together. Like everybody else does, markets cans and bottles. So that's not a particularly unique aspect of our Modelo Especial business, which as we said earlier, is actually growing more than it ever has on a incredibly large base. So the strength of that brand is phenomenal at this stage without -- it really has a fully transitioned to a general market product. And it is transitioning to a general market product. Again, with our own help as we've turned on general market TV advertising, which has been very successful and we know that there is huge room for distribution growth in that brand. And you will see it. You will see that as we continue to move forward and execute with that brand. You will see the ACV continue to go up. That's simply going to be the case as we believe quite strongly at the current time. So the cans are strong, the bottles are strong. It's following the same pattern as many brands that have become major brands and Corona is probably the best example of that."

With all these talk about as [indiscernible] SABMiller transaction, if it happens, if I recall about 55% of your volumes in the U.S. go through Miller wholesalers, obviously, they are independent, the balance mostly on [ph]. I know it it's very hypothetical and speculative, but if Heineken were to be involved in any way in the future with Miller course, and/or Miller, there could be some changes there on the wholesaler level, right? I will assume that they would want the Miller course wholesalers to carry their portfolio of Mexican brands. Of course, the wholesalers will have their own say and your business is much larger. But is there a risk there, #1. And the second question would be, in terms of your volume in the U.S., at the wholesaler level, what percentage would overlap with the brands? Or pretty much wholesalers carry your brands, don't carry the brands. And sorry about the detail there."

I would say that, that is totally irrelevant to us. The [indiscernible] brands are small, okay? And in terms of growth, they have some growth in their [ph] brand, which is less than half the size for instance of Modelo Especial and the growth has slowed down. And Ducale is, I think, is in a negative territory and they've had some growth at Ducale Light which basically sells at the domestic premium price point. So we don't really view that as particularly strong competition. And we don't  really care whether they're in miller course or ABI or frankly where they go because we don't focus on that portfolio very much. And Heineken is a whole different animal, obviously. I think it's competing with a different consumer base in general than our Mexican portfolio. So again, it's not something that we really focus on. And in general, our modus operandi is to worry more about our portfolio and the opportunities there and execution is going to be the key on our portfolio in the future, which is going to be about taking advantage of distribution opportunities and basically increasing the number of SKUs per account. I mean, that's really what we -- where the opportunity lies for us because we actually generate a huge amount of growth for ourselves and our retailers with a relatively small amount of shelf presence and we're under skewed given our velocity and our dollar volume at retail. So there's just a big opportunity there for us and our retailers. Our retailers are -- and should be interested in increasing their sales and margin per unit space -- per unit space of shelf space, that's what they're all about and probably their biggest opportunity to do that and to get dollar sales, turns and more importantly, margin, is through increased SKU and shelf space for our portfolio. So and when we talked to retailers about that, I think they realize because the statistics are just overwhelming for them as a way to increase their profitability. So building our SKU count per retail, per retail account is going to be 1 of our primary focus going forward."

Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year, and we continue to progress as planned with our Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions.
Let's drag right into the commercial and operational results we saw this quarter for our beer business. During the second quarter, the beer business generated double-digit depletion growth, driven by exceptional consumer demand for our products across the beer portfolio. In fact, the second quarter marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of volume market share growth for our beer portfolio. Constellation beers represented 45% of total U.S. beer industry volume growth during the quarter, as all of our beer brands grew across most channels and package sizes.
Excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season with the 120 Days of Summer marketing campaign, drove market share gains during the Fourth of July, which continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial.
Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion and consumer takeaway trends during the summer months, driven by continuing velocity growth and distribution gains, including the can launch and ongoing investments in media and merchandising, with the new Always Summer marketing campaign.
The new Corona cans continue to expand consumption occasions for the brand and are a hit with consumers. Cans represented more than 40% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. 
Throughout the summer, we dedicated significant media support behind the can launch with English- and Spanish-language TV and digital advertising, especially during the July 4th and Labor Day holidays.
We see great opportunity with this format as it currently represents only about 5% of total Corona Extra volume.
Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the second quarter, driven by continuing velocity and distribution gains.
The brands increased media investments, including the continuation of Modelo Especial national English-language TV and video campaign, continued throughout the summer months, reaching the general market and bicultural Hispanic beer drinkers through targeted entertainment and sports programming.
National Hispanic media included the Gold Cup broadcast sponsorship on Univision throughout the month of July, including in gain advertising and sponsorships.
Corona Light continued to gain share with all core Corona Light packages posting growth during the quarter. 3 new brands TV spots were showcased on national TV throughout the summer and the brand sponsored Kenny Chesney tour continued with 29 tour dates from June through August.
For the remainder of the year, we have solid marketing programs in place in order to maintain the excellent brand momentum we are experiencing across the portfolio.
For Corona Extra, the football season continues to grow in importance through our returning partnership with Coach Jon Gruden and maintenance of key investments with the NFL, the #1 program on TV.
Boxing also remains a priority with Corona Extra through an integrated marketing plan to support highly anticipated fights.
The momentum of the Corona can format will be supported through general market and Hispanic TV support into the fall football tailgating season. And you should expect to see our iconic Corona Feliz TV spot leading into Thanksgiving holiday, which will be accompanied by robust on and off-premise promotional programs designed to drive brand affinity for Corona during the holiday season.
For Modelo Especial, we have added 6 weeks of live TV sports program on national English-language TV during the start of the NFL season across CBS, FOX, ESPN and ESPN2.
National Hispanic media will also continue for Modelo Especial with the weekly TV exposure to Spanish-language consumers.
Before moving on to a discussion of our beer operations, I am pleased to announce today that we are launching our new Tocayo Hominy White Ale, a craft Belgium-style wheat beer inspired by the culture and flavors of Mexico. The idea for this new beer brand was developed by our beer team working in conjunction with Chef Rick Bayless. It will be available beginning next week at several of the Rick Bayless' Chicago Frontera restaurants and other key Chicago area on premise accounts.
Our beer operations continue to run smoothly. The brewery and glass plant expansions are proceeding as planned. All key performance metrics related to cost, quality, capacity utilization and service are better than target this quarter.
New bottling lines are currently being commissioned and will become fully operational by year-end. Support for the expansion such as cogeneration, wastewater, engine room and fire protection are all on schedule. We're continuous on the next expansion phase as we increase production capability from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capabilities around the site.
Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for 2016.
We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the 15% to 18% range, which is expected to drive an enhanced operating margin of approximately 34% for the segment in fiscal 2016 versus our previous margin estimate of 33%.
While we are currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits, which combined, are the most significant drivers of the revised beer margin for fiscal 2016, we have also experienced better-than-planned operational results driven by our glass plant performance.
We are on track to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of capacity online at Nava by calendar year-end. Once this capacity is operational, we will be positioned to bring the next 5 million hectoliters into service by next summer.
Upon completion of these 10 million hectoliter expansion, the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI for finished goods will no longer be required as we will be fully self sufficient from a supply perspective to fulfill our needs for the U.S. market.
We expect to receive the full benefits of our targeted mid-30% operating margin goal on a more sustainable basis once we are fully operational at 20 million hectoliters at Nava.
Longer-term margin target, we will still have much to accomplish. I would like to remind everybody that the 5 million hectoliters of capacity that will increase Nava capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters is expected to be completed by calendar 2017.
Finally, given the continued strength of our beer business, we continue to make progress in evaluating plans for our future capacity needs beyond the 25 million hectoliters. And we will have more to say as we finalize our plans in coming months.
And now I would like to discuss the business results for our wine and spirits business. In the wine and spirits business during the second quarter, we achieved earnings growth and solid margin expansion while delivering strong spirits performance and excellent overall results for our Canadian business. 
In the U.S., our net sales are benefiting from positive mixed trends, and we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market.
We have successfully integrated our new Meiomi wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and are working to expand distribution to drive incremental growth for this brand.
The most recent 4-week IRI trends show that Meiomi is growing more than 80% in multi-outlet and convenience channels, which is contributing to the fact that our premium plus dollar growth improved in recent periods.
Throughout each quarter, our focused investments within wine and spirits could be seen in the marketplace. 
As a reminder, we're concentrating our investments and our resources on a key subset of our focus brands because we believe they have the right combination of scale, higher margins and growth potential to drive our overall business results.
Let's talk about a few examples of these programs. Our TV advertising for Woodbridge aired over the summer and helps drive strong IRI growth for this brand during this time frame. This program will rev up again in advance of our winter holiday selling season.
Our Kim Crawford brand is the unrivaled leader of the New Zealand category with its distinct flavor profile and undue ordinary marketing platform.
This summer, it kicked off its exclusive national campaign with Cirque du Soleil and executed promotional programs with co-branded advertising offer, sweepstakes and sampling events. 
Kim Crawford posted dollar growth of more than 30% in the recent IRI periods.
Mark West, America's #1 pinot noir and 5-time executive winner of Impact Hot Brand Award, is harnessing the power of its unique majority male shopper base with targeted digital Facebook ads and expanded print media in conjunction with its healthy growing campaign.
And this month's -- month, we're launching Mark West Black to take further advantage of the pinot noir craze. 
Overall, we experienced depletion trends of more than 6% for our focus brands during the second quarter, which demonstrates that this strategy is paying off. 
We've also taken some exciting steps towards our goal of developing new brands that have potential to win big with consumers. 
The newest wine brand in the portfolio, Tom Gore, is named for Tom, a second generation grape farmer, who has a passion for cultivating fruit with exceptional flavor and quality from its vines. This brand resonates with consumer's search for authenticity of the origin ingredients and people involved in what they eat and drink, and we are very pleased with its preliminary results.
During the quarter, our spirits portfolio experienced excellent net sales growth of 19% at solid depletion growth across the portfolio, driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and the success of its peach flavor offering as well as SVEDKA Vodka, led by its hit flavors, mango pineapple, strawberry lemonade and grapefruit jalapeño.
Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectations so far this year with continuing share gains after particularly strong depletion growth during Cinco de Mayo. And we continue to make focus Casa Noble marketing investments in 4 key local markets: LA, New York, Chicago and Texas where activation programs include tasting, cocktail features and collaboration with our beer portfolio for local events. 
Print ads targeting millennial consumers are also running in regional publications. This quarter, we launched the national rollout of SERPENT'S BITE, a bold whiskey infused with apple cider flavors. This product targets the intersection of 3 of the hottest trends in alcoholic beverages: Flavored whiskey, hard cider and the shot occasion. Though it is too early to comment on long-term expectations for this brand, our retailer and consumer feedback has been very positive, and we are pleased with what has been a fantastic start to the development of this brand. 
As we head into the key holiday seasons for our wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our focus brands. Our expectation is that you should see improving depletion trends as we progress throughout the remainder of the year.
As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 80% complete and is expected to be completely finished by mid-October.
The current California industry estimate is for total harvest yield of 3.6 million to 3.8 million tons versus approximately 4 million tons last year.  While the crop is down this year versus last, quality looks to be very good with excellent color and flavors and our winemakers are smiling. 
From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect great pricing to be flat to down slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location and demand with the exception of Cabernet, which continues to be in high demand.
In closing, we are at the halfway point in the year, and I am very gratified with our impressive results so far this year.
We are working diligently on the Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business.
And within our wine and spirits business, we are making good progress overall, and I believe we are well positioned to drive our great portfolio of brands during the upcoming holiday selling season.
This December marks the 70th anniversary of our company's founding. We are proud of our heritage and look forward to positioning our company for the next 70 years of living our vision to elevate life with every glass raised.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our second quarter results."
258589,311179290,875157,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2015",2015-10-07,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with some Q2 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 41%.

Let's start with some Q2 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 41%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results during the key summer selling season.
The strong beer performance along with some favorability in our interest expense are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.20 to a range of $5 to $5.20 per share for fiscal '16.
The beer performance, along with lower than previously expected payments for taxes and interests, are also helping to push our fiscal '16 free cash flow projection up $100 million to a range of $200 million to $300 million.
And our glass plants and brewery expansion activities continue to progress as planned as we are positioned to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of additional capacity online during the second half of fiscal '16.
We'll take a closer look at our Q2 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.
Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 9% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 14% on volume growth of 13%.
As a reminder, during Q2 fiscal '15, we estimated that beer recall activities resulted in the reversal of approximately 2 million case shipments to wholesalers and a $37 million reduction in net sales.
If you adjust last year's second quarter for the impact of this activity, volume growth in this year's second quarter would have been closer to 9% and net sales growth closer to 10%. 
We replenished the Q2 fiscal '15 recall volume with shipments to wholesalers during the third quarter of fiscal '15.
In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of last year to bring inventory more in line with historical levels.
As a result of these activities, we will be facing a difficult beer sales and EBIT growth comparison for Q3 fiscal '16.
Beer sales growth for the first half of fiscal 2016 totaled 13%. However, the difficult third quarter comparison is a primary driver of why we continue to expect full year fiscal '16 beer net sales growth to approximate 10%. We continue to expect solid third quarter depletion growth.
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects higher spirits shipment volume. 
For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $93 million, up 13%, with gross margin increasing 220 basis points.
Beer gross profit increased $89 million, primarily due to volume growth, lower COGS and favorable pricing, and our beer gross profit margin increased 310 basis points to 48.4%.
Wine and spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and COGS benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.
Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 41.6%. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $5 million. 
Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $88 million and consolidated operating margin improved 320 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 450 basis points.
This improvement reflects the gross profits benefit that I just highlighted, plus favorability and marketing spend on a per case basis for the quarter.
The marketing spend benefit is timing related as we expect to see higher marketing spend during Q3 and for the full year.
Wine and spirits operating margin improved 90 basis points, primarily due to the gross profit benefits discussed earlier.
Interest expense for the quarter was $77 million, down 9%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates.
At the end of August, our total debt was $7.4 billion. And factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.1 billion, a decrease of $144 million since the end of fiscal 2015. 
This activity primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition.
We now expect interest expense for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million.
The improvement in this target reflects favorability in short term interest rates and timing of our CapEx spend versus our original plan.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 24.6% and compares to a 32.3% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. 
We still expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%. 
As a result, we expect our tax rate for the second half of the year to run above our projected full year rates. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
For the first half of fiscal '16, we generated $508 million of free cash flow compared to $360 million for the same period last year. 
Operating cash flow totaled $803 million versus $668 million for the prior year period.
This increase was primarily due to the higher earnings generated by the beer business. 
Given higher projected earnings for the beer business and lower projected tax and interest payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal '16.
CapEx for the first half of fiscal '16 totaled $295 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending during the same time frame last year.
Our brewery expansion activities continued to progress as planned, but we have seen some shifting in the timing of our CapEx with the higher level of spending expected to come in the second half of the year.
Overall, we are still targeting CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer.
Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal '16 free cash flow to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million.
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook.
As discussed earlier, due to continued strong results for our beer business and lower-than-expected interest expense, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $5 to $5.20 per share versus our previous $4.80 to $5 range.
The beer business continues to target mid- to high single-digit volume growth and net sales growth of approximately 10%. 
As a reminder, fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to historical levels. 
As a result, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth rate to be in the high single-digit range and above the shipment growth rate of mid- to high single digits. 
We're currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits along with better than expected glass plant performance that are helping to drive improved operational results. Therefore we now expect the beer business to generate 15% to 18% operating income growth. This guidance has us targeting at beer operating margin of approximately 34% for fiscal '16.
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range before any benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. 
While we anticipate improving depletion trends in the second half of fiscal '16, we expect to see most of the wine and spirits sales growth to be driven in Q4 versus Q3 due to shipment timing and comparisons versus the second half of fiscal '15.
Our fiscal '16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our results for the first half of the year and our projected sales, earnings and operating cash flow growth for the full year of fiscal '16.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

And then to your question, the answer is basically yes, as to what you have described the strategy is definitely about not worrying too much about the nonstrategic part of the portfolio, which is subpremium. And we are -- we did take some pricing very successfully this year in that part of the portfolio. And we are reinvesting against, as I mentioned in my script, a smaller subset of our focus brands. And we think that sort of that mix of activity will drive stronger overall results, which I believe that it is and I believe that it will.

There seems to be a positive effect when we have Corona on draft on the on premise and then our off-premise sales in the area. So the test is positive but at the same time, Corona is our, by far, most important brand and we're going to be very thoughtful about how we proceed basically with anything new with that brand. So good news is the brand's performing better than ever right now or at least, as it relates to shorter term history. So again, beer business is extremely strong."

Well, Judy, we basically -- our guidance has called out a high single digit for beer depletion performance and obviously, we're outperforming that at 10%. So I would say that our beer depletion performance exceeds our expectations but realizing that we have some -- continue to have tough overlaps in terms of strong growth last year, too. I mean, we can only be relatively cautious as to the kind of growth that we're willing to predict. So hey, I hope we far exceed those numbers but I think that high single digit remains -- depletion growth remains a good estimate. We do have some pricing that we're taking right now in the marketplace, in the 1% to 2% range liked we've talked about historically. While we feel that the brand is in an extremely strong position to take that pricing, it's not as if it will have 0 impact on depletion growth. And then in terms of IRI and the disconnect, I think that IRI only measures about half of the business, the half that it doesn't measure is the half that's not necessarily industry-wide performing very well, like the on premise for instance and liquor stores and as an example that are the more sluggish part of the industry. That said, we're performing, of course, better than anybody else in those channels. But those channels are not the highest performing channels, whereas, the IRI channels, being grocery and convenience, are some of the strongest channels at the current time.

So we -- the joint venture team on the ground in Nava as well as our partners at Owens-Illinois have done an outstanding job of smoothly getting our furnace at Nava functioning well. So as a result of that, we're seeing better profit performance from the joint venture.

And I would say based upon our volume growth numbers that we demonstrated this quarter and for the last while, we will be spending the capital on a greenfield sooner than later because it's going to take 4 years to build out another brewery. And with these kind of growth rates, we will need it to keep up with capacity. I think to then answer your question on share repurchases, again, we're going to evaluate our circumstances as we go forward, and depending upon the capital requirements and our leverage ratio and understanding the requirements from our dividend, we'll then consider share repurchases.

And that's what we're doing. So the strategy really hasn't changed. I mean, like every other business, we've got costs to cover, and our brands are strong enough to bear that kind of pricing. If there's any change in our strategy, I would say that the marketplace is changing somewhat in terms of sort of the makeup of the types of products that are out there. The market -- I mean, the industry is definitively premium-izing while volume remains sort of flat so that there's a shift internally towards more premium products. And I would say that, that probably has given us the opportunity to be less focused on what's going on with competitive products and to be more focused on what do we think is good for our brand and what do we think will work and won't work. So we continue to be very strategic in our pricing. We're doing it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. Our guidance, nevertheless, hasn't changed. We're still looking at the 1% to 2% range. And you can call it leading or not leading. We're sort of, I'll say, marching to our own beat as opposed to too worried about what some of our competitors are doing overall. And that's sort of up to them. And we'll do what we think the market will bear for our brands and what's good for the health of our brands. So in some cases that will mean that we will lead pricing. But as I said, the market's changed. It's premium-izing. 10% of the industry now is craft, selling at very high prices, right? And the other 10% of the market is basically us. And those are the 2 segments, that 20%, obviously, taking share from the other 80%. So things are a little different out there than they have been in the past."

I think that we've seen a shift somewhat at least in the growth from cans to bottles. The can is only slightly priced less than the bottle. It's really almost irrelevant, the pricing difference. Interestingly enough, cans have -- in general, taken out a very premium image, so it's becoming the package of choice in the crafted segment of the market so the whole view towards cans in general, I would say, is shifting quite significantly from a consumer perspective. So we don't see any difficulties in marketing the cans and the bottles together, like everybody else does markets cans and bottles. So that's not a particularly unique aspect of our Modelo Especial business, which as we said earlier, is actually growing more than it ever has on an incredibly large base. So the strength of that brand is phenomenal at this stage without it really having fully transitioned to a general market product. And it is transitioning to a general market product. Again, with our own help as we've turned on general market TV advertising, which has been very successful, and we know that there is huge room for distribution growth in that brand. And you will see it. You will see it as we continue to move forward and execute with that brand. You'll see the ACV continue to go up. That's simply going to be the case as we believe quite strongly at the current time. So the cans are strong, the bottles are strong. It's following the same pattern as many brands that have become major brands, and Corona is probably the best example of that."

I know it's very hypothetical and speculative, but if Heineken were to be involved in any way in the future with MillerCoors or [indiscernible], there could be some changes there on the wholesaler level, right? I will assume that they would want the MillerCoors wholesalers to carry their portfolio of Mexican brands. Of course, the wholesalers will have their own say and your business is much larger. But is there a risk there, #1. And the second question would be, in terms of your volume in the U.S., at the wholesaler level, what percentage would overlap with the Femsa brands?

I would say that, that is totally irrelevant to us. The Femsa brands are small, okay? And in terms of growth, they have some growth in their Dosekis [ph] brand, which is less than half the size for instance of Modelo Especial and the growth has slowed down. And Ducale, I think, is in negative territory, and they've had some growth with Ducale Light which basically sells at the domestic premium price point. So we don't really view that as particularly strong competition. And we don't really care whether they're in MillerCoors or ABI or frankly where they go because we don't focus on that portfolio very much. And Heineken's a whole different animal, obviously, that I think is competing with a different consumer base in general than our Mexican portfolio. So again, it's not something that we really focus on. And in general, our modus operandi is to worry more about our portfolio and the opportunities there, and execution is going to be the key on our portfolio in the future, which is going to be about taking advantage of distribution opportunities and basically increasing the number of SKUs per account. I mean, that's really what we -- where the opportunity lies for us because we actually generate a huge amount of growth for ourselves and our retailers with a relatively small amount of shelf presence, and we're under skewed given our velocity and our dollar volume at retail. So there's just a big opportunity there for us and our retailers. Our retailers are -- and should be interested in increasing their sales and margin per unit space of shelf space. That's what they're all about, and probably their biggest opportunity to do that and to get dollar sales, turns and even more importantly, margin, is through increased SKU and shelf space for our portfolio. So -- and when we talk to retailers about that, I think they realize it because the statistics are just overwhelming for them as a way to increase their profitability. So building our SKU count per retail account is going to be one of our primary focuses going forward."

O",2107,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's second quarter 2016 sales and earnings results. I am very pleased with our excellent quarterly results. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year, and we continue to progress as planned with our Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions.
Let's drag right into the commercial and operational results we saw this quarter for our beer business. During the second quarter, the beer business generated double-digit depletion growth, driven by exceptional consumer demand for our products across the beer portfolio. In fact, the second quarter marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of volume market share growth for our beer portfolio. Constellation beers represented 45% of total U.S. beer industry volume growth during the quarter, as all of our beer brands grew across most channels and package sizes.
Excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season with the 120 Days of Summer marketing campaign drove market share gains during the Fourth of July, which continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial.
Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion and consumer takeaway trends during the summer months, driven by continuing velocity, growth and distribution gains, including the can launch and ongoing investments in media and merchandising with the new Always Summer marketing campaign.
The new Corona cans continued to expand consumption occasions for the brand and are a hit with consumers. Cans represented more than 40% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. 
Throughout the summer, we dedicated significant media support behind the can launch with English- and Spanish-language TV and digital advertising, especially during the July 4th and Labor Day holidays.
We see great opportunity with this format as it currently represents only about 5% of total Corona Extra volume.
Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the second quarter, driven by continuing velocity and distribution gains.
The brands increased media investments, including the continuation of Modelo Especial's national English-language TV and video campaign, continued throughout the summer months, reaching the general market and bicultural Hispanic beer drinkers through targeted entertainment and sports programming.
National Hispanic media included the Gold Cup broadcast sponsorship on Univision throughout the month of July, including in-game advertising and sponsorships.
Corona Light continued to gain share with all core Corona Light packages posting growth during the quarter. 3 new brand TV spots were showcased on national TV throughout the summer and the brand sponsored Kenny Chesney tour continued with 29 tour dates from June through August.
For the remainder of the year, we have solid marketing programs in place in order to maintain the excellent brand momentum we are experiencing across the portfolio.
For Corona Extra, the football season continues to grow in importance through our returning partnership with Coach Jon Gruden and maintenance of key investments with the NFL, the #1 program on TV.
Boxing also remains a priority with Corona Extra through an integrated marketing plan to support highly anticipated fights.
The momentum of the Corona can format will be supported through general market and Hispanic TV support into the fall football tailgating season. And you should expect to see our iconic Corona Feliz TV spot leading into Thanksgiving holiday, which will be accompanied by robust on and off-premise promotional programs designed to drive brand affinity for Corona during the holiday season.
For Modelo Especial, we have added 6 weeks of live TV sports program on national English-language TV during the start of the NFL season across CBS, FOX, ESPN and ESPN2.
National Hispanic media will also continue for Modelo Especial with the weekly TV exposure to Spanish-language consumers.
Before moving on to a discussion of our beer operations, I am pleased to announce today that we are launching our new Tocayo Hominy White Ale, a craft Belgium-style wheat beer inspired by the culture and flavors of Mexico. The idea for this new beer brand was developed by our beer team working in conjunction with Chef Rick Bayless. It will be available beginning next week at several of the Rick Bayless' Chicago Frontera restaurants and other key Chicago area on premise accounts.
Our beer operations continue to run smoothly. The brewery and glass plant expansions are proceeding as planned. All key performance metrics related to cost, quality, capacity utilization and service are better than target this quarter.
New bottling lines are currently being commissioned and will become fully operational by year-end. Support for the expansion such as cogeneration, wastewater, engine room and fire protection are all on schedule. Work continues on the next expansion phase as we increase production capability from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capabilities around the site.
Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for 2016.
We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the 15% to 18% range, which is expected to drive an enhanced operating margin of approximately 34% for the segment in fiscal 2016 versus our previous margin estimate of 33%.
While we are currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits, which combined are the most significant drivers of the revised beer margin for fiscal 2016. We have also experienced better-than-planned operational results driven by our glass plant performance.
We are on track to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of capacity online at Nava by calendar year-end. Once this capacity is operational, we will be positioned to bring the next 5 million hectoliters into service by next summer.
Upon completion of these 10 million hectoliter expansion, the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI for finished goods will no longer be required as we will be fully self sufficient from a supply perspective to fulfill our needs for the U.S. market.
We expect to receive the full benefits of our targeted mid-30% operating margin goal on a more sustainable basis once we are fully operational at 20 million hectoliters at Nava.
Longer-term margin target, we will still have much to accomplish. I would like to remind everybody that the 5 million hectoliters of capacity that will increase Nava capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters is expected to be completed by calendar 2017.
Finally, given the continued strength of our beer business, we continue to make progress in evaluating plans for our future capacity needs beyond 25 million hectoliters. And we will have more to say as we finalize our plans in coming months.
And now I would like to discuss the business results for our wine and spirits business. In the wine and spirits business during the second quarter, we achieved earnings growth and solid margin expansion while delivering strong spirits performance and excellent overall results for our Canadian business. 
In the U.S., our net sales are benefiting from positive mix trends, and we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market.
We have successfully integrated our new Meiomi wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and are working to expand distribution to drive incremental growth for this brand.
The most recent 4-week IRI trends show that Meiomi is growing more than 80% in multi-outlet and convenience channels, which is contributing to the fact that our premium plus dollar growth improved in recent periods.
Throughout the quarter, our focused investments within wine and spirits could be seen in the marketplace. 
As a reminder, we are concentrating our investments and our resources on a key subset of our focus brands because we believe they have the right combination of scale, higher margins and growth potential to drive our overall business results.
Let's talk about a few examples of these programs. Our TV advertising for Woodbridge aired over the summer and helped to drive strong IRI growth for this brand during this time frame. This program will rev up again in advance of our winter holiday selling season.
Our Kim Crawford brand is the unrivaled leader of the New Zealand category with its distinct flavor profile and undue [ph] ordinary marketing platform.
This summer, it kicked off its exclusive national campaign with Cirque du Soleil and executed promotional programs with co-branded advertising offer, sweepstakes and sampling events. 
Kim Crawford posted dollar growth of more than 30% in the recent IRI periods.
Mark West, America's #1 pinot noir and 5-time consecutive winner of Impact's Hot Brand Award, is harnessing the power of its unique majority male shopper base with targeted digital Facebook ads and expanded print media in conjunction with its Healthy Grilling campaign.
And this month's -- month, we're launching Mark West Black to take further advantage of the pinot noir craze. 
Overall, we experienced depletion trends of more than 6% for our focus brands during the second quarter, which demonstrates that this strategy is paying off. 
We've also taken some exciting steps towards our goal of developing new brands that have potential to win big with consumers. 
The newest wine brand in the portfolio, Tom Gore, is named for Tom, a second generation grape farmer, who has a passion for cultivating fruit with exceptional flavor and quality from his vines. This brand resonates with consumer's search for authenticity of the origin ingredients and people involved in what they eat and drink, and we are very pleased with its preliminary results.
During the quarter, our spirits portfolio experienced excellent net sales growth of 19% and solid depletion growth across the portfolio, driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and the success of its peach flavor offering as well as SVEDKA Vodka, led by its hit flavors, mango pineapple, strawberry lemonade and grapefruit jalapeño.
Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectations so far this year with continuing share gains after particularly strong depletion growth during Cinco de Mayo. And we continue to make focused Casa Noble marketing investments in 4 key local markets: LA, New York, Chicago and Texas where activation programs include tasting, cocktail features and collaboration with our beer portfolio for local events. 
Print ads targeting millennial consumers are also running in regional publications. This quarter, we launched the national rollout of SERPENT'S BITE, a bold whiskey infused with apple cider flavors. This product targets the intersection of 3 of the hottest trends in alcoholic beverages: Flavored whiskey, hard cider and the shot occasion. Though it is too early to comment on long-term expectations for this brand, our retailer and consumer feedback has been very positive, and we are pleased with what has been a fantastic start to the development of this brand. 
As we head into the key holiday seasons for our wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our focus brands. Our expectation is that you should see improving depletion trends as we progress throughout the remainder of the year.
As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 80% complete and is expected to be completely finished by mid-October.
The current California industry estimate is for a total harvest yield of 3.6 million to 3.8 million tons versus approximately 4 million tons last year.  While the crop is down this year versus last, quality looks to be very good with excellent color and flavors and our winemakers are smiling. 
From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect grape pricing to be flat to down slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location and demand with the exception of Cabernet, which continues to be in high demand.
In closing, we are at the halfway point in the year, and I am very gratified with our impressive results so far this year.
We are working diligently on the Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business.
And within our wine and spirits business, we are making good progress overall, and I believe we are well positioned to drive our great portfolio of brands during the upcoming holiday selling season.
This December marks the 70th anniversary of our company's founding. We are proud of our heritage and look forward to positioning our company for the next 70 years of living our vision to elevate life with every glass raised.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our second quarter results."
258589,311179290,875221,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2015",2015-10-07,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with some Q2 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 41%.

Let's start with some Q2 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 41%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results during the key summer selling season.
The strong beer performance along with some favorability in our interest expense are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.20 to a range of $5 to $5.20 per share for fiscal '16.
The beer performance, along with lower than previously expected payments for taxes and interests, are also helping to push our fiscal '16 free cash flow projection up $100 million to a range of $200 million to $300 million.
And our glass plant and brewery expansion activities continue to progress as planned as we are positioned to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of additional capacity online during the second half of fiscal '16.
Let's take a closer look at our Q2 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.
Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 9% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 14% on volume growth of 13%.
As a reminder, during Q2 fiscal '15, we estimated that beer recall activities resulted in the reversal of approximately 2 million case shipments to wholesalers and a $37 million reduction in net sales.
If you adjust last year's second quarter for the impact of this activity, volume growth in this year's second quarter would have been closer to 9% and net sales growth closer to 10%. 
We replenished the Q2 fiscal '15 recall volume with shipments to wholesalers during the third quarter of fiscal '15.
In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of last year to bring inventory more in line with historical levels.
As a result of these activities, we will be facing a difficult beer sales and EBIT growth comparison for Q3 fiscal '16.
Beer sales growth for the first half of fiscal 2016 totaled 13%. However, the difficult third quarter comparison is a primary driver of why we continue to expect full year fiscal '16 beer net sales growth to approximate 10%. We continue to expect solid third quarter depletion growth.
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects higher spirits shipment volume. 
For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $93 million, up 13%, with gross margin increasing 220 basis points.
Beer gross profit increased $89 million, primarily due to volume growth, lower COGS and favorable pricing, and our beer gross profit margin increased 310 basis points to 48.4%.
Wine and spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and COGS benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.
Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 41.6%. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $5 million. 
Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $88 million and consolidated operating margin improved 320 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 450 basis points.
This improvement reflects the gross profit benefits that I just highlighted, plus favorability in marketing spend on a per case basis for the quarter.
The marketing spend benefit is timing related as we expect to see higher marketing spend during Q3 and for the full year.
Wine and spirits operating margin improved 90 basis points, primarily due to the gross profit benefits discussed earlier.
Interest expense for the quarter was $77 million, down 9%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates.
At the end of August, our total debt was $7.4 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.1 billion, a decrease of $144 million since the end of fiscal 2015. 
This activity primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition.
We now expect interest expense for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million.
The improvement in this target reflects favorability in short term interest rates and timing of our CapEx spend versus our original plan.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 24.6% and compares to a 32.3% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. 
We still expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%. 
As a result, we expect our tax rate for the second half of the year to run above our projected full year rate. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
For the first half of fiscal '16, we generated $508 million of free cash flow compared to $360 million for the same period last year. 
Operating cash flow totaled $803 million versus $668 million for the prior year period.
This increase was primarily due to the higher earnings generated by the beer business. 
Given higher projected earnings for the beer business and lower projected tax and interest payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal '16.
CapEx for the first half of fiscal '16 totaled $295 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending during the same time frame last year.
Our brewery expansion activities continue to progress as planned, but we have seen some shifting in the timing of our CapEx with a higher level of spending expected to come in the second half of the year.
Overall, we are still targeting CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer.
Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal '16 free cash flow to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million.
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook.
As discussed earlier, due to continued strong results for our beer business and lower-than-expected interest expense, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $5 to $5.20 per share versus our previous $4.80 to $5 range.
The beer business continues to target mid- to high single-digit volume growth and net sales growth of approximately 10%. 
As a reminder, fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to historical levels. 
As a result, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth rate to be in the high single-digit range and above the shipment growth rate of mid- to high single digits. 
We're currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits along with better than expected glass plant performance that are helping to drive improved operational results. Therefore we now expect the beer business to generate 15% to 18% operating income growth. This guidance has us targeting a beer operating margin of approximately 34% for fiscal '16.
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range before any benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. 
While we anticipate improving depletion trends in the second half of fiscal '16, we expect to see most of the wine and spirits sales growth to be driven in Q4 versus Q3 due to shipment timing and comparisons versus the second half of fiscal '15.
Our fiscal '16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our results for the first half of the year and our projected sales, earnings and operating cash flow growth for the full year of fiscal '16.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

And then to your question, the answer is basically yes, as to what you have described the strategy is definitely about not worrying too much about the nonstrategic part of the portfolio, which is the subpremium. And we are -- we did take some pricing very successfully this year in that part of the portfolio. And we are reinvesting against, as I mentioned in my script, a smaller subset of our focus brands. And we think that sort of that mix of activity will drive stronger overall results, which I believe that it is and I believe that it will.

There seems to be a positive effect when we have Corona on draft on the on premise and then our off-premise sales in the area. So the test is positive but at the same time, Corona is our, by far, most important brand and we're going to be very thoughtful about how we proceed basically with anything new with that brand. So good news is the brand's performing better than ever right now or at least, as it relates to shorter term history. So again, beer business is extremely strong."

Well, Judy, we basically -- our guidance has called out a high single digit for beer depletion performance and obviously, we're outperforming that at 10%. So I would say that our beer depletion performance exceeds our expectation,s, but realizing that we have some -- continue to have tough overlaps in terms of strong growth last year, too. I mean, we can only be relatively cautious as to the kind of growth that we're willing to predict. So hey, I hope we far exceed those numbers, but I think that high single digit remains -- depletion growth remains a good estimate. We do have some pricing that we're taking right now in the marketplace, in the 1% to 2% range liked we've talked about historically. While we feel that the brand is in an extremely strong position to take that pricing, it's not as if it will have 0 impact on depletion growth. And then in terms of IRI and the disconnect, I think that IRI only measures about half of the business, the half that it doesn't measure is the half that's not necessarily industry-wide performing very well, like the on premise for instance and liquor stores, as an example, that are the more sluggish part of the industry. That said, we're performing, of course, better than anybody else in those channels. But those channels are not the highest performing channels, whereas, the IRI channels, being grocery and convenience, are some of the strongest channels at the current time. So I'd say that's where the disconnect is."

So we -- the joint venture team on the ground in Nava as well as our partners at Owens-Illinois have done an outstanding job of smoothly getting our furnace at Nava functioning well. So as a result of that, we're seeing better profit performance from the joint venture.

And that's what we're doing. So the strategy really hasn't changed. I mean, like every other business, we've got costs to cover, and our brands are strong enough to bear that kind of pricing. If there's any change in our strategy, I would say that the marketplace is changing somewhat in terms of sort of the makeup of the types of products that are out there. The market -- I mean, the industry is definitively premium-izing while volume remains sort of flat so that there's a shift internally towards more premium products. And I would say that, that probably has given us the opportunity to be less focused on what's going on with competitive products and to be more focused on what do we think is good for our brand and what do we think will work and won't work. So we continue to be very strategic in our pricing. We're doing it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. Our guidance, nevertheless, hasn't changed. We're still looking at the 1% to 2% range. And you can call it leading or not leading. We're sort of, I'll say, marching to our own beat as opposed to too worried about what some of our competitors are doing overall. And that's sort of up to them. And we'll do what we think the market will bear for our brands and what's good for the health of our brands. So in some cases that will mean that we will lead pricing. But as I said, the market's changed. It's premium-izing. 10% of the industry now is craft, selling at very high prices, right? And the other 10% of the market is basically us. And those are the 2 segments, that 20% is, obviously, taking share from the other 80%. So things are a little different out there than they have been in the past."

The first point is that to me, the brand, the bottle and the can are really totally different products. It's a different demographic, it's a different price point and obviously, it's a different packaging. And I'm just trying to understand how can that work in the long term? The person buying the cheap Modelo Especial can is very different from the one that you're advertising in True Detective [ph] for the bottle. And the second question, which is related to this also. Obviously, Modelo Especial is driving the growth, and you provided ACVs for cans and bottles. Can you give some color in terms of what's the growth in bottles, what's the growth in cans? I understand the bottles are starting from a lower base. But the reason why I ask the question is that when you say 65% ACV for Modelo Especial, I'm not so sure there's a big market for Modelo Especial in states like Alabama or South Carolina. So perhaps your ACV has already capped on Modelo Especial on the cans or maybe not. I mean, obviously, given the growth rate, it hasn't. But just give some color there. I find the brand is a fascinating brand worth a business full case study, but it has its own challenges because of the way the cans and the bottles are marketed."

To address your -- the can versus bottle component, we had depletions year-to-date on cans that are 12-ish percent on the can part of the portfolio, and then bottles, it's -- we were in the high 20% growth rate from a depletion standpoint. So we're seeing growth coming across the spectrum of offerings on Modelo Especial."

I think that we've seen a shift somewhat at least in the growth from cans to bottles. The can is only slightly priced less than the bottle. It's really almost irrelevant, the pricing difference. Interestingly enough, cans have, in general, taken on a very premium image, since it's becoming the package of choice in the crafted segment of the market so the whole view towards cans in general, I would say, is shifting quite significantly from a consumer perspective. So we don't see any difficulties in marketing the cans and the bottles together, like everybody else does markets cans and bottles. So that's not a particularly unique aspect of our Modelo Especial business, which as we said earlier, is actually growing more than it ever has on an incredibly large base. So the strength of that brand is phenomenal at this stage without it really having fully transitioned to a general market product. And it is transitioning to a general market product. Again, with our own help as we've turned on general market TV advertising, which has been very successful. And we know that there is huge room for distribution growth in that brand and you will see it. You will see it as we continue to move forward and execute with that brand. You'll see the ACV continue to go up. That's simply going to be the case as we believe quite strongly at the current time. So the cans are strong, the bottles are strong. It's following the same pattern as many brands that have become major brands, and Corona is probably the best example of that."

With all this talk about the Anheuser-Busch InBev/SABMiller transaction, if it happens. If I recall, about 65% of your volumes in the U.S. go through MillerCoors wholesalers. Obviously, they are independent, the balance mostly Anheuser-Busch InBev. I know it's very hypothetical and speculative, but if Heineken were to be involved in any way in the future with MillerCoors and/or Molsen Coors, there could be some changes there at the wholesaler level, right? I will assume that they would want the MillerCoors wholesalers to carry their portfolio of Mexican brands. Of course, the wholesalers will have their own say and your business is much larger. But is there a risk there, #1. And the second question would be, in terms of your volume in the U.S., at the wholesaler level, what percentage would overlap with the Femsa brands? Or pretty much wholesalers that carry your brands don't carry the Femsa brands. And sorry about the detail there."

I would say that, that is totally irrelevant to us. The Femsa brands are small, okay? And in terms of growth, they have some growth in their Dos Equis brand, which is less than half the size for instance of Modelo Especial and the growth has slowed down. And Tecate, I think, is in negative territory, and they've had some growth in Tecate Light which basically sells at the domestic premium price point. So we don't really view that as particularly strong competition. And we don't really care whether they're in MillerCoors or ABI or frankly where they go because we don't focus on that portfolio very much. And Heineken's a whole different animal, obviously, that I think is competing with a different consumer base in general than our Mexican portfolio. So again, it's not something that we really focus on. And in general, our modus operandi is to worry more about our portfolio and the opportunities there, and execution is going to be the key on our portfolio in the future, which is going to be about taking advantage of distribution opportunities and basically increasing the number of SKUs per account. I mean, that's really what we -- where the opportunity lies for us because we actually generate a huge amount of growth for ourselves and our retailers with a relatively small amount of shelf presence, and we're under skewed given our velocity and our dollar volume at retail. So there's just a big opportunity there for us and our retailers. Our retailers are -- and should be interested in increasing their sales and margin per unit space of shelf space. That's what they're all about, and probably their biggest opportunity to do that and to get dollar sales, turns and even more importantly, margin, is through increased SKU and shelf space for our portfolio. So -- and when we talk to retailers about that, I think they realize it because the statistics are just overwhelming for them as a way to increase their profitability. So building our SKU count per retail account is going to be one of our primary focuses going forward."
