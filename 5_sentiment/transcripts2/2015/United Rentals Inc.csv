It was a great year for us and we think another strong year in 2015. Our message today is about progress, discipline and consistency. These fourth quarter calls tend to frame the year-end as a heart stop reality, our performance is continuum, and that's especially true this year when we went into 2015 with so much momentum.
Now I'll talk about it in a minute but first, I want to give you the last 12 months that are due because we turned in some outstanding results. Our rates were up 4.5%, in line with our guidance. 2014 was the fourth straight year we moved rates higher and we still opportunity for improvement.
We have record time utilization of 68.8% for the full year. And our return on invested capital was also a record of 8.8%.
Together, they helped drive more than $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA on rental revenue growth outpaced industry growth by nearly 2 to 1. And our free cash flow was a homerun for the year. This was due in part to the use of margin of 48.5%, another indication of the ongoing recovery.
When we set $1.7 billion on fleet. And as you saw last night, our CapEx plan for 2015 is approximately the same with even higher expectations for free cash flow.
Not only do we meat or beat every target in our outlook, we did it while making fundamental improvements in the way we operate. Take safe different example. In 2014, we had the fewest number of recordable injuries in our industry. And we drove our full-year recordable rate down below 1.0 for the first time.
It was the ninth consecutive year of safety improvement for us. So clearly, it's not just a flu, it's a progressive change for the better in our culture.
Especially rentals was another great story. We grew our specialty segment very effectively last year, with a disciplined mix of M&A, starts, new fleet, and cross-selling. Our full year revenue gain in specialty, which includes the acquisition of National Pump in April was approximately 83% on a gross margin of almost 51%. That's nearly 400 basis points higher than the prior year. And our fourth quarter margin for his specialty was up nearly 500 basis points.
Company-wide, all but 1 of our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth for the quarter, with more than half of the regions showing double-digit growth. And we had a very solid increase in key account revenue, up 16% year-over-year. Financial accounts, which is a subset of our Key Accounts, grew by more than 18%. So from every perspective, very strong year.
We demanded a lot from ourselves in 2014 and I'm happy to say that we outperformed our own expectations. 
Let's talk about this year. I'm going to start by acknowledging the concerns out there about the effect of oil prices in our industry. Look, we're not running this business with bright colored glasses, and we don't plan to be caught by surprise. We've dug deep into this issue and while we haven't seen any significant attrition to date, we do expect some impact as rig counts come down. Now we're constantly pulling the field, not just to measure Upstream oil activity but possibly to gauge any knock on effect. And we did a lot of detailed analysis based on conservative assumptions to identify our exposure. And Bill is going to share some of those numbers with you in a moment.
But I could tell where they came out. Yes, we think oil prices will reduce demand for certain types of equipment in a handful of various. But we disagree very strongly with the idea that our growth is at risk.
And I'll give you 5 good reasons why we feel this way. First, Upstream oil and gas accounts for only 6% of our business company-wide. That's a very mild exposure given our fleet can be utilized on other types of customers. Given in the battlefield states, or state of Texas, we've got deep customer relationships outside of oil. Currently, more than 80% of our rig rental revenue in Texas comes from infrastructure, manufacturing, transportation, commercial building and a host of other industries. Second, we have strong systems in place for fleet management, including the relocation of equipment and a repurposing of CapEx for used sales. As circumstances change dramatically, we have the flexibility to reduce our CapEx spend for the year. We've done this before when warranted and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again.
Third, we believe that any a drag on demand for Upstream oil will be mitigated by the positive effect on other industries. Take chemical manufacturing, 1 of our key sectors. When oil prices decline, manufacturing costs drop, production is stimulated and consumer purchasing power increases. The current growth rates of the U.S. chemical industry is forecast to accelerate to at least 2016. This is just the 1 of many examples.
Fourth, our geography plays to our advantage. Our Upstream oil exposure just a fraction of our footprint in any meaningful way. Now keep in mind we serve 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces. That gives us a lot of room to deploy our assets. The reality is you've been asking us for significantly more CapEx than we spent for a few years. And we've been very disciplined in reigning in that number. So if we decided to move fleet due to localized weakness, we have the branches that are eager to take it.
And fifth, we know how to outperform our end markets, as well as our industry. We've shown you that for years. 2014, our 15% rental revenue growth is more than 3x the year-over-year growth in non-res construction to November. Thanks, in part to secular penetration. And it was nearly twice the revenue growth of our industry overall.
Not only is there's still a lot of runway ahead in the industry up-cycle, the macroeconomics is also trending in our favor. Many economists predict U.S. GDP growth will be in the range of 3% to 3.3% for 2015 with lower unemployment, more consumer spending on goods and services and return to housing starts.
And to the degree that any uncertainty still remains in our end markets, that actually works in our favor because we offer on alternative to large capital outlays. So when global insight forecast nearly 8% rental industry growth for North America in 2015 and with more growth to follow in 2016, which they did on Sunday, you can take that as a starting point. But be assured we have bigger plans.
Bottom line, this recovery has already had a share of bumps and we think oil prices will be another bump. Given our scale and diversification, we do not see this as a roadblock. In fact we think the bigger picture is that low oil prices could have a significant upside for us over time.
And more immediately, we'll keep moving forward and better-than-expected fourth quarter by making recipient investments to capture a profitable oil business. I've already mentioned that our specialty group is on a fast track. Power & HVAC in particular turned in a standout performance, with 27% same-store growth and a 61% increase in revenue overall all in 2014.
For 2015, we've earmarked $170 million or about 30% of our growth rental CapEx to meet the increasing demand for our specialty fleet. And we plan to open at least 16 new branches [indiscernible]for all of our specialty lines, Power & HVAC, Trench Safety, Pumps and Tools.
Our growth in specialty also reflects cross-selling to our broader operations where we've seen good diversity in large projects. For example, our central U.S. districts are predicting a big year for the wide range of projects underway with start dates in the next few months. This includes health care, education, hydropower, renewables, bio research and transportation to name a few.
Further West, we've got equipment on mega sites like LAX and acute major project work lined up in the Southeast, our mixed-use developments, sports arenas, theme parks and airports.
And the Northeast, our customers in high-growth verticals are hungry to up any fleet that comes available, typical many of our regions. Now I'll give you essential insight into our thinking in 2015. Our outlook is positive because the facts support it. We like what we see. We like what we hear from our customers and every indication is that the equipment rental is going to look at the multi-year up-cycle with an ongoing recovery in our end markets and a tailwind from secular penetration.
But we're also agile and we're well prepared to respond to any changes in our operating environment. We plan to spend $1.7 billion in rental CapEx this year because we believe that the demand is there. And we can adjust that number either way. And we're guiding to at least $6 billion of revenue and approximately $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA because we believe that we can hit these marks.
We've done the math, and we're already moving forward on our goals. So now we'll cover the financial results then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."
36005,281610938,748067,"United Rentals, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2015",2015-01-22,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll move through the financial results pretty quickly so we can save some time to talk about the oil and gas analysis Mike mentioned and the outlook, which we want to make sure that we hit.Start with revenue. R",1984,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll move through the financial results pretty quickly so we can save some time to talk about the oil and gas analysis Mike mentioned and the outlook, which we want to make sure that we hit.
Start with revenue. Rental revenue was a pretty strong quarter for you, for us, as Mike mentioned, rental revenue increased 6.5%. That's $187 million year-over-year in the quarter. And as usual, I'll bridge that $187 million number. Re-rent and where we continue to be nice contributors to revenue growth for us. Re-rent and ancillary combined were up $26 million year-over-year. But the real driver's owned equipment rental revenue growth. That was up 16.3% for the quarter or $161 million year-over-year. Here are the components of that $161 million. Rental rate, up 4.1% as you saw drives about $40 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement. Volume was up 10.7%, and that drove a $106 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement. And that obviously includes the impact of National Pump's fleet being added to the volume calculation. Our inflation on the fleet was a headwind. It was $18 million detracting from the year-over-year change and then the rest, we'll call it mix, other, including FX was a positive $33 million. Within that $33 million, in addition to the volume that Pump brought along, Pump operates at a higher dollar utilization so they had a positive impact on mix of about $28 million within the $33 million. And then I'll also call out the effect of FX in the quarter, it was pretty significant as a headwind. About $10 million of FX detraction from our year-over-year revenue performance. The other components were a sum of a whole bunch of other this and that in the year-over-year performance. So those were the huge drivers of our revenue performance in the quarter for rental revenue. I'd also point out that we had a very robust used equipment sales results for the quarter. Used was up 16% over last year. And as importantly, the margin was also very good, 48.7% adjusted gross margin on a used equipment sales in the quarter, certainly helped to pay our continued focus on driving as much as we can through our retail channel along with the overall market price environment continues to be pretty solid in the fourth quarter. We also just touched on and had a very good new equipment sales quarter with robust growth in new equipment. 
On profitability, I'll bridge the EBITDA performance year-over-year for us. We had a company record for the fourth quarter of $775 million of adjusted EBITDA. And, likewise, it was a company record, 49.6% margin in the quarter. So that was $124 million of increase in adjusted EBITDA. And 100 basis point improvement in our margin over fourth quarter of '13. 
Here are the components of the $124 million year-over-year improvement. Rental rate improvement that I mentioned earlier for revenue drops through the EBITDA at $39 million. That's just using a 95% flow-through on the rental rate revenue dollars. Volume contributed $74 million worth of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. And then we had a couple of other positives here. Ancillary and re-rent we mentioned along with some other small pieces contributed about $16 million. Used equipment sales, I mentioned the improvement in volume and margin there. That contributed about $14 million of improvement. And then pump, the cat class of Pumps because of their mix, contributed about $15 million worth of positive mix impact. Working against those positives, we had fleet inflation. That was about an $11 million headwind. Additional incentive comp, we had very strong incentive comp year and quarter and our adjustment to the incentive comp cost there cost us about $10 million over the prior year. Bad debt expense cost us about $8 million. We had a strong bad debt expense result in fourth quarter of '13. We had a more normalized result in '14 along with a larger AR balance. So those were the drivers there for that $8 million. Merit increases were about $6 million and all other was the remaining $1 million. So those are the components of our adjusted EBITDA change for year-over-year. If you look down at EPS. We had an adjusted EPS of $2.90 for the quarter, up very nicely from $1.59 the prior year. So all in all a very, very strong profit picture for the quarter as Mike mentioned.
Real quickly, on cash flow. We had great free cash flow performance in the quarter as well. $557 million of free cash flow the way we calculate it but I'll remind everyone that, that includes merger-related cash payments of about $17 million in the quarter. So the way we look at free cash flow in the quarter -- excuse me this is full year, full year. The way we look at free cash flow for the full year is $574 million result. The real driver there and did uncommonly strong than we expected, the real driver was their EBITDA performance alone we'd really, really strong collections. We've mentioned that before but our AR collections have been coming in very strong for the last number of must know when that was the big part of the betterment there in the free cash flow.
Just real briefly to touch on our share repurchase program. We have been repurchasing shares. We mentioned that we brought back about $102 million of shares under the new $750 million authorization in the month of December. We added to that in the month of January. To date in January, we spent extra $125 million. So we are now at $227 million of repurchases against that $750 million repurchase authorization. So that's the way for share repurchase.
Also as Mike mentioned, I'll just reiterate, we had very nice improvement in our return on invested capital, 8.8% for the full year and that's a 130 basis point improvement over the prior year with the fourth quarter sequentially improving by 40 basis points. So we feel very good about the return direction that we have the company pointed at.
And now let's talk about oil. As Michael mentioned, we've done a lot of work assessing possible impacts from low oil prices. And we've done it in a variety of different ways. We keep coming up with the same conclusion, which is that we think any reasonable expectation for impact could is manageable. Here's one way that we've taken a look at that, that we think will resonate with folks. If we look at every branch in our company that has oil and gas revenue, we decided that the best way to look at this was to model that oil and gas revenue taking a significant hit. So in this case, we said any branch would have oil and gas revenue, Upstream oil and gas revenue. The Upstream portion of their revenue stream, that facility takes a 35% hit. In addition for any branch that has more than a de minimis amount of oil and gas revenue Upstream oil and gas revenue, let's also assume that everything else all of their other revenue take a 15% hit. So they get hit 35% in oil and gas Upstream, they get it 15% for everything else. If you do that and add it all across our company, the aggregate amount of full fleet that would be freed up by those kinds of impacts would total about $400 million of average annual fleet. So $400 million relative to an $8 billion plus fleet, you could say hey, let's dismiss that, that's not significant but we don't think about it that way. $400 million is certainly a good amount of fleet to move around. Then we further ask ourselves what could it mean financially? And we made some assumptions. So the $400 million is the average annual fleet. Will that kind of an impact happen over over the full year? We said no. Let's just evaluate having that the impact build over the year and save full effect at the second half. So the second half is really where that hit would apply. So that $400 million annual impact really in calendar 2015 would only have the effect of about $200 million on a full year basis. We ask ourselves how much of that kind of a downside could we absorb, could we mitigate? And while many of us could argue that we could absorb all of that kind of a hit, we decided to be conservative in our downside analysis and assume we could only mitigate half of that. So the $200 million annual rate, we cut down to about $100 million annual impact that represented real exposure to our company. How much is that $100 million fleet worth? We assumed a dollar utilization on that, that was very high relative to the rest of our company. We used 60% in our analysis. So 60% is at least 5 percentage points higher than the dollar utilizations that we reasonably could expect at the second half for even the highest performing regions in our company. So 60% on that $100 million annually impact gives you a $60 million revenue impact and a flow of that through at 60% EBITDA, it's about a $36 million EBITDA impact.
So when you look at it in that light come it doesn't scare you, right? It's not the end of the world to say there's $36 million hole we've got to figure out a way to fill. And as we said that we think that the options are fairly conservative. The good news as Mike mentioned in his comments is that we have assessed that there is going to be robust demand in other areas outside of oil and gas and other product types that we think can help address even if this, what we believe is a downside plays out. So that's the way we're thinking about the risk from oil and gas. And if you add the $36 million impact that we just walked through to or subtract that from what we expect for the full year, we still feel like we can deliver the range of adjusted EBITDA that we've given in our guidance.
Speaking of our guidance for 2015, just to reiterate the key points you've already seen. We expect total revenue in the range of $6 billion to $6.2 billion. Within that rental revenue will be driven by rates up about 3.5% for the year and time utilization of about 59% over 20 basis point improvement last year. The adjusted EBITDA range of $295 million to $305 million again we feel is a range that represents the most likely outcome for the year. We do expect to spend about $1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx and have that net down to about $1.2 billion for the year. And free cash flow will be a very robust result for us this year. Somewhere between $725 million and $775 million is what we expect. Obviously that's significantly higher than the about $600 million number that we guided back to back in our Investor Day in December. And it really reflects the reenactment of bonus depreciation for calendar '14 that the Congress passed and President Obama signed just recently. So put it altogether and it looks like a very robust year for us. We wouldn't say that if we didn't believe that we have the ability to manage to that oil and gas release and exposure for us. But it's an opportunity as well. And we're going to look to take advantage of the opportunities that it presents as we always have. And if we can do that, we feel like we'll be having a good conversation at this time next year.
So with that, that ends our prepared comments. And we can open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

As we think about top line, a couple of things that swirling in the background in our thinking. Obviously, walk through our oil and gas risk assessment but the question is did we get it, right? Could it be worse than that, conversely? Could it be better than that? So those are the things that surround oil and gas performance that, that may buy some -- may buy us the revenue one way or another. And I'll leave you to make your own judgment about how much risk you think there is. FX is another factor that we certainly needed to be aware of. The Canadian dollar has been weakening pretty consistently. Average Canadian was down last year by about 6% to 7% year and right now, as we said, if it's flat line from where it sits right now at about $0.81 U.S., that would be another 6% or so year-over-year headwind from the currency going down. So that's a nontrivial amount of revenue that could erode. The guidance we give is total revenue. So you have to be mindful of used and new as well. And our plan for used equipment sales this year is a reduction over what we achieved in 2014. Just look at the difference between gross CapEx and net rental CapEx, we're guiding to something like $500 million of used sales proceeds that compares to $549 million this year or in '14. So that will be a little bit of an impact to the revenues and maybe keeps the revenue guidance from being higher than it is. And then there are other items that, that might impact at the adjusted EBITDA line. So for example, we had a very robust incentive compensation year this year. And when we reset the incentive comp targets for 2015, our baseline plan assumes that we hit target and only payout at target. We paid out nicely above target this year. So that will impact the positive way where we might end up on the adjusted EBITDA line. And a host of other issues. You mentioned Lean. The Lean initiatives are still rolling out and building momentum. We finished the quarter still a little bit maxed under here. We finished the year at an annualized run rate of about $30 million of Lean impact. That's up from the $23 million that we reported at the end of the third quarter. So that's another factor that playing through our expectations for 2015. So I'll stop there and again, Mike and Matt, you guys want to add anything if I've forgotten anything, please?"

If we found the right M&A opportunity, then we would go ahead and do that whether we were at $600 million or $700 million or $775 million of free cash flow. So M&A wouldn't change. Is it fair to say that as we look at that share repurchase program, if you got more cash flow and you want to pass the leverage and we've already said we expect to be toward the low end of the leverage range that we want to operate in by the end of this year. We've called it $2.6  billion as the leverage ratio we expect before the increase in free cash flow. So I think that we would be more inclined to say okay, let's not go crazy and go below the 2.5 kind of leverage ratio this year now that we've got more cash flow coming in. So that may change how we think about the timing of the share repurchase program. And I think that's a sensible way to think about it. So that's all still to be discussed. And certainly, we'll talk about it more as we make more decisions. But I'd say M&A doesn't change but everything else we kind of put in, in the mix and say okay, we've got an extra $100 million, what do you want to do with it and we'll make that call."

As far as the cadence, if we plan out to being similar to this year, you know that we have really strong flexibility as far as we don't need to make a decision how we're going to ship until literally a week before it's going to ship. So the second quarter by April I think we'll get very good feel of what the second quarter is going to be more or less and it will all be demand driven. The first quarter is light already, which is good for us and right now we're restricting the inflow of CapEx obviously in the market set we think may have a little bit of softening in demand in the back half the year. So I really think we'll get a better picture on how much we adjust for more norm and I would call last year's cadence a new norm. Depending on what the demand is and when we're we're getting the returns and where our customers need our services. So that's always been about a cadence. As far as the specialty, we spent -- we plan on spending over 30% of our growth capital on specialty. You're talking about more of a gross number when you're referring to last year's number and a lot of that was I would say re-fleeting the pump, right. So we need that acquisition to grow. And fleeting up the many cold starts that we've done in our other specialty segments specifically power even the year before. So they were now ready to absorb scale. So we really pushed a lot into the cold starts over the last couple of years. And we'll do some more cold starts this year but not at the scale that we did over the past 2 years."

It was a great year for us and we think another strong year in 2015. Our message today is about progress, discipline and consistency. These fourth quarter calls tend to frame the year-end as a heart stop, but in reality, our performance is a continuum, and that's especially true this year when we went into 2015 with so much momentum.
Now I'll talk about it in a minute, but first, I want to give you the last 12 months that are due because we turned in some outstanding results. Our rates were up 4.5%, in line with our guidance. 2014 was the fourth straight year we moved rates higher and we still see opportunity for improvement.
We have record time utilization of 68.8% for the full year. And our return on invested capital was also a record of 8.8%.
Together, they helped drive more than $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA on rental revenue growth outpaced the industry growth by nearly 2:1. And our free cash flow was a home run for the year. This was due in part to the use of margin of 48.5%, another indication of the ongoing recovery.
And we set $1.7 billion on fleet. And as you saw last night, our CapEx plan for 2015 is approximately the same with even higher expectations for free cash flow.
Not only do we meet or beat every target in our outlook, we did it while making fundamental improvements in the way we operate. Take safety for an example. In 2014, we had the fewest number of recordable injuries in our history. And we drove our full-year recordable rate down below 1.0 for the first time.
It was the ninth consecutive year of safety improvement for us. So clearly, it's not just a fluke, it's a progressive change for the better in our culture.
Specialty rentals was another great story. We grew our specialty segment very effectively last year, with a disciplined mix of MA, cold starts, new fleet and cross-selling. Our full year revenue gain in specialty, which includes the acquisition of National Pump in April was approximately 83% and a gross margin of almost 51%. That's nearly 400 basis points higher than the prior year. And our fourth quarter margin for  specialty was up nearly 500 basis points.
Company-wide, all but 1 of our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth for the quarter, with more than half of the regions showing double-digit growth. And we had a very solid increase in key account revenue, up 16% year-over-year. Financial accounts, which is a subset of our key accounts, grew by more than 18%. So from every perspective, very strong year.
We demanded a lot of ourselves in 2014 and I'm happy to say that we outperformed our own expectations. 
Let's talk about this year. I'm going to start by acknowledging the concerns out there about the effect of oil prices on our industry. Look, we're not running this business with bright-colored glasses and we don't plan to be caught by surprise. We've dug deep into this issue and while we haven't seen any significant attrition to date, we do expect some impact as rig counts come down. Now we're constantly pulling the field not just to measure upstream oil activity but also to gauge any knock-on effect. And we did a lot of detailed analysis based on conservative assumptions to identify our exposure. And Bill is going to share some of those numbers with you in a moment.
But I can tell where they came out. Yes, we think oil prices will reduce demand for certain types of equipment in a handful of areas. But we disagree very strongly with the idea that our growth is at risk.
And I'll give you 5 good reasons why we feel this way. First, upstream oil and gas accounts for only 6% of our business company-wide. That's a very modest exposure given our fleet can be utilized by other types of customers. Even in the battlefield states, or State of Texas, we've got deep customer relationships outside of oil. Currently, more than 80% of our rig rental revenue in Texas comes from infrastructure, manufacturing, transportation, commercial building and a host of other industries. Second, we have strong systems in place for fleet management, including the relocation of equipment and a repurposing of CapEx through used sales. And as circumstances change dramatically, we have the flexibility to reduce our CapEx spend for the year. We've done this before when warranted and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Third, we believe that any drag on demand for upstream oil will be mitigated by the positive effect on other industries. Take chemical manufacturing, 1 of our key sectors. When oil prices decline, manufacturing costs drop, production is stimulated and consumer purchasing power increases. The current growth rate for the U.S. chemical industry is forecast to accelerate to at least 2016. This is just 1 of many examples. Fourth, our geography plays to our advantage. Our upstream oil exposure touches just a fraction of our footprint in any meaningful way. Now keep in mind, we serve 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces. That gives us a lot of room to deploy our assets. The reality is a few has been asking us for significantly more CapEx than we spent for a few years now, and we've been very disciplined in reigning in that number. So if we decided to move fleet due to localized weakness, we have branches that are eager to take it.
And fifth, we know how to outperform our end markets as well as our industry. We've shown you that for years. 2014, our 15% rental revenue growth was more than 3x the year-over-year growth in non-res construction through November, thanks in part to secular penetration. And it was nearly twice the revenue growth of our industry overall.
Not only is there's still lot of runway ahead in the industry up-cycle, the macroeconomy is also trending in our favor. Many economists predict U.S. GDP growth will be in the range of 3% to 3.3% for 2015, with lower unemployment, more consumer spending on goods and services and return to housing starts. And to the degree that any uncertainty still remains in our end markets, that actually works in our favor because we offer on alternative to large capital outlays. 
So when global insight forecast nearly 8% rental industry growth for North America in 2015, and with more growth to follow in 2016, which they did on Sunday, you can take that as a starting point. But be assured, we have bigger plans.
Bottom line, this recovery has already had a share of bumps and we think oil prices will be another bump. Given our scale and diversification, we do not see this as a roadblock. In fact, we think the bigger picture is that low oil prices could have a significant upside for us over time.
And more immediately, we'll keep moving forward with better-than-expected fourth quarter by making disciplined investments to capture a profitable business. I've already mentioned that our specialty group is on a fast track. Power & HVAC in particular turned in a standout performance, with 27% same-store growth and a 61% increase in revenue overall all in 2014.
For 2015, we've earmarked $170 million or about 30% of our growth rental CapEx to meet the increasing demand for our specialty fleet. And we plan to open at least 16 new branches, this includes [indiscernible] for all of our specialty lines, Power & HVAC, Trench Safety, Pumps and Tools.
Our growth in specialty also reflects cross-selling to our broader operations where we're seeing good diversity in large projects. For example, our central U.S. districts are predicting a big year with a wide range of projects underway, with start dates in the next few months. This includes health care, education, hydropower, renewables, bio research and transportation, to name a few.
Further West, we've got equipment on mega sites like LAX and a queue of major project work lined up in the Southeast for mixed-use developments, sports arenas, theme parks and airports.
And in the Northeast, our customers in high-growth verticals are hungry to [indiscernible] any fleet that comes available, atypical in many of our regions. 
Now how about I give you a substantial insight into our thinking in 2015. Our outlook is positive because the facts support it. We like what we see. We like what we hear from our customers and every indication is that the equipment rental is going to look at a multiyear up-cycle with an ongoing recovery in our end markets and a tailwind from secular penetration.
But we're also agile and we're well-prepared to respond to any changes in our operating environment. We plan to spend $1.7 billion in rental CapEx this year because we believe the demand is there. And we can adjust that number either way. And we're guiding to at least $6 billion of revenue and approximately $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA because we believe that we can hit these marks.

I'll move through the financial results pretty quickly so we can save some time to talk about the oil and gas analysis Mike mentioned, and the outlook, which we want to make sure that we hit.Start with revenue",1987,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I'll move through the financial results pretty quickly so we can save some time to talk about the oil and gas analysis Mike mentioned, and the outlook, which we want to make sure that we hit.
Start with revenue. Rental revenue was a pretty strong quarter for you -- for us, as Mike mentioned, total rental revenue increased 6.5%. That's $187 million year-over-year in the quarter. And as usual, I'll bridge that $187 million number. Re-rent and ancillary continue to be nice contributors to revenue growth for us. Re-rent and ancillary combined were up $26 million year-over-year. But the real driver is owned equipment rental revenue growth. That was up 16.3% for the quarter or $161 million year-over-year. Here are the components of that $161 million. Rental rate, up 4.1%, as you saw, drives about $40 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement. Volume was up 10.7%, and that drove $106 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement and that obviously includes the impact of National Pump's fleet being added to the volume calculation. Our inflation on the fleet was a headwind. It was $18 million, detracting from the year-over-year change. And then, the rest, we'll call it mix, other, including FX, was a positive $33 million. Within that $33 million, in addition to the volume that Pump brought along, Pump operates at a higher dollar utilization, so they had a positive impact on mix of about $28 million within the $33 million. And then, I'd also call out the effect of FX in the quarter, it was pretty significant as a headwind, about $10 million of FX detraction from our year-over-year revenue performance. The other components were a sum of a whole bunch of other mix in that [ph] in the year-over-year performance. 
So those were the key drivers of our revenue performance in the quarter for rental revenue. I'd also point out that we had a very robust used equipment sales result for the quarter. Used was up 16% over last year. And as importantly, the margin was also very good, 48.7% adjusted gross margin on our used equipment sales in the quarter, certainly helped by our continued focus on driving as much as we can through our retail channel, along with the overall market price environment continues to be pretty solid in the fourth quarter. We also just touched on and had a very good new equipment sales quarter with robust growth in new equipment. 
On profitability, I'll bridge the EBITDA performance year-over-year for us. We had a company record for fourth quarter of $775 million of adjusted EBITDA. And likewise, it was a company record 49.6% margin in the quarter. So that was $124 million of increase in adjusted EBITDA. And 100 basis point improvement in our margin over fourth quarter of '13. 
Here are the components of the $124 million year-over-year improvement. The rental rate improvement that I mentioned earlier for revenue drops through the EBITDA at $39 million. That's just using a 95% flow-through on the rental rate revenue dollars. Volume contributed $74 million worth of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. And then, we had a couple of other positives here. Ancillary and re-rent I mentioned, along with some other small pieces, contributed about $16 million. Used equipment sales, I mentioned the improvement in volume and margin there, that contributed about $14 million of improvement. And then, pump, the CAT class of pumps, because of their mix, contributed about $15 million worth of positive mix impact. Working against those positives, we had fleet inflation. That was about an $11 million headwind. Additional incentive comp, we had very strong incentive comp year and quarter, and our adjustment to the incentive comp there cost us about $10 million over the prior year. Bad debt expense cost us about $8 million. We had a strong bad debt expense result in fourth quarter of '13. We had more normalized result in '14 along with a larger AR balance. So those were the drivers there for that $8 million. Merit increases were about $6 million and all other was the remaining $1 million. So those are the components of our adjusted EBITDA change for year-over-year. If you look down at EPS, we had an adjusted EPS of $2.19 for the quarter, up very nicely from $1.59 the prior year. So all in all, a very, very strong profit picture for the quarter, as Mike mentioned.
Real quickly on cash flow. We had great free cash flow performance in the quarter as well. $557 million of free cash flow the way we calculate it, but I'll remind everyone that, that includes merger-related cash payments of about $17 million in the quarter. So the way we look at free cash flow in the quarter -- excuse me, this is full year, full year. The way we look at free cash flow for the full year is a $574 million result. The real driver there, and it did come in stronger than we expected, the real driver was better EBITDA performance, along with really, really strong collections. We've mentioned that before but our AR collections have been coming in very strong for the last number of months now and that was a big part of the betterment there in free cash flow.
Just real briefly to touch on our share repurchase program. We have been repurchasing shares. We mentioned that we bought back about $102 million of shares under the new $750 million authorization in the month of December. We added to that in the month of January. To date, in January, we spent extra $125 million. So we are now at $227 million of repurchases against that $750 million repurchase authorization. So that's the way [indiscernible] for share repurchase.
Also as Mike mentioned, I'll just reiterate, we had very nice improvement in our return on invested capital, 8.8% for the full year and that's 130 basis point improvement over the prior year with the fourth quarter sequentially improving by 40 basis points. So we feel very good about the return direction that we have the company pointed at.
Now let's talk about oil. As Michael mentioned, we've done a lot of work assessing possible impacts from low oil prices. And we've done it in a variety of different ways. We keep coming up with the same conclusion, which is that we think any reasonable expectation for impact could -- is manageable. Here's one way that we've taken a look at it and we think will resonate with folks. If we look at every branch in our company that has oil and gas revenue, we decided that the best way to look at this was to model that oil and gas revenue taking a significant hit. So in this case, we said, any branch that had oil and gas revenue, upstream oil and gas revenue, the upstream portion of their revenue stream, let's assume it takes a 35% hit, in addition, for any branch that has more than a de minimis amount of oil and gas revenue, upstream oil and gas revenue, let's also assume that everything else, all of their other revenue take a 15% hit, so they get hit 35% in oil and gas, upstream, they get hit 15% for everything else, if you do that and add it up across our company, the aggregate amount of fleet that would be freed up by those kinds of impacts would total about $400 million of average annual fleet. So $400 million relative to an $8 billion plus fleet, you could say, hey, let's dismiss that, that's not significant, but we don't think about it that way. $400 million is certainly a good amount of fleet to move around. Then we further ask ourselves, what could it mean financially? And we made some assumptions. So the $400 million is the average annual fleet. Will that kind of an impact happen over the full year? We said, no. Let's just evaluate having that impact build over the year and say it's fully in effect at the second half. So the second half is really where that hit would apply. So that $400 million annual impact, really, in calendar 2015 would only have the effect of about $200 million on a full year basis. We asked ourselves, how much of that kind of a downside could we absorb, could we mitigate? And while many of us could argue that we could absorb all of that kind of a hit, we decided to be conservative in our downside analysis and assumed we could only mitigate half that. So the $200 million annual rate, we cut down to about $100 million annual impact that represented real exposure to our company. How much is that $100 million fleet worth? We assumed a dollar utilization on that, that was very high relative to the rest of our company. We used 60% in our analysis. So 60% is at least 5 percentage points higher than the dollar utilizations that we reasonably could expect in the second half for even the highest performing regions in our company. So 60% on that $100 million annual impact gives you a $60 million revenue impact and if we're to flow that through at 60% EBITDA, it's about a $36 million EBITDA impact.
So when you look at it in that light, it doesn't scare you, right? It's not the end of the world to say there's $36 million hole we've got to figure out a way to fill. And as we said, we think that the options are fairly conservative. The good news, as Mike mentioned in his comments, is that we have assessed that there is going to be robust demand in other areas outside of oil and gas and other product types that we think can help address even if this, what we believe, severe downside plays out. So that's the way we're thinking about the risk from oil and gas. And if you add the $36 million impact that we just walked through to, or subtract that from what we expect for the full year, we still feel like we can deliver the range of adjusted EBITDA that we've given in our guidance.
Speaking of our guidance for 2015, just to reiterate the key points you've already seen, we expect total revenue in the range of $6 billion to $6.2 billion. Within that rental revenue will be driven by rates at about 3.5% for the year and time utilization of about 69%, over 20 basis point improvement over last year. The adjusted EBITDA range of $295 million to $305 million, again, we feel is a range that represents the most likely outcome for the year. We do expect to spend about $1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx and have that net down to about $1.2 billion for the year. And free cash flow will be a very robust result for us this year. Somewhere between $725 million and $775 million is what we expect. Obviously, that's significantly higher than the about $600 million number that we guided to you back in our Investor Day in December. And it really reflects the reactment of bonus depreciation for calendar '14 that Congress passed and President Obama signed just recently. So put it altogether and it looks like a very robust year for us. We wouldn't say that if we didn't believe that and believe that we have the ability to manage to that oil and gas certainly is an exposure for us. But it's an opportunity as well. And we're going to look to take advantage of the opportunities that it presents as we always have. And if we can do that, we feel like we'll be having a good conversation at this time next year.
So with that, that ends our prepared comments. And we can open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So I'll start, but certainly, Mike and Matt, please chime in. As we think about top line, a couple of things that swirl in the background in our thinking, obviously, walk through our oil and gas risk assessment but the question is did we get it, right? Could it be worse than that? Conversely, could it be better than that? So those are the things that surround oil and gas performance that may buy us some -- may buy us the revenue one way or another. And I'll leave you to make your own judgment about how much risk you think there is. FX is another factor that we certainly needed to be aware of. The Canadian dollar has been weakening pretty consistently. Average Canadian was down last year by about 6% to 7% year, and right now, as we said, if it flatlined from where it sits right now at about $0.81 U.S., that would be another 6% or so year-over-year headwind from the currency going down. So that's a nontrivial amount of revenue that could erode. The guidance we give is total revenue. So you have to be mindful of used and new as well. And our plan for used equipment sales this year is a reduction over what we achieved in 2014. Just look at the difference between gross CapEx and net rental CapEx, we're guiding to something like $500 million of used sales proceeds that compares to $549 million this year -- or in '14. So that will be a little bit of an impact to the revenues and maybe keeps the revenue guidance from being higher than it is. And then, there are other items that, that might impact at the adjusted EBITDA line. So for example, we had a very robust incentive compensation year this year. And when we reset the incentive comp targets for 2015, our baseline plan assumes that we hit target and only payout at target. We paid out nicely above target this year. So that will impact the positive way where we might end up on the adjusted EBITDA line. And a host of other issues. You mentioned Lean. The Lean initiatives are still rolling out and building momentum. We finished the quarter, still a little bit mess under here. We finished the year at an annualized run rate of about $30 million of Lean impact. That's up from the $23 million that we reported at the end of the third quarter. So that's another factor that's playing through our expectations for 2015. So I'll start there, and again, Mike and Matt, if you guys want to add anything or if I've forgotten anything, please."

I think, it is fair to say that as we look at the share repurchase program, if you got more cash flow and you want to pass the leverage and we've already said we expect to be toward the low end of the leverage range that we want to operate in by the end of this year, we've called $2.6 billion as the leverage ratio you expect before the increase in free cash flow. So I think we would be more inclined to say, okay, let's not go crazy and go below the $2.5 billion kind of leverage ratio this year now that we've got more cash flow coming in. So that may change how we think about the timing of the share repurchase program. And I think that's a sensible way to think about it. So that's all still to be discussed. And certainly, we'll talk about it more as we make more decisions. But I'd say, M&A doesn't change, but everything else we kind of put in, in the mix and say, okay, we've got an extra $100 million, what do you want to do with it and we'll make that call."

The first, as far as the cadence, if we plan on to being similar to this year, you know that we have really strong flexibility as far as we don't need to make a decision of we're going to ship until literally a week before it's going to ship. So the second quarter, by April, I think, we'll get a very good feel if the second quarter is going to be more or less and it will all be demand-driven. The first quarter was light already, which is good for us, and right now, we restrict the inflow of CapEx obviously in the market set we think may have a little bit of softening in demand in the back half of the year. So I really think we'll get a better picture on how much we adjust for more norm and I would call last year's cadence a new norm, depending on what the demand is and where we're getting our returns and where our customers need our services. So that's how we feel about the cadence. As far as the specialty, we spent -- we plan on spending over 30% of our growth capital on specialty. You're talking about more of a gross number when you're referring to last year's number and a lot of that was, I would say, re-fleeting our pump, right? So we need that acquisition to grow. And fleeting up the many cold starts that we've done in our other specialty segments, specifically power, even the year before, so they were now ready to absorb scale. So we really pushed a lot into the cold starts over the last couple of years. And we'll do some more cold starts this year but not at the scale that we did over the past 2 years."

So in total numbers, it's down, you're right, but it hasn't changed our view on specialty. We do reserve the right on pump to understand what impact upstream could or could not have as we go through our cross-sell opportunities. And we -- as I mentioned, we will do cold starts with pump to broaden their reach and that was 1 of the key aspects of the acquisition was making sure that, if you recall, 6% of their business was only in our commercial and industrial space. So we see that as a significant opportunity. So it's kind of more of a tempered look, take a look at it.

I actually think that Eastern Canada, which by the way has been down for the last several years, we'll see some activity there and come forward. The only headwind we would have, as Bill mentioned, is the currency exchange from a revenue, but on a constant dollars, we would expect that to grow. So we see that -- the Canadian market grow and probably less growth on Western Canada than we've experienced in the past."

The cost costs are minimal compared to the opportunity you'd have by reallocating. But right now, they're running high time utilization and we're just going to manage the influx in the energy, oil and gas markets first.

It was a great year for us and we expect another strong year in 2015. Our message today is about progress, discipline and consistency. These fourth quarter calls tend to frame the year-end as a hard stop, but in reality, our performance is a continuum, and that's especially true this year when we went into 2015 with so much momentum.
Now I'll talk about that in a minute, but first, I want to give you the last 12 months their due, because we turned in some outstanding results. Our rates were up 4.5%, in line with our guidance. 2014 was the fourth straight year we moved rates higher and we still see opportunity for improvement.
We have record time utilization of 68.8% for the full year. And our return on invested capital was also a record of 8.8%.
Together, they helped drive more than $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA, our rental revenue growth outpaced the industry growth by nearly 2:1. And our free cash flow was a home run for the year. This was due in part to the use of margin of 48.5%, another indication of the ongoing recovery.
And we spent $1.7 billion on fleet. And as you saw last night, our CapEx plan for 2015 is approximately the same with even higher expectations for free cash flow.
Not only do we meet or beat every target in our outlook, we did it while making fundamental improvements in the way we operate. Take safety for an example. In 2014, we had the fewest number of recordable injuries in our history. And we drove our full-year recordable rate down below 1.0 for the first time.
It was the ninth consecutive year of safety improvement for us. So clearly, it's not just a fluke, it's a progressive change for the better in our culture.
Specialty rentals was another great story. We grew our specialty segment very effectively last year, with a disciplined mix of MA, cold starts, new fleet and cross-selling. Our full year revenue gain in specialty, which includes the acquisition of National Pump in April was approximately 83% and a gross margin of almost 51%. That's nearly 400 basis points higher than the prior year. And our fourth quarter margin for specialty was up nearly 500 basis points.
Company-wide, all but 1 of our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth for the quarter, with more than half of the regions showing double-digit growth. And we had a very solid increase in key account revenue, up 16% year-over-year. National accounts, which is a subset of our key accounts, grew by more than 18%. So from every perspective, very strong year.
We demanded a lot of ourselves in 2014 and I'm happy to say that we outperformed our own expectations. 
Let's talk about this year. I'm going to start by acknowledging the concerns out there about the effect of oil prices on our industry. Look, we're not running this business with rose-colored glasses and we don't plan to be caught by surprise. We've dug deep into this issue and while we haven't seen any significant attrition to date, we do expect some impact as rig counts come down. Now we're constantly polling the field not just to measure upstream oil activity but also to gauge any knock-on effect. And we done a lot of detailed analysis based on conservative assumptions to identify our exposure. And Bill is going to share some of those numbers with you in a moment.
But I can tell where they came out. Yes, we think oil prices will reduce demand for certain types of equipment in a handful of areas. But we disagree very strongly with the idea that our growth is at risk.
And I'll give you 5 good reasons why we feel this way. First, upstream oil and gas accounts for only 6% of our business company-wide. That's a very modest exposure given our fleet can be utilized by other types of customers. Even in the battlefield states, or State of Texas, we've got deep customer relationships outside of oil. Currently, more than 80% of our rig rental revenue in Texas comes from infrastructure, manufacturing, transportation, commercial building and a host of other industries. Second, we have strong systems in place for fleet management, including the relocation of equipment and a repurposing of CapEx through used sales. And as circumstances change dramatically, we have the flexibility to reduce our CapEx spend for the year. We've done this before when warranted and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Third, we believe that any drag on demand for upstream oil will be mitigated by the positive effect on other industries. Take chemical manufacturing, 1 of our key sectors. When oil prices decline, manufacturing costs drop, production is stimulated and consumer purchasing power increases. The current growth rate for the U.S. chemical industry is forecast to accelerate to at least 2016. This is just 1 of many examples. Fourth, our geography plays to our advantage. Our upstream oil exposure touches just a fraction of our footprint in any meaningful way. Now keep in mind, we serve 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces. That gives us a lot of room to deploy our assets. The reality is a field has been asking us for significantly more CapEx than we spent for a few years now and we've been very disciplined in reining in that number. So if we decide to move fleet due to a localized weakness, we have branches that are eager to take it.
And fifth, we know how to outperform our end markets as well as our industry. We've shown you that for years. In 2014, our 15% rental revenue growth was more than 3x the year-over-year growth in non-res construction through November, thanks in part to secular penetration. And it was nearly twice the revenue growth of our industry overall.
Not only is there's still lot of runway ahead in the industry up-cycle, the macroeconomy is also trending in our favor. Many economists predict the U.S. GDP growth will be in the range of 3% to 3.3% for 2015, with lower unemployment, more consumer spending on goods and services and a return to housing starts. And to the degree that any uncertainty still remains in our end markets, that actually works in our favor because we offer on alternative to large capital outlays. 
So when global insight forecast nearly 8% rental industry growth for North America in 2015, and with more growth to follow in 2016, which they did on Sunday, you can take that as a starting point. But be assured, we have bigger plans.
Bottom line, this recovery has already had its share of bumps and we think oil prices will be another bump. Given our scale and diversification, we do not see this as a roadblock. In fact, we think the bigger picture is that low oil prices could have a significant upside for us over time.
And more immediately, we'll keep moving forward in a better-than-expected fourth quarter by making disciplined investments to capture a profitable business. I've already mentioned that our specialty group is on a fast track. Power & HVAC in particular turned in a standout performance, with 27% same-store growth and a 61% increase in revenue overall in 2014.
For 2015, we've earmarked $170 million or about 30% of our growth rental CapEx to meet the increasing demand for our specialty fleet. And we plan to open at least 16 new branches, this includes cold starts for all of our specialty lines, Power & HVAC, Trench Safety, Pumps and Tools.
Our growth in specialty also reflects cross-selling to our broader operations where we're seeing good diversity in large projects. For example, our central U.S. districts are predicting a big year with a wide range of projects underway, with start dates in the next few months. This includes health care, education, hydropower, renewables, bio research and transportation, to name a few.
Further West, we've got equipment on mega sites like LAX and a queue of major project work lined up in the Southeast for mixed-use developments, sports arenas, theme parks and airports.
And in the Northeast, our customers in high-growth verticals are hungry to snap up any fleet that comes available, and that's typical in many of our regions. 
Now I hope to give you a substantial insight into our thinking in 2015. Our outlook is positive because the facts support it. We like what we see. We like what we hear from our customers and every indication is that the equipment rental is going to look at a multiyear up-cycle with an ongoing recovery in our end markets and a tailwind from secular penetration.
But we're also agile and we're well-prepared to respond to any changes in our operating environment. We plan to spend $1.7 billion in rental CapEx this year because we believe the demand is there. And we can adjust that number either way. And we're guiding to at least $6 billion of revenue and approximately $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA because we believe that we can hit these marks.
We've done the math and we're already moving forward on our goals. So now, Bill will cover the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."
36005,281610938,748345,"United Rentals, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2015",2015-01-22,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I'll move through the financial results pretty quickly so we can save some time to talk about the oil and gas analysis Mike mentioned, and the outlook, which we want to make sure that we hit.Start with revenue",1993,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I'll move through the financial results pretty quickly so we can save some time to talk about the oil and gas analysis Mike mentioned, and the outlook, which we want to make sure that we hit.
Start with revenue. Rental revenue was a pretty strong quarter for you -- for us, as Mike mentioned, total rental revenue increased 6.5%. That's $187 million year-over-year in the quarter. And as usual, I'll bridge that $187 million number. Re-rent and ancillary continue to be nice contributors to revenue growth for us. Re-rent and ancillary combined were up $26 million year-over-year. But the real driver is owned equipment rental revenue growth. That was up 16.3% for the quarter or $161 million year-over-year. Here are the components of that $161 million. Rental rate, up 4.1%, as you saw, drives about $40 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement. Volume was up 10.7%, and that drove $106 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement and that obviously includes the impact of National Pump's fleet being added to the volume calculation. Our inflation on the fleet was a headwind. It was $18 million, detracting from the year-over-year change. And then, the rest, we'll call it mix, other, including FX, was a positive $33 million. Within that $33 million, in addition to the volume that Pump brought along, Pump operates at a higher dollar utilization, so they had a positive impact on mix of about $28 million within the $33 million. And then, I'd also call out the effect of FX in the quarter, it was pretty significant as a headwind, about $10 million of FX detraction from our year-over-year revenue performance. The other components were a sum of a whole bunch of other this and that’s in the year-over-year performance. 
So those were the key drivers of our revenue performance in the quarter for rental revenue. I'd also point out that we had a very robust used equipment sales result for the quarter. Used was up 16% over last year. And as importantly, the margin was also very good, 48.7% adjusted gross margin on our used equipment sales in the quarter, certainly helped by our continued focus on driving as much as we can through our retail channel, along with the overall market price environment continues to be pretty solid in the fourth quarter. We also just touched on and had a very good new equipment sales quarter with robust growth in new equipment. 
On profitability, I'll bridge the EBITDA performance year-over-year for us. We had a company record for fourth quarter of $775 million of adjusted EBITDA. And likewise, it was a company record 49.6% margin in the quarter. So that was $124 million of increase in adjusted EBITDA. And 100 basis point improvement in our margin over fourth quarter of '13. 
Here are the components of the $124 million year-over-year improvement. The rental rate improvement that I mentioned earlier for revenue drops through to EBITDA at $39 million. That's just using a 95% flow-through on the rental rate revenue dollars. Volume contributed $74 million worth of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. And then, we had a couple of other positives here. Ancillary and re-rent I mentioned, along with some other small pieces, contributed about $16 million. Used equipment sales, I mentioned the improvement in volume and margin there, that contributed about $14 million of improvement. And then, pump, the CAT class of pumps, because of their mix, contributed about $15 million worth of positive mix impact. Working against those positives, we had fleet inflation. That was about an $11 million headwind. Additional incentive comp, we had a very strong incentive comp year end quarter, and our adjustment to the incentive comp there cost us about $10 million over the prior year. Bad debt expense cost us about $8 million. We had a strong bad debt expense result in fourth quarter of '13. We had a more normalized result in '14 along with a larger AR balance. So those were the drivers there for that $8 million. Merit increases were about $6 million and all other was the remaining $1 million. So those are the components of our adjusted EBITDA change for year-over-year. If you look down at EPS, we had an adjusted EPS of $2.19 for the quarter, up very nicely from $1.59 the prior year. So all in all, a very, very strong profit picture for the quarter, as Mike mentioned.
Real quickly on cash flow. We had great free cash flow performance in the quarter as well. $557 million of free cash flow the way we calculate it, but I'll remind everyone that, that includes merger-related cash payments of about $17 million in the quarter. So the way we look at free cash flow in the quarter -- excuse me, this is full year, full year. The way we look at free cash flow for the full year is a $574 million result. The real driver there, and it did come in stronger than we expected, the real driver was better EBITDA performance, along with really, really strong collections. We've mentioned that before but our AR collections have been coming in very strong for the last number of months now and that was a big part of the betterment there in free cash flow.
Just real briefly to touch on our share repurchase program. We have been repurchasing shares. We mentioned that we bought back about $102 million of shares under the new $750 million authorization in the month of December. We added to that in the month of January. To date, in January, we spent extra $125 million. So we are now at $227 million of repurchases against that $750 million repurchase authorization. So that's the way [indiscernible] for share repurchase.
Also as Mike mentioned, I'll just reiterate, we had very nice improvement in our return on invested capital, 8.8% for the full year and that's 130 basis point improvement over the prior year with the fourth quarter sequentially improving by 40 basis points. So we feel very good about the return, the direction that we have the company pointed in.
Now let's talk about oil. As Michael mentioned, we've done a lot of work assessing possible impacts from low oil prices. And we've done it in a variety of different ways. We keep coming up with the same conclusion, which is that we think any reasonable expectation for impact could -- is manageable. Here's one way that we've taken a look at it and we think will resonate with folks. If we look at every branch in our company that has oil and gas revenue, we decided that the best way to look at this was to model that oil and gas revenue taking a significant hit. So in this case, we said, any branch that had oil and gas revenue, upstream oil and gas revenue, the upstream portion of their revenue stream, let's assume it takes a 35% hit. In addition, for any branch that has more than a de minimis amount of oil and gas revenue, upstream oil and gas revenue, let's also assume that everything else, all of their other revenue take a 15% hit, so they get hit 35% in oil and gas, upstream, they get hit 15% for everything else. If you do that and add it up across our company, the aggregate amount of fleet that would be freed up by those kinds of impacts would total about $400 million of average annual fleet. So $400 million relative to an $8 billion plus fleet, you could say, hey, let's dismiss that, that's not significant, but we don't think about it that way. $400 million is certainly a good amount of fleet to move around. Then we further ask ourselves, what could it mean financially? And we made some assumptions. So the $400 million is the average annual fleet. Will that kind of an impact happen over the full year? We said, no. Let's just evaluate having that impact build over the year and say it's fully in effect at the second half. So the second half is really where that hit would apply. So that $400 million annual impact, really, in calendar 2015 would only have the effect of about $200 million on a full year basis. We asked ourselves, how much of that kind of a downside could we absorb, could we mitigate? And while many of us could argue that we could absorb all of that kind of a hit, we decided to be conservative in our downside analysis and assumed we could only mitigate half that. So the $200 million annual rate, we cut down to about $100 million annual impact that represented real exposure to our company. How much is that $100 million fleet worth? We assumed a dollar utilization on that, that was very high relative to the rest of our company. We used 60% in our analysis. So 60% is at least 5 percentage points higher than the dollar utilizations that we reasonably could expect in the second half for even the highest performing regions in our company. So 60% on that $100 million annual impact gives you a $60 million revenue impact and if we're to flow that through at 60% EBITDA, it's about a $36 million EBITDA impact.
So when you look at it in that light, it doesn't scare you, right? It's not the end of the world to say there's a $36 million hole we've got to figure out a way to fill. And as we said, we think that the assumptions are fairly conservative. The good news, as Mike mentioned in his comments, is that we have assessed that there is going to be robust demand in other areas outside of oil and gas and other product types that we think can help address even if this, what we believe is a severe downside, plays out. So that's the way we're thinking about the risk from oil and gas. And if you add the $36 million impact that we just walked through to, or subtract that from what we expect for the full year, we still feel like we can deliver the range of adjusted EBITDA that we've given in our guidance.
Speaking of our guidance for 2015, just to reiterate the key points you've already seen, we expect total revenue in the range of $6 billion to $6.2 billion. Within that rental revenue will be driven by rates at about 3.5% for the year and time utilization of about 69%, or a 20 basis point improvement over last year. The adjusted EBITDA range of $295 million to $305 million, again, we feel is a range that represents the most likely outcome for the year. We do expect to spend about $1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx and have that net down to about $1.2 billion for the year. And free cash flow will be a very robust result for us this year. Somewhere between $725 million and $775 million is what we expect. Obviously, that's significantly higher than the about $600 million number that we guided to you back in our Investor Day in December. And it really reflects the reenactment of bonus depreciation for calendar '14 that Congress passed and President Obama signed just recently. So put it altogether and it looks like a very robust year for us. We wouldn't say that if we didn't believe that and believe that we have the ability to manage to that. Oil and gas certainly is an exposure for us. But it's an opportunity as well. And we're going to look to take advantage of the opportunities that it presents as we always have. And if we can do that, we feel like we'll be having a good conversation at this time next year.
So with that, that ends our prepared comments. And we can open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So I'll start, but certainly, Mike and Matt, please chime in. As we think about top line, a couple of things that swirl in the background in our thinking, obviously, I walked through our oil and gas risk assessment but the question is did we get it,",449,"Sure. So I'll start, but certainly, Mike and Matt, please chime in. As we think about top line, a couple of things that swirl in the background in our thinking, obviously, I walked through our oil and gas risk assessment but the question is did we get it, right? Could it be worse than that? Conversely, could it be better than that? So those are the things that surround oil and gas performance that may buy us some -- may buy us the revenue one way or another. And I'll leave you to make your own judgment about how much risk you think there is. FX is another factor that we certainly needed to be aware of. The Canadian dollar has been weakening pretty consistently. Average Canadian was down last year by about 6% to 7% year, and right now, as we said, if it flatlined from where it sits right now at about $0.81 U.S., that would be another 6% or so year-over-year headwind from the currency going down. So that's a nontrivial amount of revenue that could erode. The guidance we give is total revenue. So you have to be mindful of used and new as well. And our plan for used equipment sales this year is a reduction over what we achieved in 2014. Just look at the difference between gross CapEx and net rental CapEx, we're guiding to something like $500 million of used sales proceeds that compares to $549 million this year -- or in '14. So that will be a little bit of an impact to the revenues and maybe keeps the revenue guidance from being higher than it is. And then, there are other items that, that might impact at the adjusted EBITDA line. So for example, we had a very robust incentive compensation year this year. And when we reset the incentive comp targets for 2015, our baseline plan assumes that we hit target and only payout at target. We paid out nicely above target this year. So that will impact in a positive way where we might end up on the adjusted EBITDA line. And a host of other issues. You mentioned Lean. The Lean initiatives are still rolling out and building momentum. We finished the quarter, still a little bit mess [ph] under here. We finished the year at an annualized run rate of about $30 million of Lean impact. That's up from the $23 million that we reported at the end of the third quarter. So that's another factor that's playing through our expectations for 2015. So I'll start there, and again, Mike and Matt, if you guys want to add anything or if I've forgotten anything, please."

I think, it is fair to say that as we look at the share repurchase program, if you got more cash flow and you want to pass the leverage and we've already said we expect to be toward the low end of the leverage range that we want to operate in by the end of this year, we've called $2.6 billion as the leverage ratio you'd expect before the increase in free cash flow. So I think we would be more inclined to say, okay, let's not go crazy and go below the $2.5 billion kind of leverage ratio this year now that we've got more cash flow coming in. So that may change how we think about the timing of the share repurchase program. And I think that's a sensible way to think about it. So that's all still to be discussed. And certainly, we'll talk about it more as we make more decisions. But I'd say, M&A doesn't change, but everything else we kind of put in, in the mix and say, okay, we've got an extra $100 million, what do you want to do with it and we'll make that call."

The first, as far as the cadence, if we plan on to being similar to this year, you know that we have really strong flexibility as far as we don't need to make a decision of we're going to ship until literally a week before it's going to ship. So the second quarter, by April, I think, we'll get a very good feel if the second quarter is going to be more or less and it will all be demand-driven. The first order was light already, which is good for us, and right now, we restricting inflow of CapEx obviously in the markets that we think may have a little bit of softening in demand in the back half of the year. So I really think we'll get a better picture on how much we adjust from our norm and I would call last year's cadence a new norm, depending on what the demand is and where we're getting our returns and where our customers need our services. So that's how we feel about the cadence. As far as the specialty, we spent -- we plan on spending over 30% of our growth capital on specialty. You're talking about more of a gross number when you're referring to last year's number and a lot of that was, I would say, re-fleeting our pump, right? So we needed that acquisition to grow. And fleeting up the many cold starts that we've done in our other specialty segments, specifically power, even the year before, so they were now ready to absorb scale. So we really pushed a lot into the cold starts over the last couple of years. And we'll do some more cold starts this year but not at the scale that we did over the past 2 years."

So we should think of less just trying to move the fleet, you also can tap the retail market the best you can on selling used."

But even in that space, the pipeline was so robust that, individually, they may have opportunity. I think, more importantly, the other 90% of our key account managers are extremely encouraged because we've always sent the fleet to the highest return opportunity and oil and gas was pretty hot for a while. You could argue, we may have underserved a lot of other opportunity that will give us very good returns and a little bit more geographically dispersed. So I think that what we're hearing on the ground is encouragement and opportunity in markets like the West Coast, even the Northwest or Southeast, the mid-Atlantic, where you could see the map that we have on the investor deck on, I think, it was Slide 14, where you see there's some real big opportunities.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. Today we'll talk about how we're managing the business in light of our expectations for 2015 with almost 4 months of the year behind us, we've been able to draw conclusions on how this year is shaping up and we'll talk more about that in a minute and then Bill will cover the results followed by your questions.
So let's begin with the numbers you saw last night. We had a solid start to the year. Our revenue, EBITDA and return on invested capital are all first quarter records. And that's a credit to our employees. Our rental revenue increased 12% year-over-year based in part on an 8% increase in volume. We generated $602 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 46% margin.
Our return on invested capital improved to 9% and our free cash flow for the quarter was $450 million, more than 60% higher than a year ago. We also reported record adjusted EPS of $1.34 for the quarter.
Now we achieved these results despite some notable headwinds, the most significant constraint was the decline in Upstream oil and gas activity. The rapid shutdown of almost 50% of drill rigs had both a direct and knock on effect. And this was felt most strongly in our Pump operations.
The slowdown also happened earlier than expected and we now think it's likely to continue to at least the next 3 to 6 months. We still expect to mitigate the decline within our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and we'll have more opportunity to do that now during the peak seasonality.
Now given the timing of the impact, we felt it was really stick to narrow the ranges of revenue and EBITDA. Our updated revenue range is $6 billion to $6.1 billion below and adjusted EBITDA of $2.95 billion to $3 billion. And these ranges still full within our regional outlook.
Now in addition, in the first quarter, we had a negative currency impact from a relatively weaker Canadian dollar and this will likely impact our year-over-year comparisons throughout 2015. In the harsh winter slowed the pace of the projects in several regions where we dealt with historic cold and snow. Now with that one, we can safely say that's behind us. But despite these headwinds, we put a record $5.4 billion of OEC-on-Rent in the first quarter in a highly competitive marketplace.
We could leave it at that but as you know, we're not a company that shies away from looking at numbers from every angle. In the first quarter, the metrics of time utilization and rate merit for the discussion. Time utilization decreased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 64%. And to change our outlook, we're still comfortable with our full year time utilization of approximately 69%. And when we look what at branches without any meaningful exposure to Upstream oil and gas activity, time utilization was actually up 40 basis points in the quarter.
With pricing, our rate increase of 2.9% in the quarter versus last year and that was lower than expected and we're now anticipating a very competitive rate environment going into the summer months. But I know that our field management feels like I do that there are actions that we can take to get our prices up. Now coming off the quarter, we now expect our rate increase to be about 3% for the full year instead of the original regional outlook of 3.5%.
Regardless of any headwinds, we'll continue to transfer underutilized fleet to areas of higher demand where our sales force have more leverage to negotiate rates. And we'll help have even more opportunity to get the equipment on rent as we go into our seasonality as it picks up.
We're focused on achieving that optimal balance of metrics that we talked about before, that is where rate and time utilization intersect to drive returns. We see this as being absolutely essential as we continue to capitalize on the up-cycle and a large measure is within our control regardless of external developments.
Now let's turn to the marketplace starting with specialty rentals. The organic revenue growth in our specialty segment was 25% in the quarter and EBITDA was up 57%, Trench Safety and Power were particularly strong. Specialty rentals are our high margin business and help drive our fifth consecutive first quarter increase of EBITDA margin company-wide.
We'll expand all of our specialty lines this year with an addition of approximately 18 new branches. This will give us a strategic presence in new trade areas and strengthen our cross-selling abilities.
From a broader perspective, our operating environment continues to match up favorably against last year. Our sales force is reporting high level of project starts and if anything, our customers are even more optimistic than they were in December.
And this is true for our large National Accounts, as well as regional operators and local contractors. We're serving a diverse customer base that has maintained a healthy balance year-over-year going into April. Key accounts represent 65% of our base by revenue. That includes National Accounts at 46% of our base. And our local customers, which we classify as unassigned accounts, ticked up slightly to 35%.
Let's now turn to geography. On a constant currency basis, all but 1 of our regions had year-over-year growth and that 1 was nearly flat. The Mid-Atlantic, South, Midwest and Mountain West regions had a particularly strong quarter. And I want to give a nod to our industrial team, which has continued to score wins in the downstream energy sector. Energy gets a rep right now but from our perspective, we're seeing some impressive numbers.
We currently have commitments for 8 multibillion-dollar energy projects, 4 of which are underway, 2 are in the third stage and the other 2 will kick off in 2016 and 2018. All of these are 3 to 6-year projects in Texas or Louisiana.
But beyond energy, we're seeing many different sectors pick up. For example, our major infrastructure project are renovations in Ottawa and Montréal, large stadium projects in Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale and renewables such as wind firms in Kansas. And I want to share something new about Texas, which is a large and diversified markets for us.
If you exclude Pump, the increase in rental revenue was in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. That points to a solid demand outside of Upstream oil and gas. We've always had to write up some sector related cycles but the fundamentals of our markets are very strong.
We should see broad-based growth well beyond 2015 as our customers take on more work and secular penetration adds an extra layer of demand. Most industry forecasts supports this view. 1 recent release is the consensus construction report put up by the American Institute of Architects that takes account 7 major forecasters, including Dodge and Moody's. Report concludes that construction -- Commercial Construction, which is our bread-and-butter, is forecast to remain on a strong upward trajectory, hotels, office buildings and retail are just some of the areas -- just a few of some of the areas projected to contribute to that growth.
And the institutional sector, which had a disappointing decline in 2014, appears to have bottomed out. The consensus is that institutional construction will reverse to a gain in 2015 and climb again in 2016. And that's good news for markets such as health, education and public safety.
So that gives you an idea where we see the challenges and the opportunities for 2015. And to some degree, in 2016 as well. Taking everything into consideration, we remain confident in our full year guidance of adjusted EBITDA of at least $2.95 billion on total revenue of at least $6 billion.
But we're balancing these metrics behind those numbers in light of the market dynamics, and we expect to spend $1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx this year as planned. Now in short, we show that we have the right plan, we know we have the right plan in place for 2015. And our strategy for the long-term, profitable growth remains intact.
So with that, I'll ask Bill to cover the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

We've got a lot to cover here, so I'm going to try and streamline my comments about the actuals so we can save a little time to touch on the refinancings that we did, touch on our oil and gas experience for the first quarter and also the outlook. 
Real briefly on the financials, we had a good revenue result in the quarter. Rental revenue was up by almost 12%, 11.9%, as Mike called out. That's a $119 million, $120 million improvement and the drivers were as follows: The ancillary and re-rent revenue performance for the quarter was good. We had about a $14 million year-over-year improvement from those 2 combined. The bulk of it being ancillary, pick up delivery and our RPP program, re-rent was just a little better than flat year-over-year. So that was about $14 million of the $120 million.
Within owned equipment revenue, OER, rental rate growth, you saw was 2.9%. We translate that into about a $26 million improvement over last year. On the volume front, we had 8.1% volume improvement and that translates into about $72 million of volume impact, which I'll note includes the impact of heavy Pump this year and not in the first quarter of last year. Also sprinkled throughout volume and some of the other lines is the FX impact that we experienced in the quarter. I'll summarize that at the and.
Inflation, replacement CapEx inflation, we called at about 2.1% for the quarter and that's a headwind of just under $19 million year-over-year. And then mix, all other, including some portion of FX, accounted for  $27 million year-over-year. That includes the impact again of the Pump acquisition as we talked before, Pump not only contributed to the acquisition but has a more attractive mix than the rest of the business. And so that was a significant part of that $27 million.
So those were the key components of the $120 million improvement. And I'll just call out separately if you aggregate all of the currency impact, we estimate that currency cost us about $16 million of rental revenue year-over-year. And that certainly is a significant headwind when you think about the growth that we were able to experience.
The only other revenue comment that I'll make is about used equipment sales. We had another good used equipment sales result in the quarter, $116 million. And that's up about 6% from last year. And also very importantly, a very robust 50.7 % adjusted gross margin for the quarter. And as has been the case, that was helped not only by solid pricing in the quarter. Pricing as measured by proceeds as a percent  of OEC was just under 50% in the quarter but it also was supported by our continued focus on the retail channel we get the best results, margin results there. And so selling about 61% of our used sales through retail channel was a nice support for the results.
Turning quickly to profitability. EBITDA first, adjusted EBITDA of $602.2 million was a company record for the quarter, as Mike pointed out, as was the adjusted EBITDA margin, 45.8% was a very robust margin. So that's $83 million worth of dollar improvement over last year and 170 basis points worth of margin improvement as well. 
Flow through in the quarter was strong at 60.6%. And we'll certainly touch on some of the drivers there in the year-over-year EBITDA bridge. Speaking of which, that $83 million of improvement was driven by volume. Primarily, volume was up about $51 million of the $83 million year-over-year improvement. Rental rates contributed another $24 million toward that $83 million improvement. The cat class mix, primarily from the impact of adding pump, we would call out at about $14 million of incremental improvement. And then we also had the improvement from ancillary and re-rent revenues that I called out earlier. That's about a $7 million improvement on the incremental $14 million of revenue that I called out.
We did have a lower incentive compensation accrual for the first quarter this year compared to last year, reflecting some of the headwinds that we experienced with oil and gas, weather and currency. So that contributed $6 million of year-over-year improvement. Used equipment sales or we called out the sales margin improvement, that was about $5 million of improvement. And then a few headwind items. Fleet inflation and mix component combined was about a $13 million headwind versus last year. Bad debt expense, we reverted to a more normal bad debt expense this year compared to a solid bad debt expense performance last year. So that cost us about $8 million in year-over-year EBITDA and then merit increases were about $6 million of impact this year as well. That leaves about $3 million of all other this and that's combined. So all in all, a very robust EBITDA result in the quarter even in spite of the headwinds.
And as Mike called out on EPS, it was a great EPS result for the quarter as well, $1.34. That's up almost 50% against the $0.90 of adjusted EPS that we delivered in the first quarter last year. So another good results there. 
Moving on to free cash flow, continuing the good result commentary. $450 million of free cash flow in the first quarter and that's up from $278 million in the first quarter of last year, with minimal merger-related adjustments showing up in the current quarters, it's only about $1 million worth of merger-related payments. So the way we talk about free cash flow on an adjusted basis, we would call $451 million, a variety of different drivers, including the operating profitability, we also had lower AER and the timing of some of the other working capital payments were also favorable for us primarily accounts payable.
Rental CapEx for the quarter was $323 million. And that's certainly a start consistent with the comments we've made previously about the timing of CapEx this year looking similar to last year. As you saw in the outlook, we continue to expect to spend $1.7 billion in gross capital this year for a net of about $1.2 billion. The net rental CapEx for the quarter was just under $210 million for the quarter. 
On capital structure and liquidity, a busy quarter in capital structure actions. You all have seen that we refinanced 2 of outstanding issues. We issued calls on the 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes and the 5 3/4% senior notes. We refinanced those issues by issuing 2 new issues, $1 billion of 4 5/8% 8-year senior secured notes and then another $800 million worth of 10-year senior unsecured. Very attractive overall impact for those refinancing transactions but we didn't stop there. We also amended and extended our ABL facility and increased its size as well. So the ABL is now up to $2.5 billion. We then drew on that new and improved ABL and used it to partially call the 8 1/4 % senior notes. And I go through all of that just to note that the timing of those transactions were split between first quarter and second quarter and so as you think about the results in the first quarter and as you anticipate the results for the second quarter, you have to remind yourself that we will have some impact in the second quarter from those first quarter transactions. In particular, we'll report in the second quarter about $121 million loss on the redemptions that covers both the premium of calling the outstanding notes, as well as writing off any remaining deferred financing costs that will happen in the second quarter. When you aggregate it altogether, we expect that the aggregate run rate of interest expense reductions from all of those transactions should come in to an improvement of about $40 million -- $48 million a year. So that gives you a summary. And to put it even more directly, our interest expense estimate for cash interest this year, we -- excuse me GAAP interest, GAAP interest this year, we expect to be about $460 million. So hopefully, that will help you as you think through all those transactions.
Real briefly on ROIC. A company record ROIC result in the quarter, 9%. And that was 120 basis points compared to the first quarter last year and 20 basis points better than in the fourth quarter. So despite all the headwinds, as Michael discussed, we continue to be on a path to improving our ROIC, which has been a major focus of our efforts.
And even with the revised guidance that we provided, we fully expect a very nice improvement in ROIC as we go through the full 2015 year.
Before I do finish up with the outlook, just a real brief summary of our progress in oil and gas. We talked in the first quarter about a downside oil and gas scenario. And I just to want to provide a couple of data point about progress against oil and gas and how we compare to that downside.
Recall that we -- we called out about a $400 million maximum fleet size impact from the downside scenario we laid out. You'll also recall that we said that $400 million impact, we modeled it as hitting us in the second quarter. Obviously, we didn't expect it would be 0 impact until June and then $400 million from June on. But we certainly modeled it that way. So that's $400 million maximum impact, averaged out to a $200 million OEC impact over the course of 2015.
We are about halfway to that $400 million maximum impact, just based on the path of fleet in our oil and gas branches. And in particular, when you look at those oil and gas branches, most of the impact that we've seen has come from the oil and gas branches that have the highest share of the revenue from oil and gas. If the branch has more than 20% of the revenue from oil and gas, in aggregate, those have seen about a $200 million equivalent OEC impact. For the branches that have less than 20% of their share in oil and gas, there's been virtually no impact. So we find that a very interesting feature of how oil and gas is progressing throughout our branches.
The thing, as Mike pointed out, that surprised us a little bit is that the impact came a little sooner than what we expected. But certainly, not outside the context of the size of what we expected. But the fact that it came sooner means that it will have an effect over the remainder of the year, longer than the way we modeled the downside. So when you net it all together, we're probably seeing an impact through the full 2015 calendar year of something in the area of 88% of the full downside the impact that we talked about previously.
We called that $36 million of EBITDA, as you will recall. And so we'd probably say that we're seeing something like a $32 million EBITDA impact, assuming oil and gas maintains at the level that it is currently.
That is not an unreasonable assumption, given that when we look at our oil and gas branches, we are seeing a slowdown in the decline. In fact, if you look at all of our oil and gas branches, for the month of March and so far in April, we've actually seen a slight sequential increase in fleet on rent in those branches. So that gives us some level of encouragement that the decline has slowed if not, completely arrested. The question is where does it go from from here? And that's going to be the wildcard and we can talk more about that in Q&A, if anybody's interested.
So that's the oil and gas picture at a very high level. The last thing I'd like to update is just the outlook. You saw the announcement, essentially what we do is to take off the top end of the revenue and EBITDA ranges, reduce the expected rental rates realization and left everything else unchanged. And we think that's a very realistic view of where we will be for 2015. So the outlook now is for rental revenue -- excuse me total revenue, total revenue in the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion. And within that, as I said, we expect rental rates to be approximately 3% for the full year. Time, we haven't changed our review, 69% for the full year or an increase of about 20 basis points. And then adjusted EBITDA, we're now in the range of $2,950,000,000 to $3 billion for that measure. We're continuing to target $1.7 billion of gross capital spend for a net of about $1.2 billion and we continue to expect free cash flow to be centered around $750 million, with $725 million on the low side and $775 million on the high side. All of that will net out to our continued expectation of leverage at the end of the year up about 2.6x net debt-to-EBITDA. And that assumes that we complete the share repurchase program at about $500 million in calendar 2015. You all saw that we did spend about $316 million on share repurchases in the first quarter. That brought in about 3.5 million shares at an average price of about $89.16 in the quarter. And we continued to believe that spending on the path of $500 million is the right place to be for right now for 2015. Obviously, we'll continue to reevaluate as we see how profitability and cash flow develop, as well as how the stock price trades.
So those are the key points that I wanted to make and certainly, we welcome all of your questions. It was a solid quarter for us. When you step back and look at the results, with some headwinds that not only had we to deal with in the first quarter, we'll have to continue to deal with going forward. But we've got confidence that we've got a program that can get us to outlook that we've given. And certainly, we'll update you as we go forward. So we with that, operator, I'll ask you to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So the issue has been concentrating in those high share oil and gas branches and we responded there with a deflating of about $80 million so far. The challenge, of course, is putting that fleet on rent usefully elsewhere. We think we stepped up to the challenge. It is more of a challenge in the first part of the year than it will be the second and third quarters in particular, just given the relative business of those quarters compared to first quarter. So we're encouraged by our ability to mitigate by moving fleet around. As to where it's going and sort of the environment that it's facing, you guys want to add anything?"

And that's improving. When you look at the nonoil and gas branches in Q1, they were actually 40 bps up on a year-over-year basis. So if we deliver 3% rate, 79% time, that's a good reason to spend that $1.7 billion. We do have the flexibility in case anything changes, as Bill stated. But we feel good about being able to deploy that, as well as 18 cold starts that we're doing in the full year, many of which are opened already. So actually it's 21, it's 18 specialty and 3 gen rent cold starts that we've already opened up.

If we continue on the path that we're on, that's going to continue to contribute as we go throughout the rest of the year.

And so we accrued up to a much higher level for last year's bonus. This year, assuming we stay and deliver the guidance that we've given, it's going to be less.

We realized what was the number, guys, $7 million of year-to-date impact of our efficiency, our lean focus and that set a run rate of $42 million. So we'll continue to drive that run rate higher and the realized amount higher as we go forward as well. So that's going to contribute and help support the incremental margin. And then I'd say bad debt expense, it's always a little bit of a wildcard but we think that there could an opportunity in bad debt expense as we drive some process change internally to focus on how effectively we collect. So I think those are the things that I'd point to you that give us some confidence that the 60% flow-through margin or flow through that we talked about is very realistic for the year."

It will be 3 quarters of $200 million of impact and 1 quarter at an average of 0 to $200 million. So call it a net effect of $175 million of impact before mitigation. And then the math flows through from there to that 88% or $32 million number that I gave earlier. But the mitigation I want to point out, the mitigation is not included in that calculation. On the $80 million of fleet that came out of oil and gas and went somewhere else, right? We would have to do a separate calculation of the mitigation impact of that and that's why I said that I don't believe it will be a full $32 million impact that we'll experience but something less than that and I tried to range it between $18 million and $36 million. And you'd probably say $18 million and $32 million as the realistic range. So that's how we're thinking about it this year. And obviously, it requires us to continue to mitigate pretty aggressively with the fleet that does come out of oil and gas. And as I pointed out, that's harder to do in the first order of the year, in the first quarter, than it is when things get busy in the second and third quarters. So we're encouraged about our ability to mitigate even more effectively as we go forward.

Today, we'll talk about how we're managing the business in light of our expectations for 2015, with almost 4 months of the year behind us, we've been able",1383,"Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Today, we'll talk about how we're managing the business in light of our expectations for 2015, with almost 4 months of the year behind us, we've been able to draw some conclusions to how this year is shaping up and we'll talk more about that in a minute. And then, Bill will cover the results followed by your questions.
So let's begin with the numbers you saw last night. We had a solid start to the year. Our revenue, EBITDA and return on invested capital were all first quarter records. And that's a credit to our employees. Our rental revenue increased 12% year-over-year based in part on an 8% increase in volume. We generated $602 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 46% margin.
Our return on invested capital improved to 9% and our free cash flow for the quarter was $450 million, more than 60% higher than a year ago. We also reported record adjusted EPS of $1.34 for the quarter.
Now we achieved these results despite some notable headwinds, the most significant constraint was the decline in upstream oil and gas activity. The rapid shutdown of almost 50% of drill rigs had both a direct and knock-on effect. And this was felt most strongly in our pump operations.
The slowdown also happened earlier than expected and we now think it's likely to continue to at least the next 3 to 6 months. We still expect to mitigate the decline within our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and we'll have more opportunity to do that now during the peak seasonality.
Now given the timing of the impact, we felt it was realistic to narrow the ranges of revenue and EBITDA. Our updated revenue range is $6 billion to $6.1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.95 billion to $3 billion. And these ranges still fall within our regional outlook.
Now in addition, in the first quarter, we had a negative currency impact from a relatively weaker Canadian dollar and this will likely impact our year-over-year comparisons throughout 2015. And the harsh winter slowed the pace of projects in several regions where we dealt with historic cold and snow. And with that one, we can safely say that's behind us. But despite these headwinds, we put a record $5.4 billion of OEC-on-Rent in the first quarter in a highly competitive marketplace.
We could leave it at that, but as you know, we're not a company that shies away from looking at numbers from every angle. In the first quarter, the metrics of time utilization and rate merit further discussion. Time utilization decreased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 64%. It hasn't changed our outlook, we're still comfortable with our full year time utilization of approximately 69%. And when we look at branches without any meaningful exposure to upstream oil and gas activity, time utilization was actually up 40 basis points in the quarter.
With pricing, our rate increased 2.9% in the quarter versus last year, and that was lower than expected and we're now anticipating a very competitive rate environment going into the summer months. But I know that our field management feels like I do that these are -- there are actions that we can take to get our prices up. Now coming off the quarter, we now expect our rate increase to be about 3% for the full year instead of the original outlook of 3.5%.
Regardless of any headwinds, we'll continue to transfer underutilized fleet to areas of higher demand where our sales force has more leverage to negotiate rate. And we'll help -- have even more opportunity to get the equipment on rent as we go into our seasonality as it picks up.
We're focused on achieving that optimal balance of metrics that we've talked about before, that is where rate and time utilization intersect to drive returns. We see this as being absolutely essential as we continue to capitalize on the up-cycle. And a large measure is within our control regardless of external developments.
Now let's turn to the marketplace starting with specialty rentals. The organic revenue growth in our specialty segment was 25% in the quarter and EBITDA was up 57%, Trench Safety and Power were particularly strong. Specialty rentals are a high-margin business and it helped drive our fifth consecutive first quarter increase and EBITDA margin company-wide.
We'll expand all of our specialty lines this year with an addition of approximately 18 new branches. This will give us a strategic presence in new trade areas and strengthen our cross-selling abilities.
For a broader perspective, our operating environment continues to match up favorably against last year. Our sales force is reporting high level of project starts, and if anything, our customers are even more optimistic than they were in December.
And this is true of our large national accounts, as well as regional operators and local contractors. We're serving a diverse customer base that has maintained a healthy balance year-over-year going into April. Key accounts represent 65% of our base by revenue. That includes National Accounts at 46% of our base. And our local customers, which we classify as unassigned accounts, ticked up slightly to 35%.
Now turning to geography. On a constant currency basis, all but 1 of our regions had year-over-year growth and that 1 was nearly flat. The Mid-Atlantic, South, Midwest and Mountain West regions had a particularly strong quarter. And I want to give a nod to our industrial team, which has continued to score wins in the downstream energy sector. Energy gets a bad rap right now, but from our perspective, we're seeing some impressive numbers.
We currently have commitments for 8 multibillion-dollar energy projects, 4 of which are underway, 2 are in the third stage and the other 2 will kick off in 2016 and 2018. All of these are 3 to 6-year projects in Texas or Louisiana.
But beyond energy, we're seeing many different sectors pick up. For example, our major infrastructure project -- renovations in Ottawa and Montréal, large stadium projects in Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale and renewables such as wind firms in Kansas. And I want to share something new about Texas, which is a large and diversified markets for us.
If you exclude pump, the increase in rental revenue was in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. That points to a solid demand outside of upstream oil and gas. We've always had to write out some sector-related cycles but the fundamentals of our markets are very strong.
We should see broad-based growth well beyond 2015 as our customers take on more work and secular penetration adds an extra layer of demand. Most industry forecasts supports this view. 1 recent release is the consensus construction report put up by the American Institute of Architects that takes into account 7 major forecasters, including Dodge and Moody's. Report concludes that construction -- commercial construction, which is our bread-and-butter, is forecast to remain on a strong upward trajectory, hotels, office buildings and retail are just some of the areas -- just a few of some of the areas projected to contribute to that growth. And the institutional sector, which had a disappointing decline in 2014, appears to have bottomed out. The consensus is that institutional construction will reverse to a gain in 2015 and climb again in 2016. And that's good news for markets such as health, education and public safety.
So that gives you an idea where we see the challenges and the opportunities in 2015. And to some degree, in 2016 as well. Taking everything into consideration, we remain confident in our full year guidance of adjusted EBITDA of at least $2.95 billion and total revenue of at least $6 billion.
We're balancing these metrics behind those numbers in light of the market dynamics, and we expect to spend $1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx this year as planned. Now in short, we show that we have the right plan, we know we have the right plan in place for 2015. And our strategy for long-term profitable growth remains intact.
So with that, I'll ask Bill to cover the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

We've got a lot to cover here, so I'm going to try and streamline my comments about the actuals so we can save a little time to touch on the refinancings that we did, touch on our oil and gas experience for the first quarter and also the outlook. 
Real briefly on the financials, we had a good revenue result in the quarter. Rental revenue was up by almost 12%, 11.9%, as Mike called out. That's a $119 million, $120 million improvement. And the drivers were as follows: The ancillary and re-rent revenue performance for the quarter was good. We had about a $14 million year-over-year improvement from those 2 combined. The bulk of it being ancillary, pick up delivery and our RPP program, re-rent was just a little better than flat year-over-year. So that was about $14 million of the $120 million.
Within owned equipment revenue, OER, rental rate growth, you saw, was 2.9%. We translate that into about a $26 million improvement over last year. On the volume front, we had 8.1% volume improvement and that translates into about $72 million of volume impact, which I'll note includes the impact of heavy pump this year and not in the first quarter of last year. Also sprinkled throughout volume and some of the other lines is the FX impact that we experienced in the quarter. I'll summarize that at the and.
Inflation, or replacement CapEx inflation, we called at about 2.1% for the quarter and that's a headwind of just under $19 million year-over-year. And then, mix, all other, including some portion of FX, accounted for $27 million year-over-year. That includes the impact, again, of the Pump acquisition as we talked before, Pump not only contributed through the acquisition but has a more attractive mix than the rest of the business. And so that was a significant part of that $27 million.
So those were the key components of the $120 million improvement. And I'll just call out separately, if you aggregate all of the currency impacts, we estimate that currency cost us about $16 million of rental revenue year-over-year. And that certainly is a significant headwind when you think about the growth that we were able to experience.
The only other revenue comment that I'll make is about used equipment sales. We had another good used equipment sales result in the quarter, $116 million. And that's up about 6% from last year. And also, very importantly, a very robust 50.7% adjusted gross margin for the quarter. And as has been the case, that was helped not only by solid pricing in the quarter, pricing as measured by proceeds as a percent of OEC was just under 50% in the quarter, but it also was supported by our continued focus on the retail channel, we get the best result -- margin results there. And so selling about 61% of our used sales through retail channel was a nice support for the results.
Turning quickly to profitability. EBITDA first, adjusted EBITDA of $602.2 million was a company record for the quarter, as Mike pointed out, as was the adjusted EBITDA margin, 45.8% was a very robust margin. So that's $83 million worth of dollar improvement over last year and 170 basis points worth of margin improvement as well. 
Flow through in the quarter was strong at 60.6%. And we'll certainly touch on some of the drivers there in the year-over-year EBITDA bridge. Speaking of which, that $83 million of improvement was driven by volume. Primarily, volume was up about $51 million of the $83 million year-over-year improvement. Rental rates contributed another $24 million toward that $83 million improvement. The cat class mix, primarily from the impact of adding Pump, we would call out at about $14 million of incremental improvement. And then, we also had the improvement from ancillary and re-rent revenues that I called out earlier. That's about a $7 million improvement on the incremental $14 million of revenue that I called out.
We did have a lower incentive compensation accrual for the first quarter this year compared to last year, reflecting some of the headwinds that we experienced with oil and gas, weather and currency. So that contributed $6 million of year-over-year improvement. Used equipment sales, I already called out the sales margin improvement, that was about $5 million of improvement. And then, a few headwind items. The fleet inflation and mix component combined was about a $13 million headwind versus last year. Bad debt expense, we reverted to a more normal bad debt expense this year compared to a solid bad debt expense performance last year. So that cost us about $8 million in year-over-year EBITDA, and then merit increases were about $6 million of impact this year as well. That leaves about $3 million of all other nits and gnats combined. So all in all, a very robust EBITDA result in the quarter, even in spite of the headwinds.
And as Mike called out on EPS, it was a great EPS result for the quarter as well, $1.34. That's up almost 50% against the $0.90 of adjusted EPS that we delivered in the first quarter last year. So another good result there. 
Moving on to free cash flow, continuing the good result commentary. $450 million of free cash flow in the first quarter and that's up from $278 million in the first quarter of last year, with minimal merger-related adjustments showing up in the current quarter, it's only about $1 million worth of merger-related payments. So the way we talk about free cash flow on an adjusted basis, we would call $451 million, a variety of different drivers, including the operating profitability, we also had lower AR and the timing of some of the other working capital payments were also favorable for us, primarily accounts payable.
Rental CapEx for the quarter was $323 million. And that's certainly a start, consistent with the comments we've made previously about the timing of CapEx this year looking similar to last year. As you saw in the outlook, we continue to expect to spend $1.7 billion in gross capital this year for a net of about $1.2 billion. The net rental CapEx in the quarter was just under $210 million for the quarter. 
On capital structure and liquidity, a busy quarter in capital structure actions. You all have seen that we refinanced 2 of our outstanding issues. We issued calls on the 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes and the 5 3/4% senior notes. We refinanced those issues by issuing 2 new issues, $1 billion of 4 5/8% 8-year senior secured notes and then another $800 million worth of 10-year senior unsecured. Very attractive overall impact for those refinancing transactions but we didn't stop there. We also amended and extended our ABL facility and increased its size as well. So the ABL is now up to $2.5 billion. We then drew on that new and improved ABL and used it to partially call the 8 1/4% senior notes. And I go through all of that just to note that the timing of those transactions were split between first quarter and second quarter, and so as you think about the results in the first quarter and as you anticipate the results for the second quarter, you have to remind yourself that we will have some impacts in the second quarter from those first quarter transactions. In particular, we'll report in the second quarter about $121 million loss on the redemptions that covers both the premium of calling the outstanding notes, as well as writing off any remaining deferred financing costs that will happen in the second quarter. When you aggregate it altogether, we expect that the aggregate run rate of interest expense reductions from all those transactions should come in to an improvement of about $48 million a year. So that gives you a summary. And to put it even more directly, our interest expense estimate for cash interest this year, we -- excuse me, GAAP interest, GAAP interest this year, we expect to be about $460 million. So hopefully, that will help you as you think through all those transactions.
Real briefly on ROIC. A company record ROIC result in the quarter, 9%. And that was 120 basis points compared to  first quarter last year and 20 basis points better than in the fourth quarter. So despite all the headwinds, as Michael discussed, we continue to be on a path to improving our ROIC, which has been a major focus of our efforts.
And even with the revised guidance that we provided, we fully expect a very nice improvement in ROIC as we go through the full 2015 year.
Before I finish up with the outlook, just a real brief summary of our progress in oil and gas. We talked in the first quarter about a downside oil and gas scenario. And I just wanted to provide a couple of data points about progress against oil and gas and how we compare to that downside.
Recall that we called out about a $400 million maximum fleet size impact from the downside scenario we laid out. You'll also recall that we said that $400 million impact, we modeled it as hitting us in the second quarter. Obviously, we didn't expect it would be 0 impact until June and then $400 million from June on. But we certainly modeled it that way. So that's $400 million maximum impact, averaged out to a $200 million OEC impact over the course of 2015.
We are about halfway to that $400 million maximum impact, just based on the path of fleet in our oil and gas branches. And in particular, when you look at those oil and gas branches, most of the impact that we've seen has come from the oil and gas branches that have the highest share of their revenue from oil and gas. If the branch has more than 20% of their revenue from oil and gas, in aggregate, those branches have seen about a $200 million equivalent OEC impact. For the branches that have less than 20% of their share in oil and gas, there's been virtually no impact. So we find that to be a very interesting feature of how oil and gas is progressing throughout our branches.
The thing, as Mike pointed out, that surprised us a little bit is that the impact came a little sooner than what we expected. But certainly, not outside the context of the size of what we expected. But the fact that it came sooner means that it will have an effect over the remainder of the year, longer than the way we modeled the downside. So when you net it all together, we're probably seeing an impact through the full 2015 calendar year of something in the area of 88% of the full downside impact that we talked about previously.
We called that $36 million of EBITDA, as you all recall. And so we'd probably say that we're seeing something like a $32 million EBITDA impact, assuming oil and gas maintains at the level that it is currently.
That is not an unreasonable assumption, given that when we look at our oil and gas branches, we are seeing a slowdown in the decline. In fact, if you look at all of our oil and gas branches for the month of March and so far in April, we've actually seen a slight sequential increase in fleet on rent in those branches. So that gives us some level of encouragement that the decline has slowed, if not completely arrested. The question is where does it go from here? And that's going to be the wildcard and we can talk more about that in Q&A, if anybody's interested.
So that's the oil and gas picture at a very high level. The last thing I'd like to update is just the outlook. You saw the announcement, essentially what we do is to take off the top end of the revenue and EBITDA ranges, reduce the expected rental rate realization and left everything else unchanged. And we think that's a very realistic view of where we will be for 2015. So the outlook now is for rental revenue -- excuse me, total revenue, total revenue in the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion. And within that, as I said, we expect rental rates to be approximately 3% for the full year. [indiscernible] we have not changed our view, 69% for the full year or an increase of about 20 basis points. And then, adjusted EBITDA, we're now in the range of $2,950,000,000 to $3 billion for that measure. We're continuing to target $1.7 billion of gross capital spend for a net of about $1.2 billion, and we continue to expect free cash flow to be centered around $750 million, with $725 million on the low side and $775 million on the high side. All of that will net out to our continued expectation of leverage at the end of the year at about 2.6x net debt-to-EBITDA. And that assumes that we complete the share repurchase program at about $500 million in calendar 2015. You all saw that we did spend about $316 million on share repurchase in the first quarter. That brought in about 3.5 million shares at an average price of about $89.16 in the quarter. And we continue to believe that spending on the path to $500 million is the right place to be for right now for 2015. Obviously, we'll continue to reevaluate as we see how profitability and cash flow develop, as well as how the stock price trades.
So those are the key points that I wanted to make. And certainly, we'd welcome all your questions. It was a solid quarter for us, when you step back and look at the results, with some headwinds that not only had we -- to deal with in the first quarter, we'll have to continue to deal with going forward. But we've got confidence that we've got a program that can get us to outlook that we've given. And certainly, we'll update you as we go forward. 
So with that, operator, I'll ask you to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So the issue has been concentrating in those high share oil and gas branches, and we responded there with a de-fleeting of about $80 million so far. The challenge, of course, is putting that fleet on rent usefully elsewhere. We think we stepped up to the challenge. It is more of a challenge in the first part of the year than it will be in the second and third quarters in particular, just given the relative busyness of those quarters compared to first quarter. So we're encouraged by our ability to mitigate by moving fleet around. As to where it's going and sort of the environment that it's facing, you guys want to add anything?"

So if we deliver 3% rate, 79% time, that's a good reason to spend that $1.7 billion. We do have the flexibility in case anything changes, as Bill stated, but we feel good about being able to deploy that, as well as 18 cold starts that we're doing in the full year, many of which are opened already. So -- actually, it's 21, it's 18 specialty and 3 gen rent cold starts that we've already opened up.

So I called out the impact of 1 particular item, bonus accrual difference year-over-year was $6 million in the first quarter. If we continue on the path that we're on, that's going to continue to contribute as we go throughout the rest of the year. In fact, the contribution will increase because last year, we increased our bonus accrual as the year wore on. The second half, we ran very strong versus our plan. And so we accrued up to a much higher level for last year's bonus. This year, assuming we stay and deliver the guidance that we've given, it's going to be less. And so that $6 million will go up a little bit in future quarters. So that will help. And as you know, the incremental margin calculation is very sensitive even to reasonably small dollar amounts. So I think that's one example. To Mike's point, we've got a very intense focus on productivity overall. We realized, what was the number, guys, $7 million of year-to-date impact of our efficiency, our lean focus and that set a run rate of $42 million. So we'll continue to drive that run rate higher and the realized amount higher as we go forward as well. So that's going to contribute and help support the incremental margin. And then, I'd say bad debt expense, it's always a little bit of a wildcard but we think that there could be an opportunity in bad debt expense as we drive some process changes internally to focus on how effectively we collect.

And then, the math flows through from there to that 88% or $32 million number that I gave earlier. But the mitigation I want to point out, the mitigation is not included in that calculation on the $80 million of fleet that came out of oil and gas and went somewhere else, right? We would have to do a separate calculation of the mitigation impact of that. And that's why I said that I don't believe it will be a full $32 million impact that we'll experience but something less than that, and I tried to range it between $18 million and $36 million. And you'd probably say $18 million and $32 million as the realistic range. So that's how we're thinking about it this year. And obviously, it requires us to continue to mitigate pretty aggressively with the fleet that does come out of oil and gas. And as I pointed out, that's harder to do in the first part of the year, in the first quarter, than it is when things get busy in second and third quarters.

Today, we'll talk about how we're managing the business in light of our expectations for 2015, with almost 4 months of the year behind us, we've been able",1383,"Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Today, we'll talk about how we're managing the business in light of our expectations for 2015, with almost 4 months of the year behind us, we've been able to draw some conclusions to how this year is shaping up and we'll talk more about that in a minute. And then, Bill will cover the results followed by your questions.
So let's begin with the numbers you saw last night. We had a solid start to the year. Our revenue, EBITDA and return on invested capital were all first quarter records. And that's a credit to our employees. Our rental revenue increased 12% year-over-year based in part on an 8% increase in volume. We generated $602 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 46% margin.
Our return on invested capital improved to 9% and our free cash flow for the quarter was $450 million, more than 60% higher than a year ago. We also reported record adjusted EPS of $1.34 for the quarter.
Now we achieved these results despite some notable headwinds, the most significant constraint was the decline in upstream oil and gas activity. The rapid shutdown of almost 50% of drill rigs had both a direct and knock-on effect. And this was felt most strongly in our pump operations.
The slowdown also happened earlier than expected and we now think it's likely to continue to at least the next 3 to 6 months. We still expect to mitigate the decline within our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and we'll have more opportunity to do that now during the peak seasonality.
Now given the timing of the impact, we felt it was realistic to narrow the ranges of revenue and EBITDA. Our updated revenue range is $6 billion to $6.1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.95 billion to $3 billion. And these ranges still fall within our regional outlook.
Now in addition, in the first quarter, we had a negative currency impact from a relatively weaker Canadian dollar and this will likely impact our year-over-year comparisons throughout 2015. And the harsh winter slowed the pace of projects in several regions where we dealt with historic cold and snow. And with that one, we can safely say that's behind us. But despite these headwinds, we put a record $5.4 billion of OEC-on-Rent in the first quarter in a highly competitive marketplace.
We could leave it at that, but as you know, we're not a company that shies away from looking at numbers from every angle. In the first quarter, the metrics of time utilization and rate merit further discussion. Time utilization decreased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 64%. It hasn't changed our outlook, we're still comfortable with our full year time utilization of approximately 69%. And when we look at branches without any meaningful exposure to upstream oil and gas activity, time utilization was actually up 40 basis points in the quarter.
With pricing, our rate increased 2.9% in the quarter versus last year, and that was lower than expected and we're now anticipating a very competitive rate environment going into the summer months. But I know that our field management feels like I do that these are -- there are actions that we can take to get our prices up. Now coming off the quarter, we now expect our rate increase to be about 3% for the full year instead of the original outlook of 3.5%.
Regardless of any headwinds, we'll continue to transfer underutilized fleet to areas of higher demand where our sales force has more leverage to negotiate rate. And we'll help -- have even more opportunity to get the equipment on rent as we go into our seasonality as it picks up.
We're focused on achieving that optimal balance of metrics that we've talked about before, that is where rate and time utilization intersect to drive returns. We see this as being absolutely essential as we continue to capitalize on the up-cycle. And a large measure is within our control regardless of external developments.
Now let's turn to the marketplace starting with specialty rentals. The organic revenue growth in our specialty segment was 25% in the quarter and EBITDA was up 57%, Trench Safety and Power were particularly strong. Specialty rentals are a high-margin business and it helped drive our fifth consecutive first quarter increase and EBITDA margin company-wide.
We'll expand all of our specialty lines this year with an addition of approximately 18 new branches. This will give us a strategic presence in new trade areas and strengthen our cross-selling abilities.
For a broader perspective, our operating environment continues to match up favorably against last year. Our sales force is reporting high level of project starts, and if anything, our customers are even more optimistic than they were in December.
And this is true of our large national accounts, as well as regional operators and local contractors. We're serving a diverse customer base that has maintained a healthy balance year-over-year going into April. Key accounts represent 65% of our base by revenue. That includes National Accounts at 46% of our base. And our local customers, which we classify as unassigned accounts, ticked up slightly to 35%.
Now turning to geography. On a constant currency basis, all but 1 of our regions had year-over-year growth and that 1 was nearly flat. The Mid-Atlantic, South, Midwest and Mountain West regions had a particularly strong quarter. And I want to give a nod to our industrial team, which has continued to score wins in the downstream energy sector. Energy gets a bad rap right now, but from our perspective, we're seeing some impressive numbers.
We currently have commitments for 8 multibillion-dollar energy projects, 4 of which are underway, 2 are in the third stage and the other 2 will kick off in 2016 and 2018. All of these are 3 to 6-year projects in Texas or Louisiana.
But beyond energy, we're seeing many different sectors pick up. For example, our major infrastructure project -- renovations in Ottawa and Montréal, large stadium projects in Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale and renewables such as wind firms in Kansas. And I want to share something new about Texas, which is a large and diversified markets for us.
If you exclude pump, the increase in rental revenue was in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. That points to a solid demand outside of upstream oil and gas. We've always had to write out some sector-related cycles but the fundamentals of our markets are very strong.
We should see broad-based growth well beyond 2015 as our customers take on more work and secular penetration adds an extra layer of demand. Most industry forecasts supports this view. 1 recent release is the consensus construction report put up by the American Institute of Architects that takes into account 7 major forecasters, including Dodge and Moody's. Report concludes that construction -- commercial construction, which is our bread-and-butter, is forecast to remain on a strong upward trajectory, hotels, office buildings and retail are just some of the areas -- just a few of some of the areas projected to contribute to that growth. And the institutional sector, which had a disappointing decline in 2014, appears to have bottomed out. The consensus is that institutional construction will reverse to a gain in 2015 and climb again in 2016. And that's good news for markets such as health, education and public safety.
So that gives you an idea where we see the challenges and the opportunities in 2015. And to some degree, in 2016 as well. Taking everything into consideration, we remain confident in our full year guidance of adjusted EBITDA of at least $2.95 billion and total revenue of at least $6 billion.
We're balancing these metrics behind those numbers in light of the market dynamics, and we expect to spend $1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx this year as planned. Now in short, we show that we have the right plan, we know we have the right plan in place for 2015. And our strategy for long-term profitable growth remains intact.
So with that, I'll ask Bill to cover the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

We've got a lot to cover here, so I'm going to try and streamline my comments about the actuals so we can save a little time to touch on the refinancings that we did, touch on our oil and gas experience for the first quarter and also the outlook. 
Real briefly on the financials, we had a good revenue result in the quarter. Rental revenue was up by almost 12%, 11.9%, as Mike called out. That's a $119 million, $120 million improvement. And the drivers were as follows: The ancillary and re-rent revenue performance for the quarter was good. We had about a $14 million year-over-year improvement from those 2 combined. The bulk of it being ancillary, pick up delivery and our RPP program, re-rent was just a little better than flat year-over-year. So that was about $14 million of the $120 million.
Within owned equipment revenue, OER, rental rate growth, you saw, was 2.9%. We translate that into about a $26 million improvement over last year. On the volume front, we had 8.1% volume improvement and that translates into about $72 million of volume impact, which I'll note includes the impact of heavy pump this year and not in the first quarter of last year. Also sprinkled throughout volume and some of the other lines is the FX impact that we experienced in the quarter. I'll summarize that at the and.
Inflation, or replacement CapEx inflation, we called at about 2.1% for the quarter and that's a headwind of just under $19 million year-over-year. And then, mix, all other, including some portion of FX, accounted for $27 million year-over-year. That includes the impact, again, of the Pump acquisition as we talked before, Pump not only contributed through the acquisition but has a more attractive mix than the rest of the business. And so that was a significant part of that $27 million.
So those were the key components of the $120 million improvement. And I'll just call out separately, if you aggregate all of the currency impacts, we estimate that currency cost us about $16 million of rental revenue year-over-year. And that certainly is a significant headwind when you think about the growth that we were able to experience.
The only other revenue comment that I'll make is about used equipment sales. We had another good used equipment sales result in the quarter, $116 million. And that's up about 6% from last year. And also, very importantly, a very robust 50.7% adjusted gross margin for the quarter. And as has been the case, that was helped not only by solid pricing in the quarter, pricing as measured by proceeds as a percent of OEC was just under 50% in the quarter, but it also was supported by our continued focus on the retail channel, we get the best result -- margin results there. And so selling about 61% of our used sales through retail channel was a nice support for the results.
Turning quickly to profitability. EBITDA first, adjusted EBITDA of $602.2 million was a company record for the quarter, as Mike pointed out, as was the adjusted EBITDA margin, 45.8% was a very robust margin. So that's $83 million worth of dollar improvement over last year and 170 basis points worth of margin improvement as well. 
Flow through in the quarter was strong at 60.6%. And we'll certainly touch on some of the drivers there in the year-over-year EBITDA bridge. Speaking of which, that $83 million of improvement was driven by volume. Primarily, volume was up about $51 million of the $83 million year-over-year improvement. Rental rates contributed another $24 million toward that $83 million improvement. The cat class mix, primarily from the impact of adding Pump, we would call out at about $14 million of incremental improvement. And then, we also had the improvement from ancillary and re-rent revenues that I called out earlier. That's about a $7 million improvement on the incremental $14 million of revenue that I called out.
We did have a lower incentive compensation accrual for the first quarter this year compared to last year, reflecting some of the headwinds that we experienced with oil and gas, weather and currency. So that contributed $6 million of year-over-year improvement. Used equipment sales, I already called out the sales margin improvement, that was about $5 million of improvement. And then, a few headwind items. The fleet inflation and mix component combined was about a $13 million headwind versus last year. Bad debt expense, we reverted to a more normal bad debt expense this year compared to a solid bad debt expense performance last year. So that cost us about $8 million in year-over-year EBITDA, and then merit increases were about $6 million of impact this year as well. That leaves about $3 million of all other nits and gnats combined. So all in all, a very robust EBITDA result in the quarter, even in spite of the headwinds.
And as Mike called out on EPS, it was a great EPS result for the quarter as well, $1.34. That's up almost 50% against the $0.90 of adjusted EPS that we delivered in the first quarter last year. So another good result there. 
Moving on to free cash flow, continuing the good result commentary. $450 million of free cash flow in the first quarter and that's up from $278 million in the first quarter of last year, with minimal merger-related adjustments showing up in the current quarter, it's only about $1 million worth of merger-related payments. So the way we talk about free cash flow on an adjusted basis, we would call $451 million, a variety of different drivers, including the operating profitability, we also had lower AR and the timing of some of the other working capital payments were also favorable for us, primarily accounts payable.
Rental CapEx for the quarter was $323 million. And that's certainly a start, consistent with the comments we've made previously about the timing of CapEx this year looking similar to last year. As you saw in the outlook, we continue to expect to spend $1.7 billion in gross capital this year for a net of about $1.2 billion. The net rental CapEx in the quarter was just under $210 million for the quarter. 
On capital structure and liquidity, a busy quarter in capital structure actions. You all have seen that we refinanced 2 of our outstanding issues. We issued calls on the 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes and the 5 3/4% senior notes. We refinanced those issues by issuing 2 new issues, $1 billion of 4 5/8% 8-year senior secured notes and then another $800 million worth of 10-year senior unsecured. Very attractive overall impact for those refinancing transactions but we didn't stop there. We also amended and extended our ABL facility and increased its size as well. So the ABL is now up to $2.5 billion. We then drew on that new and improved ABL and used it to partially call the 8 1/4% senior notes. And I go through all of that just to note that the timing of those transactions were split between first quarter and second quarter, and so as you think about the results in the first quarter and as you anticipate the results for the second quarter, you have to remind yourself that we will have some impacts in the second quarter from those first quarter transactions. In particular, we'll report in the second quarter about $121 million loss on the redemptions that covers both the premium of calling the outstanding notes, as well as writing off any remaining deferred financing costs that will happen in the second quarter. When you aggregate it altogether, we expect that the aggregate run rate of interest expense reductions from all those transactions should come in to an improvement of about $48 million a year. So that gives you a summary. And to put it even more directly, our interest expense estimate for cash interest this year, we -- excuse me, GAAP interest, GAAP interest this year, we expect to be about $460 million. So hopefully, that will help you as you think through all those transactions.
Real briefly on ROIC. A company record ROIC result in the quarter, 9%. And that was 120 basis points compared to  first quarter last year and 20 basis points better than in the fourth quarter. So despite all the headwinds, as Michael discussed, we continue to be on a path to improving our ROIC, which has been a major focus of our efforts.
And even with the revised guidance that we provided, we fully expect a very nice improvement in ROIC as we go through the full 2015 year.
Before I finish up with the outlook, just a real brief summary of our progress in oil and gas. We talked in the first quarter about a downside oil and gas scenario. And I just wanted to provide a couple of data points about progress against oil and gas and how we compare to that downside.
Recall that we called out about a $400 million maximum fleet size impact from the downside scenario we laid out. You'll also recall that we said that $400 million impact, we modeled it as hitting us in the second quarter. Obviously, we didn't expect it would be 0 impact until June and then $400 million from June on. But we certainly modeled it that way. So that's $400 million maximum impact, averaged out to a $200 million OEC impact over the course of 2015.
We are about halfway to that $400 million maximum impact, just based on the path of fleet in our oil and gas branches. And in particular, when you look at those oil and gas branches, most of the impact that we've seen has come from the oil and gas branches that have the highest share of their revenue from oil and gas. If the branch has more than 20% of their revenue from oil and gas, in aggregate, those branches have seen about a $200 million equivalent OEC impact. For the branches that have less than 20% of their share in oil and gas, there's been virtually no impact. So we find that to be a very interesting feature of how oil and gas is progressing throughout our branches.
The thing, as Mike pointed out, that surprised us a little bit is that the impact came a little sooner than what we expected. But certainly, not outside the context of the size of what we expected. But the fact that it came sooner means that it will have an effect over the remainder of the year, longer than the way we modeled the downside. So when you net it all together, we're probably seeing an impact through the full 2015 calendar year of something in the area of 88% of the full downside impact that we talked about previously.
We called that $36 million of EBITDA, as you all recall. And so we'd probably say that we're seeing something like a $32 million EBITDA impact, assuming oil and gas maintains at the level that it is currently.
That is not an unreasonable assumption, given that when we look at our oil and gas branches, we are seeing a slowdown in the decline. In fact, if you look at all of our oil and gas branches for the month of March and so far in April, we've actually seen a slight sequential increase in fleet on rent in those branches. So that gives us some level of encouragement that the decline has slowed, if not completely arrested. The question is where does it go from here? And that's going to be the wildcard and we can talk more about that in Q&A, if anybody's interested.
So that's the oil and gas picture at a very high level. The last thing I'd like to update is just the outlook. You saw the announcement, essentially what we do is to take off the top end of the revenue and EBITDA ranges, reduce the expected rental rate realization and left everything else unchanged. And we think that's a very realistic view of where we will be for 2015. So the outlook now is for rental revenue -- excuse me, total revenue, total revenue in the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion. And within that, as I said, we expect rental rates to be approximately 3% for the full year. [indiscernible] we have not changed our view, 69% for the full year or an increase of about 20 basis points. And then, adjusted EBITDA, we're now in the range of $2,950,000,000 to $3 billion for that measure. We're continuing to target $1.7 billion of gross capital spend for a net of about $1.2 billion, and we continue to expect free cash flow to be centered around $750 million, with $725 million on the low side and $775 million on the high side. All of that will net out to our continued expectation of leverage at the end of the year at about 2.6x net debt-to-EBITDA. And that assumes that we complete the share repurchase program at about $500 million in calendar 2015. You all saw that we did spend about $316 million on share repurchase in the first quarter. That brought in about 3.5 million shares at an average price of about $89.16 in the quarter. And we continue to believe that spending on the path to $500 million is the right place to be for right now for 2015. Obviously, we'll continue to reevaluate as we see how profitability and cash flow develop, as well as how the stock price trades.
So those are the key points that I wanted to make. And certainly, we'd welcome all your questions. It was a solid quarter for us, when you step back and look at the results, with some headwinds that not only had we -- to deal with in the first quarter, we'll have to continue to deal with going forward. But we've got confidence that we've got a program that can get us to outlook that we've given. And certainly, we'll update you as we go forward. 
So with that, operator, I'll ask you to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

And primarily that $80 million has come out of the branches, the more than 20% share of branches that I mentioned earlier. So the issue has been concentrating in those high share oil and gas branches, and we responded there with a de-fleeting of about $80 million so far. The challenge, of course, is putting that fleet on rent usefully elsewhere. We think we stepped up to the challenge. It is more of a challenge in the first part of the year than it will be in the second and third quarters in particular, just given the relative busyness of those quarters compared to first quarter. So we're encouraged by our ability to mitigate by moving fleet around. As to where it's going and sort of the environment that it's facing, you guys want to add anything?"

So if we deliver 3% rate, 79% time, that's a good reason to spend that $1.7 billion. We do have the flexibility in case anything changes, as Bill stated, but we feel good about being able to deploy that, as well as 18 cold starts that we're doing in the full year, many of which are opened already.

If you ask me, which one is the most challenge to move, until we further build out our footprint, we have a headwind to moving the pumps as fast as we move the other more fungible assets. But that was always our game plan when we made the pump acquisition was to grow out that footprint and penetrate other markets, as well as chasing our cross-sell opportunity. You'll see in the slide deck on, I think, it's Slide 35, that we've identified $80 million of cross-sell opportunity. So we don't only have the strategy and hope, we actually have the opportunity to continue to move some of those pumps out of the oil and gas and into existing customers through cross-sell. So stay tuned for what our close rate will be, but there is an opportunity out there that we've identified and that we're chasing. And that will be the last part of the asset class that we need to move more aggressively and it would be the pumps."

So I called out the impact of 1 particular item, bonus accrual difference year-over-year was $6 million in the first quarter. If we continue on the path that we're on, that's going to continue to contribute as we go throughout the rest of the year. In fact, the contribution will increase because last year, we increased our bonus accrual as the year wore on. The second half, we ran very strong versus our plan. And so we accrued up to a much higher level for last year's bonus. This year, assuming we stay and deliver the guidance that we've given, it's going to be less. And so that $6 million will go up a little bit in future quarters. So that will help. And as you know, the incremental margin calculation is very sensitive even to reasonably small dollar amounts. So I think that's one example. To Mike's point, we've got a very intense focus on productivity overall. We realized, what was the number, guys, $7 million of year-to-date impact of our efficiency, our lean focus and that set a run rate of $42 million. So we'll continue to drive that run rate higher and the realized amount higher as we go forward as well. So that's going to contribute and help support the incremental margin. And then, I'd say bad debt expense, it's always a little bit of a wildcard but we think that there could be an opportunity in bad debt expense as we drive some process changes internally to focus on how effectively we collect. So I think, those are the things that I'd point to you that give us some confidence that the 60% flow-through margin or flow through that we talked about is very realistic for the year."

The fact that we've now experienced the equivalent of a $200 million decline for -- now it's going to be 3 quarters, assuming it doesn't get any worse or doesn't get any better.

And then, the math flows through from there to that 88% or $32 million number that I gave earlier. But the mitigation I want to point out, the mitigation is not included in that calculation on the $80 million of fleet that came out of oil and gas and went somewhere else, right? We would have to do a separate calculation of the mitigation impact of that. And that's why I said that I don't believe it will be a full $32 million impact that we'll experience but something less than that, and I tried to range it between $18 million and $36 million. And you'd probably say $18 million and $32 million as the realistic range. So that's how we're thinking about it this year. And obviously, it requires us to continue to mitigate pretty aggressively with the fleet that does come out of oil and gas. And as I pointed out, that's harder to do in the first part of the year, in the first quarter, than it is when things get busy in second and third quarters. So we're encouraged by our ability to mitigate even more effectively as we go forward. Hopefully, that answers it. If not, ask again, George."

With almost 4 months of the year behind us, we've been able",1387,"Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Today, we'll talk about how we're managing the business in light of our expectations for 2015. With almost 4 months of the year behind us, we've been able to draw some conclusions to how this year is shaping up and we'll talk more about that in a minute. And then, Bill will cover the results followed by your questions.
So let's begin with the numbers you saw last night. We had a solid start to the year. Our revenue, EBITDA and return on invested capital were all first quarter records. And that's a credit to our employees. Our rental revenue increased 12% year-over-year based in part on an 8% increase in volume. We generated $602 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 46% margin.
Our return on invested capital improved to 9% and our free cash flow for the quarter was $450 million, more than 60% higher than a year ago. We also reported record adjusted EPS of $1.34 for the quarter.
Now we achieved these results despite some notable headwinds. The most significant constraint was the decline in upstream oil and gas activity. The rapid shutdown of almost 50% of drill rigs had both a direct and knock-on effect. And this was felt most strongly in our pump operations.
The slowdown also happened earlier than expected, and we now think it's likely to continue to at least the next 3 to 6 months. We still expect to mitigate the decline within our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and we'll have more opportunity to do that now during the peak seasonality.
Now given the timing of the impact, we felt it was realistic to narrow the ranges of revenue and EBITDA. Our updated revenue range is $6 billion to $6.1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.95 billion to $3 billion. And these ranges still fall within our original outlook.
Now in addition, in the first quarter, we had a negative currency impact from a relatively weaker Canadian dollar and this will likely impact our year-over-year comparisons throughout 2015. And the harsh winter slowed the pace of projects in several regions where we dealt with historic cold and snow. Now with that one, we can safely say that's behind us. But despite these headwinds, we put a record $5.4 billion of OEC on rent in the first quarter in a highly competitive marketplace.
We could leave it at that, but as you know, we're not a company that shies away from looking at numbers from every angle. In the first quarter, the metrics of time utilization and rate merit further discussion. Time utilization decreased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 64%. It hasn't changed our outlook. We're still comfortable with our full year time utilization of approximately 69%. And when we look at branches without any meaningful exposure to upstream oil and gas activity, time utilization was actually up 40 basis points in the quarter.
With pricing, our rate increased 2.9% in the quarter versus last year, and that was lower than expected and we're now anticipating a very competitive rate environment going into the summer months. But I know that our field management feels like I do, that these are -- there are actions that we can take to get our prices up. Now coming off the quarter, we now expect our rate increase to be about 3% for the full year instead of the original outlook of 3.5%.
Regardless of any headwinds, we'll continue to transfer underutilized fleets to areas of higher demand where our sales force has more leverage to negotiate rate. And we'll help -- have even more opportunity to get the equipment on rent as we go into our seasonality as it picks up.
We're focused on achieving that optimal balance of metrics that we've talked about before, that is where rate and time utilization intersect to drive returns. We see this as being absolutely essential as we continue to capitalize on the up-cycle. And a large measure is within our control regardless of external developments.
Now let's turn to the marketplace starting with specialty rentals. The organic revenue growth in our specialty segment was 25% in the quarter and EBITDA was up 57%. Trench Safety and Power were particularly strong. Specialty rentals are a high-margin business, and it helped drive our fifth consecutive first quarter increase and EBITDA margin company-wide.
We'll expand all of our specialty lines this year with an addition of approximately 18 new branches. This will give us a strategic presence in new trade areas and strengthen our cross-selling abilities.
For our broad perspective, our operating environment continues to match up favorably against last year. Our sales force is reporting high level of project starts, and if anything, our customers are even more optimistic than they were in December.
And this is true of our large national accounts as well as regional operators and local contractors. We're serving a diverse customer base that has maintained a healthy balance year-over-year going into April. Key accounts represent 65% of our base by revenue. That includes National Accounts at 46% of our base. And our local customers, which we classify as unassigned accounts, ticked up slightly to 35%.
Now turning to geography. On a constant currency basis, all but one of our regions had year-over-year growth and that one was nearly flat. The Mid-Atlantic, South, Midwest and Mountain West regions had a particularly strong quarter. And I want to give a nod to our industrial team, which has continued to score wins in the downstream energy sector. Energy gets a bad rap right now, but from our perspective, we're seeing some impressive numbers.
We currently have commitments for 8 multibillion-dollar energy projects, 4 of which are underway, 2 are in the third stage and the other 2 will kick off in 2016 and 2018. All of these are 3- to 6-year projects in Texas or Louisiana.
But beyond energy, we're seeing many different sectors pick up. For example, our major infrastructure renovations in Ottawa and Montréal, large stadium projects in Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale and renewables such as wind firms in Kansas. And I want to share something new about Texas, which is a large and diversified markets for us.
If you exclude Pump, the increase in rental revenue was in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. That points to a solid demand outside of upstream oil and gas. We've always had to ride out some sector-related cycles, but the fundamentals of our markets are very strong.
We should see broad-based growth well beyond 2015 as our customers take on more work and secular penetration adds an extra layer of demand. Most industry forecasts supports this view. One recent release is the consensus construction report put out by the American Institute of Architects, and it takes into account 7 major forecasters, including Dodge and Moody's. The report concludes that construction -- commercial construction, which is our bread-and-butter, is forecast to remain on a strong upward trajectory. Hotels, office buildings and retail are just some of the areas -- just a few of some of the areas projected to contribute to that growth. And the institutional sector, which had a disappointing decline in 2014, appears to have bottomed out. The consensus is that institutional construction will reverse to a gain in 2015 and climb again in 2016. And that's good news for markets such as health, education and public safety.
So that gives you an idea of where we see the challenges and the opportunities in 2015, and to some degree, in 2016 as well. Taking everything into consideration, we remain confident in our full year guidance of adjusted EBITDA of at least $2.95 billion on total revenue of at least $6 billion.
We're balancing these metrics behind those numbers in light of the market dynamics, and we expect to spend $1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx this year as planned. Now in short, we show that we have the right plan -- we know we have the right plan in place for 2015, and our strategy for long-term profitable growth remains intact.
So with that, I'll ask Bill to cover the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."
36005,290468074,792304,"United Rentals, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone.

We've got a lot to cover here, so I'm going to try and streamline my comments about the actuals so we can save a little time to touch on the refinancings that we did, touch on our oil and gas experience for the first quarter and also the outlook. 
Real briefly on the financials, we had a good revenue result in the quarter. Rental revenue was up almost 12%; 11.9%, as Mike called out. That's a $119 million, $120 million improvement and the drivers were as follows: The ancillary and re-rent revenue performance for the quarter was good. We had about a $14 million year-over-year improvement from those 2 combined, the bulk of it being ancillary; pick up delivery and our RPP program. Re-rent was just a little better than flat year-over-year. So that was about $14 million of the $120 million.
Within owned equipment revenue, OER, rental rate growth, you saw, was 2.9%. We translate that into about a $26 million improvement over last year. On the volume front, we had 8.1% volume improvement and that translates into about $72 million of volume impact, which I'll note includes the impact of having Pump this year and not in the first quarter of last year. Also sprinkled throughout volume and some of the other lines is the FX impact that we experienced in the quarter. I'll summarize that at the end.
Inflation, or replacement CapEx inflation, we called at about 2.1% for the quarter and that's a headwind of just under $19 million year-over-year. And then, mix, all other, including some portion of FX, accounted for $27 million year-over-year. That includes the impact, again, of the Pump acquisition, as we've talked before. Pump not only contributed through the acquisition, but has a more attractive mix than the rest of the business. And so that was a significant part of that $27 million.
So those were the key components of the $120 million improvement. And I'll just call out separately, if you aggregate all of the currency impacts, we estimate that currency cost us about $16 million of rental revenue year-over-year. And that certainly is a significant headwind when you think about the growth that we were able to experience.
The only other revenue comment that I'll make is about used equipment sales. We had another good used equipment sales result in the quarter, $116 million. And that's up about 6% from last year. And also, very importantly, a very robust 50.7% adjusted gross margin for the quarter. And as has been the case, that was helped not only by solid pricing in the quarter, pricing as measured by proceeds as a percent of OEC was just under 50% in the quarter, but it also was supported by our continued focus on the retail channel. We get the best result -- margin result there. And so selling about 61% of our used sales through retail channel was a nice support for the results.
Turning quickly to profitability. EBITDA first, adjusted EBITDA of $602.2 million was a company record for the quarter, as Mike pointed out, as was the adjusted EBITDA margin; 45.8% was a very robust margin. So that's $83 million worth of dollar improvement over last year and 170 basis points worth of margin improvement as well. 
Flow through in the quarter was strong at 60.6%. And we'll certainly touch on some of the drivers there in the year-over-year EBITDA bridge. Speaking of which, that $83 million of improvement was driven by volume. Primarily, volume was up about $51 million of the $83 million year-over-year improvement. Rental rates contributed another $24 million toward that $83 million improvement. The cat class mix, primarily from the impact of adding Pump, we would call out at about $14 million of incremental improvement. And then, we also had the improvement from ancillary and re-rent revenues that I called out earlier. That's about a $7 million improvement on the incremental $14 million of revenue that I called out.
We did have a lower incentive compensation accrual for the first quarter this year compared to last year, reflecting some of the headwinds that we experienced with oil and gas, weather and currency. So that contributed $6 million of year-over-year improvement. Used equipment sales, I already called out the sales margin improvement, that was about $5 million of improvement. And then, a few headwind items: The fleet inflation and mix component combined was about a $13 million headwind versus last year. Bad debt expense, we reverted to a more normal bad debt expense this year compared to a solid bad debt expense performance last year. So that cost us about $8 million in year-over-year EBITDA, and then merit increases were about $6 million of impact this year as well. That leaves about $3 million of all other nits and gnats combined. So all in all, a very robust EBITDA result in the quarter, even in spite of the headwinds.
And as Mike called out on EPS, it was a great EPS result for the quarter as well, $1.34. That's up almost 50% against the $0.90 of adjusted EPS that we delivered in the first quarter last year. So another good result there. 
Moving on to free cash flow, continuing the good result commentary. $450 million of free cash flow in the first quarter and that's up from $278 million in the first quarter of last year, with minimal merger-related adjustments showing up in the current quarter. There's only about $1 million worth of merger-related payments. So the way we talk about free cash flow on an adjusted basis, we would call $451 million. A variety of different drivers, including the operating profitability, we also had lower AR and the timing of some of the other working capital payments were also favorable for us, primarily accounts payable.
Rental CapEx for the quarter was $323 million. And that's certainly a start, consistent with the comments we've made previously about the timing of CapEx this year looking similar to last year. As you saw in the outlook, we continue to expect to spend $1.7 billion in gross capital this year for a net of about $1.2 billion. The net rental CapEx in the quarter was just under $210 million for the quarter. 
On capital structure and liquidity, a busy quarter in capital structure actions. You all have seen that we refinanced 2 of our outstanding issues. We issued calls on the 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes and the 5 3/4% senior secured notes. We refinanced those issues by issuing 2 new issues: $1 billion of 4 5/8% 8-year senior secured notes and then another $800 million worth of 10-year senior unsecured. A very attractive overall impact for those refinancing transactions, but we didn't stop there. We also amended and extended our ABL facility and increased its size as well. So the ABL is now up to $2.5 billion. We then drew on that new and improved ABL and used it to partially call the 8 1/4% senior notes. And I go through all of that just to note that the timing of those transactions were split between first quarter and second quarter, and so as you think about the results in the first quarter and as you anticipate the results for the second quarter, you have to remind yourself that we will have some impacts in the second quarter from those first quarter transactions. In particular, we'll report in the second quarter about a $121 million loss on the redemptions that covers both the premium of calling the outstanding notes as well as writing off any remaining deferred financing costs. That will happen in the second quarter. When you aggregate it altogether, we expect that the aggregate run rate of interest expense reductions from all those transactions should come in to an improvement of about $48 million a year. So that gives you a summary. And to put it even more directly, our interest expense estimate for cash interest this year, we -- excuse me, GAAP interest, GAAP interest this year, we expect to be about $460 million. So hopefully, that will help you as you think through all those transactions.
Real briefly on ROIC. A company record ROIC result in the quarter, 9%. And that was 120 basis points compared to first quarter last year and 20 basis points better than in the fourth quarter. So despite all the headwinds, as Michael discussed, we continue to be on a path to improving our ROIC, which has been a major focus of our efforts.
And even with the revised guidance that we provided, we fully expect a very nice improvement in ROIC as we go through the full 2015 year.
Before I finish up with the outlook, just a real brief summary of our progress in oil and gas. We talked in the first quarter about a downside oil and gas scenario. And I just wanted to provide a couple of data points about progress against oil and gas and how we compare to that downside.
Recall that we called out about a $400 million maximum fleet size impact from the downside scenario we laid out. You'll also recall that we said that $400 million impact, we modeled it as hitting us in the second quarter. Obviously, we didn't expect it would be 0 impact until June and then $400 million from June on. But we certainly modeled it that way. So that $400 million maximum impact averaged out to a $200 million OEC impact over the course of 2015.
We are about half way to that $400 million maximum impact, just based on the path of fleet in our oil and gas branches. And in particular, when you look at those oil and gas branches, most of the impact that we've seen has come from the oil and gas branches that have the highest share of their revenue from oil and gas. If the branch has more than 20% of their revenue from oil and gas, in aggregate, those branches have seen about a $200 million equivalent OEC impact. For the branches that have less than 20% of their share in oil and gas, there's been virtually no impact. So we find that to be a very interesting feature of how oil and gas is progressing throughout our branches.
The thing, as Mike pointed out, that surprised us a little bit is that the impact came a little sooner than what we expected, but certainly, not outside the context of the size of what we expected. But the fact that it came sooner means that it will have an effect over the remainder of the year, longer than the way we modeled the downside. So when you net it all together, we're probably seeing an impact through the full 2015 calendar year of something in the area of 88% of the full downside impact that we talked about previously.
We called that $36 million of EBITDA, as you all recall. And so we'd probably say that we're seeing something like a $32 million EBITDA impact, assuming oil and gas maintains at the level that it is currently.
That is not an unreasonable assumption, given that when we look at our oil and gas branches, we are seeing a slowdown in the decline. In fact, if you look at all of our oil and gas branches for the month of March and so far in April, we've actually seen a slight sequential increase in fleet on rent in those branches. So that gives us some level of encouragement that the decline has slowed, if not completely arrested. The question is where does it go from here? And that's going to be the wildcard and we can talk more about that in Q&A, if anybody's interested.
So that's the oil and gas picture at a very high level. The last thing I'd like to update is just the outlook. You saw the announcement. Essentially what we do is to take off the top end of the revenue and EBITDA ranges, reduce the expected rental rate realization and left everything else unchanged. And we think that's a very realistic view of where we will be for 2015. So the outlook now is for rental -- excuse me, total revenue, total revenue in the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion. And within that, as I said, we expect rental rates to be approximately 3% for the full year. Time ute, we have not changed our view, 69% for the full year or an increase of about 20 basis points. And then, adjusted EBITDA, we're now in the range of $2,950,000,000 to $3 billion for that measure. We're continuing to target $1.7 billion of gross capital spend for a net of about $1.2 billion, and we continue to expect free cash flow to be centered around $750 million, with $725 million on the low side and $775 million on the high side. All of that will net out to our continued expectation of leverage at the end of the year at about 2.6x net debt-to-EBITDA. And that assumes that we complete the share repurchase program at about $500 million in calendar 2015. You all saw that we did spend about $316 million on share repurchase in the first quarter. That brought in about 3.5 million shares at an average price of about $89.16 in the quarter. And we continue to believe that spending on the path to $500 million is the right place to be for right now for 2015. Obviously, we'll continue to reevaluate as we see how profitability and cash flow develop, as well as how the stock price trades.
So those are the key points that I wanted to make and certainly, would welcome all your questions. It was a solid quarter for us, when you step back and look at the results, with some headwinds that not only had we -- to deal with in the first quarter, we'll have to continue to deal with going forward. But we've got confidence that we've got a program that can get us to the outlook that we've given. And certainly, we'll update you as we go forward. 
So with that, operator, I'll ask you to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So the issue has been concentrated in those high share oil and gas branches, and we responded there with a de-fleeting of about $80 million so far. The challenge, of course, is putting that fleet on rent usefully elsewhere. We think we stepped up to the challenge. It is more of a challenge in the first part of the year than it will be in the second and third quarters in particular, just given the relative busyness of those quarters compared to first quarter. So we're encouraged by our ability to mitigate by moving fleet around. As to where it's going and sort of the environment that it's facing, you guys want to add anything?"

If we continue on the path that we're on, that's going to continue to contribute as we go throughout the rest of the year. In fact, the contribution will increase because last year, we increased our bonus accrual as the year wore on. The second half, we ran very strong versus our plan. And so we accrued up to a much higher level for last year's bonus. This year, assuming we stay and deliver the guidance that we've given, it's going to be less. And so that $6 million will go up a little bit in future quarters. So that will help. And as you know, the incremental margin calculation is very sensitive even to reasonably small dollar amounts. So I think that's one example. To Mike's point, we've got a very intense focus on productivity overall. We realized -- what was the number, guys? -- $7 million of year-to-date impact of our efficiency, our lean focus and that set a run rate of $42 million. So we'll continue to drive that run rate higher and the realized amount higher as we go forward as well. So that's going to contribute and help support the incremental margin. And then, I'd say bad debt expense, it's always a little bit of a wildcard, but we think that there could be an opportunity in bad debt expense as we drive some process changes internally to focus on how effectively we collect. So I think, those are the things that I'd point to you that give us some confidence that the 60% flow-through margin or flow through that we talk about is very realistic for the year."

And then, $60 million revenues on 60% EBITDA flow-through gets you to the $36 million EBITDA downside.

The fact that we've now experienced the equivalent of a $200 million decline for -- now it's going to be 3 quarters, assuming it doesn't get any worse or doesn't get any better. It will be 3 quarters at $200 million of impact and 1 quarter at an average of 0 to $200 million. So call it a net effect of $175 million of impact before mitigation. And then, the math flows through from there to that 88% or $32 million number that I gave earlier. But the mitigation -- I want to point out, the mitigation is not included in that calculation on the $80 million of fleet that came out of oil and gas and went somewhere else, right? We would have to do a separate calculation of the mitigation impact of that. And that's why I said that I don't believe that it will be a full $32 million impact that we'll experience but something less than that, and I tried to range it between $18 million and $36 million. And you'd probably say $18 million and $32 million as the realistic range. So that's how we're thinking about it this year. And obviously, it requires us to continue to mitigate pretty aggressively with the fleet that does come out of oil and gas. And as I pointed out, that's harder to do in the first part of the year, in the first quarter, than it is when things get busy in second and third quarters. So we're encouraged by our ability to mitigate even more effectively as we go forward. Hopefully, that answers it. If not, ask again, George."

I want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. 
I want to focus most of my comments today on the dynamics of our operating environment, I'll discuss how our industry is adjusting to the recovery and I'll talk about the nonresidential construction is hitting its stride, particularly in the commercial sector. And then Bill will cover the financial results followed by your questions.
So first, look at the quarter. We turned in a solid performance with nice gains and profitability, margin and returns. Our EBITDA margin increased over 49% in the quarter, and we reported earnings per share of $1.95 on an adjusted basis. And these were both second quarter record for us.
Free cash flow is very strong at $432 million through June. Now taking into an entirety, these numbers reflect the fundamental strength of our operating environment. There's clear evidence of demand for our equipment and demand is growing.
However, taking individually, 2 of the underlying metrics reflects some challenges in our environment, their rate and time utilization. They came in softer than expected at 1.5% higher year-over-year, and time utilization was down 150 basis points to 66.6%.
And it's important to understand what these numbers do and don't represent. For 1 thing, they do not reflect the macro weakness in demand. Now we spent a lot of time analyzing industry behavior, and we believe that rental demand in North America has multiple years of growth ahead.
We also think that 2016 will be even stronger than 2015 for our end markets and that the growth will be led by nonresidential construction spending. And that's what most industry experts believe, and we agree.
Now what the metrics point to are 2 dynamics that are more like micro cycles within our larger operating environment. These dynamics will run their course but right now, they're not doing us any favors.
The first issue is upstream oil and gas. Last quarter, we told you this sector was a significant constraint with both a direct and knock-on-effect. And I'll give you an idea of the impact in the second quarter. If we exclude the branches with the most exposure of upstream oil and gas, time utilization was only down 30 basis points year-over-year and sequential rates was slightly positive.
In April, we said, we thought this sector would continue to be a drag on numbers to at least the third quarter. So it's no surprise that we're still dealing with that challenge, particularly in our pump operations.
So obviously, there's not much we can do about the price of oil but we are taking actions. So far, we've are deployed over $125 million of fleet away from the Upstream oil and gas markets and will continue to use this lever where we see the opportunity for higher returns.
The second dynamic is on the supply side, where it's more of a timing issue with our industry as a whole. Right now, Rouse will tell you that there are some excess fleet that needs to be absorbed into the marketplace. It's not unusual for our industry to add fleet in an and do so slightly in advance of the demand.
In this case, however, the imbalance was exaggerated by the decline of upstream oil and gas. This will allow but until that happens, it continue to be a drag on rates and digitalization.
Our own plan is to invest $1.6 billion of gross CapEx this year, which is $100 million less than our original projection. Now why we've taken that number down, it's still represents plenty of growth CapEx to serve our large accounts and to expand our high-margin specialty business.
On the other side of CapEx management, we used equipment sales, the market is growing strong. Used sales continue to be an important mechanism for us in fleet management.
In the second quarter, our adjusted margin on used sales was a robust 50%, which is an increase over last year. Now giving these various considerations, we're being realistic about the short-term impact on our performance.
And as you saw last night, we lowered our expectation on rate to a 0.5% gain. Time utilization target is now approximately 67.5% and we've adjust our revenue and EBITDA ranges accordingly.
At the same time, we expect free cash flow to remain very strong. Now one of the clear about our higher than its outlook as it always are with any guidance we give. I think you know by know that our nature is to be hungry for more. And in this case, if there's more rate, we're going to find it.
We have a lot of runway ahead of us in this cycle, secular penetration is still in play and commercial construction is nowhere near its peak. Global Insight is forecasting solid growth for the U.S. rental industry this year, followed by similar increases in 2016 and 2017. And see the construction market growing for at least the next 3 years.
At the same time, we're careful to maintain our company in a strong position to handle any issues that can arise. We've been building our scale, technology, processes, our scale sets for nearly 2 decades. And even if the environment throws us a curveball, we can handle it. In fact, we're better equipped to handle it now than any time in our history.
From our current vantage point, the cycle is right on track. We're finding the customers are bullish about their prospects and the level of activity activity seems to bear that out. In some case, we're hearing about project backlogs that are approaching prerecession levels. I'll give you a few snapshots from the field.
In our mid-Atlantic region, where we had double-digit growth in the quarter, won a nuclear Power presents, roads, bridges and industrial manufacturing plants. In the Southeast, we're seeing government projects start-up as well as health care construction and highway expansion. Florida has picked up. And customers are saying they expect a strong finish to the year, with upside into 2016. And in the Midwest, where heavy rains and a labor shortage delayed some bridge construction starts, we still had solid growth. And we're now seeing a range of projects get underway, including a fertilizer plants, manufacturing and commercial buildings. And should give us momentum right through the winter.
Turning to our specialty segment.
Trench Safety, Power & HVAC, all had a stellar quarter. Trench Safety revenue was up 15% year-over-year and Power posted 39% growth.
Our specialty segment got a boost from 10 new branches we opened in the first half the year and we plan to open another 8 before the year-end. But this segment is also generating solid growth organically.
All of the 15% growth in Trench in the quarter came from same-store performance, and Power and HVAC had 27% same-store growth.
Now in addition to being important revenue streams in their own right, specialty rentals have a role in strengthening our key customer relationships. The larger customer, the more likely that the rental needs extend beyond the basics and we're doing a good job of ramping up our cross-selling efforts to serve these accounts were completely. And in a the process, we're building loyalty that holds up in the competitive pressure.
National Accounts are good example. In the year-over-year in Q2, we grew our cross-sell revenue by almost 30% with National Accounts. In the second quarter, we grew our rental revenue in the same group by more than 7%.
So highlighting a steady shape and we're being extremely disciplined our business development efforts. Finally, I want to mention our share repurchase plans. As we announced last night, we're accelerating the $750 million program we initiated last year. We now expect to complete that program before year-end, and then we'll start a new program for additional $1 billion of share repurchases.
It's a sign of our confidence in our future earning power and our commitment to returning value to our stockholders. 
Now on closing, I want to come back on our operating environment and in many levers we have in our disposal. We used these levers and the inherent strengths of our strategic to manage our business to the best possible outcomes. And in the second quarter, you saw the benefit of the organic and inorganic blues we made, our focus on operational excellence, our efficient cost structure and our ability to use scale to our advantage, all of which contributed to a strong financial performance in many respects.
While we'll continue to take the decisive actions where we see opportunity to build on these results and generate even higher returns. So with that, come I'll ask Bill to cover the financial results and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."
36005,306283089,836688,"United Rentals, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that most of you have seen in the press release or heard in Mike's remarks.Starting with rental revenue. Rental revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% year-ove",2258,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that most of you have seen in the press release or heard in Mike's remarks.
Starting with rental revenue. Rental revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% year-over-year, that's $42 million of an increase. Within that increase, owned equipment revenue represented 3.7% year-over-year growth or for about $37 million of that $42 million.
The remaining rounded $4 million was ancillary and re-rent items, which were up nicely over the prior year. Within the OER growth, rental rate, the 1.5% year-over-year rental rate that we delivered in the quarter, equates to about $16 million of the $42 million year-over-year growth. The volume growth, 2.8% volume growth represents about $29 million worth of rental revenue growth year-over-year.
The replacement CapEx we sold -- the replacement CapEx average age of 86.9 months in the quarter, inflating that out over the average life -- those life of equipment that we sold resulting in about 1.9% or $20 million of rental revenue headwind in the quarter.
And that leaves about $12 million of mix and other impacts resulting from the strong growth in specialty and other mix effects throughout the business. So those are the key components of the $42 million year-over-year rental revenue growth. The only other point that I would emphasize is that Canadian currency effects equates throughout all of those lines, with the exception of rental rate. Canadian dollars was weaker by 11% in the quarter and that resulted in about $15 million of headwind in the quarter compared to last year. So significant component to the overall performance.
That said, we still delivered the 3.5% in spite in spite of that particular challenge.
Moving to used equipment sales. We generated $124 million of proceeds from used sales in the quarter. That's down about 10% from the second quarter of last year. And even though the total revenue was down, the margin performance was very good. 50% adjusted margin for our used equipment sales activity. That's 140 basis points better than the prior year. And particularly proud about the fact that we were able to do that while still supporting the overall fleet strategy of selling the oldest fleet, as I mentioned earlier, just under 87 months of average age per fleet told.
Continue to do a good job of disposing of used equipments for our retail channel. Retail represented just over 60% of our sales in the quarter. And that was about 1% better than the share that it represented last year. So a good used equipment result, even a little bit with a slight year-over-year decline.
If we move to adjusted EBITDA. We delivered $706 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. That set a margin of 49.4%, both the records for the second quarter for our company.
That's $43 million of improvement year-over-year and $200 million of greater -- excuse me 200 basis points of greater margin from second quarter last year.
The components of that $43 million improvement year-over-year are as follows: The rental rate improvement resulted in about $15 million of year-over-year EBITDA improvement; volume is about $20 million of improvement; and the ancillary that I called out earlier, all of that $4 million revenue improvement drops to an EBITDA improvement. So nice results there.
Working against these, fleet inflation resulted in about $14 million of impact at EBITDA, and used sales year-over-year was about $5 million of impact at EBITDA, both representing headwinds.
We also had year-over-year bad debt expense increase, so that was a headwind of about $10 million. Didn't represent a problem or challenge in bad debt collections this year. It's just that the comparison period last year was so strong. Last year, we had a really nice collection result, along with an improvement in the aging buckets of our accounts receivable that really took down our bad debt expense last year.
Instead of compensation, was one of the adjustments that we have made in order to offset some of the challenges that Mike mentioned, our incentive comp benefited us year-over-year to the tune of about $18 million for the cash incentive compensation programs across the business. So that was an $18 million benefit. And it helped to offset some of the headwinds that I mentioned previously.
Merit increases are always there. They were about $6 million of headwind for the quarter. And the remainder, which is about a total of $20 million represents mix and other benefits. Of that $20 million, about $10 million is pure mix, whether it's mix from growing specialty, cat class mix, day, week, months mix, all of those mix factors net out to about $10 million of benefit year-over-year. And that leaves about $10 million of all other, which encompasses a wide variety of net benefit. So within that all other, we had fuel low cost saves with the lower price of diesel and gasoline. We had lower professional fees year-over-year, lower T&E and that's where you would see the benefit of our lean and other productivity focused programs.
So those are the pieces of the $43 million of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. And here again, I'll call out the impact of currency, which is scattered throughout a number of those lines. When you step back and aggregate it all, currency cost us an unfavorable impact in the quarter about $7 million versus last year.
Flow-through for the quarter, the top line number was very robust, 143%. But I'll remind you that does include the impact of the incentive compensation. If you adjust for that incentive comp, the $18 million, you get that flow-through down to about 83%. I'd also point out that the flow-through was helped by the fact that our year-over-year used equipment sales were lower. We're selling used equipments at roughly 50% margin. That's lower than our margin for the rental business. So when you take out used equipment, you're actually helping the overall flow-through. If you adjust for that used equipment effect, you'll get flow-through that was down around 70%, and still a nice result of 70% in any given quarter. It's more in line with the roughly 6% that we've guided to for the full year.
Looking at adjusted EBITDA. We delivered $1.95 of adjusted EPS -- excuse me adjusted EPS for the quarter. That compares to $1.65 in the second quarter of last year. That's an 18% increase year-over-year. And as I've pointed out for the other measures, it also includes the impact of currency. Absent currency, it would have been about $0.04 higher.
Moving to free cash flow. Year-to-date, we generated free cash flow of $432 million. That includes $2 million of merger-related payments and that compares to $240 million on a comparable basis for the first 6 months of 2014.
The driver of the increase was largely the result of the year-over-year improvement in EBITDA performance, as well as some benefits in other lines, including a variety of other items.
CapEx in the quarter was $693 million and that brings the total first 6 months capital spend for this year to just over $1 billion. And that leaves our net rental CapEx for the second quarter and first 6 months at $570 million and $776 million, respectively.
If we move to capital structure and liquidity. As you know, we took several steps to improve our capital structure in the first quarter with refinancing issues. We issued 2 new notes totaling about $1.8 billion and called a comparable amount of notes out of 3 different issues, either fully or partially during the first quarter.
And as I noted on the first call, the actual settlement for those transactions would happen in the second quarter. And indeed in this quarter, we record a charge of approximately $121 million to cover the redemption and write-off of other amortized cost in the quarter.
The details of all those transactions are in our 10-Q and I'll refer you there if you'd like to see more.
As of June 30, our total liquidity sat at $880 million. And that included a ABL capacity of about $680 million, along with the cash balance of right at $200 million. So we feel we're very well positioned with liquidity.
Mike mentioned the share repurchase program but just to hit a couple of points there. We did continue to execute under the $750 million current authorization during the quarter. We bought $155 million worth of shares. And that brings our total purchases against that program through June 30 up to $573 million, which leaves us with about $177 million to complete that program. Our initial target was that, that program would run until about April 2016. But given our performance, especially the robust cash flow performance as is ruling in this year, we accelerated our time line and now expect to finish that program by the end of this year.
And us Michael also mentioned, we have announced that our board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. That program gram will begin after we've completed the current $750 million program. We put an 18-month time line on execution of the $1 billion, so the 18-month clock will start once we start purchasing under this program.
One thing to mention regarding our share repurchase program. We do have to be mindful of limitations on restricted payment transactions that are inherent in many of our debt notes. As I'm sure most of you are familiar, RP limitations are typical in these notes. And typically, give you a basket, which deals with net income. So as you grow net income, you build up a basket basket gets depleted with RB transactions, of which share repurchases represent 1 type.
At the end of June, we had roughly $400 million of available capacity for executing repurchase or other restricted payments. That $400 million includes the RP basket along with the cash capacity that we have at the hauling company level, which is outside of the respective payment limitations of the operating note issues.
So we have plenty of room. sure and swift we have plenty of room to complete the $750 million program this year and to get deep into the $1 billion program as we execute it over the course of the next 18-months-plus.
On ROIC, the ROIC was for the quarter was 8.9%. And that was an increase of 80 basis points over last year although down slightly from the first quarter sequentially in this year. And the decline really was the result of the way that we calculate ROIC. We use a 5-point average for the IC component in the denominator and then as you cross over the quarter, that includes pump in that 5-point average versus [indiscernible] it had a slight impact on our ROIC on a sequential basis. So certainly, we continue to be in the path as the year-over-year number indicates toward improving our ROIC performance. And as all of you know, that's a very intense focus of our company.
Regarding the outlook for 2015, again, Mike hit most of the key components, but I'll are just add a little bit more color. Our total revenue range is now $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion. Within that, rental revenue will be driven by rate and time utilization assumptions that we've revised. So rate, we now expect up [ph] about 0.5% year-over-year and really, that rate assumptions reflects a very heavily the experience that we've had so far this year.
Time utilization also reflect that experience. Now expect the full year to come in at about 57.5%. And those will result in an adjusted EBITDA a range of about $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion. We have reduced our capital spending plan for the year by $100 million. So net gross capital we now expect to spend about $1.6 billion. And we think this line is -- this change is in line with what we've been focused on very recently, which is the be very disciplined around our CapEx spend.
Free cash flow, we've maintained our range there at $725 million to $775 million. And if we deliver that, we expect the year to end with adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.8x. That's slightly higher than the 2.6x that we've shared in the past. It clearly reflects the decrease in adjusted EBITDA, but it also assumes now the accelerated completion of the $750 million share repurchase program by the end of this year.
So those are the key comments I wanted to make. I just want to reemphasize a couple of the point that Mike made. It is a solid quarter for us, albeit, some headwinds that were more challenging that we certainly expected. Our Upstream oil and gas, that impacts will continue to work through but it just a matter of working through it rather than it being a major impact to the company's longer-term future.
The supply dynamic across the industry is one that we're also focused and making sure that we're focused on adjusting profitably to what we see as a short-term supply dynamic. And, of course, currency is another effect that will continue to play in our future coming up.
But with all of that, the results that we delivered in the quarter represent what I think are our really solid performance, record revenue, record EBITDA, record EBITDA margin, record EPS, all put us in a great position for the future. 
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open us up for questions and answers. Operator?"

I think framing it -- I hit in my comments and Mike hit it as well. There is the dynamic of oil and gas is a major factor that we continue to work through, but we feel like we are making good progress and working through it. The industry as well is working through it and I think over time, they will as long as there's not a major down leg on oil and gas drilling activity. Given what we we've seen and we've put some more information in our investor deck to share with you the trends that we've seen in oil and gas activity. We think that the impact from oil and gas is stabilizing and even if it goes down a little bit more, it's not going to be a major change from here. The supply dynamic is one that I think we're also very focused on. Some of the midsized and smaller players according to the data that we've seen from Rouse and elsewhere have been growing your fleets in the early part of this year. What we've have seen and heard more recently, let's call it over the last couple of months, is that they are much more attuned to the challenges that the oil and gas dynamic have put to the industry. And so people are no focused more on making more disciplined decisions, we believe, around their supply in the current environment. So that's what frames our thinking that we could work through this supply access, if you will, in the relatively near-term, couple that with the overall demand backdrop that we talked so that will get through this and time should be better going ahead.

I just -- given the rate and utilization outlook that we're looking at for the for third and fourth quarter, I'm just trying to reconcile why wouldn't you bring the CapEx down further at least for the second half of this year. And as kind of a tie-in into that question, you brought your long-term -- longer-term rate guidance down from 3% to 2%.

It's a great question and it's one that we've been debated internally here for the last few weeks, actually, I would to the last few months.

It's a great question and it's one that we've been debated internally here for the last few weeks, actually, I would to the last few months. But I think we have to start, let me break down the CapEx for you, to begin with. Of the $1.6 billion of rental CapEx, if you take away the inflation adjusted replacement CapEx of $1.14 billion, that leaves you with the growth capital of about $460 million. This is all seen in our investor deck that we have out there. We will spend of that $460 million, we'll spend $70 million of that this year to refurbishments and to our -- for our rental assets and the investments in our GPS our telematics for the fleet. So this is rounded. And that -- this leaves us about $400 million. That is split evenly between our specialty business and our-centric business. As I mentioned, our specialty business is doing quite well, and we're funding the 10 [ph] starts that we started. We have a more to go this year. That's a high-margin business, high return. And it also provides an entanglement with our customer base. So now we're talking about roughly $200 million for the Gen Rent. And we're funding the growth really goes into our national key accounts business, we've had some new wins and we're also investing in high time you devised assets. But when you think about investment, we don't think about just as a point in time, we're investing in what we think is a cycle that has multiple years of growth ahead of us. And I also want to point out, you mentioned us dropping our CapEx this year. I'll point out in the investor deck that we also dropped it going into next year and that's always subject to change. Just as the -- as we go through this year, and we think about next year and when we go into December and when we come out of the investment community, we'll update you. If we think that the worst is behind us completely and there's some rational behavior is going on, and we can see more, we're going to post more. But that said, we're actually very comfortable with our investment plan. As far as the rates are concerned, just to addressed that, yes, you're right, it declined. And if you recall, when it talked about rate, people are asking me -- used to ask me when we were coming out of every session, Mike, how do you see this? Will we went price margins improve NUC utilization then rate. Rate has been impacted but time utilization because of the influx, we're working through that as we go through the back half of this year. Now I will tell you, quite honestly, Seth, if we have put adjust next year, we will. But I just don't think about it as a point in time. I think it is a continuum because if we buy these assets for the life cycle and it's really comes on to a judgment call. And this is how we debated this and this is where we came out. And we're comfortable with it at this point in time."

But what we want to fund the additional cold starts growth as well as candidly, not fire sell assets that have plenty of time light left on them and will have value for us long-term as we see these other recovery for that business production investment we made for it longer-term. So that's half of that 130 bps of year-over-year decline. Bill have pointed out we moved $125 million of assets out of the oil and gas. That's only 2/3 what we have to do. We have about another $60 million that we have to move out in the balance of this quarter. And we've had action plans, individual assets identified. When you tie those 2 components together, those are -- that's the drag, that's the 1.3 year-over-year drag that we're dealing with.

I'll discuss how our industry is adjusting to the",1489,"Well, thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. I want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. 
I want to focus most of my comments today on the dynamics of our operating environment. I'll discuss how our industry is adjusting to the recovery. And I'll talk about the nonresidential construction is hitting its stride, particularly in the commercial sector. And then Bill will cover the financial results followed by your questions.
So first, look at the quarter. We turned in a solid performance with nice gains and profitability, margin and returns. Our EBITDA margin increased over 49% in the quarter, and we reported earnings per share of $1.95 on an adjusted basis. And these were both second quarter records for us.
Free cash flow is very strong at $432 million through June. Now taking it into an entirety, these numbers reflect the fundamental strength of our operating environment. There's clear evidence of demand for our equipment and demand is growing.
However, taken individually, 2 of the underlying metrics reflects some challenges in our environment: the rate and time utilization. They came in softer than expected at 1.5% higher year-over-year, and time utilization was down 150 basis points to 66.6%.
And it's important to understand what these numbers do and don't represent. For one thing, they do not reflect the macro weakness in demand. Now we spent a lot of time analyzing industry behavior, and we believe that rental demand in North America has multiple years of growth ahead.
We also think that 2016 will be even stronger than 2015 for our end markets and that the growth will be led by nonresidential construction spending. And that's what most industry experts believe, and we agree.
Now what the metrics point to are 2 dynamics that are more like micro cycles within our larger operating environment. These dynamics will run their course. But right now, they're not doing us any favors.
The first issue is upstream oil and gas. Last quarter, we told you this sector was a significant constraint with both a direct and knock-on effect. 
And I'll give you an idea of the impact in the second quarter. If we exclude the branches with the most exposure of upstream oil and gas, time utilization was only down 30 basis points year-over-year and sequential rates were slightly positive.
In April, we said we thought this sector would continue to be a drag on numbers to at least the third quarter. So it's no surprise that we're still dealing with that challenge, particularly in our pump operations.
So obviously, there's not much we can do about the price of oil, but we are taking action. So far, we've redeployed over $125 million of fleet away from the upstream oil and gas markets, and we'll continue to use this lever where we see the opportunity for higher returns.
The second dynamic is on the supply side, where it's more of a timing issue with our industry as a whole. Right now, Rouse will tell you that there's some excess fleet in rally yards that needs to be absorbed into the marketplace. It's not unusual for our industry to add fleet in an upturn and to do so slightly in advance of the demand.
In this case, however, the imbalance was exaggerated by the decline of upstream oil and gas. This will allow [ph]. But until that happens, it continues to be a drag on rates and utilization.
Our own plan is to invest $1.6 billion of gross CapEx this year, which is $100 million less than our original projection. And while we've taken that number down, it's still represents plenty of growth CapEx to serve our large accounts and to expand our high-margin specialty business.
On the other side of CapEx management, used equipment sales, the market is going strong. Used sales continue to be an important mechanism for us in fleet management.
In the second quarter, our adjusted margin on used sales was a robust 50%, which is an increase over last year. By giving these various considerations, we're being realistic about the short-term impact on our performance.
And as you saw last night, we lowered our expectation on rate to a 0.5% gain. Our time utilization target is now approximately 67.5% and we've adjusted our revenue and EBITDA ranges accordingly.
At the same time, we expect free cash flow to remain very strong. Now I want to be clear about our sites set higher than its outlook, as it always are with any guidance we give. I think you know by now that our nature is to be hungry for more. And in this case, if there's more rate, we're going to find it.
We have a lot of runway ahead of us in this cycle. Secular penetration is still in play and commercial construction is nowhere near its peak. Global Insight is forecasting solid growth for the U.S. rental industry this year followed by similar increases in 2016 and 2017, and Dodge sees the construction market growing for at least the next 3 years.
At the same time, we're careful to maintain our company in a strong position to handle any issue that could arise. We've been building our scale, technology, processes, our skill sets for nearly 2 decades. And even if the environment throws us a curveball, we can handle it. In fact, we're better equipped to handle it now than any time in our history.
From our current vantage point, the cycle is right on track. We're finding the customers are bullish about their prospects and the level of activity seems to bear that out. In some cases, we're hearing about project backlogs that are approaching prerecession levels. Now here, I'll give you a few snapshots from the field.
In our mid-Atlantic region, where we had double-digit growth in the quarter for our nuclear power presents, roads, bridges and industrial manufacturing plants. In the Southeast, we're seeing government projects start up as well as health care construction and highway expansion. Florida has picked up, and customers are saying they expect a strong finish to the year with upside into 2016. And in the Midwest, where heavy rains and a labor shortage delayed some bridge construction starts, we still had solid growth. And we're now seeing a range of projects get underway, including a fertilizer plant, auto manufacturing and commercial buildings. It should give us the momentum right through the winter.
Turning to our specialty segment. Trench Safety, Power & HVAC both had a stellar quarter. Trench Safety revenue was up 15% year-over-year and Power posted 39% growth.
Our specialty segment got a boost from 10 new branches we opened in the first half of the year, and we plan to open another 8 before the year-end. But this segment is also generating solid growth organically.
All of the 15% growth in Trench in the quarter came from same-store performance, and Power & HVAC had 27% same-store growth.
Now in addition to being important revenue streams in their own right, specialty rentals have a role in strengthening our key customer relationships. The larger the customer, the more likely that the rental needs extend beyond the basics. And we're doing a good job of ramping up our cross-selling efforts to serve these accounts more completely. And in the process, we're building loyalty that holds up on a competitive pressure.
National Accounts are a good example. Year-over-year in Q2, we grew our cross-sell revenue by almost 30% with National Accounts. In the second quarter, we grew our rental revenue about -- in the same group by more than 7%.
So highlighting a steady ship and we're being extremely disciplined about our business development efforts. Finally, I want to mention our share repurchase plans. As we announced last night, we're accelerating the $750 million program we initiated last year. We now expect to complete that program before year-end, and then we'll start a new program for an additional $1 billion of share repurchases.
As a sign of our confidence and our future earning power and our commitment to reigning that -- returning value to our stockholders. 
Now on closing, I want to come back to our operating environment and on many levers that we have at our disposal. We use these levers and the inherent strengths of our strategy to manage our business to the best possible outcomes. And in the second quarter, you saw the benefit of the organic and inorganic moves we made: our focus on operational excellence; our efficient cost structure; and our ability to use scale to our advantage, all of which contributed to a strong financial performance in many respects.
Now we'll continue to take decisive action, where we see opportunity to build on these results and generate even higher returns. So with that, I'll ask Bill to cover the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that most of you have seen in the press release or heard in Mike's remarks.Starting with rental revenue. Rental revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% year-ove",2256,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that most of you have seen in the press release or heard in Mike's remarks.
Starting with rental revenue. Rental revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% year-over-year, that's $42 million of an increase. Within that increase, owned equipment revenue represented 3.7% year-over-year growth or for about $37 million of that $42 million.
The remaining rounded $4 million was ancillary and re-rent items, which were up nicely over the prior year. Within the OER growth, rental rate, the 1.5% year-over-year rental rate that we delivered in the quarter equates to about $16 million of the $42 million year-over-year growth. 
The volume growth. 2.8% volume growth represents about $29 million worth of rental revenue growth year-over-year.
The replacement CapEx we sold. The replacement CapEx, average age of 86.9 months in the quarter. Inflating that over the average life -- those life of equipment that we sold resulted in about 1.9% or $20 million of rental revenue headwind in the quarter.
And that leaves about $12 million of mix and other impacts resulting from the strong growth in specialty and other mix effects throughout the business. So those are the key components of the $42 million year-over-year rental revenue growth. The only other point that I would emphasize is that Canadian currency effects are at place throughout all of those lines, with the exception of rental rate. Canadian dollar was weaker by 11% in the quarter, and that resulted in about $15 million of headwind in the quarter compared to last year. So significant component to the overall performance.
That said, we still delivered the 3.5% in spite of that particular challenge.
Moving to used equipment sales. We generated $124 million of proceeds from used sales in the quarter. That's down about 10% from the second quarter of last year. And even though the total revenue was down, the margin performance was very good, 50% adjusted margin for our used equipment sales activity. That's 140 basis points better than the prior year. And we're particularly proud about the fact that we were able to do that while still supporting the overall fleet strategy of selling the oldest fleet, as I mentioned earlier, just under 87 months of average age per fleet sold.
Continue to do a good job of disposing of used equipment through our retail channel. Retail represented just over 60% of our sales in the quarter, and that was about 1% better than the share that it represented last year. So a good used equipment result, even albeit with a slight year-over-year decline.
If we move to adjusted EBITDA, we delivered $706 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. That set a margin of 49.4%, both records for the second quarter for our company. That's $43 million of improvement year-over-year and $200 million of greater -- excuse me, 200 basis points of greater margin from second quarter last year.
The components of that $43 million improvement year-over-year are as follows: the rental rate improvement resulted in about $15 million of year-over-year EBITDA improvement; volume is about $20 million of improvement; and the ancillary that I called out earlier, all of that $4 million revenue improvement drops to an EBITDA improvement. So nice result there.
Working against this, fleet inflation resulted in about $14 million of impact at EBITDA and used sales year-over-year was about $5 million of impact at EBITDA, both representing headwinds.
We also had a year-over-year bad debt expense increase. So that was a headwind of about $10 million. Didn't represent a problem or challenge in bad debt collections this year. It's just that the comparison period last year was so strong. Last year, we had a really nice collection result along with an improvement in the aging buckets of our accounts receivable that really took down our bad debt expense last year.
Instead of compensation was one of the adjustments that we have made in order to offset some of the challenges that Mike mentioned, our incentive comp benefited us year-over-year to the tune of about $18 million for the cash incentive compensation programs across the business. So that was an $18 million benefit, and it helped to offset some of the headwinds that I mentioned previously.
Merit increases are always there. They were about $6 million of headwind for the quarter. And the remainder, which is about a total of $20 million, represents mix and other benefits. Of that $20 million, about $10 million is pure mix. Whether it's mix from growing specialty, cat class mix, day, week, month mix, all of those mix factors net out to about $10 million of benefit year-over-year. And that leaves about $10 million of all other, which encompasses a wide variety of net benefit. So within that all other, we had fuel cost saves with the lower price of diesel and gasoline. We had lower professional fees year-over-year, lower T&E. And that's where you would see the benefit of our lean and other productivity-focused programs.
So those are the pieces of the $43 million of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. And here, again, I'll call out the impact of currency, which is scattered throughout a number of those lines. When you step back and aggregate it all, currency cost us an unfavorable impact in the quarter, about $7 million versus last year.
Flow-through for the quarter. The top line number was very robust, 143%. But I'll remind you, that does include the impact of the incentive compensation. If you adjust for that incentive comp, the $18 million, you get that flow-through down to about 83%. I'll also point out that the flow-through was helped by the fact that our year-over-year used equipment sales were lower. We're selling used equipment at roughly 50% margin. That's lower than our margin for the rental business. So when you take out used equipment, you're actually helping the overall flow-through. If you adjust for that used equipment effect, you get flow-through that was down around 70%. And still, a nice result of 70% in any given quarter is more in line with the roughly 6% that we've guided to for the full year.
Looking at adjusted EBITDA. We delivered $1.95 of adjusted EPS -- excuse me, adjusted EPS for the quarter. That compares to $1.65 in the second quarter of last year. That's an 18% increase year-over-year. And as I've pointed out for the other measures, it also includes the impact of currency. Absent currency, it would have been about $0.04 higher.
Moving to free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've generated free cash flow of $432 million. That includes $2 million of merger-related payments, and that compares to $240 million on a comparable basis for the first 6 months of 2014.
The driver of the increase was largely a result of the year-over-year improvement in EBITDA performance as well as some benefits in other lines, including a variety of other items.
CapEx in the quarter was $693 million, and that brings the total first 6 months capital spend for this year to just over $1 billion. And that leaves our net rental CapEx for the second quarter and first 6 months at $570 million and $776 million, respectively.
If we move to capital structure and liquidity. As you know, we took several steps to improve our capital structure in the first quarter with refinancing issues. We issued 2 new notes totaling about $1.8 billion and called a comparable amount of notes out of 3 different issues either fully or partially during the first quarter.
And as I noted on the first call, the actual settlement for those transactions would happen in the second quarter. And indeed, in this quarter, we record a charge of approximately $121 million to cover the redemption and write-off of other amortized costs in the quarter.
The details of all those transactions are in our 10-Q, and I'll refer you there if you'd like to see more.
As of June 30, our total liquidity sat at $880 million. And that included an ABL capacity of about $680 million along with a cash balance of right at $200 million. So we feel we're very well positioned with liquidity.
Mike mentioned the share repurchase program. But just to hit a couple of points there, we did continue to execute under the $750 million current authorization during the quarter. We bought $155 million worth of shares. And that brings our total purchases against that program through June 30 up to $573 million, which leaves us with about $177 million to complete that program. Our initial target was that, that program would run until about April 2016. But given our performance, especially the robust cash flow performance as it's rolling in this year, we accelerated our time line and now expect to finish that program by the end of this year.
And as Michael also mentioned, we have announced that our board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. That program will begin after we've completed the current $750 million program. We put an 18-month time line on execution of the $1 billion, so the 18-month clock will start once we start purchasing under this program.
One thing to mention regarding our share repurchase program. We do have to be mindful of limitations on restricted payment transactions that are inherent in many of our debt notes. As I'm sure most of you are familiar, RP limitations are typical in these notes. And typically, they give you a basket which deals with net income. So as you grow net income, you build up that basket. The basket gets depleted with RP transactions, of which share repurchases represent one type.
At the end of June, we had roughly $400 million of available capacity for executing repurchase or other restricted payments. That $400 million includes the RP basket along with the cash capacity that we have at the holding company level, which is outside of the restrictive payment limitations of the operating note issues.
So we have plenty of room. The insurance suite is we have plenty of room to complete the $750 million program this year and to get deep into the $1 billion program as we execute it over the course of the next 18 months-plus.
On ROIC. The ROIC result for the quarter was 8.9%. And that was an increase of 80 basis points over last year, although down slightly from the first quarter sequentially in this year. And the decline really was a result of the way that we calculate ROIC. We used a 5-point average for the IC component in the denominator. And as you cross over the quarter, that includes pump in that 5-point average versus dumping included, it had a slight impact on our ROIC on a sequential basis. So certainly, we continue to be on the path as the year-over-year number indicates toward improving our ROIC performance. And as all of you know, that is a very intense focus of our company.
Regarding the outlook for 2015, again, Mike hit most of the key components. But just to add a little bit more color, our total revenue range is now $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion. Within that, rental revenue will be driven by the rate and time utilization assumptions that we've revised. So rate, we now expect up about 0.5% year-over-year. And really, that rate assumption reflects very heavily the experience that we've had so far this year.
Our time utilization also reflects that experience. We now expect the full year to come in at about 57.5%. And those will result in an adjusted EBITDA range of about $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion. We have reduced our capital spending plan for the year by $100 million. So net gross capital, we now expect to spend about $1.6 billion. And we think this line is -- this change is in line with what we've been focused on very recently, which is to be very disciplined around our CapEx spend.
Free cash flow. We've maintained our range there at $725 million to $775 million. And if we deliver that, we expect the year to end with adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.8x. That's slightly higher than the 2.6x that we've shared in the past. It clearly reflects the decrease in adjusted EBITDA, but it also assumes now the accelerated completion of the $750 million share repurchase program by the end of this year.
So those are the key comments I wanted to make. I just wanted to reemphasize a couple of the points that Mike made. It is a solid quarter for us, albeit with some headwinds that were more challenging than we certainly expected. Upstream oil and gas, that impact will continue to work through. But it is a matter of working through it rather than it being a major impact to the company's longer-term future.
The supply dynamic across the industry is one that we're also focused and making sure that we're focused on adjusting profitably to what we see as a short-term supply dynamic. And of course, currency is another effect that will continue to play in our future coming up.
But with all of that, the results that we delivered in the quarter represent what I think are our really solid performance. Record revenue, record EBITDA, record EBITDA margin, record EPS, all put us in a great position for the future. 
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open us up for questions and answers. Operator?"

I think framing it -- I hit on it in my comments and Mike did as well. There is the dynamic of oil and gas is a major factor that we continue to work through, but we feel like we are making good progress and working through it. The industry as well is working through it. And I think, over time, they will, as long as there's not a major down leg on oil and gas drilling activity. Given what we we've seen, and we've put some more information in our investor deck to share with you the trends that we've seen in oil and gas activity. We think that the impact from oil and gas is stabilizing. And even if it goes down a little bit more, it's not going to be a major change from here. The supply dynamic is one that I think we're also very focused on. Some of the mid-sized and smaller players, according to data that we've seen from Rouse and elsewhere, have been growing their fleets in the early part of this year. What we've seen and heard more recently, let's call it over the last couple of months, is that they are much more attuned to the challenges that the oil and gas dynamic have put to the industry. And so people are now focused more on making more disciplined decisions, we believe, around their supply in the current environment. So that's what frames our thinking that we could work through this supply access, if you will, in the relatively near term. Couple that with the overall demand backdrop that we've talked about so that will get through this. And times should be better going ahead. I don't know if you guys want add anything, Mike or Matt?"

I just -- given the rate and utilization outlook that we're looking at for the for third and fourth quarter, I'm just trying to reconcile what -- why you wouldn't bring the CapEx down further for -- at least for the second half of this year. And as a kind of as a tie-in to that question, you brought your long term -- longer-term rate guidance down from 3% to 2%. And I would think that one of the ways that you could ensure that the rate stays higher is with less -- having upward pressure on fleet utilization.

It's a great question and it's one that we've been debated internally here for the last few weeks and, actually, I would say the last few months. But I think we have to start. Let me break down the CapEx for you, to begin with",552,"Yes. And Seth, this is Mike. It's a great question and it's one that we've been debated internally here for the last few weeks and, actually, I would say the last few months. But I think we have to start. Let me break down the CapEx for you, to begin with. Of the $1.6 billion of rental CapEx, if you take away the inflation adjusted replacement CapEx of $1.14 billion, that leaves you with a growth capital of about $460 million. This is all seen in our investor deck that we have out there. We will spend of that $460 million, we'll spend $70 million of that this year to refurbishments and to our rental -- for our rental assets, and in the investments in our GPS our telematics for the fleet. So this is rounded and that -- so it leaves us about $400 million. That is split evenly between our specialty business and our generate business. Now as I mentioned, our specialty business is doing quite well and we're funding the 10 cold-starts that we've started. We have 8 more to go this year. That's a high-margin business, high return, and it also provides an entanglement with our customer base. So now we're talking about roughly $200 million for the gen rent. And we're funding the growth really goes into our national key accounts business. We've had some new wins and we're also investing into high-time utilized assets. But when we think about the investment, we don't think about it just as a point in time. We're investing in what we think is a cycle that has multiple years of growth ahead of us. And I want to also point out that you mentioned of dropping our CapEx this year. I'll point out in the investor deck that we also dropped it going into next year, and that's always subject to change. Just as the -- as we go through this year and we think about next year and we go into December and we come out to the investment community, we'll update you. If we think that the worst is behind us completely and there's some rational behavior is going on and we can see more, we're going to post more. But that said, we're actually very comfortable with our investment plan. As far as the rates are concerned, just to addressed that, yes, you're right, it declined. And if you recall, when it talk about rate, people are asking me -- or used to ask me when we're coming out of every session, Mike, where -- how do you see this? Well, your used price margins improve then you see utilization then rate. Our rate's been impacted, but time utilization because of the influx. We're working through that as we go through the back half of this year. Now I will tell you, quite honestly, Seth, if we have to adjust next year, we will. But I just don't think about it as a point in time. I think of it as a continuum. Because we buy these assets for their life cycle and it's really -- it comes down to a judgment call. And this is how we've debated this and this is where we came out. And we're comfortable with it at this point in time."

And it just seems like with adding this fleet, you're moving away from that objective. And in conjunction with that, the rate's coming down. So it just -- it seems like there's, at a minimum, an opportunity here for the second half of the year to take CapEx down and just sort of wait and see how things progress. Because, really, nobody know how oil's going to play out and whatnot. And so, I mean, are you locked into contracts that are -- there's $200 of gen rent that is at a -- are those deals that you can't get out?

As Mike said, that additional $200 million, the flexibility to take that away without to come at the risk of long-term relationships and long-term revenue and accretive positive good return revenue. So that's why we came to that decision. But when you parse out the gap year-over-year between -- which about 130 basis points if you look at our full year guidance this year versus our full year actual this year, half of that is all that we made to continue our path on pump. So we've got a little over $70 million in pump assets that, with that business being down, we could monetize if we thought that was the right long-term decision. But we want to fund the additional cold-start growth as well as, candidly, not fire sell assets that have plenty of tread left on them and will have value for us long-term as we see this other recovery for that business. That's an investment we made for a longer-term gain. So that's half of that, 130 bps of year-over-year decline. Bill had pointed out that we've moved $125 million of assets out of the oil and gas. That's only 2/3 of what we have to do. We have about another $60 million that we have to move out in the balance of this quarter. And we've had action plans, individual assets identified. When you tie those 2 components together, those are -- that's the drag, that's the 1.3 year-over-year drag that we're dealing with. And it's not unfortunately as simple as us saying we're not going to buy the remaining $200 million of high-time assets in the gen rent business and replace them with those assets that are dragging the time down. And that's why it looks a little dislocated from afar. But when you dig into the detail, which we've obviously done, we're comfortable with our plan."

When you take a look at residential investment, business investment and even the state and local investment, it's supposed to improve. Step us forward, take a look at what Dodge has put out, and we have this all broken down into our investor deck. Construction, excluding utility and gas plants, is going to be up in '15 by 9%, projected 12% and 16%, and 14% in '17. And then we even break it down by IHS, where they see real construction growth by sector over the outlying years. Again, all public -- all the public information, all independent, and all of it, the primary goals or I would say the primary business nonres construction, which is a big catalyst for our industry, remains positive. So over time, we see that to continue to play out. With regards to the fleet, and I've talked about this, the -- I understand the refleeting. I get it from the -- from all of the independents. They have been somewhat blocked out for some period of time. They won't have an endless supply of capital available to them. So -- and I also think that with the Rouse information, 55 -- at least 55 participants aside from United Rentals participate in this. So they have real data, they have real information by which they can help judge their business better today than ever before. And I believe that they signed up for this so that they can understand how they can drive better returns, how they can drive better cash flow so that they don't get themselves into situations when a cycle does turn.

I want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. I want to focus most of my comments today on the dynamics of our operating environment.

I want to focus most of my comments today on the dynamics of our operating environment. I'll discuss how our industry is adjusting to the recovery. And I'll talk about the nonresidential construction is hitting its stride, particularly in the commercial sector. And then Bill will cover the financial results followed by your questions.
So first, look at the quarter. We turned in a solid performance with nice gains in profitability, margin and returns. Our EBITDA margin increased over 49% in the quarter, and we reported earnings per share of $1.95 on an adjusted basis. And these were both second quarter records for us.
Free cash flow is very strong at $432 million through June. Now taken in their entirety, these numbers reflect the fundamental strength of our operating environment. There's clear evidence of demand for our equipment and demand is growing.
However, taken individually, 2 of the underlying metrics reflects some challenges in our environment: the rate and time utilization. Rate came in softer than expected at 1.5% higher year-over-year, and time utilization was down 150 basis points to 66.6%.
And it's important to understand what these numbers do and don't represent. For one thing, they do not reflect a macro weakness in demand. Now we spent a lot of time analyzing industry behavior, and we believe that rental demand in North America has multiple years of growth ahead.
We also think that 2016 will be even stronger than 2015 for our end markets and that the growth will be led by nonresidential construction spending. And that's what most industry experts believe, and we agree.
Now what the metrics point to are 2 dynamics that are more like micro cycles within our larger operating environment. These dynamics will run their course. But right now, they're not doing us any favors.
The first issue is upstream oil and gas. Last quarter, we told you this sector was a significant constraint with both a direct and knock-on effect. 
And I'll give you an idea of the impact in the second quarter. If we exclude the branches with the most exposure of upstream oil and gas, time utilization was only down 30 basis points year-over-year and sequential rates were slightly positive.
In April, we said we thought this sector would continue to be a drag on numbers through at least the third quarter. So it's no surprise that we're still dealing with that challenge, particularly in our pump operations.
So obviously, there's not much we can do about the price of oil, but we are taking action. So far, we've redeployed over $125 million of fleet away from the upstream oil and gas markets, and we'll continue to use this lever where we see the opportunity for higher returns.
The second dynamic is on the supply side, where it's more of a timing issue with our industry as a whole. Right now, Rouse will tell you that there's some excess fleet in rental yards that needs to be absorbed into the marketplace. It's not unusual for our industry to add fleet in an upturn and to do so slightly in advance of the demand.
In this case, however, the imbalance was exaggerated by the decline in upstream oil and gas. This will level [ph] out. But until that happens, it continues to be a drag on rates and utilization.
Our own plan is to invest $1.6 billion of gross [ph] CapEx this year, which is $100 million less than our original projection. And while we've taken that number down, it's still represents plenty of growth CapEx to serve our large accounts and to expand our high-margin specialty business.
On the other side of CapEx management, used equipment sales, the market is going strong. Used sales continue to be an important mechanism for us in fleet management.
In the second quarter, our adjusted margin on used sales was a robust 50%, which is an increase over last year. By giving these various considerations, we're being realistic about the short-term impact on our performance.
And as you saw last night, we lowered our expectation on rate to a 0.5% gain. Our time utilization target is now approximately 67.5% and we've adjusted our revenue and EBITDA ranges accordingly.
At the same time, we expect free cash flow to remain very strong. Now I want to be clear about our sights are set higher than this outlook, as they always are with any guidance we give. I think you know by now that our nature is to be hungry for more. And in this case, if there's more rate, we're going to find it.
We have a lot of runway ahead of us in this cycle. Secular penetration is still in play and commercial construction is nowhere near its peak. Global Insight is forecasting solid growth for the U.S. rental industry this year followed by similar increases in 2016 and 2017, and Dodge sees the construction market growing for at least the next 3 years.
At the same time, we're careful to maintain our company in a strong position to handle any issue that could arise. We've been building our scale, technology, processes, our skill sets for nearly 2 decades. And even if the environment throws us a curveball, we can handle it. In fact, we're better equipped to handle it now than at any time in our history.
From our current vantage point, the cycle is right on track. We're finding that customers are bullish about their prospects, and the level of activity seems to bear that out. In some cases, we're hearing about project backlogs that are approaching prerecession levels. Now here, I'll give you a few snapshots from the field.
In our mid-Atlantic region, where we had double-digit growth in the quarter for our nuclear power presents, roads, bridges and industrial manufacturing plants. In the Southeast, we're seeing government projects start up as well as health care construction and highway expansion. Florida has picked up, and customers are saying they expect a strong finish to the year with upside into 2016. And in the Midwest, where heavy rains and a labor shortage delayed some bridge construction starts, we still had solid growth. And we're now seeing a range of projects get underway, including a fertilizer plant, auto manufacturing and commercial buildings. It should give us the momentum right through the winter.
Turning to our specialty segment. Trench Safety, Power & HVAC both had a stellar quarter. Trench Safety revenue was up 15% year-over-year and Power posted 39% growth.
Our specialty segment got a boost from 10 new branches we opened in the first half of the year, and we plan to open another 8 before the year-end. But this segment is also generating solid growth organically.
All of the 15% growth in Trench in the quarter came from same-store performance, and Power & HVAC had 27% same-store growth.
Now in addition to being important revenue streams in their own right, specialty rentals have a role in strengthening our key customer relationships. The larger the customer, the more likely that their rental needs extend beyond the basics. And we're doing a good job of ramping up our cross-selling efforts to serve these accounts more completely. And in the process, we're building loyalty that holds up under competitive pressure.
National Accounts are a good example. Year-over-year in Q2, we grew our cross-sell revenue by almost 30% with National Accounts. In the second quarter, we grew our rental revenue about -- in the same group by more than 7%.
So we're highlighting a steady ship and we're being extremely disciplined about our business development efforts. Finally, I want to mention our share repurchase plans. As we announced last night, we're accelerating the $750 million program we initiated last year. We now expect to complete that program before year-end, and then we'll start a new program for an additional $1 billion of share repurchases.
As a sign of our confidence in our future earning power and our commitment to running [ph] that -- returning value to our stockholders. 
Now on closing, I want to come back to our operating environment and on many levers that we have at our disposal. We use these levers and the inherent strengths of our strategy to manage our business for the best possible outcomes. And in the second quarter, you saw the benefit of the organic and inorganic moves we made: our focus on operational excellence; our efficient cost structure; and our ability to use scale to our advantage, all of which contributed to a strong financial performance in many respects.
Now we'll continue to take decisive action, where we see opportunity to build on these results and generate even higher returns. So with that, I'll ask Bill to cover the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that most of you have seen in the press release or heard in Mike's remarks.Starting with rental revenue. Rental revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% year-ove",2256,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that most of you have seen in the press release or heard in Mike's remarks.
Starting with rental revenue. Rental revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% year-over-year, that's $42 million of an increase. Within that increase, owned equipment revenue represented 3.7% year-over-year growth or for about $37 million of that $42 million.
The remaining rounded $4 million was ancillary and re-rent items, which were up nicely over the prior year. Within the OER growth, rental rate, the 1.5% year-over-year rental rate that we delivered in the quarter equates to about $16 million of the $42 million year-over-year growth. 
The volume growth. 2.8% volume growth represents about $29 million worth of rental revenue growth year-over-year.
The replacement CapEx we sold. The replacement CapEx, average age of 86.9 months in the quarter. Inflating that over the average life -- life of equipment that we sold resulted in about 1.9% or $20 million of rental revenue headwind in the quarter.
And that leaves about $12 million of mix and other impacts resulting from the strong growth in specialty and other mix effects throughout the business. So those are the key components of the $42 million year-over-year rental revenue growth. The only other point that I would emphasize is that Canadian currency effects are at play throughout all of those lines, with the exception of rental rate. Canadian dollar was weaker by 11% in the quarter, and that resulted in about $15 million of headwind in the quarter compared to last year. So a significant component to the overall performance.
That said, we still delivered the 3.5% in spite of that particular challenge.
Moving to used equipment sales. We generated $124 million of proceeds from used sales in the quarter. That's down about 10% from the second quarter of last year. And even though the total revenue was down, the margin performance was very good, 50% adjusted margin for our used equipment sales activity. That's 140 basis points better than the prior year. And we're particularly proud about the fact that we were able to do that while still supporting the overall fleet strategy of selling the oldest fleet, as I mentioned earlier, just under 87 months of average age per fleet sold.
Continue to do a good job of disposing of used equipment through our retail channel. Retail represented just over 60% of our sales in the quarter, and that was about 1% better than the share that it represented last year. So a good used equipment result, even albeit with a slight year-over-year decline.
If we move to adjusted EBITDA, we delivered $706 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. That set a margin of 49.4%, both records for the second quarter for our company. That's $43 million of improvement year-over-year and $200 million of greater -- excuse me, 200 basis points of greater margin from second quarter last year.
The components of that $43 million improvement year-over-year are as follows: the rental rate improvement resulted in about $15 million of year-over-year EBITDA improvement; volume is about $20 million of improvement; and the ancillary that I called out earlier, all of that $4 million revenue improvement drops to an EBITDA improvement. So nice result there.
Working against this, fleet inflation resulted in about $14 million of impact at EBITDA and used sales year-over-year was about $5 million of impact at EBITDA, both representing headwinds.
We also had a year-over-year bad debt expense increase. So that was a headwind of about $10 million. It didn't represent a problem or challenge in bad debt collections this year. It's just that the comparison period last year was so strong. Last year, we had a really nice collection result along with an improvement in the aging buckets of our accounts receivable that really took down our bad debt expense last year.
Incentive compensation was one of the adjustments that we have made in order to offset some of the challenges that Mike mentioned, our incentive comp benefited us year-over-year to the tune of about $18 million for the cash incentive compensation programs across the business. So that was an $18 million benefit, and it helped offset some of the headwinds that I mentioned previously.
Merit increases are always there. They were about $6 million of headwind for the quarter. And the remainder, which is about a total of $20 million, represents mix and other benefits. Of that $20 million, about $10 million is pure mix. Whether it's mix from growing specialty, cat class mix, day, week, month mix, all of those mix factors net out to about $10 million of benefit year-over-year. And that leaves about $10 million of all other, which encompasses a wide variety of net benefit. So within that all other, we had fuel cost saves with the lower price of diesel and gasoline. We had lower professional fees year-over-year, lower T&E. And that's where you would see the benefit of our lean and other productivity-focused programs.
So those are the pieces of the $43 million of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. And here, again, I'll call out the impact of currency, which is scattered throughout a number of those lines. When you step back and aggregate it all, currency cost us in an unfavorable impact in the quarter, about $7 million versus last year.
Flow-through for the quarter. The top line number was very robust, 143%. But I'll remind you, that does include the impact of the incentive compensation. If you adjust for that incentive comp, $18 million, you get that flow-through down to about 83%. I'll also point out that the flow-through was helped by the fact that our year-over-year used equipment sales were lower. We're selling used equipment at roughly 50% margin. That's lower than our margin for the rental business. So when you take out used equipment, you're actually helping the overall flow-through. If you adjust for that used equipment effect, you get flow-through that was down around 70%. And still a nice result, 70% in any given quarter is more in line with the roughly 6% that we've guided to for the full year.
Looking at adjusted EBITDA. We delivered $1.95 of adjusted EPS -- excuse me, adjusted EPS for the quarter. That compares to $1.65 in the second quarter of last year. That's an 18% increase year-over-year. And as I pointed out for the other measures, it also includes the impact of currency. Absent currency, it would have been about $0.04 higher.
Moving to free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've generated free cash flow of $432 million. That includes $2 million of merger-related payments, and that compares to $240 million on a comparable basis for the first 6 months of 2014.
The driver of the increase was largely a result of the year-over-year improvement in EBITDA performance as well as some benefits in other lines, including a variety of other items.
CapEx in the quarter was $693 million, and that brings the total first 6 months capital spend for this year to just over $1 billion. And that leaves our net rental CapEx for the second quarter and first 6 months at $570 million and $776 million, respectively.
If we move to capital structure and liquidity. As you know, we took several steps to improve our capital structure in the first quarter with refinancing issues. We issued 2 new notes totaling about $1.8 billion and called a comparable amount of notes out of 3 different issues either fully or partially during the first quarter.
And as I noted on the first call, the actual settlement for those transactions would happen in the second quarter. And indeed, in this quarter, we did record a charge of approximately $121 million to cover the redemption and write-off of other amortized costs in the quarter.
The details of all those transactions are in our 10-Q, and I'll refer you there if you'd like to see more.
As of June 30, our total liquidity sat at $880 million. And that included an ABL capacity of about $680 million along with a cash balance of right at $200 million. So we feel we're very well positioned with liquidity.
Mike mentioned the share repurchase program. But just to hit a couple of points there, we did continue to execute under the $750 million current authorization during the quarter. We bought $155 million worth of shares. And that brings our total purchases against that program through June 30 up to $573 million, which leaves us with about $177 million to complete that program. Our initial target was that, that program would run until about April 2016. But given our performance, especially the robust cash flow performance as it's rolling in this year, we accelerated our time line and now expect to finish that program by the end of this year.
And as Mike also mentioned, we have announced that our board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. That program will begin after we've completed the current $750 million program. We put an 18-month time line on execution of the $1 billion, so the 18-month clock will start once we start purchasing under this program.
One thing to mention regarding our share repurchase program. We do have to be mindful of limitations on restricted payment transactions that are inherent in many of our debt notes. As I'm sure most of you are familiar, RP limitations are typical in these notes. And typically, they give you a basket which builds with net income. So as you grow net income, you build up that basket. The basket gets depleted with RP transactions, of which share repurchases represent one type.
At the end of June, we had roughly $400 million of available capacity for executing repurchase or other restricted payments. That $400 million includes the RP basket along with the cash capacity that we have at the holding company level, which is outside of the restricted payment limitations of the operating note issues.
So we have plenty of room. The short and sweet is we have plenty of room to complete the $750 million program this year and to get deep into the $1 billion program as we execute it over the course of the next 18 months-plus.
On ROIC. The ROIC result for the quarter was 8.9%. And that was an increase of 80 basis points over last year, although down slightly from the first quarter sequentially in this year. And the decline really was a result of the way that we calculate ROIC. We use a 5-point average for the IC component in the denominator. And as you cross over the quarter, that includes pump in that 5-point average versus doesn't include it, it had a slight impact on our ROIC on a sequential basis. So certainly, we continue to be on the path as the year-over-year number indicates toward improving our ROIC performance. And as all of you know, that is a very intense focus of our company.
Regarding the outlook for 2015, again, Mike hit most of the key components. But just to add a little bit more color, our total revenue range is now $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion. Within that, rental revenue will be driven by rate and time utilization assumptions that we've revised. So rate, we now expect up about 0.5% year-over-year. And really, that rate assumption reflects very heavily the experience that we've had so far this year.
Time utilization also reflects that experience. We now expect the full year to come in at about 57.5%. And those will result in an adjusted EBITDA range of about $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion. We have reduced our capital spending plan for the year by $100 million. So net gross capital, we now expect to spend about $1.6 billion. And we think this line is -- this change is in line with what we've been focused on very recently, which is to be very disciplined around our CapEx spend.
Free cash flow. We've maintained our range there at $725 million to $775 million. And if we deliver that, we expect the year to end with adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.8x. That's slightly higher than the 2.6x that we've shared in the past. It clearly reflects the decrease in adjusted EBITDA, but it also assumes now the accelerated completion of the $750 million share repurchase program by the end of this year.
So those are the key comments I wanted to make. I just wanted to reemphasize a couple of the points that Mike made. It is a solid quarter for us, albeit with some headwinds that were more challenging than we certainly expected. Upstream oil and gas, that impact will continue to work through. But it is a matter of working through it rather than it being a major impact to the company's longer-term future.
The supply dynamic across the industry is one that we're also focused on and making sure that we're focused on adjusting properly to what we see as a short-term supply dynamic. And of course, currency is another effect that will continue to play in our future coming up.
But with all of that, the results that we delivered in the quarter represent what I think are our really solid performance. Record revenue, record EBITDA, record EBITDA margin, record EPS, all put us in a great position for the future. 
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open us up for questions and answers. Operator?"

There is the dynamic of oil and gas is a major factor that we continue to work through, but we feel like we are making good progress in working through it. The industry as well is working through it. And I think, over time, they will, as long as there's not a major down leg on oil and gas drilling activity. Given what we we've seen, and we've put some more information in our investor deck to share with you the trends that we've seen in oil and gas activity. We think that the impact from oil and gas is stabilizing. And even if it goes down a little bit more, it's not going to be a major change from here. The supply dynamic is one that I think we're also very focused on. Some of the mid-sized and smaller players, according to data that we've seen from Rouse and elsewhere, have been growing their fleets in the early part of this year. What we've seen and heard more recently, let's call it over the last couple of months, is that they are much more attuned to the challenges that the oil and gas dynamic have put to the industry. And so people are now focused more on making more disciplined decisions, we believe, around their supply in the current environment. So that's what frames our thinking that we could work through this supply access, if you will, in the relatively near term. Couple that with the overall demand backdrop that we've talked about says that we'll get through this and times should be better going ahead.

It's a great question and it's one that we've been debated internally here for the last few weeks and, actually, I would say the last few months. But I think we have to start. Let me break down the CapEx for you, to begin with",555,"Yes. And Seth, this is Mike. It's a great question and it's one that we've been debated internally here for the last few weeks and, actually, I would say the last few months. But I think we have to start. Let me break down the CapEx for you, to begin with. Of the $1.6 billion of rental CapEx, if you take away the inflation adjusted replacement CapEx of $1.14 billion, that leaves you with a growth capital of about $460 million. This is all seen in our investor deck that we have out there. We will spend of that $460 million, we'll spend $70 million of that this year to refurbishments and to our rental -- for our rental assets, and in the investments in our GPS, our telematics for the fleet. So this is rounded and that -- so it leaves us about $400 million. That is split evenly between our specialty business and our gen rent business. Now as I mentioned, our specialty business is doing quite well and we're funding the 10 cold-starts that we started. And we have 8 more to go this year. That's a high-margin business, high return, and it also provides an entanglement with our customer base. So now we're talking about roughly $200 million for the gen rent. And we're funding the growth really goes into our national key accounts business. We've had some new wins and we're also investing in high-time utilized assets. But when we think about the investment, we don't think about it just as a point in time. We're investing in what we think is a cycle that has multiple years of growth ahead of us. And I want to also point out that you mentioned of dropping our CapEx this year. I'll point out in the investor deck that we also dropped it going into next year, and that's always subject to change. Just as the -- as we go through this year and we think about next year and we go into December and we come out to the investment community, we'll update you. If we think that the worst is behind us completely and there's some rational behavior that's going on and we can see more, we're going to post more. But that said, we're actually very comfortable with our investment plan. As far as the rates are concerned, just to addressed that, yes, you're right, it declined. And if you recall, when I talk about rate, people are asking me -- or used to ask me when we were coming out of the recession, Mike, where -- how do you see this? Well, your used price margins improve, then you see utilization, then rate. Our rate's been impacted, but time utilization because of the influx. We're working through that as we go through the back half of this year. Now I will tell you, quite honestly, Seth, if we have to adjust next year, we will. But I just don't think about it as a point in time. I think of it as a continuum. Because we buy these assets for their life cycle and it's really -- it comes down to a judgment call. And this is how we've debated this and this is where we came out. And we're comfortable with it at this point in time."

So that's why we came to that decision. But when you parse out the gap year-over-year between -- which about 130 basis points if you look at our full year guidance this year versus our full year actual this year, half of that is a call that we made to continue our path on pump. So we've got a little over $70 million in pump assets that, with that business being down, we could monetize if we thought that was the right long-term decision. But we want to fund the additional cold-start growth as well as, candidly, not fire-sell assets that have plenty of tread left on them and will have value for us long-term as we see this other recovery for that business. That's an investment we made for a longer-term gain. So that's half of that, 130 bps of year-over-year decline. Bill had pointed out that we've moved $125 million of assets out of the oil and gas. That's only 2/3 of what we have to do. We have about another $60 million that we have to move out in the balance of this quarter. And we have action plans, individual assets identified. When you tie those 2 components together, those are -- that's the drag, that's the 1.3 year-over-year drag that we're dealing with. And it's not, unfortunately, as simple as us saying we're not going to buy the remaining $200 million of high-time assets in the gen rent business and replace them with those assets that are dragging the time down. And that's why it looks a little dislocated from afar. But when you dig into the detail, which we've obviously done, we're comfortable with our plan."

When you take a look at residential investment, business investment and even the state and local investment, it's supposed to improve. Stepped [ph] us forward, take a look at what Dodge has put out, and we have this all broken down into our investor deck. Construction, excluding utility and gas plants, is going to be up in '15 by 9%, projected 12% in '16, and 14% in '17. And then we even break it down by IHS, where they see real construction growth by sector over the outlying years. Again, all public -- all public information, all independent, and all of the primary goals -- or I would say the primary business of nonres construction, which is a big catalyst for our industry, remains positive. So over time, we see that to continue to play out. With regards to the fleet, and I've talked about this, the -- I understand the refleeting. I get it from the -- from all of the independents. They have been somewhat blocked out for some period of time. They won't have an endless supply of capital available to them. So -- and I also think that with the Rouse information, 55 -- at least 55 participants aside from United Rentals participate in this. So they have real data, they have real information by which they can help judge their business better today than ever before. And I believe that they sign up for this so that they can understand how they can drive better returns, how they can drive better cash flow so that they don't get themselves into situations when the cycle does turn.

I'm going to use some of the time today to share how we're thinking about the opportunities in 2016. But first, let's start with the results that we reported last night. 
As you saw from our press release, there is some mixed dynamics in the quarter as well as strong positive. Our revenue was up just slightly year-over-year but we made the most of every dollar and delivered substantial profitability. In fact, it was a record quarter for us, with adjusted EPS of $2.57 per diluted share and an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%. Now this is a company record not only for the third quarter but for every quarter on our history. In addition, our Trench Safety and Power & HVAC businesses had stellar results and our 9-month free cash flow stands at a robust $508 million. 
So there's a lot to like about the quarter and as you saw last night, we reaffirmed our outlook for 2015. But we also dealt with some ongoing challenges to our top line, most notably upstream oil and gas and a weak Canadian economy with a negative impact on FX. In addition, there is still an oversupply of fleet in our industry and these 3 dynamics taken together had put pressure on rates and utilization. And it's all unfolded pretty much as we expected and we're running the business with great cost discipline in this environment. And as the numbers show, we stay true to our strategy by taking a balanced approach in a competitive microenvironment. That's where our focus is today and that's where we'll be and will continue to be in 2016.
We will issue our outlook in January as usual, but I think it's valuable to start that dialogue now. So before we go to the quarter, I'd like to give you some insights into our current market conditions and our perspective in the coming year. First, our industry grew steadily through 2015 to deman for equipment rental in North America is far from hitting its peak. In the third quarter, we once again increased our volume of equipment on rent and while time utilization easy over here, it was still a healthy 7%. About half our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth in the quarter. Our mid-Atlantic region was particularly strong with double digit growth. Activity this regions anchored by large manufacturing plants under construction in South Carolina and Tennessee as well as data center work in circumference. Industrial activity remains strong with year-over-year growth and attractive pipeline projects. Our utilization industrial has been in the mid-70s for the past 4 to 5 weeks. 
Now looking at our specialty businesses. Our 2 largest lines, Trench Safety and Power & HVAC, both have exceptional quarter. Trench generated year-over-year revenue growth of more than 16% and Power & HVAC delivered 20% growth. These increases were primarily driven by same-store growth, which is another indicator of demand. But all of our specialty businesses benefited from greenfield expansion this year. To date, in 2015, we've opened a total of 15 specialty branches in Trench, Power, pump and tool and another 3 on are under construction. In our pump network, we are pursuing a penetration strategy with in new and existing verticals [indiscernible] many of our pump cold starts in 2015 will be co-located with existing branches, where customer relationships can leverage for cross-selling. And we've had good success in developing a customer base for pump in verticals that derisk the exposure of upstream oil and gas. The business has now shifted to less than 50% of upstream and is growing in other areas. Another positive indicator of demand is the performance of our National Account, which a showed year-over-year revenue increase in the quarter. And we've had good success in selling to high-growth verticals such as chemical processing, power and multifamily residential construction. National and Strategic Accounts are driving some of these business but these verticals are also benefiting from a broader customer base. 
So those are some of our observations from the quarter, and we expect the remaining months of the year to play out with a typical seasonality. Now looking forward, our industry is in a very good place. Forecast such as global insights, and others seen multiple years of up cycle ahead and number of factors are working in our favor, for example, a fair amount of U.S. consumption growth is been, driven by large, multinational multiyear projects with price tags of $50 million or higher and this is an area where our scale really works to our advantage. In the U.S., spending on plant maintenance projects is ticking upwards, which adds to industrial demand. And industrial spending Canada is forecasted to begin a modest but steady recovery starting in 2016. This is all very positive, but the disconnect between demand and revenue, of course, is supply. As I mentioned, earlier, we believe that our industry has continued to fleet up slightly ahead of demand in anticipation of a long cycle ahead. Now for our part, we can't control which is quite a lot. We can adjust our CapEx up or down realtime. We can manage our used equipment together with CapEx for optimal fleet size. We can adjust the timing of our spent. And we can move idled fleet to other areas of higher demand. In addition, we can continue to try of cross-sell and invest in our sales force, and will be even more stringent on cost controls, and take a number -- any number of other actions. And we'll be making these decisions against an industry that continues to look very positive. We expect to benefit from the growth in demand for at least the next several years, driven by construction and industrial activity and the secular shift towards rental. And as far as standing any headwinds, we're looking at 2016 as a clean slate with every option on the table, including the timing and the amount of capital spend. 
We already know that we'll spend significantly less CapEx in the first quarter of 2016 than in Q1 of this year. And we will be watching demand very closely, and we will make sure we continue to meet our customer needs as the year unfolds. In our opinion, the best grow to recover the business is to go in the year with a strong understanding of the market but with no preconceived notions as operators. Our goal is and always has been to drive higher returns and we have tremendous flexibility in the path we take to that goal. So with that, I'll ask Bill to go to the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

As has been our customary, I try to add some color to information that was released by last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions if we don't get to something you're interested",1897,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As has been our customary, I try to add some color to information that was released by last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions if we don't get to something you're interested in. 
So starting with rental revenue. Within rental revenue, rental revenue grew over all 0.8% year-over-year. It's about $11 million of increase versus last year. Within that, we had re-rent and ancillary items this year, essentially flat to last year. So no contribution to growth from re-rent and ancillary combined or individually. It was also about OER growth and that was driven by the rental rate experience that we posted last night. Rates being down at 10th of a percent [ph] year-over-year. It cost us about $1.5 million of year-over-year rental revenue. Our volume growth was still solid 2.4%. Volume growth, that's growth in OEC and rent, and that translates into about $29 million worth of year-over-year revenue increase. 
Replacement CapEx inflation was about 1.7 percentage point headwind, good for just under $20 million of year-over-year revenue decline as an offset to the volume increase. And then everything else, we're calling mix and other was an increase of about 0.3% or about $3.1 million year-over-year and that includes the mix of our business as well as a little bit of FX. Most of FX shows up in the volume measure in this way of breaking things down but a little bit drops down into that mix and other line. 
Speaking of FX, we continue to have headwinds from the Canadian currency being down materially. It was down about 17% in the quarter compared to last year and that was worth about $26 million of revenue decline year-over-year, sprinkled among the other components that I already mentioned. If you took CapEx for the quarter, our rental revenue growth would have been 2.8%, and certainly more in line with what we have seen in terms of fleet growth and the other components. So those are the comments that offer regarding rental revenue. 
Just to touch a little bit more in some of the operating measures. Time utilization in the quarter finished at 70% and as I've said, that reflected rental -- fleet on rent growth of about 2.4% year-over-year. $6.27 billion was our average fleet on rent during the quarter. That 70% utilization was down 150 basis points versus last year comparable to the decline that we saw back in the second quarter, maybe a touch more. That's clearly an area of focus for us as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year and certainly you'll hear us talk more about focusing on driving that utilization improvement wherever we can. 
For used equipment, solid quarter for used equipment sales in the quarter, $142 million in the quarter, that's basically flat with third quarter last year. And an adjusted gross margin of 44%, that's down about 3 percentage points from last year. The primary driver of that decline is the mix of channels that we use. We sold about 52% of our used equipment in the retail channel. And we did a little bit more in auctions than we have been doing historically, and certainly more than we did last year in selling used equipment in the quarter. So that combination was the primary driver for the margin decline year-over-year. 
The auction increase I wouldn't go too far with that. We used about 12% of our sales through auction in the quarter that compares to something like 4 or 5 last year. And it's consistent with our focus on making sure that we dispose of the fleet that we need to dispose off during the course of 2015. 
Moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $780 million in the quarter and very importantly, as Mike said, 50% margin, 50.3% margin to be precise, that represents about $19 million of improvement over last year and a margin improvement of 100 basis points. 
To break down that year-over-year increase of $19 million, we saw rental rates as a headwind and its contribution to EBITDA of about $1 million. Volume -- that volume revenue drive -- drove about $20 million worth of volume impact at EBITDA. The fleet inflation headwind there was $14 million [ph] against that and the margin decline by called out earlier in used sales cost us about $4 million year-over-year. The impact of our merit increases, we've been calling that out, it's about $6 million per quarter. It's again $6 million in this quarter. And the 2 big positives in the quarter this year were the incentive compensation adjustment that we have made in the third quarter of this year as incentive programs have come down -- our accrual for incentive revenues have come down, reflecting the somewhat, well, the weaker performance than what we had in our original plan. So that was worth about $13 million of year-over-year improvement. We also had a mix and other improvement of about $11 million. And that came from a variety of cost saves items that Mike referred to. In our cost of rentals, we had nice performance in delivery costs during the quarter, some wage and benefit saves during the quarter and some puts and takes elsewhere that overall resulted in a very nice cost of rentals performance. 
And on top of that, we also have a nice SG&A performance in the quarter with SG&A like [indiscernible] expense, professional fee, a little bit of improvement in bad debt expense adding to a nice contribution there. So all in all, it was a pretty good quarter on the cost front and when you add those 2 benefits of incentive comp decline and mix and other, it adds up to the overall $19 million of EBITDA improvement that we saw versus third quarter last year. Currency is sprinkled through those different lines of EBITDA free cash flow. Currency had an unfavorable impact of about $8 million when you're talking about EBITDA in the quarter. So it continues to be a material headwind. 
Flow-through in the quarter, it's hard to even say some of these number sometimes but flow-through in the was very high, 317% for the quarter and obviously, it's a very sensitive calculation, driven by the fact we had the fairly small denominator in the year-over-year change in total revenue. So that 317% was heavily benefited by the incentive compensation accrual adjustment. If you take that out in the quarter, flow-through would have been 86%. Still pretty robust and therefore, reflecting some of the other cost saves that we have. But as we said, all along, you shouldn't look at flow-through in a 1 quarter length, you should think about it longer term. If you look at our year-to-date flow-through, the total number, including the incentive comp adjustments we've made is 84%, still pretty high. If you take out the adjustments in incentive comp year-to-date flow-through would be about 62% and that's very much in line with the roughly 60% that we've been guiding to. So good flow-through story for the quarter. 
Just real quickly on EPS, as Mike mentioned, $2.57 adjusted EPS for the quarter. It was a company record. That's up 17% over EPS in the comparable quarter. And that I'll remind you, includes the affect of the currency headwind. Currency cost us about $0.05 per share in this $2.57 EPS quarter. So continue to deliver a nice result at EPS even with the various impacts that we're talking about. 
Moving on to free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've generated $511 million of free cash flow once you exclude the $3 million impact of merger-related payments, which is the way we talk about it. That compares to $328 million on the same basis in the first 9 months of last year. And we continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet -- free cash flow view for the full year. 
The primary drivers of the free cash flow result this quarter were the better EBITDA performance, a little bit less CapEx than the year-to-date period last year and a little bit better interest expense or cash interest expense in the year-to-date period as well. 
Gross rental CapEx, just to mention with that, for the third quarter, it was $409 million. And that brings the full year-to-date areas of CapEx spend to $1.4 billion. Actually, the actual number was $1.425 billion. Net rental CapEx for the third quarter was $268 million and that brought the full year-to-date net rental CapEx number to $1 billion. 
Moving on quickly to our capital structure and a little bit on liquidity. At the end of the quarter, we have liquidity of just over $800 million. That included ABL capacity of about $620 million and roughly $170 million of cash on the balance sheet. So we feel that we're well positioned with regard to liquidity. 
A real quick update on the share repurchase program. We continue to execute purchases under the $750 million authorization. In the quarter, we bought back $167 million and that brings the total against this program at quarter end to $740 million, leaving $10 million to complete during the course of the fourth quarter. We do believe we'll finish that in the fourth quarter. And as we've said before, the new $1 billion authorization that we have from the Board we will commence buying on right after we complete the existing $750 million program. Our thinking now is that $1 billion program we will execute on a fairly steady basis, as we've called out before, we expect to complete that program over 18 months once we start it. 
Last quarter, I did remind you or mentioned to you all that we need to be mindful of limitations on the amount of share repurchases that we can under our debt covenants. And just to update you there, as we said at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $500 million of available capacity for repurchasing shares or other restricted transactions. That includes restricted payments baskets in our debt facilities as well as the cash capacity that we have up at the hauling company level of URI. Just real briefly on ROIC for the quarter, 8.9% in the third quarter, that's a trailing 12-month number, as you all know, and that's up 50 basis points compared to the same period last year and flat with where we were at the second quarter of this year. 
Not going to spend much time on the outlook because we didn't change anything in the outlook. So certainly, the numbers remain operative there. Certainly, if you have any questions about the outlook, we can address them in Q&A. So I'll stop there with my comments and again, welcome any questions on things that I didn't touch on or more detail on things that I did. But just want to echoe the commentary that you heard from Michael and that the results in the quarter we feel very good about, certainly, the profitability, certainly, the margin. And we feel like we're underwrite truck and dealing with the environment that we're in. And we certainly are thinking very much about how we finished out the year strong and get good momentum going into '16. 
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So we veil be I think in a better position to be able to manage rate if we're absorbing the existing fleet utilization more effectively. So that's going to be another, I think, positive for us in how we approach delivering improved rate next year. Obviously, that will come along with a very intense cost focus, won't directly that rate but will certainly help us examine everything we're doing rate effective into the company has ever be more effective in the marketplace. So those are the key things that tie point since it to your case. What did I miss?"

And so now we're pivoting to look at whether there are so the other costs that we need to take out in order to continue to drive that productivity result. And so that's been discussed as we speak right here and now. We still are very comfortable guiding to that $100 million run rate impacted by the end of next year because we can look across the business and still see places where we haven't implemented fully all of the Lean initiatives or we have but we haven't gotten as much out of them as we might have anticipated. So we're still comfortable saying that we expect to see the $100 million impact by the end of next year."

I'm going to use some of the time today to share how we're thinking about the opportunities in 2016. But first, let's start with the results that we reported last night. 
As you saw from our press release, there is some mixed dynamics in the quarter as well as some strong positive. Our revenue was up just slightly year-over-year, but we made the most of every dollar and delivered substantial profitability. In fact, it was a record quarter for us, with adjusted EPS of $2.57 per diluted share and an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%. Now this is a company record not only for the third quarter but for every quarter on our history. In addition, our Trench Safety and Power & HVAC businesses had stellar results, and our 9-month free cash flow stands at a robust $508 million. 
So there's a lot to like about the quarter. And as you saw last night, we reaffirmed our outlook for 2015. But we also dealt with some ongoing challenges to our top line, most notably upstream oil and gas and a weak Canadian economy with a negative impact on FX. In addition, there is still an oversupply of fleet in our industry, and these 3 dynamics taken together had put pressure on rates and utilization. Now this all unfolded pretty much as we expected, and we're running the business with great cost discipline in this environment. And as the numbers show, we stay true to our strategy by taking a balanced approach in a competitive market environment. That's where our focus is today and that's where it will be and will continue to be in 2016.
Now we'll issue our outlook in January as usual, but I think it's valuable to start that dialogue now. So before Bill goes through the quarter, I'd like to give you some insights into the current market conditions and our perspective on the coming year. First, our industry grew steadily through 2015. The demand for equipment rental in North America is far from hitting its peak. In the third quarter, we once again increased our volume of equipment on rent. And while time utilization eased year over year, it was still a healthy 7%. About half our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth in the quarter. Our mid-Atlantic region was particularly strong with double digit growth. Activity in this region is anchored by large manufacturing plants under construction in South Carolina and Tennessee as well as data center work in solar farms. And industrial activity remains strong with year-over-year growth and an attractive pipeline of projects. Our utilization for industrial has been in the mid-70s for the past 4 to 5 weeks. 
Now looking at our specialty businesses. Our 2 largest lines, Trench Safety and Power & HVAC both had an exceptional quarter. Trench generated year-over-year revenue growth of more than 16% and Power & HVAC delivered 20% growth. These increases were primarily driven by same-store growth, which is another indicator of demand. Now all of our specialty businesses benefited from greenfield expansion this year. To date, in 2015, we've opened a total of 15 new specialty branches in Trench, Power, Pump and Tools and another 3 are under construction. In our pump network, we're pursuing a penetration strategy with new and existing verticals. Now many of our pump cold starts in 2015 will be co-located with existing branches, where customer relationships can leverage for cross-selling. And we've had good success in developing a customer base for pump in verticals that de-risk the exposure of upstream oil and gas. The business has now shifted to less than 50% of upstream and is growing in other areas. 
Another positive indicator of demand is the performance of our National Accounts, which showed a year-over-year revenue increase in the quarter. And we've had good success in selling to high-growth verticals such as chemical processing, power and multifamily residential construction. National and Strategic Accounts are driving some of this business, but these verticals are also benefiting from a broader customer base. 
So those are some of our observations from the quarter, and we expect the remaining months of the year to play out with a typical seasonality. Now looking forward, our industry is in a very good place. Forecasts such as Global Insight, Dodge and others have seen multiple years of up cycle ahead. And a number of factors are working in our favor, for example, a fair amount of U.S. construction growth has been driven by large multiyear projects with price tags of $50 million or higher, and this is an area where our scale really works to our advantage. In the U.S., spending on plant maintenance projects is ticking upward, which adds to industrial demand. And industrial spend in Canada is forecasted to begin a modest but steady recovery starting in 2016. 
This is all very positive but the disconnect between demand and revenue, of course, is supply. As I mentioned, earlier, we believe that our industry has continued to fleet up slightly ahead of demand in anticipation of a long cycle ahead. Now for our part, we can't control which is quite a lot. We can adjust our CapEx up or down realtime. We can manage our used equipment sales together with CapEx for optimal fleet size. We can adjust the timing of our spend, and we can move idle fleet to  areas of higher demand. In addition, we can continue to drive cross-sell and invest in our sales force, and we'll be even more stringent on cost controls and take a number -- any number of other actions. And we're making these decisions against an industry backdrop that continues to look very positive. We expect to benefit from the growth in demand for at least the next several years, driven by construction and industrial activity and the secular shift towards rental. And as far as withstanding any headwinds, we're looking at 2016 as a clean slate with every option on the table, including the timing and the amount of capital spend. 
We already know that we'll spend significantly less CapEx in the first quarter of 2016 than in Q1 of this year. And we'll be watching demand very closely, and we'll make sure we continue to meet our customer needs as the year unfolds. In our opinion, the best way to grow to the business is to go in the year with a strong understanding of the market but with no preconceived notions as operators. Our goal is and always has been to drive higher returns, and we have tremendous flexibility in the path we take to meet that goal. 
So with that, I'll ask Bill to go to the financial results, and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

As has been our custom, I'll try to add some color to the information that was released last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions, if we don't get to something you're interest",1899,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As has been our custom, I'll try to add some color to the information that was released last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions, if we don't get to something you're interested in. 
So starting with rental revenue. Within rental revenue, rental revenue grew overall 0.8% year-over-year. It's about $11 million of increase versus last year. Within that, we had re-rent and ancillary items this year essentially flat to last year, so no contribution to growth from re-rent and ancillary combined or individually. It was all about OER growth, and that was driven by the rental rate experience that we posted last night. Rates being down at 0.10% year-over-year, that cost us about $1.5 million of year-over-year rental revenue. Our volume growth was still a solid 2.4% volume growth. That's growth in OEC on rent, and that translates into about $29 million worth of year-over-year revenue increase. 
Replacement CapEx inflation was about a 1.7 percentage point headwind, good for just under $20 million of year-over-year revenue decline as an offset to the volume increase. And then everything else we're calling mix and other was an increase of about 0.3% or about $3.1 million year-over-year, and that includes the mix of our business as well as a little bit of FX. Most of FX shows up in the volume measure in this way of breaking things down but a little bit drops down into that mix and other line. 
Speaking of FX, we continue to have headwinds from the Canadian currency being down materially. It was down about 17% in the quarter compared to last year, and that was worth about $26 million of revenue decline year-over-year sprinkled amongst the other components that I already mentioned. If you took out CapEx for the quarter, our rental revenue growth would have been 2.8% and certainly more in line with what we've seen in terms of fleet growth and the other components. So those are the comments that offer regarding rental revenue. 
Just to touch a little bit more on some of the operating measures. Time utilization in the quarter finished at 70%. And as I've said, that reflected rental -- fleet on rent growth of about 2.4% year-over-year. $6.27 billion was our average fleet on rent during the quarter. That 70% utilization was down 150 basis points versus last year comparable to the decline that we saw back in the second quarter, maybe a touch more. That's clearly an area of focus for us as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year, and certainly you'll hear us talk more about focusing on driving that utilization improvement wherever we can. 
For used equipment, solid quarter for used equipment sales in the quarter, $142 million in the quarter. That's basically flat with third quarter of last year. And an adjusted gross margin of 44%, that's down about 3 percentage points from last year. The primary driver of that decline is the mix of channels that we use. We sold about 52% of our used equipment in the retail channel, and we did a little bit more in auctions than we have been doing historically and certainly more than we did last year in selling used equipment in the quarter. So that combination was the primary driver for the margin decline year-over-year. 
The auction increase, I wouldn't go too far with that. We used about 12% of our sales through auction in the quarter, that compares to something like 4% or 5% last year. And it's consistent with our focus on making sure that we dispose of the fleet that we need to dispose off during the course of 2015. 
Moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $780 million in the quarter and very importantly, as Mike said, 50% margin, 50.3% margin to be precise. That represents about $19 million of improvement over last year and a margin improvement of 100 basis points. To break down that year-over-year increase of $19 million, we saw rental rates as a headwind in its contribution to EBITDA of about $1 million. Volume, that volume revenue drive -- drove about $20 million worth of volume impact at EBITDA. The fleet inflation headwind there was $14 million against that, and the margin decline by called out earlier in used sales cost us about $4 million year-over-year. The impact of our merit increases, we've been calling that out, it's about $6 million per quarter. It's against $6 million in this quarter. And the 2 big positives in the quarter this year were the incentive compensation adjustment that we've made in the third quarter of this year as incentive programs have come down -- our accrual for incentive revenues have come down, reflecting the somewhat -- well, the weaker performance than what we had in our original plan. So that was worth about $13 million of year-over-year improvement. 
We also had a mix and other improvement of about $11 million, and that came from a variety of cost-save items that Mike referred to. In our cost of rentals, we had nice performance in delivery cost during the quarter, some wage and benefit saves during the quarter and some puts and takes elsewhere that overall resulted in a very nice cost of rentals performance. And on top of that, we also have a nice SG&A performance in the quarter, with SG&A like T&A expense, professional fees, a little bit of improvement in bad debt expense, all adding up to a nice contribution there. 
So all in all, it was a pretty good quarter on the cost front. And when you add those 2 benefits of incentive comp decline and mix and other, it adds up to the overall $19 million of EBITDA improvement that we saw versus third quarter last year. Currency is sprinkled throughout those different lines of the EBITDA bridge as well. Currency had an unfavorable impact of about $8 million when you're talking about EBITDA in the quarter, so it continues to be a material headwind. 
Flow-through in the quarter, it's hard to even say some of these number sometimes, but flow-through in the was very high, 317% for the quarter. And obviously, it's a very sensitive calculation, driven by the fact we had a fairly small denominator in the year-over-year change in total revenue. So that 317% was heavily benefited by the incentive compensation accrual adjustment. If you take that out in the quarter, flow-through would have been 86%, still pretty robust and therefore reflecting some of the other cost saves that we had. But as we said all along, you shouldn't look at flow-through in a 1-quarter lens. You should think about it longer term. If you look at our year-to-date flow-through, the total number including the incentive comp adjustments that we've made is 84%, still pretty high. If you take out the adjustment in incentive comp, year-to-date flow-through would be about 62%, and that's very much in line with the roughly 60% that we've been guiding to so a good flow-through story for the quarter. 
Just real quickly on EPS. As Mike mentioned, $2.57 adjusted EPS for the quarter was a company record. That's up 17% over EPS in the comparable quarter. And that, I'll remind you, includes the affect of the currency headwind. Currency costs us about $0.05 per share in this $2.57 EPS quarter, so continue to deliver a nice result at EPS even with the various impacts that we're talking about. 
Moving on to free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've generated $511 million of free cash flow once you exclude the $3 million impact of merger-related payments, which is the way we talk about it. That compares to $328 million on the same basis in the first 9 months of last year, and we continue to feel very comfortable with our free cash flow view for the full year. The primary drivers of the free cash flow result this quarter were the better EBITDA performance, a little bit less CapEx than the year-to-date period last year and a little bit better interest expense or cash interest expense in the year-to-date period as well. Gross rental CapEx, just to mention with that, for the third quarter, it was $409 million. And that brings the full year-to-date period of CapEx spend to $1.4 billion. Actually, the actual number was $1.425 billion. Net rental CapEx for the third quarter was $268 million, and that brought the full year-to-date net rental CapEx number to $1 billion. 
Moving on quickly to our capital structure and a little bit on liquidity. At the end of the quarter, we have liquidity of just over $800 million. That included ABL capacity of about $620 million and roughly $170 million of cash on the balance sheet, so we feel that we're well positioned with regard to liquidity. 
A real quick update on the share repurchase program. We continue to execute purchases under the $750 million authorization. In the quarter, we bought back $167 million and that brings the total against this program at quarter end to $740 million, leaving $10 million to complete during the course of the fourth quarter. We do believe we'll finish that in the fourth quarter. And as we've said before, the new $1 billion authorization that we have from the Board, we will commence buying on right after we complete the existing $750 million program. Our thinking now is that $1 billion program, we will execute on a fairly steady basis. And as we've called out before, we expect to complete that program over 18 months once we start it. Last quarter, I did remind you or mentioned to you all that we need to be mindful of limitations on the amount of share repurchases that we can do under our debt covenants. And just to update you there, as we said at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $500 million of available capacity for repurchasing shares or other restricted transactions. That includes the restricted payments baskets in our debt facilities as well as the cash capacity that we have up at the holding company level of URI. 
Just real briefly on ROIC for the quarter, 8.9% in the third quarter, that's a trailing 12-month number, as you all know, and that's up 50 basis points compared to the same period last year and flat with where we were at the second quarter of this year. Not going to spend much time on the outlook because we didn't change anything in the outlook so certainly, the numbers remain operative there. Certainly, if you have any questions about the outlook, we can address them in Q&A. 
So I'll stop there with my comments and again, welcome any questions on things that I didn't touch on or more detail on things that I did. But I just want to echo the commentary that you heard from Michael and that the results in the quarter, we feel very good about, certainly, the profitability, certainly, the margin. And we feel like we're on the right track in dealing with the environment that we're in. And we certainly are thinking very much about how we finish out the year strong and get good momentum going into '16.

I won't offer any commentary on the OEMs' view of what next year's order pattern will look like. The $1.1 billion of replacement CapEx for us is the calculation of what it would take in order to just replace the units that we would be selling as used, and so it's a pretty straightforward mathematical calculation. We make a separate decision every year about how much we will actually replace, and that is driven by where the fleet stands versus what we calculate as its rental useful life as well as how the used sales strategy fits in with our overall fleet management strategy. And those are the things that are going to drive how much we actually sell as used. What that means to the OEMs, I'll let them comment on. The one thing I will point out that we do, obviously, we feel the impact of prior year's purchasing patterns on any given year's rental useful life, and so we'll certainly be monitoring that dynamic as we go forward. But again, I'll let the OEMs commentary stand at their own commentary."

It won't be a full reversal though because remember last year, we accrued to a very high payout level for our program, almost maxed out. This year, we're accruing to a below-target payout level.

So that's starting point number one is that we think the backdrop will be positive. Point number two is that we are very focused on the utilization performance of the company as we think about next year. That's going to be a very important guide for us in thinking about what we're doing, where we're going, how much we're investing in the fleet to get it done.

So the $22 million run rate at the third quarter, as I'm sure you've noted, is down from where it was in the second quarter, and we can certainly talk about the drivers there. But in terms of the initiatives that we're pursuing, they're very much similar to what we've talked about in the past, right? We've implemented all of the important components of a lean program, and what we're about now is rolling that out to a broader set of locations across our business and touching more of the processes in the business. The $22 million number is reflective of all of the work that we've done so far, much of which was focused on improving the productivity of each dollar of cost that we spent rather than actually taking out absolute dollars of cost. Well, given that volume hasn't developed quite the way we thought it would this year, the improved productivity hasn't delivered the same amount of save that we initially thought. And so now we're pivoting to look at whether there are actual dollar cost that we need to take out in order to continue to drive that productivity result. And so that's being discussed as we speak right here and now. We still are very comfortable guiding to that $100 million run rate impact by the end of next year because we can look across the business and still see places where we haven't implemented fully all the lean initiatives or where we have but we haven't gotten as much out of them as we might have anticipated.

That's step two. And we'll continue to look at that. Step three might be if we're not seeing the market offer a rate environment that we would expect. Early in the year, rate is always a challenge because of seasonality. But if it's more of a challenge than sort of what we have going into the year, then we'll have to reassess.

But it wasn't the entire explanation for the cost of rent improvement that we saw. We did have a little bit of a fuel benefit in the quarter as well that showed up primarily in cost of rent. And so call it a couple of million dollars in the quarter there as well. But I'll remind you that fuel as it plays through cost of rent is a pass-through for the rental fuel, the fuel that's actually in the equipment we rent, right? The customer pays for that, so it's sort of a natural hedge. And the fuel component of our delivery cost, that's a pass-through to our delivery charge as well, so it's sort of a natural hedge. So the impact may not be as large as you think from fuel. What else? I called out overall delivery cost of which fuel was a part. Wage and benefit saves were really just about headcount, not particular headcount action but the natural turnover of headcount in our business as well as some efficiencies that we're realizing from some of the cost-save initiatives that we talked about earlier. Those are the primary drivers within the cost of rent saves, and we think we've got the opportunity to continue to drive more saves as we go forward."

I'm going to use some of the time today to share how we're thinking about the opportunities in 2016. But first, let's start with the results that we reported last night. 
As you saw from our press release, there are some mixed dynamics in the quarter as well as some strong positives. Our revenue was up just slightly year-over-year, but we made the most of every dollar and delivered substantial profitability. In fact, it was a record quarter for us, with adjusted EPS of $2.57 per diluted share and an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%. Now this is a company record not only for the third quarter but for every quarter in our history. In addition, our Trench Safety and Power & HVAC businesses had stellar results, and our 9-month free cash flow stands at a robust $508 million. 
So there's a lot to like about the quarter. And as you saw last night, we reaffirmed our outlook for 2015. But we also dealt with some ongoing challenges to our top line, most notably upstream oil and gas and a weak Canadian economy with a negative impact on FX. In addition, there is still an oversupply of fleet in our industry, and these 3 dynamics taken together have put pressure on rates and utilization. Now this all unfolded pretty much as we expected, and we're running the business with great cost discipline in this environment. And as the numbers show, we've stayed true to our strategy by taking a balanced approach in a competitive market environment. That's where our focus is today and that's where it will be and will [ph] continue to be in 2016.
Now we'll issue our outlook in January as usual, but I think it's valuable to start that dialogue now. So before Bill goes through the quarter, I'd like to give you some insights into the current market conditions and our perspective on the coming year. First, our industry grew steadily through 2015. The demand for equipment rental in North America is far from hitting its peak. In the third quarter, we once again increased our volume of equipment on rent. And while time utilization eased year over year, it was still a healthy 70%. About half our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth in the quarter. Our mid-Atlantic region was particularly strong with double digit growth. Activity in this region is anchored by large manufacturing plants under construction in South Carolina and Tennessee as well as data center work and solar farms. And industrial activity remains strong with year-over-year growth and an attractive pipeline of projects. Our utilization for industrial has been in the mid-70s for the past 4 to 5 weeks. 
Now looking at our specialty businesses. Our 2 largest lines, Trench Safety and Power & HVAC both had an exceptional quarter. Trench generated year-over-year revenue growth of more than 16% and Power & HVAC delivered 20% growth. These increases were primarily driven by same-store growth, which is another indicator of demand. Now all of our specialty businesses benefited from greenfield expansion this year. To date, in 2015, we've opened a total of 15 new specialty branches in Trench, Power, Pump and Tools and another 3 are under construction. In our pump network, we're pursuing a penetration strategy with new and existing verticals. Now many of our pump cold starts in 2015 will be co-located with existing branches, where customer relationships can leverage for cross-selling. And we've had good success in developing a customer base for pump in verticals that de-risk the exposure of upstream oil and gas. The business has now shifted to less than 50% of upstream and is growing in other areas. 
Another positive indicator of demand is the performance of our National Accounts, which showed a year-over-year revenue increase in the quarter. And we've had good success in selling to high-growth verticals such as chemical processing, power and multifamily residential construction. National and Strategic Accounts are driving some of this business, but these verticals are also benefiting from a broader customer base. 
So those are some of our observations from the quarter, and we expect the remaining months of the year to play out with a typical seasonality. Now looking forward, our industry is in a very good place. Forecasters such as Global Insight, Dodge and others see multiple years of up-cycle ahead. And a number of factors are working in our favor, for example, a fair amount of U.S. construction growth is being driven by large multiyear projects with price tags of $50 million or higher, and this is an area where our scale really works to our advantage. In the U.S., spending on plant maintenance projects is ticking upward, which adds to industrial demand. And industrial spend in Canada is forecasted to begin a modest but steady recovery starting in 2016. 
This is all very positive but the disconnect between demand and revenue, of course, is supply. As I mentioned, earlier, we believe that our industry has continued to fleet up slightly ahead of demand in anticipation of a long cycle ahead. Now for our part we can control, which is quite a lot. We can adjust our CapEx up or down realtime. We can manage our used equipment sales together with CapEx for optimal fleet size. We can adjust the timing of our spend, and we can move idle fleet to areas of higher demand. In addition, we can continue to drive cross-sell and invest in our sales force, and we'll be even more stringent on cost controls and take a number -- any number of other actions. And we're making these decisions against an industry backdrop that continues to look very positive. We expect to benefit from the growth in demand for at least the next several years, driven by construction and industrial activity and a secular shift towards rental. And as far as withstanding any headwinds, we're looking at 2016 as a clean slate with every option on the table, including the timing and the amount of capital spend. 
We already know that we'll spend significantly less CapEx in the first quarter of 2016 than in Q1 of this year. And we'll be watching demand very closely, and we'll make sure we continue to meet our customer needs as the year unfolds. In our opinion, the best way to grow the business is to go into the year with a strong understanding of the market, but with no preconceived notions as operators. Our goal is and always has been to drive higher returns, and we have tremendous flexibility in the path we take to meet that goal. 
So with that, I'll ask Bill to go over the financial results, and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

As has been our custom, I'll try to add some color to the information that was released last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions, if we don't get to something you're interest",1902,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As has been our custom, I'll try to add some color to the information that was released last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions, if we don't get to something you're interested in. 
So starting with rental revenue. Within rental revenue, rental revenue grew overall 0.8% year-over-year. That's about $11 million of increase versus last year. Within that, we had re-rent and ancillary items this year essentially flat to last year, so no contribution to growth from re-rent and ancillary combined or individually. It was all about OER growth, and that was driven by the rental rate experience that we posted last night. Rates being down 0.10% year-over-year, that cost us about $1.5 million of year-over-year rental revenue. Our volume growth was still solid, 2.4% volume growth. That's growth in OEC on rent, and that translates into about $29 million worth of year-over-year revenue increase. 
Replacement CapEx inflation was about a 1.7 percentage point headwind, good for just under $20 million of year-over-year revenue decline as an offset to the volume increase. And then everything else we're calling mix and other was an increase of about 0.3% or about $3.1 million year-over-year, and that includes the mix of our business as well as a little bit of FX. Most of FX shows up in the volume measure in this way of breaking things down but a little bit drops down into that mix and other line. 
Speaking of FX, we continue to have headwinds from the Canadian currency being down materially. It was down about 17% in the quarter compared to last year, and that was worth about $26 million of revenue decline year-over-year sprinkled among the other components that I already mentioned. If you took out CapEx for the quarter, our rental revenue growth would have been 2.8% and certainly more in line with what we've seen in terms of fleet growth and the other components. So those are the comments that I'd offer regarding rental revenue. 
Just to touch a little bit more on some of the operating measures. Time utilization in the quarter finished at 70%. And as I said, that reflected rental -- fleet on rent growth of about 2.4% year-over-year. $6.27 billion was our average fleet on rent during the quarter. That 70% utilization was down 150 basis points versus last year comparable to the decline that we saw back in the second quarter, maybe a touch more. That's clearly an area of focus for us as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year, and certainly you'll hear us talk more about focusing on driving that utilization improvement wherever we can. 
For used equipment, a solid quarter for used equipment sales in the quarter, $142 million in the quarter. That's basically flat with third quarter of last year. And an adjusted gross margin of 44%, that's down about 3 percentage points from last year. The primary driver of that decline is the mix of channels that we use. We sold about 52% of our used equipment in the retail channel, and we did a little bit more in auctions than we have been doing historically and certainly more than we did last year in selling used equipment in the quarter. So that combination was the primary driver for the margin decline year-over-year. 
The auction increase, I wouldn't go too far with that. We used about 12% of our sales through auction in the quarter, that compares to something like 4% or 5% last year. And it's consistent with our focus on making sure that we dispose of the fleet that we need to dispose of during the course of 2015. 
Moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $780 million in the quarter and very importantly, as Mike said, 50% margin, 50.3% margin to be precise. That represents about $19 million of improvement over last year and a margin improvement of 100 basis points. To break down that year-over-year increase of $19 million, we saw rental rates as a headwind in its contribution to EBITDA of about $1 million. Volume, that volume revenue drive -- drove about $20 million worth of volume impact at EBITDA. The fleet inflation headwind there was $14 million against that, and the margin decline that I called out earlier in used sales cost us about $4 million year-over-year. The impact of our merit increases, we've been calling that out, it's about $6 million per quarter. It's again $6 million in this quarter. And the 2 big positives in the quarter this year were the incentive compensation adjustment that we've made in the third quarter of this year as incentive programs have come down -- our accrual for incentive programs have come down, reflecting the somewhat -- well, the weaker performance than what we had in our original plan. So that was worth about $13 million of year-over-year improvement. 
We also had a mix and other improvement of about $11 million, and that came from a variety of cost-save items that Mike referred to. In our cost of rentals, we had nice performance in delivery costs during the quarter, some wage and benefit saves during the quarter and some puts and takes elsewhere that overall resulted in a very nice cost of rentals performance. And on top of that, we also had a nice SG&A performance in the quarter, with SG&A lines like T&E expense, professional fees, a little bit of improvement in bad debt expense, all adding up to a nice contribution there. 
So all in all, it was a pretty good quarter on the cost front. And when you add those 2 benefits of incentive comp decline and mix and other, it adds up to the overall $19 million of EBITDA improvement that we saw versus third quarter last year. Currency is sprinkled throughout those different lines of the EBITDA bridge as well. Currency had an unfavorable impact of about $8 million when you're talking about EBITDA in the quarter, so it continues to be a material headwind. 
Flow-through in the quarter, it's hard to even say some of these number sometimes, but flow-through in the quarter was very high, 317% for the quarter. And obviously, it's a very sensitive calculation, driven by the fact that we had a fairly small denominator in the year-over-year change in total revenue. So that 317% was heavily benefited by the incentive compensation accrual adjustment. If you take that out in the quarter, flow-through would have been 86%, still pretty robust and therefore reflecting some of the other cost saves that we had. But as we've said all along, you shouldn't look at flow-through in a 1-quarter lens. You should think about it longer term. If you look at our year-to-date flow-through, the total number including the incentive comp adjustments that we've made is 84%, still pretty high. If you take out the adjustment to incentive comp, year-to-date flow-through would be about 62%, and that's very much in line with the roughly 60% that we've been guiding to. So a good flow-through story for the quarter. 
Just real quickly on EPS. As Mike mentioned, $2.57 adjusted EPS for the quarter was a company record. That's up 17% over EPS in the comparable quarter. And that, I'll remind you, includes the affect of the currency headwind. Currency cost us about $0.05 per share in this $2.57 EPS quarter, so continue to deliver a nice result at EPS even with the various impacts that we're talking about. 
Moving on to free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've generated $511 million of free cash flow once you exclude the $3 million impact of merger-related payments, which is the way we talk about it. That compares to $328 million on the same basis in the first 9 months of last year, and we continue to feel very comfortable with our free cash flow view for the full year. The primary drivers of the free cash flow result this quarter were the better EBITDA performance, a little bit less CapEx than the year-to-date period last year and a little bit better interest expense -- cash interest expense in the year-to-date period as well. Gross rental CapEx, just to mention that, for the third quarter, it was $409 million. And that brings the full year-to-date period of CapEx spend to $1.4 billion. Actually, the actual number was $1.425 billion. Net rental CapEx for the third quarter was $268 million, and that brought the full year-to-date net rental CapEx number to $1 billion. 
Moving on quickly to our capital structure and a little bit on liquidity. At the end of the quarter, we had liquidity of just over $800 million. That included ABL capacity of about $620 million and roughly $170 million of cash on the balance sheet, so we feel that we're well positioned with regard to liquidity. 
A real quick update on the share repurchase program. We continued to execute purchases under the $750 million authorization. In the quarter, we bought back $167 million and that brings the total against this program at quarter end to $740 million, leaving $10 million to complete during the course of the fourth quarter. We do believe we'll finish that in the fourth quarter. And as we've said before, the new $1 billion authorization that we have from the Board, we will commence buying on right after we complete the existing $750 million program. Our thinking now is that $1 billion program, we will execute on a fairly steady basis. And as we've called out before, we expect to complete that program over 18 months once we start it. Last quarter, I did remind you or mentioned to you all that we need to be mindful of limitations on the amount of share repurchases that we can do under our debt covenants. And just to update you there, as we said at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $500 million of available capacity for repurchasing shares or other restricted transactions. That includes the restricted payments baskets in our debt facilities as well as the cash capacity that we have up at the holding company level of URI. 
Just real briefly on ROIC for the quarter, 8.9% in the third quarter, that's a trailing 12-month number, as you all know, and that's up 50 basis points compared to the same period last year and flat with where we were at the second quarter of this year. Not going to spend much time on the outlook because we didn't change anything in the outlook so certainly, the numbers remain operative there. Certainly, if you have any questions about the outlook, we can address them in Q&A. 
So I'll stop there with my comments and again, welcome any questions on things that I didn't touch on or more detail on things that I did. But I just want to echo the commentary that you heard from Michael and that the results in the quarter, we feel very good about, certainly, the profitability, certainly, the margin. And we feel like we're on the right track in dealing with the environment that we're in. And we certainly are thinking very much about how we finish out the year strong and get good momentum going into '16. 
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

The $1.1 billion of replacement CapEx for us is the calculation of what it would take in order to just replace the units that we would be selling as used, and so it's a pretty straightforward mathematical calculation. We make a separate decision every year about how much we will actually replace, and that is driven by where the fleet stands versus what we calculate as its rental useful life as well as how the used sales strategy fits in with our overall fleet management strategy. And those are the things that are going to drive how much we actually sell as used. What that means to the OEMs, I'll let them comment on.

It won't be a full reversal, though, because remember last year, we accrued to a very high payout level for our program, almost maxed out. This year, we're accruing to a below-target payout level.

We start from thinking about what is the macro backdrop expected to look like in 2016 and all of the forecasts that we see suggest that there's still going to be a solid macro backdrop. So that's a good starting point and it gives us the opportunity to continue to absorb whatever is left of the oil and gas dislocation, absorb any excess fleet that might have been built up in the early part of 2015. So that's starting point number one is that we think the backdrop will be positive. Point number two is that we are very focused on the utilization performance of the company as we think about next year. That's going to be a very important guide for us in thinking about what we're doing, where we're doing it, how much we're investing in the fleet to get it done. So we will be, I think, in a better position to be able to manage rate if we're absorbing our existing fleet through utilization more effectively. So that's going to be another, I think, positive for us in how we approach delivering improved rate next year. Obviously, that will come along with a very intense cost focus. It won't directly impact rate but certainly will help us examine everything that we're doing and seeing there's a way to be more effective inside the company and therefore be more effective in the marketplace. So those are the key things that I'd point to, guys. What did I miss?"

So the $22 million run rate at the third quarter, as I'm sure you've noted, is down from where it was in the second quarter, and we can certainly talk about the drivers there. But in terms of the initiatives that we're pursuing, they're very much similar to what we've talked about in the past, right? We've implemented all of the important components of a lean program, and what we're about now is rolling that out to a broader set of locations across our business and touching more of the processes in the business. The $22 million number is reflective of all of the work that we've done so far, much of which was focused on improving the productivity of each dollar of cost that we spend rather than actually taking out absolute dollars of cost. Well, given that volume hasn't developed quite the way we thought it would this year, the improved productivity hasn't delivered the same amount of save that we initially thought. And so now we're pivoting to look at whether there are actual dollar costs that we need to take out in order to continue to drive that productivity result. And so that's being discussed as we speak right here and now. We still are very comfortable guiding to that $100 million run rate impact by the end of next year because we can look across the business and still see places where we haven't implemented fully all the lean initiatives or where we have but we haven't gotten as much out of them as we might have anticipated. So we're still comfortable saying that we expect to see the $100 million impact by the end of next year."

That's step two. And we'll continue to look at that. Step three might be if we're not seeing the market offer a rate environment that we would expect. Early in the year, rate is always a challenge because of seasonality. But if it's more of a challenge than sort of what we have going into the year, then we'll have to reassess.

And so call it a couple of million dollars in the quarter there as well. But I'll remind you that fuel as it plays through cost of rent is a pass-through for the rental fuel, the fuel that's actually in the equipment we rent, right? The customer pays for that, so it's sort of a natural hedge. And the fuel component of our delivery costs, that's a pass-through to our delivery charge as well, so it's sort of a natural hedge. So the impact may not be as large as you think from fuel. What else? I called out overall delivery costs of which fuel was a part. Wage and benefit saves were really just about headcount, not particular headcount action, but the natural turnover of headcount in our business as well as some efficiencies that we're realizing from some of the cost-save initiatives that we talked about earlier. Those are the primary drivers within the cost of rent saves, and we think we've got the opportunity to continue to drive more saves as we go forward."

I'm going to use some of the time today to share how we're thinking about the opportunities in 2016. But first, let's start with the results that we reported last night. 
As you saw from our press release, there are some mixed dynamics in the quarter as well as some strong positives. Our revenue was up just slightly year-over-year, but we made the most of every dollar and delivered substantial profitability. In fact, it was a record quarter for us, with adjusted EPS of $2.57 per diluted share and an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%. Now this is a company record not only for the third quarter but for every quarter in our history. In addition, our Trench Safety and Power & HVAC businesses had stellar results, and our 9-month free cash flow stands at a robust $508 million. 
So there's a lot to like about the quarter. And as you saw last night, we reaffirmed our outlook for 2015. But we also dealt with some ongoing challenges to our top line, most notably upstream oil and gas and a weak Canadian economy with a negative impact on FX. In addition, there is still an oversupply of fleet in our industry, and these 3 dynamics taken together have put pressure on rates and utilization. Now this all unfolded pretty much as we expected, and we're running the business with great cost discipline in this environment. And as the numbers show, we've stayed true to our strategy by taking a balanced approach in a competitive market environment. That's where our focus is today and that's where it will be and will [ph] continue to be in 2016.
Now we'll issue our outlook in January as usual, but I think it's valuable to start that dialogue now. So before Bill goes through the quarter, I'd like to give you some insights into the current market conditions and our perspective on the coming year. First, our industry grew steadily through 2015. The demand for equipment rental in North America is far from hitting its peak. In the third quarter, we once again increased our volume of equipment on rent. And while time utilization eased year over year, it was still a healthy 70%. About half our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth in the quarter. Our mid-Atlantic region was particularly strong with double digit growth. Activity in this region is anchored by large manufacturing plants under construction in South Carolina and Tennessee as well as data center work and solar farms. And industrial activity remains strong with year-over-year growth and an attractive pipeline of projects. Our utilization for industrial has been in the mid-70s for the past 4 to 5 weeks. 
Now looking at our specialty businesses. Our 2 largest lines, Trench Safety and Power & HVAC both had an exceptional quarter. Trench generated year-over-year revenue growth of more than 16% and Power & HVAC delivered 20% growth. These increases were primarily driven by same-store growth, which is another indicator of demand. Now all of our specialty businesses benefited from greenfield expansion this year. To date, in 2015, we've opened a total of 15 new specialty branches in Trench, Power, Pump and Tools and another 3 are under construction. In our pump network, we're pursuing a penetration strategy with new and existing verticals. Now many of our pump cold starts in 2015 will be co-located with existing branches, where customer relationships can leverage for cross-selling. And we've had good success in developing a customer base for pump in verticals that de-risk the exposure of upstream oil and gas. The business has now shifted to less than 50% of upstream and is growing in other areas. 
Another positive indicator of demand is the performance of our National Accounts, which showed a year-over-year revenue increase in the quarter. And we've had good success in selling to high-growth verticals such as chemical processing, power and multifamily residential construction. National and Strategic Accounts are driving some of this business, but these verticals are also benefiting from a broader customer base. 
So those are some of our observations from the quarter, and we expect the remaining months of the year to play out with a typical seasonality. Now looking forward, our industry is in a very good place. Forecasters such as Global Insight, Dodge and others see multiple years of up-cycle ahead. And a number of factors are working in our favor, for example, a fair amount of U.S. construction growth is being driven by large multiyear projects with price tags of $50 million or higher, and this is an area where our scale really works to our advantage. In the U.S., spending on plant maintenance projects is ticking upward, which adds to industrial demand. And industrial spend in Canada is forecasted to begin a modest but steady recovery starting in 2016. 
This is all very positive but the disconnect between demand and revenue, of course, is supply. As I mentioned, earlier, we believe that our industry has continued to fleet up slightly ahead of demand in anticipation of a long cycle ahead. Now for our part we can control, which is quite a lot. We can adjust our CapEx up or down realtime. We can manage our used equipment sales together with CapEx for optimal fleet size. We can adjust the timing of our spend, and we can move idle fleet to areas of higher demand. In addition, we can continue to drive cross-sell and invest in our sales force, and we'll be even more stringent on cost controls and take a number -- any number of other actions. And we're making these decisions against an industry backdrop that continues to look very positive. We expect to benefit from the growth in demand for at least the next several years, driven by construction and industrial activity and a secular shift towards rental. And as far as withstanding any headwinds, we're looking at 2016 as a clean slate with every option on the table, including the timing and the amount of capital spend. 
We already know that we'll spend significantly less CapEx in the first quarter of 2016 than in Q1 of this year. And we'll be watching demand very closely, and we'll make sure we continue to meet our customer needs as the year unfolds. In our opinion, the best way to grow the business is to go into the year with a strong understanding of the market, but with no preconceived notions as operators. Our goal is and always has been to drive higher returns, and we have tremendous flexibility in the path we take to meet that goal. 
So with that, I'll ask Bill to go over the financial results, and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

As has been our custom, I'll try to add some color to the information that was released last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions, if we don't get to something you're interest",1902,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As has been our custom, I'll try to add some color to the information that was released last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions, if we don't get to something you're interested in. 
So starting with rental revenue. Within rental revenue, rental revenue grew overall 0.8% year-over-year. That's about $11 million of increase versus last year. Within that, we had re-rent and ancillary items this year essentially flat to last year, so no contribution to growth from re-rent and ancillary combined or individually. It was all about OER growth, and that was driven by the rental rate experience that we posted last night. Rates being down 0.10% year-over-year, that cost us about $1.5 million of year-over-year rental revenue. Our volume growth was still solid, 2.4% volume growth. That's growth in OEC on rent, and that translates into about $29 million worth of year-over-year revenue increase. 
Replacement CapEx inflation was about a 1.7 percentage point headwind, good for just under $20 million of year-over-year revenue decline as an offset to the volume increase. And then everything else we're calling mix and other was an increase of about 0.3% or about $3.1 million year-over-year, and that includes the mix of our business as well as a little bit of FX. Most of FX shows up in the volume measure in this way of breaking things down but a little bit drops down into that mix and other line. 
Speaking of FX, we continue to have headwinds from the Canadian currency being down materially. It was down about 17% in the quarter compared to last year, and that was worth about $26 million of revenue decline year-over-year sprinkled among the other components that I already mentioned. If you took out CapEx for the quarter, our rental revenue growth would have been 2.8% and certainly more in line with what we've seen in terms of fleet growth and the other components. So those are the comments that I'd offer regarding rental revenue. 
Just to touch a little bit more on some of the operating measures. Time utilization in the quarter finished at 70%. And as I said, that reflected rental -- fleet on rent growth of about 2.4% year-over-year. $6.27 billion was our average fleet on rent during the quarter. That 70% utilization was down 150 basis points versus last year comparable to the decline that we saw back in the second quarter, maybe a touch more. That's clearly an area of focus for us as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year, and certainly you'll hear us talk more about focusing on driving that utilization improvement wherever we can. 
For used equipment, a solid quarter for used equipment sales in the quarter, $142 million in the quarter. That's basically flat with third quarter of last year. And an adjusted gross margin of 44%, that's down about 3 percentage points from last year. The primary driver of that decline is the mix of channels that we use. We sold about 52% of our used equipment in the retail channel, and we did a little bit more in auctions than we have been doing historically and certainly more than we did last year in selling used equipment in the quarter. So that combination was the primary driver for the margin decline year-over-year. 
The auction increase, I wouldn't go too far with that. We used about 12% of our sales through auction in the quarter, that compares to something like 4% or 5% last year. And it's consistent with our focus on making sure that we dispose of the fleet that we need to dispose of during the course of 2015. 
Moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $780 million in the quarter and very importantly, as Mike said, 50% margin, 50.3% margin to be precise. That represents about $19 million of improvement over last year and a margin improvement of 100 basis points. To break down that year-over-year increase of $19 million, we saw rental rates as a headwind in its contribution to EBITDA of about $1 million. Volume, that volume revenue drive -- drove about $20 million worth of volume impact at EBITDA. The fleet inflation headwind there was $14 million against that, and the margin decline that I called out earlier in used sales cost us about $4 million year-over-year. The impact of our merit increases, we've been calling that out, it's about $6 million per quarter. It's again $6 million in this quarter. And the 2 big positives in the quarter this year were the incentive compensation adjustment that we've made in the third quarter of this year as incentive programs have come down -- our accrual for incentive programs have come down, reflecting the somewhat -- well, the weaker performance than what we had in our original plan. So that was worth about $13 million of year-over-year improvement. 
We also had a mix and other improvement of about $11 million, and that came from a variety of cost-save items that Mike referred to. In our cost of rentals, we had nice performance in delivery costs during the quarter, some wage and benefit saves during the quarter and some puts and takes elsewhere that overall resulted in a very nice cost of rentals performance. And on top of that, we also had a nice SG&A performance in the quarter, with SG&A lines like T&E expense, professional fees, a little bit of improvement in bad debt expense, all adding up to a nice contribution there. 
So all in all, it was a pretty good quarter on the cost front. And when you add those 2 benefits of incentive comp decline and mix and other, it adds up to the overall $19 million of EBITDA improvement that we saw versus third quarter last year. Currency is sprinkled throughout those different lines of the EBITDA bridge as well. Currency had an unfavorable impact of about $8 million when you're talking about EBITDA in the quarter, so it continues to be a material headwind. 
Flow-through in the quarter, it's hard to even say some of these number sometimes, but flow-through in the quarter was very high, 317% for the quarter. And obviously, it's a very sensitive calculation, driven by the fact that we had a fairly small denominator in the year-over-year change in total revenue. So that 317% was heavily benefited by the incentive compensation accrual adjustment. If you take that out in the quarter, flow-through would have been 86%, still pretty robust and therefore reflecting some of the other cost saves that we had. But as we've said all along, you shouldn't look at flow-through in a 1-quarter lens. You should think about it longer term. If you look at our year-to-date flow-through, the total number including the incentive comp adjustments that we've made is 84%, still pretty high. If you take out the adjustment to incentive comp, year-to-date flow-through would be about 62%, and that's very much in line with the roughly 60% that we've been guiding to. So a good flow-through story for the quarter. 
Just real quickly on EPS. As Mike mentioned, $2.57 adjusted EPS for the quarter was a company record. That's up 17% over EPS in the comparable quarter. And that, I'll remind you, includes the effect of the currency headwind. Currency cost us about $0.05 per share in this $2.57 EPS quarter, so continue to deliver a nice result at EPS even with the various impacts that we're talking about. 
Moving on to free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've generated $511 million of free cash flow once you exclude the $3 million impact of merger-related payments, which is the way we talk about it. That compares to $328 million on the same basis in the first 9 months of last year, and we continue to feel very comfortable with our free cash flow view for the full year. The primary drivers of the free cash flow result this quarter were the better EBITDA performance, a little bit less CapEx than the year-to-date period last year and a little bit better interest expense -- cash interest expense in the year-to-date period as well. Gross rental CapEx, just to mention that, for the third quarter, it was $409 million. And that brings the full year-to-date period of CapEx spend to $1.4 billion. Actually, the actual number was $1.425 billion. Net rental CapEx for the third quarter was $268 million, and that brought the full year-to-date net rental CapEx number to $1 billion. 
Moving on quickly to our capital structure and a little bit on liquidity. At the end of the quarter, we had liquidity of just over $800 million. That included ABL capacity of about $620 million and roughly $170 million of cash on the balance sheet, so we feel that we're well positioned with regard to liquidity. 
A real quick update on the share repurchase program. We continued to execute purchases under the $750 million authorization. In the quarter, we bought back $167 million and that brings the total against this program at quarter end to $740 million, leaving $10 million to complete during the course of the fourth quarter. We do believe we'll finish that in the fourth quarter. And as we've said before, the new $1 billion authorization that we have from the Board, we will commence buying on right after we complete the existing $750 million program. Our thinking now is that $1 billion program, we will execute on a fairly steady basis. And as we've called out before, we expect to complete that program over 18 months once we start it. Last quarter, I did remind you or mentioned to you all that we need to be mindful of limitations on the amount of share repurchases that we can do under our debt covenants. And just to update you there, as we said at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $500 million of available capacity for repurchasing shares or other restricted transactions. That includes the restricted payments baskets in our debt facilities as well as the cash capacity that we have up at the holding company level of URI. 
Just real briefly on ROIC for the quarter, 8.9% in the third quarter, that's a trailing 12-month number, as you all know, and that's up 50 basis points compared to the same period last year and flat with where we were at the second quarter of this year. Not going to spend much time on the outlook because we didn't change anything in the outlook so certainly, the numbers remain operative there. Certainly, if you have any questions about the outlook, we can address them in Q&A. 
So I'll stop there with my comments and again, welcome any questions on things that I didn't touch on or more detail on things that I did. But I just want to echo the commentary that you heard from Michael and that the results in the quarter, we feel very good about, certainly, the profitability, certainly, the margin.

I won't offer any commentary on the OEM's view of what next year's order pattern will look like. The $1.1 billion of replacement CapEx for us is the calculation of what it would take in order to just replace the units that we would be selling as used, and so it's a pretty straightforward mathematical calculation. We make a separate decision every year about how much we will actually replace, and that is driven by where the fleet stands versus what we calculate as its rental useful life as well as how the used sales strategy fits in with our overall fleet management strategy. And those are the things that are going to drive how much we actually sell as used. What that means to the OEMs, I'll let them comment on. The one thing I will point out that we do -- obviously, we feel the impact of prior year's purchasing patterns on any given year's rental useful life, and so we'll certainly be monitoring that dynamic as we go forward.

It won't be a full reversal, though, because remember last year, we accrued to a very high payout level for our program, almost maxed out. This year, we're accruing to a below-target payout level.

Point number two is that we are very focused on the utilization performance of the company as we think about next year.

There'll be a little less supply in those areas. But more importantly, the dynamic for us is that we've still won some business in oil and gas plays right now throughout many of the different shales.

So the $22 million run rate at the third quarter, as I'm sure you've noted, is down from where it was in the second quarter, and we can certainly talk about the drivers there. But in terms of the initiatives that we're pursuing, they're very much similar to what we've talked about in the past, right? We've implemented all of the important components of a lean program, and what we're about now is rolling that out to a broader set of locations across our business and touching more of the processes in the business. The $22 million number is reflective of all of the work that we've done so far, much of which was focused on improving the productivity of each dollar of cost that we spend rather than actually taking out absolute dollars of cost. Well, given that volume hasn't developed quite the way we thought it would this year, the improved productivity hasn't delivered the same amount of save that we initially thought. And so now we're pivoting to look at whether there are actual dollar costs that we need to take out in order to continue to drive that productivity result. And so that's being discussed as we speak right here and now. We still are very comfortable guiding to that $100 million run rate impact by the end of next year because we can look across the business and still see places where we haven't implemented fully all the lean initiatives or where we have but we haven't gotten as much out of them as we might have anticipated.

But it wasn't the entire explanation for the cost of rent improvements that we saw. We did have a little bit of a fuel benefit in the quarter as well that showed up primarily in cost of rent. And so call it a couple of million dollars in the quarter there as well. But I'll remind you that fuel as it plays through cost of rent is a pass-through for the rental fuel, the fuel that's actually in the equipment we rent, right? The customer pays for that, so it's sort of a natural hedge. And the fuel component of our delivery costs, that's a pass-through to our delivery charge as well, so it's sort of a natural hedge. So the impact may not be as large as you think from fuel. What else? I called out overall delivery costs of which fuel was a part. Wage and benefit saves were really just about headcount, not particular headcount action, but the natural turnover of headcount in our business as well as some efficiencies that we're realizing from some of the cost-save initiatives that we talked about earlier. Those are the primary drivers within the cost of rent saves, and we think we've got the opportunity to continue to drive more saves as we go forward."
