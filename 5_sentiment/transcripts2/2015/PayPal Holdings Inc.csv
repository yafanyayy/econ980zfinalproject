Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first earnings call as an independent company. I'm pleased to say we had strong results for the quarter. But before I get into some of the details, I'd like to introduce you",2425,"Great. Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first earnings call as an independent company. I'm pleased to say we had strong results for the quarter. But before I get into some of the details, I'd like to introduce you to John Rainey, our new Chief Financial Officer. I'm thrilled to have John join our leadership team. He is not just a seasoned public company CFO, but he is a world-class individual whose judgment and integrity are a pleasure to see in action. I'm sure all of you will enjoy working with him. John will be providing a detailed overview of our financial performance later in this call.
Now let me highlight some of our key results and initiatives in the third quarter. PayPal had a great start as an independent company, gaining market share, expanding our customer base and deepening our engagement with our customers. In Q3, payment volume increased 27% on an FX-neutral basis, with PayPal processing $70 billion in total payment volume. This continues our track record of mid- to high 20% growth in every quarter this year. Merchant Services TPV continued its strong base, growing 34%, approximately 1.5 to 2x the growth of e-commerce, further extending our global lead in online and mobile Payments. 
We're operating in a time when change is sweeping through the financial services industry, driven by the rise of mobile technology and the acceleration of money becoming increasingly digital. These 2 massive trends play directly to our strengths and give PayPal the unique opportunity to expand our reach and relevance to both consumers and merchants.
We are making significant strides in our vision to use our platform become a full-service solution provider for merchants as they seek to form more intimate relationships with their customers. And we strongly believe that our platform and other upcoming development efforts will enable PayPal to be an everyday part of the financial lives of our consumers.
Why do I consider our position so differentiated from our competition? It's not simply because we continue to build and extend our strong leadership position. Of course, our increasing scale counts, but it is our focus that separates us from others. We are the only company that is entirely focused on end-to-end digital payments across the globe. Our brand continues to strengthen. For the first time, we were named as one of the top 100 brands in the world, driven by the latest in our new product innovation, leading risk models and outstanding customer service. Each quarter we extend the strength of our key attributes, in this comes through clearly in our results.
As I've mentioned, there are 4 metrics that capture the health and strength of our business. They are the increasing scale of our customer base, the engagement of that base is measured by transactions per account, our top line revenue growth and free cash flow. And the third quarter was our best quarter of 2015, in each of these supporting areas. We finished the quarter with 173 million active accounts, adding over 4 million new customers in the past 3 months, our best net add quarter in 2015. Of the 173 million, approximately 13 million are merchants to accept PayPal across the world. Think about that. Think about that scale in terms of both consumers and merchants. It's a powerful, very difficult asset to replicate. 
To put it in context, our active customers for all citizens with single mission, PayPal would now be the eighth largest country the world. Consumers across the globe in merchant, large and small, are signing up for PayPal in record numbers. 
But our goal is not simply to grow our customer base. We are intensely focused on creating more relevant relationships with every one of our customers. In Q3, we processed 1.2 billion transactions for our customers, up 25% from the last year. And perhaps most importantly, we increased transactions per account, which rose from 24 a year ago to 27, growing 12% as our new product and services begin to resonate with our large customer base. These strong customer numbers naturally led to strong revenue growth. We grew our top line at 19% on an FX-neutral basis and 15% on a spot basis in the third quarter, with revenues of approximately $2.3 billion. This obviously strengthens our conviction that we will deliver on our full year FX-neutral revenue guidance of 15% to 18%. 
And finally, free cash flow expanded nicely in line with our expectation. We had a significant increase in our cash flow, and we are on track to deliver our guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in 2015. 
While we're obviously pleased with our financial results, what's even more important is the strength of the underlying drivers of these results. As I mentioned earlier, our brand just continues to strengthen. In October, for the first time ever, PayPal was ranked on Interbrand's Top Global 100 list, placing #97. This honor is more than just the ranking. Being one of interbrand's Top 100 is the recognition that our brand's truly global and has successfully transcended geographic and cultural differences.
In a recent Forrester study of U.S. consumers people trusts PayPal to provide their mobile digital wallet more than banks, credit card networks or other technology companies. The trust associated with our brand comes from assets that are difficult to replicate. These range from our sophisticated risk algorithms, driven by the billions of transactions on our platform and our 8,000 customer service associates, where our Net Promoter Score continues to rise year-over-year.
Our value proposition is a force that attracts consumers to choose PayPal. It drives measurable sales conversion lift for merchants who offer PayPal as a way to pay. Simply put, merchants and consumers trust PayPal. But interestingly, people are even more compelled to choose and use us once they have experience the convenience of our newest innovations like One Touch. I'd like to highlight some the progress we've made in the quarter innovating and enhancing our products our customers.
Let me start with One Touch. I believe that One Touch is significant forward in the commerce checkout experience and a key way in which we are creating more engagement with our customers, both merchants and consumers. It is a faster, simpler and more convenient way for consumers to check out at merchant sites, whether in mobile apps, on the mobile web or online across all form factors -- platforms and payment sites.
In Q3, we began to roll out One Touch to 16 markets and 100% of eligible U.S. consumers and merchants. Today, more than 60% of the IR 500 and over 1 million merchants around the world, from the largest like Home Depot to the smallest, have One Touch enabled for their customers. And we are rapidly gaining consumer adoption. Today, some 7 million consumers have opted to use One Touch globally, and everyday that number rapidly increases. 
We continue to see not just meaningful improvement in conversion rates when One Touch is used, but also interestingly, a significant improvement in customer engagement. The innovation behind One Touch came to us in the acquisition of Braintree. In the re-platform of our PayPal software stack enabled its rapid global implementation. We marked an important milestone for the 2-year anniversary of our Braintree acquisition. It's now very clear that Braintree's early bet on mobile is paying off. Most of the best NextGen mobile commerce companies use Braintree for payments. 
Two years ago, Braintree has 56 million cards on sale. This quarter, Braintree had 185 million cards on file and has quadrupled the volume it processes. Our increased customer approach and engagement is the direct result of our focus on providing full solution to our merchant partners. The PayPal sales force across 46 markets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia is actively selling the full suite of services on our platform, focused on capturing 100% share of checkout. And we are seeing tremendous adoption, greatly expanding our base of merchants, which includes new companies like Jec.com, One Kings Lane and the Hungry Owl [ph] as well as industry leaders like Uber and Airbnb. And Venmo continues to set the standard as the mobile payment app for millenials. A year ago, Venmo processed $700 million in volume in Q3. This quarter, Venmo processed $2.1 billion of volume, growing well over 200% year-over-year. This makes Venmo one of the fastest growing apps in the world and likely 1 of the top 10 apps in the U.S. by dollar volume. And a typical Venmo customer engages with the Venmo app multiple times per week. I'm also pleased to share that we will shortly begin trial engages allowing Venmo customers to pay with Venmo and selected PayPal merchants. This provides even more value to Venmo customers and at the same time, allows us to start the monetization of our Venmo asset.
I'd like to close my remarks by highlighting 3 areas: Credit, our in-store and on the efforts and end with a quick update on our announced acquisitions. These topics frequently come up in conversations I have with investors so I thought some additional color might be helpful.
Credit is an important way we deepen our relationship with our customers, both merchants and consumers. And we're committed to creating transparent and compelling credit products that help our customers have better control of their money. I'm pleased, but not surprised, that PayPal Working Capital, our lending program that provides our merchant customers the capital they need to grow and succeed, has now exceeded $1 billion in credit extended to more than 60,000 small and medium businesses in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. PayPal Working Capital uniquely leverages PayPal technology and data to assess creditworthiness, underwrite the service loans in ways that traditional lenders can't. We bid eligibility on a merchant's PayPal processing value, not their business or personal credit score. 
PayPal Working Capital loan amounts which ranges from $1,000  to $85,000 -- in a traditional banking environment. And perhaps most importantly, PayPal Working Capital also powers our traditional business. 90% of the merchants who use PayPal Working Capital reapply for a loan, and their Net Promoter Scores and TPV go up significantly, which naturally results in meaningful term reduction numbers. It's a true win-win for our position. 
Let me now spend a couple of minutes on our multichannel efforts and some of our early success working [indiscernible] for merchants.
Our goal is to help merchants provide a truly differentiated value proposition in using mobile across the web, in-app and in-store. The movement of in-app mobile payments to the in-store environment unleashes a tremendous opportunity for us, opening our addressable market by almost 10x. Mobile provides a natural evolution for PayPal to move from the online and in-app world to the in-store environment. As our retail partners search for ways to use mobile across all channels in order to form ever more personal connections to their customers, they are looking for a full-service platform to power their application across all payment types and loyalty. They desire a cloud-based solution that is point-of-sale technology, device and operating system agnostic. Our merchants want to provide a consistent experience and value proposition to all of their customers, regardless of channel, device, OS or payment type, and the combination of our Paydiant, Braintree and PayPal platforms provide the capabilities they are looking for. 
Unlike our previous in-store efforts, our merchant partners are driving the adoption of our open platform. PayPal is working to be a true payments partner to merchants who are increasingly seeking to bridge the divide between online and in-store through mobile. By being truly technology and payments agnostic, we can focus on improving the entire commerce experience by linking our merchant's loyalty, efforts, reports and private label credit cards into our platform, and provide capabilities like split tender at point-of-sale and other innovative propositions in order to help merchants create deeper and more powerful engagement with their customers.
In September, Macy's announced an integration with PayPal for omnichannel checkout capability online, in-store and on mobile. The integration enables Macy's customers to pay in-store with PayPal payment codes and online and on mobile via the PayPal button and One Touch. These innovative payment options are also available in all Macy's, Bloomingdales, Macy's Backstage and Bloomingdale's Outlet stores in the U.S.
Subway, with its 30,000-plus locations is using Paydiant and PayPal for its order-ahead application. And with Shell Oil in the U.K., we jointly announced a mobile payment service that allows drivers to fill up and go without having to go into a store and pay. Fill Up and Go is the first mobile payment services at the pump offered by a fuels retailer in the U.K. 
And finally, our Paydiant platform is the technology powering Target, CVS, Walmart, Wendy's, Sears and K-Mart as they trial the MCX currency application in Ohio. 
As you can see, merchants are beginning to use our platform and capabilities to put forth true value proposition enhancements for their consumers. These omnichannel efforts are already well beyond anything we've done previously and we are just getting started.
Finally, I'd like to touch on acquisitions. First, we expect to close our Xoom acquisition later this quarter. I'm more excited than ever to welcome Xoom to the PayPal family. And in August, we announced the acquisition of Chicago-based Modest, a company that bought us world-class talent and technology that will allow us to accelerate our -- in contextual commerce, allowing customers to pay for products and services in whatever context they discover them, not just on a merchant website. Modest has deployed a leading set of APIs that allows contextual design buttons to hook directly into a merchant's e-commerce order management systems, which is essential in providing a full-service -- solution to our merchants.
But as important as acquisitions are for us, our internal innovation efforts will always be our primary driver of value. Our technology reflects -- efforts have allowed us to dramatically accelerate our organic software development roadmap. We now have a powerful combination of internal innovation efforts and acquisition firepower working in tandem. That's a strong combination to drive and further differentiate our leadership position.
I'd like to conclude by saying thanks to the entire PayPal team. It's because of your focus, your passion for our for our mission and day-in and day-out efforts that we continue to make strides towards our ultimate goal of being a customer champion. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to John. John?"

It's a pleasure to be here for PayPal's first earnings call a newly independent, publicly traded company. I also like to thank PayPal's 173 million customers and 16,000 employees worldwide for making this a great quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us, and I'm excited to be able to join Dan and the rest of the PayPal team to transform the movement and management of money.
Q3 was a strong quarter and we continued to execute on our plans. As Dan mentioned, we grew revenue 19% on an FX-neutral basis, and achieved earnings of $0.31 per share, an increase of 31%. We continue to grow our share of the market. Our share gain is an indication that our strategy is working as we expand our product solution from a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. As our results for the quarter show, we are delivering on the commitments that we outlined earlier this year.
We are expanding our reach and becoming more relevant, enabling us to deepen our engagement with our customers by increasing the number of merchants where PayPal is available to shop and pay. In the quarter, we went live with a number of large retailers like Macy's, REI and Symantec. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 27, up 12% from a year ago.
Importantly, our payment volume through the mobile channel increased 42% year-over-year to $16.5 billion. With mobile growing faster and continuing to gain share, that highlights the shift in consumer behavior and the opportunity we have to leverage this trend as mobile technology bridges the divide to the significantly larger in-store opportunity.
I'd like to highlight our performance on a few operating metrics for the quarter. First, we expanded our active account base by more than 4 million in the quarter to 173 million customers. The number of payment transactions increased 25%, driven by growth of the media, travel and retail verticals. Total payment volume was $70 billion in the quarter, up 27% on an FX-neutral basis. U.S. payment volume grew 28%, a 2-point acceleration, while international growth was 45%, again, on an FX-neutral basis.
Our U.S. business benefited from strong results in both Braintree and Venmo in addition to the transaction growth from our branded PayPal digital wallet product. PayPal merchant service transactions in North America, which exclude Braintree and Venmo, accelerated one point to 25%. 
As we can do business in 203 markets across the world, the stronger dollar had an impact on our results, not only from a translation perspective but also in consumer demand. We experienced weakness in China exports, specifically from our merchants off of eBay, which were impacted by lower demand from both Australia and Europe.
For the quarter, PayPal generated $2.3 billion of revenue, up 19%, FX-neutral. Transaction revenue was up 18%, while Other Value Added Services grew 26%. Transaction revenue benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree's unbranded product and the evolution from a payment button or a tender type to payment partner where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes.
Other Value Added Services benefited from the growing penetration of PayPal Credit, as well as an amended agreement with Synchrony Financial during the quarter for which we will now record revenue each quarter versus historically recognized revenue annually in the second quarter of each year. The amended agreement extends our relationship with Synchrony, and importantly, no longer requires PayPal to purchase the credit portfolio in October of next year, freeing up more than $1 billion of cash for users that are more accretive to shareholders.
Total expenses grew 12%, significantly less than revenue. On a per transaction basis, total expenses declined 11%. Our volume-based variable costs, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 17%. Despite the additional cost associated with standing up an independent company, we gained economies of scale on our other expense, which were up only 7%. The investment in our technology platform had both increased security and availability, but also reduces platform costs per transaction. We are also experiencing good cost control in the other areas of our business as we begin to operate as an independent, standalone company.
Our transaction margin for the quarter declined 80 basis points. This is a result of 2 things, both of which are a deliberate strategy on our part. First, as we expand our presence with large merchants, our corresponding take rate is lower as they benefit from volume-based pricing. And second, as Braintree becomes a greater percentage of our volume, the higher credit card mixed results in increased transaction expense. 
While our transaction margin declined, our operating margin expanded 200 basis points in the quarter. This demonstrates our ability to maintain and even grow our margins with the operating leverage we have in the business, as well as the discipline that this management team has around controlling costs.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $590 million, up 20% year-over-year, with CapEx coming in at 6% of revenue. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss capital allocation. There are a few companies of our size with our balance sheet and growth rate that are generating the free cash flow and operating margins of PayPal. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow, via through organic investment, acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders. I will discuss our plans for each of those on our next earnings call as we lay out our strategy for 2016.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.7 billion, including approximately $2.4 billion in the U.S. In July, we announced our agreement to acquire Xoom, a digital money transfer provider and have made good strides towards closing this transaction. Xoom shareholders approve the acquisition. And any regulatory approvals, we expect this to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction will have a negligible impact to our full year 2015 results.
And now to guidance. For 2015, we are executing on our strategy and our strong performance in the third quarter only reinforces our confidence in our guidance, both for 2015, as well as the midterm guidance we provided at the time of our separation. We are firmly on track to deliver on our full year 2015 pro forma guidance of FX-neutral revenue growth of 15% to 18% and EPS of $1.23 to $1.27.
The U.S. dollar was a headwind to our spot revenue growth in the third quarter, representing a 4-point difference between our reported revenue growth of 15% and our 19% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis, and we expect this similar impact in the fourth quarter.
In closing, we have created a leading, sustainable financial model which allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale. We are a global company with a trusted and recognized brand. We operate in 203 markets across the world, with 173 million customers. We are growing our top line at a 15% to 18% annual clip. We had a 20% operating margin in the quarter and generated almost $0.25 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue earned. And along with our revenue growth, our good cost control and operating leverage enabled us to grow EPS by over 30% in the quarter. And lastly, we have a management team that is laser-focused on creating shareholder value. 
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

So we'll start trials with the -- with Venmo at selected PayPal merchants this quarter.

So depending on where they're buying, you'll see just as if a PayPal customer is purchasing at a PayPal merchant. So those will be very familiar economics to you. We're trialing this in the fourth quarter, assuming from a technological perspective, this works. Obviously we have millions upon millions upon millions of Venmo users. Merchants are eager for them to start to buy at their locations. We would start to roll that out next year and by the end of next year, really expect to fully monetize the Venmo asset. So you'll start to see that come into next year and hopefully be fully rolled out so that any Venmo user can pay pretty much almost any PayPal merchant location. That's the goal and objective that we have with similar take rates. No change in take rates."

But importantly, as it relates to our economics, there are 2 things I would point out. One is that they are better economics. And in quarter, we recognized about $37 million related to this transaction. Probably 25% of that number is more one-time in nature, then the rest is what we would expect on a quarterly basis going forward. That's a little bit different than what we've done in the past, when we recognized -- or we settled all of the revenue the second quarter of each year.

First of all, we have a very close relationship with the folks at MCX, whether that be with Brian Mooney [ph] and his team or with the merchants that are part of the MCX Consortium. And obviously, Paydiant is the technology provider that powers the currency application. CHASE, they will be integrated in through our Paydiant platform. My view on all of this is, is that you've got an exploding marketplace right now for digital payments. I mean, the number of opportunities is immense and honestly, it's putting those in order of priority, selecting which people to work with, making sure that it's within our full development pipeline is a big test that we have because of the amount of interest in working with our platforms and working with us. Yes, I think you're going to see, obviously, numerous different people coming into the payment space. There are announcements all the time. Chase Pay is another way to me as many other payment forms are. And mostly they integrate through our platforms. And so I would say we are in very close relationship continue to have a close relationship with MCX. We're exploring additional opportunities with MCX. And the more successful that they are, that's helpful for us because we have a close relationship with them and their merchant partners."

I think it's what I think merchants really want to do that's what I think merchants want to do is not the form factor change. They're not looking to just substitute a card swipe for a mobile tap. What they're looking for is a true value proposition change. And part of these true value proposition changes is one, knowing the customer with a coming because they know who they are when they come into the store, but rewarding them as well. And so lot of the merchants creating applications that gives rewards instantaneously. And then those rewards hook up into our platform through a set of APIs so we're not creating them program, the merchant is. We're powering it through our platform so that when a consumer checks out, they can immediately see, ""okay, I got rewarded for those purchases."" they then have the option to do split tender at the point-of-sale so they can pay for a part of that purchase with their awards for real rewards point, a part of that with a certain tender type. You can automatically, for instance, when a customer walks into a store, have the private label credit card pop-up as the default. So there are all sorts of great things you can do when you have a robust platform that goes across payment sites, across -- sites and across form factors and also works in multiple PoS environments. And that's really kind of why we pulled together a set of assets from Paydiant to Braintree to PayPal and are integrating those platforms together, so that we can provide a robust platform solution that enables merchants to write their application, tie in their offers, loyalty rewards into our platform. And then we can also bring with that the 173 million customers we have through our PayPal button into that platform to light up that platform. So it's a very strong combination of both branded and unbranded that merchants are excited about working with us."

And second, Craig, to your point, we are working with one large merchant after another throughout, not just the country here, but across the world. In talking to them about how they want to use mobile across online, in-app and in-store. And that neutral third-party is actually the strength that we bring to that. There are all sorts of ways of thinking about how we use technology to help merchants selects that consistency of being able to use sort of some of the unique assets we have like our funding mix to be able to help merchants at point-of-sale to look across payment sites, so not just the one payment type and have a different experience with it, a different operating system, have a different experience with that, but create a consistency across payments, across loyalty, across different technologies. And that is hitting a real core with merchants. Of course, not every merchant is going to want to do business with us throughout the world. We don't think this is going to be a winner take all model. But the assets that we are bringing I really resonating, and we're having more strategic conversations on a daily basis with the largest merchants than we've ever had before."

Fortunately for us, we expanded our operating margin 200 basis points in the quarter, and that's a good indication of the operating leverage that we have in the business. Our other costs that are not volume related in the quarter represented about 42% of our revenue. That's down 3 points from the previous year, almost 45% of our revenue. And so this is something that we will continue to do going forward as we focus on free cash flow generation and increasing our margins. With respect to the overall level of operating cost in the business, I think the third quarter is fairly representative of what we should look like going forward. We did have some noise in our year-over-year comparisons as we stood up an independent organization.

When we do that, the PayPal button is always implemented a way that's typically improves our share of check out. This is our most advanced integration on that with every one of those implementations we add additional revenues and additional profit dollars. So although our take rate may come down, that's absolutely the right thing for us to do.

But now until we come out of that with enthusiasm for 2016 could look like. But I thought the most important takeaway was we came out of that thinking about really hope that sets us up for a great 2017. And that's really the way that we're thinking about the business. For all the capabilities that we're building, our internal development efforts are accelerating in a very nice fashion right now, start to have some of our acquisitions come on board and then we'll be able to leverage some of that. Our customers are really responding to the new PayPal. And you pull all that together and, yes, we're obviously reiterating our medium-term guidance on this.

Thank you for joining us, and welcome to PayPal's earnings release conference call for the third quarter 2015. Joining me today on the call today are Dan Schulman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany the commentary during the call. 
In discussing year-over-year comparisons, we've chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics, which reflects items that are factually supportable, directly attributable to the separation of the company from eBay Inc. on July 17 of this year, and expected to have a continuing impact on the company's results of operations as we believe these measures provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. All historical measures for periods prior to Q3 '15, including year-over-year comparisons, are presented on a non-GAAP pro forma basis unless otherwise stated. FX-neutral growth rates are calculated by translating current period's local currency results by the prior period's exchange rate. 
This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation and the call are available through our Investor Relations section on the PayPal website at investor.paypal-corp.com. You can visit our Investor Relations website for the latest company news and updates. In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible for 90 days through the same link. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of the conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma measures mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying the call. 
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, the future performance of PayPal as a standalone business, including expected financial results for the full year 2015. Our forward-looking statements do not contemplate any impact in 2015 for the pending acquisition of the Xoom business. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the call for a variety of reasons. 
You can find more information about the risks, uncertainties and other factors that can affect our operating results in our Registration Statement on Form 10 as amended in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available at investor.paypal-corp.com. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first earnings call as an independent company. I'm pleased to say we had strong results for the quarter.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first earnings call as an independent company. I'm pleased to say we had strong results for the quarter. But before I get into some of the details, I'd like to introduce you to John Rainey, our new Chief Financial Officer. I'm thrilled to have John join our leadership team. He is not just a seasoned public company CFO, but he is a world-class individual whose judgment and integrity are a pleasure to see in action. I'm sure all of you will enjoy working with him. John will be providing a detailed overview of our financial performance later in this call.
Now let me highlight some of our key results and initiatives in the third quarter. PayPal had a great start as an independent company, gaining market share, expanding our customer base and deepening our engagement with our customers. In Q3, payment volume increased 27% on an FX-neutral basis, with PayPal processing $70 billion in total payment volume. This continues our track record of mid- to high 20% growth in every quarter this year. Merchant services TPV continued its strong pace, growing 34%, approximately 1.5 to 2x the growth of e-commerce, further extending our global lead in online and mobile payments. 
We're operating in a time when change is sweeping through the financial services industry, driven by the rise of mobile technology and the acceleration of money becoming increasingly digital. These 2 massive trends play directly to our strengths and give PayPal the unique opportunity to expand our reach and relevance to both consumers and merchants. We are making significant strides in our vision to use our platform to become a full-service solution provider for merchants as they seek to form more intimate relationships with their customers, and we strongly believe that our platform and our upcoming development efforts will enable PayPal to be an everyday part of the financial life of our consumers.
Why do I consider our position so differentiated from our competition? It's not simply because we continue to build and extend our strong leadership position. Of course, our increasing scale helps, but it is our focus that separates us from others. We are the only company that is entirely focused on end-to-end digital payments across the globe. Our brand continues to strengthen. For the first time, we were named as one of the top 100 brands in the world, driven by the latest in our new product innovations, leading risk models and outstanding customer service. Each quarter, we extend the strength of our key attributes and this comes through clearly in our results.
As I've mentioned, there are 4 metrics that capture the health and strength of our business. They are the increasing scale of our customer base. The engagement of that base is measured by transactions per account, our top line revenue growth and free cash flow. And the third quarter was our best quarter of 2015 in each of these supporting areas. We finished the quarter with 173 million active accounts, adding over 4 million new customers in the past 3 months, our best net add quarter in 2015. Of the 173 million, approximately 13 million are merchants who accept PayPal across the world. Think about that. Think about that scale in terms of both consumers and merchants. It's a powerful, very difficult asset to replicate. 
To put it in context for our active customers, we're all citizens of a single nation. PayPal would now be the eighth largest country in the world. Consumers across the globe and merchants, large and small, are signing up for PayPal in record numbers. But our goal is not simply to grow our customer base. We are intensely focused on creating more relevant relationships with every one of our customers. In Q3, we processed 1.2 billion transactions for our customers, up 25% from the last year. And perhaps most importantly, we increased transactions per account, which rose from 24 a year ago to 27, growing 12% as our new products and services begin to resonate with our large customer base. These strong customer numbers naturally led to strong revenue growth. We grew our top line at 19% on an FX-neutral basis and 15% on a spot basis in the third quarter, with revenues of approximately $2.3 billion. This obviously strengthens our conviction that we will deliver on our full year FX-neutral revenue guidance of 15% to 18%. And finally, free cash flow expanded nicely in line with our expectations. We had a significant increase in our cash flow, and we are on track to deliver our guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in 2015. 
While we're obviously pleased with our financial results, what's even more important is the strength of the underlying drivers of these results. As I mentioned earlier, our brand just continues to strengthen. In October, for the first time ever, PayPal was ranked on Interbrand's Top Global 100 list, placing #97. This honor is more than just a ranking. Being one of Interbrand's Top 100 is the recognition that our brand is truly global and has successfully transcended geographic and cultural differences. And a recent Forrester study of U.S. consumers found that people trusts PayPal to provide their mobile digital wallet more than banks, credit card networks or other technology companies. 
The trust associated with our brand comes from assets that are difficult to replicate. These range from our sophisticated risk algorithms, driven by the billions of transactions on our platform and our 8,000 customer service associates, where our Net Promoter Score continues to rise year-over-year. Our value proposition is a force that attracts consumers to choose PayPal. It drives measurable sales conversion lift for merchants who offer PayPal as a way to pay. Simply put, merchants and consumers trust PayPal. But interestingly, people are even more compelled to choose and use us once they have experienced the convenience of our newest innovations like One Touch. I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made in the quarter, innovating and enhancing our products for our customers.
Let me start with One Touch. I believe that One Touch is a significant leap forward in the commerce checkout experience and a key way in which we are creating more engagement with our customers, both merchants and consumers. It is a faster, simpler and more convenient way for consumers to check out at merchant sites, whether in mobile apps, on the mobile web or online across all form factors, OS platforms and payment sites. In Q3, we began to roll out One Touch to 16 markets and 100% of eligible U.S. consumers and merchants. Today, more than 50% of the IR 500 and over 1 million merchants around the world, from the largest like Home Depot to the smallest, have One Touch enabled for their customers. And we are rapidly gaining consumer adoption. Today, some 7 million consumers have opted in to use One Touch globally, and everyday that number rapidly increases. We continue to see not just meaningful improvement in conversion rates when One Touch is used but also interestingly a significant improvement in customer engagement. 
The innovation behind One Touch came to us with the acquisition of Braintree and the re-platforming of our PayPal software stack enabled its rapid global implementation. We marked an important milestone with the 2-year anniversary of our Braintree acquisition. It's now very clear that Braintree's early bet on mobile is paying off. Most of the best next-gen mobile commerce companies use Braintree for payments. Two years ago, Braintree has 56 million cards on file. This quarter, Braintree had 185 million cards on file and has quadrupled the volumes it processes. 
Our increased customer growth and engagement is the direct result of our focus on providing a full solution to our merchant partners. The PayPal sales force across 46 markets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia is actively selling the full suite of services on our platform, focused on capturing 100% share of checkout. And we are seeing tremendous adoption, greatly expanding our base of merchants, which includes new companies like Jet.com, One Kings Lane and the Hungryhouse as well as industry leaders like Uber and Airbnb. And Venmo continues to set the standard as the mobile payment app for millenials. A year ago, Venmo processed $700 million in volume in Q3. This quarter, Venmo processed $2.1 billion of volume, growing well over 200% year-over-year. This makes Venmo one of the fastest growing apps in the world and likely 1 of the top 10 apps in the U.S. by dollar volume. And a typical Venmo customer engages with the Venmo app multiple times per week. I'm also pleased to share that we will shortly begin trials allowing Venmo customers to pay with Venmo at selected PayPal merchants. This provides even more value to Venmo customers and at the same time, allows us to start the monetization of our Venmo asset.
I'd like to close my remarks by highlighting 3 areas: credit, our in-store and on the efforts and end with a quick update on our announced acquisitions. These topics frequently come up in conversations I have with investors so I thought some additional color might be helpful.
Credit is an important way we deepen our relationship with our customers, both merchants and consumers, and we're committed to creating transparent and compelling credit products that help our customers have better control over their money. I'm pleased but not surprised that PayPal Working Capital, our lending program that provides our merchant customers the capital they need to grow and succeed, has now exceeded $1 billion in credit extended to more than 60,000 small and medium businesses in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. PayPal Working Capital uniquely leverages PayPal technology and data to assess creditworthiness, underwrite service loans in ways that traditional lenders can't. We bid eligibility on a merchant's PayPal history in processing volume, not their business or personal credit score. PayPal Working Capital loan amounts, which range from $1,000  to $85,000, fill a void in the traditional banking environment. And perhaps most importantly, PayPal Working Capital also powers our traditional business. 90% of the merchants who use PayPal Working Capital reapply for a loan, and their Net Promoter Scores and TPV go up significantly, which naturally results in meaningful term reduction numbers. It's a true win-win proposition. 
Let me now spend a couple of minutes on our multichannel efforts and some of our early successes working into each of the merchants. Our goal is to help merchants provide a truly differentiated value proposition in using mobile across the web, in-app and in-store. The movement of in-app mobile payments to the in-store environment unleashes a tremendous new opportunity for us, opening our addressable market by almost 10x. Mobile provides a natural evolution for PayPal to move from the online and in-app world to the in-store environment. As our retail partners search for ways to use mobile across all channels in order to form evermore personal connections to their customers, they are looking for a full-service platform to power their application across all payment types and loyalty. They desire a cloud-based solution that is point-of-sale technology, device and operating system agnostic. Our merchants want to provide a consistent experience and value proposition to all of their customers, regardless of channel, device, OS or payment type. And the combination of our Paydiant, Braintree and PayPal platforms provide the capabilities they are looking for. Unlike our previous in-store efforts, our merchant partners are driving the adoption of our open platform. 
PayPal is working to be a true payments partner to merchants who are increasingly seeking to bridge the divide between online and in-store through mobile. By being truly technology and payments agnostic, we can focus on improving the entire commerce experience by linking a merchant's loyalty, offers, rewards and private label credit cards into our platform and provide capabilities like split tender at point-of-sale and other innovative propositions in order to help merchants create deeper and more powerful engagement with their customers. 
In September, Macy's announced an integration with PayPal for omnichannel checkout capabilities online, in-store and on mobile. The integration enables Macy's customers to pay in-store with PayPal payment codes and online and on mobile via the PayPal Credit and One Touch. These innovative payment options are now available at all Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Macy's Backstage and Bloomingdale's Outlet stores in the U.S. Subway, with its 30,000-plus locations, is using Paydiant and PayPal for its order-ahead application. And with Shell Oil in the U.K., we jointly announced a mobile payment service that allows drivers to fill up and go without having to go into the store and pay. Fill Up & Go is the first mobile payment service at the pump offered by a fuels retailer in the U.K. And finally, our Paydiant platform is the technology powering Target, CVS, Walmart, Wendy's, Sears and K-Mart as they trial the MCX currency application in Ohio. As you can see, merchants are beginning to use our platform and capabilities to put forth true value proposition enhancements for their consumers. These omnichannel efforts are already well beyond anything we've done previously, and we are just getting started.
Finally, I'd like to touch on acquisitions. First, we expect to close our Xoom acquisition later this quarter. I'm more excited than ever to welcome Xoom to the PayPal family. And in August, we announced the acquisition of Chicago-based Modest, a company that brought us world-class talent and technology that will allow us to accelerate our lead in contextual commerce, allowing customers to pay for products and services in whatever context they discover them, not just on a merchant website. Modest has deployed a leading set of APIs that allows contextual design buttons to hook directly into a merchant's e-commerce order management systems, which is essential in providing a full-service solution to our merchants.
But as important as acquisitions are for us, our internal innovation efforts will always be our primary driver of value. Our technology re-platforming efforts have allowed us to dramatically accelerate our organic software development road map. We now have a powerful combination of internal innovation efforts and acquisition firepower working in tandem. That's a strong combination to drive and further differentiate our leadership position.
I'd like to conclude by saying thanks to the entire PayPal team. It's because of your focus, your passion for our mission and day-in and day-out efforts that we continue to make strides towards our ultimate goal of being a customer champion. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to John. John?"

It's a pleasure to be here for PayPal's first earnings call as a newly independent publicly traded company. I'd also like to thank PayPal's 173 million customers and 16,000 employees worldwide for making this a great quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us, and I'm excited to be able to join Dan and the rest of the PayPal team to transform the movement and management of money.
Q3 was a strong quarter and we continued to execute on our plans. As Dan mentioned, we grew revenue 19% on an FX-neutral basis and achieved earnings of $0.31 per share, an increase of 31%. We continue to grow our share of the market. Our share gain is an indication that our strategy is working as we expand our product solution from a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. As our results for the quarter show, we are delivering on the commitments that we outlined earlier this year.
We are expanding our reach and becoming more relevant, enabling us to deepen our engagement with our customers by increasing the number of merchants where PayPal is available to shop and pay. In the quarter, we went live with a number of large retailers like Macy's, REI and Symantec. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 27, up 12% from a year ago. Importantly, our payment volume through the mobile channel increased 42% year-over-year to $16.5 billion. With mobile growing faster and continuing to gain share, that highlights the shift in consumer behavior and the opportunity we have to leverage this trend as mobile technology bridges the divide to the significantly larger in-store opportunity.
I want to highlight our performance on a few operating metrics for the quarter. First, we expanded our active account base by more than 4 million in the quarter to 173 million customers. The number of payment transactions increased 25%, driven by growth of the media, travel and retail verticals. Total payment volume was $70 billion in the quarter, up 27% on an FX-neutral basis. U.S. payment volume grew 28%, a 2-point acceleration, while international growth was 45%, again, on an FX-neutral basis.
Our U.S. business benefited from strong results in both Braintree and Venmo in addition to the transaction growth from our branded PayPal digital wallet product. PayPal merchant service transactions in North America, which exclude Braintree and Venmo, accelerated 1 point to 25%. As we conduct business in 203 markets across the world, the stronger dollar had an impact on our results, not only from a translation perspective but also on consumer demand. We experienced weakness in China exports, specifically from our merchants off of eBay, which were impacted by lower demand from both Australia and Europe.
For the quarter, PayPal generated $2.3 billion of revenue, up 19% FX-neutral. Transaction revenue was up 18%, while Other Value Added Services grew 26%. Transaction revenue benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree's unbranded product and the evolution from a payment button or a tender type to payment partner where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes.
Other Value Added Services benefited from a growing penetration of PayPal Credit as well as an amended agreement with Synchrony Financial during the quarter for which we will now record revenue each quarter versus historically recognizing revenue annually in the second quarter of each year. The amended agreement extends our relationship with Synchrony, and importantly, no longer requires PayPal to purchase the credit portfolio in October of next year, freeing up more than $1 billion of cash for users that are more accretive to shareholders.
Total expenses grew 12%, significantly less than revenue. On a per transaction basis, total expenses declined 11%. Our volume-based variable costs, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 17%. Despite the additional cost associated with standing up an independent company, we gained economies of scale on our other expense, which were up only 7%. The investment in our technology platform had both increased security and availability but also reduce the platform cost per transaction. We are also experiencing good cost control in the other areas of our business as we begin to operate as an independent standalone company.
Our transaction margin for the quarter declined 80 basis points. This is a result of 2 things, both of which are a deliberate strategy on our part. First, as we expand our presence with large merchants, our corresponding take rate is lower as they benefit from volume-based pricing. And second, as Braintree becomes a greater percentage of our volume, the higher credit card mix results in increased transaction expense. While our transaction margin declined, our operating margin expanded 200 basis points in the quarter. This demonstrates our ability to maintain and even grow our margins with the operating leverage we have in the business as well as the discipline that this management team has around controlling costs. Free cash flow for the quarter was $519 million, up 20% year-over-year, with CapEx coming in at 6% of revenue. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss capital allocation. There are a few companies of our size with our balance sheet and growth rate that are generating the free cash flow and operating margins of PayPal. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow via through organic investment, acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders. I will discuss our plans for each of those on our next earnings call as we lay out our strategy for 2016.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.7 billion, including approximately $2.4 billion in the U.S. In July, we announced our agreement to acquire Xoom, a digital money transfer provider, and have made good strides towards closing this transaction. Xoom shareholders approve the acquisition, and pending regulatory approvals, we expect this to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction will have a negligible impact to our full year 2015 results.
And now to guidance. For 2015, we are executing on our strategy and our strong performance in the third quarter only reinforces our confidence in our guidance, both for 2015 as well as the midterm guidance we provided at the time of our separation. We are firmly on track to deliver on our full year 2015 pro forma guidance of FX-neutral revenue growth of 15% to 18% and EPS of $1.23 to $1.27. The U.S. dollar was a headwind to our spot revenue growth in the third quarter, representing a 4-point difference between our reported revenue growth of 15% and our 19% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis, and we expect a similar impact in the fourth quarter.
In closing, we have created a leading, sustainable financial model which allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale. We are a global company with a trusted and recognized brand. We operate in 203 markets across the world, with 173 million customers. We are growing our top line at a 15% to 18% annual clip. We had a 20% operating margin in the quarter and generated almost $0.25 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue earned. And along with our revenue growth, our good cost control and operating leverage enabled us to grow EPS by over 30% in the quarter. And lastly, we have a management team that is laser-focused on creating shareholder value. 
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

So in the quarter, we amendment our agreement with Synchrony, which provides the PayPal-branded credit card. That agreement was set to expire in 2016. And as I called out in my prepared remarks, that required us to have a significant outlay of cash to purchase that credit portfolio. The amendment now extends the agreement through 2023 and we no longer have that obligation to purchase the credit portfolio, although we have the option at that point in time. But importantly, as it relates to our economics, there are 2 things I would point out. One is that there are better economics. And in the quarter, we recognized about $37 million related to this transaction. Probably 25% of that number is more one-time in nature, then the rest is what we would expect on a quarterly basis going forward. That's a little bit different than what we've done in the past when we recognized or we settled all of the revenue in the second quarter of each year. So we'll see a more consistent earnings stream from this transaction going forward."

And honestly, putting those in order of priority, selecting which people to work with, making sure that it fits within our full development pipeline is a big test that we have because of the amount of interest in working with our platforms and working with us. I think you're going to see, obviously, numerous different people coming into the payment space. There are announcements all the time. Chase Pay is another way to pay as many other payment forms are, and mostly they integrate through our platforms. And so I would say we have a very close relationship with MCX. We'll continue to have a close relationship with MCX. We're exploring additional opportunities with MCX.

I think it's crucial because what I think merchants really want to do -- in fact, what I know merchants want to do is not a form factor change. They are not looking to just substitute a card swipe for a mobile tap. What they're looking for is a true value proposition change. And part of these true value proposition changes are, one, knowing the customer when they come in because you now know who they are when they come into the store but rewarding them as well. And so a lot of the merchants are creating applications that give rewards instantaneously, and then those rewards hook up into our platform through a set of APIs. So we're not creating the rewards program, the merchant is. We're powering it through our platform so that when a consumer checks out, they can immediately see, ""Okay, I got rewarded for those purchases."" They then have the option to do split tender at the point-of-sale so they could pay for a part of that purchase with their rewards point, a part of that with a certain tender type. You can automatically, for instance, when a customer walks into a store, have the private label credit card pop up as the default. So there are all sorts of great things you can do when you have a robust platform that goes across payment sites, across OS types and across form factors and also works in multiple PoS environments. And that's really kind of why we pulled together these set of assets from Paydiant to Braintree to PayPal and are integrating those platforms together, so that we can provide a robust platform solution that enables merchants to write their application, tie in their offers, loyalty rewards into our platform. And then we can also bring with that 173 million customers we have through our PayPal button into that platform to light up that platform. So it's a very strong combination of both unbranded and branded that merchants are excited about working with us."

And second, Craig, to your point, we are working with one large merchant after another throughout not just the country here, but across the world and talking to them about how they want to use mobile across online, in-app and in-store. And that neutral third-party is actually a strength that we bring to that. There are all sorts of ways of thinking about how we use technology to help merchants flex that consistency of being able to use sort of some of the unique assets we have like our funding mix to be able to help merchants at the point-of-sale to look across payment sites, so not just the one payment type and have a different experience with it, a different operating system and have a different experience with that, but create a consistency across payments, across loyalty, across different technologies. And that is hitting a real core with merchants. Of course, not every merchant is going to want to do business with us throughout the world. We don't think this is going to be a winner-take-all model. But the assets that we are bringing are really resonating, and we're having more strategic conversations on a daily basis with the largest merchants than we've ever had before."

Fortunately for us, we expanded our operating margin 200 basis points in the quarter, and that's a good indication of the operating leverage that we have in the business. Our other costs that are not volume related in the quarter represented about 42% of our revenue. That's down 3 points from the previous year, which was 45% of our revenue. And so this is something that we will continue to do going forward as we focus on free cash flow generation and increasing our margins. With respect to the overall level of operating cost in the business, I think the third quarter is fairly representative of what we should look like going forward. We did have some noise in our year-over-year comparisons as we stood up an independent organization.

When we do that, the PayPal button is always implemented in a way that typically improves our share of checkout because it's our most advanced integration on that. With every one of those implementations, we add additional revenues and additional profit dollars. So although our take rate may come down, that's absolutely the right thing for us to do. And as we move towards more and more ubiquity for PayPal consumers to shop and move into more and more larger merchants, as John also mentioned, the more volume, the lower the take rate on that, but that's just a part of how the payments industry works.

As I mentioned, there are tremendous amount of opportunities in front of us. You may have seen in the press release, we just signed a major deal with America Movil in Latin America, the largest wireless provider there. That will make a significant difference in results down there. It's going to be a pretty expensive partnership. Those opportunities are around us all over, and we have both the product development capabilities to go and implement those and the investment capacity to make sure that those partnerships are successful. So as John mentioned, we are laser-focused on the cost but we're laser-focused on the cost the right way. We are not cutting costs for short-term gains one way or another. We are cutting costs because we are operating more efficiently, and that really is the major takeaway for this.

We just came off of our off-site for our 2016 planning. But not only did we come out of that with enthusiasm for what 2016 could look like, but I thought the most important takeaway was we came out of that thinking about really just how that sets us up for a great 2017, and that's really the way that we're thinking about the business. For all the capabilities that we're building, our internal development efforts are accelerating in a very nice fashion right now.

Thank you for joining us, and welcome to PayPal's earnings release conference call for the third quarter of 2015. Joining me today on the call today are Dan Schulman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany the commentary during the call. 
In discussing year-over-year comparisons, we've chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics, which reflects items that are factually supportable, directly attributable to the separation of the company from eBay Inc. on July 17 of this year, and expected to have a continuing impact on the company's results of operations as we believe these measures provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. All historical measures for periods prior to Q '13 [ph] or Q3 '15, including year-over-year comparisons, are presented on a non-GAAP pro forma basis unless otherwise stated. FX-neutral growth rates are calculated by translating current period's local currency results by the prior period's exchange rate. 
This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation and the call are available through our Investor Relations section on the PayPal website at investor.paypal-corp.com. You can visit our Investor Relations website for the latest company news and updates. In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible for 90 days through the same link. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of the conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma measures mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying the call. 
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, the future performance of PayPal as a stand-alone business, including expected financial results for the full year 2015. Our forward-looking statements do not contemplate any impact in 2015 for the pending acquisition of the Xoom business. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the call for a variety of reasons. 
You can find more information about the risks, uncertainties and other factors that can affect our operating results in our Registration Statement on Form 10 as amended in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available at investor.paypal-corp.com. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, October 28, 2015, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update the information.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first earnings call as an independent company. I'm pleased to say we had strong results for the quarter. But before I get into some of the details, I'd like to introduce you",2432,"Great. Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first earnings call as an independent company. I'm pleased to say we had strong results for the quarter. But before I get into some of the details, I'd like to introduce you to John Rainey, our new Chief Financial Officer. I'm thrilled to have John join our leadership team. He is not just a seasoned public company CFO, but he is a world-class individual whose judgment and integrity are a pleasure to see in action. I'm sure all of you will enjoy working with him. John will be providing a detailed overview of our financial performance later in this call.
Now let me highlight some of our key results and initiatives in the third quarter. PayPal had a great start as an independent company, gaining market share, expanding our customer base and deepening our engagement with our customers. In Q3, payment volume increased 27% on an FX-neutral basis, with PayPal processing $70 billion in total payment volume. This continues our track record of mid- to high 20% growth in every quarter this year. Merchant services TPV continued its strong pace, growing 34%, approximately 1.5 to 2x the growth of e-commerce, further extending our global lead in online and mobile payments. 
We're operating in a time when change is sweeping through the financial services industry, driven by the rise of mobile technology and the acceleration of money becoming increasingly digital. These 2 massive trends play directly to our strengths and give PayPal the unique opportunity to expand our reach and relevance to both consumers and merchants. We are making significant strides in our vision to use our platform to become a full-service solution provider for merchants as they seek to form more intimate relationships with their customers, and we strongly believe that our platform and our upcoming development efforts will enable PayPal to be an everyday part of the financial life of our consumers.
Why do I consider our position so differentiated from our competition? It's not simply because we continue to build and extend our strong leadership position. Of course, our increasing scale helps, but it is our focus that separates us from others. We are the only company that is entirely focused on end-to-end digital payments across the globe. Our brand continues to strengthen. For the first time, we were named as one of the top 100 brands in the world, driven by the latest in our new product innovations, leading risk models and outstanding customer service. Each quarter, we extend the strength of our key attributes and this comes through clearly in our results.
As I've mentioned, there are 4 metrics that capture the health and strength of our business. They are the increasing scale of our customer base. The engagement of that base is measured by transactions per account, our top line revenue growth and free cash flow. And the third quarter was our best quarter of 2015 in each of these important areas. We finished the quarter with 173 million active accounts, adding over 4 million new customers in the past 3 months, our best net add quarter in 2015. Of the 173 million, approximately 13 million are merchants who accept PayPal across the world. Think about that. Think about that scale in terms of both consumers and merchants. It's a powerful, very difficult asset to replicate. 
To put it in context, if our active customers were all citizens of a single nation, PayPal would now be the eighth largest country in the world. Consumers across the globe and merchants, large and small, are signing up for PayPal in record numbers. But our goal is not simply to grow our customer base. We are intensely focused on creating more relevant relationships with every one of our customers. In Q3, we processed 1.2 billion transactions for our customers, up 25% from last year. And perhaps most importantly, we increased transactions per account, which rose from 24 a year ago to 27, growing 12% as our new products and services begin to resonate with our large customer base. These strong customer numbers naturally led to strong revenue growth. We grew our top line at 19% on an FX-neutral basis and 15% on a spot basis in the third quarter, with revenues of approximately $2.3 billion. This obviously strengthens our conviction that we will deliver on our full year FX-neutral revenue guidance of 15% to 18%. And finally, free cash flow expanded nicely in line with our expectations. We had a significant increase in our cash flow, and we are on track to deliver our guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for 2015. 
While we're obviously pleased with our financial results, what's even more important is the strength of the underlying drivers of these results. As I mentioned earlier, our brand just continues to strengthen. In October, for the first time ever, PayPal was ranked on Interbrand's Top Global 100 list, placing #97. This honor is more than just a ranking. Being one of Interbrand's Top 100 is the recognition that our brand is truly global and has successfully transcended geographic and cultural differences. And a recent Forrester study of U.S. consumers found that people trust PayPal to provide their mobile digital wallet more than banks, credit card networks or other technology companies. 
The trust associated with our brand comes from assets that are difficult to replicate. These range from our sophisticated risk algorithms, driven by the billions of transactions on our platform and our 8,000 customer service associates, where our Net Promoter Score continues to rise year-over-year. Our value proposition is a force that attracts consumers to choose PayPal. It drives measurable sales conversion lift for merchants who offer PayPal as a way to pay. Simply put, merchants and consumers trust PayPal. But interestingly, people are even more compelled to choose and use us once they have experienced the convenience of our newest innovations like One Touch. I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made in the quarter, innovating and enhancing our products for our customers.
Let me start with One Touch. I believe that One Touch is a significant leap forward in the commerce checkout experience and a key way in which we are creating more engagement with our customers, both merchants and consumers. It is a faster, simpler and more convenient way for consumers to check out at merchant sites, whether in mobile apps, on the mobile web or online across all form factors, OS platforms and payment types. In Q3, we began to roll out One Touch to 16 markets and 100% of eligible U.S. consumers and merchants. Today, more than 50% of the IR 500 and over 1 million merchants around the world, from the largest like Home Depot to the smallest, have One Touch enabled for their customers. And we are rapidly gaining consumer adoption. Today, some 7 million consumers have opted in to use One Touch globally, and every day that number rapidly increases. We continue to see not just meaningful improvement in conversion rates when One Touch is used, but also interestingly a significant improvement in customer engagement. 
The innovation behind One Touch came to us with the acquisition of Braintree and the re-platforming of our PayPal software stack enabled its rapid global implementation. We marked an important milestone with the 2-year anniversary of our Braintree acquisition. It's now very clear that Braintree's early bet on mobile is paying off. Most of the best next-gen mobile commerce companies use Braintree for payments. Two years ago, Braintree had 56 million cards on file. This quarter, Braintree had 185 million cards on file and has quadrupled the volumes it processes. 
Our increased customer growth and engagement is the direct result of our focus on providing a full solution to our merchant partners. The PayPal sales force across 46 markets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia is actively selling the full suite of services on our platform, focused on capturing 100% share of checkout. And we are seeing tremendous adoption, greatly expanding our base of merchants, which includes new companies like Jet.com, One Kings Lane and Hungryhouse as well as industry leaders like Uber and Airbnb. And Venmo continues to set the standard as the mobile payment app for millennials. A year ago, Venmo processed $700 million in volume in Q3. This quarter, Venmo processed $2.1 billion of volume, growing well over 200% year-over-year. This makes Venmo one of the fastest growing apps in the world and likely 1 of the top 10 apps in the U.S. by dollar volume. And a typical Venmo customer engages with the Venmo app multiple times per week. I'm also pleased to share that we will shortly begin trials allowing Venmo customers to pay with Venmo at selected PayPal merchants. This provides even more value to Venmo customers and at the same time, allows us to start the monetization of our Venmo asset.
I'd like to close my remarks by highlighting 3 areas: credit, our in-store and omni efforts and end with a quick update on our announced acquisitions. These topics frequently come up in conversations I have with investors so I thought some additional color might be helpful.
Credit is an important way we deepen our relationship with our customers, both merchants and consumers, and we're committed to creating transparent and compelling credit products that help our customers have better control over their money. I'm pleased but not surprised that PayPal Working Capital, our lending program that provides our merchant customers the capital they need to grow and succeed, has now exceeded $1 billion in credit extended to more than 60,000 small and medium businesses in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. PayPal Working Capital uniquely leverages PayPal technology and data to assess creditworthiness, underwrite and service loans in ways that traditional lenders can't. We bet eligibility on a merchant's PayPal history and processing volume, not their business or personal credit score. PayPal Working Capital loan amounts, which range from $1,000 to $85,000, fill a void in the traditional banking environment. And perhaps most importantly, PayPal Working Capital also powers our traditional business. 90% of the merchants who use PayPal Working Capital reapply for a loan, and their Net Promoter Scores and TPV go up significantly, which naturally results in meaningful churn reduction numbers. It's a true win-win proposition. 
Let me now spend a couple of minutes on our multichannel efforts and some of our early successes working with major merchants. Our goal is to help merchants provide a truly differentiated value proposition in using mobile across the web, in-app and in-store. The movement of in-app mobile payments to the in-store environment unleashes a tremendous new opportunity for us, opening our addressable market by almost 10x. Mobile provides a natural evolution for PayPal to move from the online and in-app world to the in-store environment. As our retail partners search for ways to use mobile across all channels in order to form evermore personal connections to their customers, they are looking for a full-service platform to power their application across all payment types and loyalty. They desire a cloud-based solution that is point-of-sale technology, device and operating system agnostic. Our merchants want to provide a consistent experience and value proposition to all of their customers, regardless of channel, device, OS or payment type. And the combination of our Paydiant, Braintree and PayPal platforms provide the capabilities they are looking for. Unlike our previous in-store efforts, our merchant partners are driving the adoption of our open platform. 
PayPal is working to be a true payments partner to merchants who are increasingly seeking to bridge the divide between online and in-store through mobile. By being truly technology and payments agnostic, we can focus on improving the entire commerce experience by linking a merchant's loyalty, offers, rewards and private label credit cards into our platform and provide capabilities like split tender at point-of-sale and other innovative propositions in order to help merchants create deeper and more powerful engagement with their customers. 
In September, Macy's announced an integration with PayPal for omnichannel checkout capabilities online, in-store and on mobile. The integration enables Macy's customers to pay in-store with PayPal payment codes and online and on mobile via the PayPal button and One Touch. These innovative payment options are now available at all Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Macy's Backstage and Bloomingdale's Outlet stores in the U.S. Subway, with its 30,000-plus locations, is using Paydiant and PayPal for its order-ahead applications. And with Shell Oil in the U.K., we jointly announced a mobile payment service that allows drivers to fill up and go without having to go into the store and pay. Fill Up & Go is the first mobile payment service at the pump offered by a fuels retailer in the U.K. And finally, our Paydiant platform is the technology powering Target, CVS, Walmart, Wendy's, Sears and K-Mart as they trial the MCX currency application in Ohio. As you can see, merchants are beginning to use our platform and capabilities to put forth true value proposition enhancements for their consumers. These omnichannel efforts are already well beyond anything we've done previously, and we are just getting started.
Finally, I'd like to touch on acquisitions. First, we expect to close our Xoom acquisition later this quarter. I'm more excited than ever to welcome Xoom to the PayPal family. And in August, we announced the acquisition of Chicago-based Modest, a company that brought us world-class talent and technology that will allow us to accelerate our lead in contextual commerce, allowing customers to pay for products and services in whatever context they discover them, not just on a merchant website. Modest has deployed a leading set of APIs that allow contextual buy buttons to hook directly into a merchant's e-commerce order management systems, which is essential in providing a full-service solution to our merchants.
But as important as acquisitions are for us, our internal innovation efforts will always be our primary driver of value. Our technology re-platforming efforts have allowed us to dramatically accelerate our organic software development road map. We now have a powerful combination of internal innovation efforts and acquisition firepower working in tandem. That's a strong combination to drive and further differentiate our leadership position.
I'd like to conclude by saying thanks to the entire PayPal team. It's because of your focus, your passion for our mission and day-in and day-out efforts that we continue to make strides towards our ultimate goal of being a customer champion. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to John. John?"

It's a pleasure to be here for PayPal's first earnings call as a newly independent, publicly traded company. I'd also like to thank PayPal's 173 million customers and 16,000 employees worldwide for making this a great quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us, and I'm excited to be able to join Dan and the rest of the PayPal team to transform the movement and management of money.
Q3 was a strong quarter and we continued to execute on our plan. As Dan mentioned, we grew revenue 19% on an FX-neutral basis and achieved earnings of $0.31 per share, an increase of 31%. We continue to grow our share of the market. Our share gain is an indication that our strategy is working as we expand our product solution from a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. As our results for the quarter show, we are delivering on the commitments that we outlined earlier this year.
We are expanding our reach and becoming more relevant, enabling us to deepen our engagement with our customers by increasing the number of merchants where PayPal is available to shop and pay. In the quarter, we went live with a number of large retailers like Macy's, REI and Symantec. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 27, up 12% from a year ago. Importantly, our payment volume through the mobile channel increased 42% year-over-year to $16.5 billion. With mobile growing faster and continuing to gain share, that highlights the shift in consumer behavior and the opportunity we have to leverage this trend as mobile technology bridges the divide to the significantly larger in-store opportunity.
I want to highlight our performance on a few operating metrics for the quarter. First, we expanded our active account base by more than 4 million in the quarter to 173 million customers. The number of payment transactions increased 25%, driven by growth of the media, travel and retail verticals. Total payment volume was $70 billion in the quarter, up 27% on an FX-neutral basis. U.S. payment volume grew 28%, a 2-point acceleration, while international growth was 45%, again, on an FX-neutral basis.
Our U.S. business benefited from strong results in both Braintree and Venmo in addition to the transaction growth from our branded PayPal digital wallet product. PayPal merchant service transactions in North America, which exclude Braintree and Venmo, accelerated 1 point to 25%. As we conduct business in 203 markets across the world, the stronger dollar had an impact on our results, not only from a translation perspective but also on consumer demand. We experienced weakness in China exports, specifically from our merchants off of eBay, which were impacted by lower demand from both Australia and Europe.
For the quarter, PayPal generated $2.3 billion of revenue, up 19% FX-neutral. Transaction revenue was up 18%, while Other Value Added Services grew 26%. Transaction revenue benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree's unbranded product and the evolution from a payment button or a tender type to payment partner where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes.
Other Value Added Services benefited from a growing penetration of PayPal Credit as well as an amended agreement with Synchrony Financial during the quarter from which we will now record revenue each quarter versus historically recognizing revenue annually in the second quarter of each year. The amended agreement extends our relationship with Synchrony, and importantly, no longer requires PayPal to purchase the credit portfolio in October of next year, freeing up more than $1 billion of cash for uses that are more accretive to shareholders.
Total expenses grew 12%, significantly less than revenue. On a per transaction basis, total expenses declined 11%. Our volume-based variable costs, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 17%. Despite the additional cost associated with standing up an independent company, we gained economies of scale on our other expenses, which were up only 7%. The investment in our technology platform has both increased security and availability, but also reduced the platform cost per transaction. We are also experiencing good cost control in the other areas of our business as we begin to operate as an independent stand-alone company.
Our transaction margin for the quarter declined 80 basis points. This is a result of 2 things, both of which are a deliberate strategy on our part. First, as we expand our presence with large merchants, our corresponding take rate is lower as they benefit from volume-based pricing. And second, as Braintree becomes a greater percentage of our volume, the higher credit card mix results in increased transaction expense. While our transaction margin declined, our operating margin expanded 200 basis points in the quarter. This demonstrates our ability to maintain and even grow our margins with the operating leverage we have in the business as well as the discipline that this management team has around controlling costs. Free cash flow for the quarter was $519 million, up 20% year-over-year, with CapEx coming in at 6% of revenue. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss capital allocation. There are few companies of our size with our balance sheet and growth rate that are generating the free cash flow and operating margins of PayPal. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow, be it through organic investment, acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders. I will discuss our plans for each of those on our next earnings call as we lay out our strategy for 2016.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.7 billion, including approximately $2.4 billion in the U.S. In July, we announced our agreement to acquire Xoom, a digital money transfer provider, and have made good strides towards closing this transaction. Xoom shareholders approved the acquisition, and pending regulatory approvals, we expect this to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction will have a negligible impact to our full year 2015 results.
And now to guidance. For 2015, we are executing on our strategy and our strong performance in the third quarter only reinforces our confidence in our guidance, both for 2015 as well as the midterm guidance we provided at the time of our separation. We are firmly on track to deliver on our full year 2015 pro forma guidance of FX-neutral revenue growth of 15% to 18% and EPS of $1.23 to $1.27. The U.S. dollar was a headwind to our spot revenue growth in the third quarter, representing a 4-point difference between our reported revenue growth of 15% and our 19% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis, and we expect a similar impact in the fourth quarter.
In closing, we have created a leading, sustainable financial model which allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale. We are a global company with a trusted and recognized brand. We operate in 203 markets across the world, with 173 million customers. We are growing our top line at a 15% to 18% annual clip. We had a 20% operating margin in the quarter and generated almost $0.25 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue earned. And along with our revenue growth, our good cost control and operating leverage enabled us to grow EPS by over 30% in the quarter.

So we'll start trials with the pay with Venmo at selected PayPal merchants this quarter. And basically, what this does is, it opens up the PayPal -- or excuse me, the Venmo base to our PayPal merchants and it will be exactly the same take rates. So depending on where they're buying, it will be just as if a PayPal customer is purchasing at a PayPal merchant. So those will be very familiar economics to you. We're trialing this in the fourth quarter, assuming from a technological perspective this works. Obviously, we have millions upon millions upon millions of Venmo users. Merchants are eager for them to start to buy at their locations. We would start to roll that out next year, and by the end of next year, really expect to fully monetize the Venmo asset. So you'll start to see that come into next year and hopefully be fully rolled out so that any Venmo user can pay at pretty much almost any PayPal merchant location. That's the goal and objective that we have with similar take rates. No change in the take rate."

The amendment now extends the agreement through 2023 and we no longer have that obligation to purchase the credit portfolio, although we do have the option at that point in time. But importantly, as it relates to our economics, there are 2 things I would point out. One is that there are better economics. And in the quarter, we recognized about $37 million related to this transaction. Probably 25% of that number is more one-time in nature, then the rest is what we would expect on a quarterly basis going forward. That's a little bit different than what we've done in the past where we recognized or we settled all of the revenue in the second quarter of each year.

I think it's crucial because what I think merchants really want to do -- in fact, what I know merchants want to do is not a form factor change. They are not looking to just substitute a card swipe for a mobile tap. What they're looking for is a true value proposition change. And part of these true value proposition changes are, one, knowing the customer when they come in because you now know who they are when they come into the store, but rewarding them as well. And so a lot of the merchants are creating applications that give rewards instantaneously, and then those rewards hook up into our platform [ph] through a set of APIs. So we're not creating the rewards program, the merchant is. We're powering it through our platform so that when a consumer checks out, they can immediately see, ""Okay, I got rewarded for those purchases."" They then have the option to do split tender at the point-of-sale so they could pay for a part of that purchase with their rewards points, a part of that with a certain tender type. You can automatically, for instance, when a customer walks into a store, have the private label credit card pop up as the default. So there are all sorts of great things you can do when you have a robust platform that goes across payment types, across OS types and across form factors and also works in multiple PoS environments. And that's really kind of why we've pulled together this set of assets from Paydiant to Braintree to PayPal and are integrating those platforms together, so that we can provide a robust platform solution that enables merchants to write their applications, tie in their offers, loyalty rewards into our platform. And then we can also bring with that, 173 million customers we have through our PayPal button into that platform to light up that platform. So it's a very strong combination of both unbranded and branded that merchants are excited about working with us."

And second, Craig, to your point, we are working with one large merchant after another throughout not just the country here, but across the world and talking to them about how they want to use mobile across online, in-app and in-store. And that neutral third-party is actually a strength that we bring to that. There are all sorts of ways of thinking about how we use technology to help merchants flex that consistency of being able to use sort of some of the unique assets we have like our funding mix to be able to help merchants at the point-of-sale to look across payment types, so not just the one payment type and have a different experience with it, a different operating system and have a different experience with that, but create a consistency across payments, across loyalty, across different technologies. And that is hitting a real core with merchants. Of course, not every merchant is going to want to do business with us throughout the world. We don't think this is going to be a winner-take-all model. But the assets that we are bringing are really resonating, and we're having more strategic conversations on a daily basis with the largest merchants than we've ever had before."

Fortunately for us, we expanded our operating margin 200 basis points in the quarter, and that's a good indication of the operating leverage that we have in the business. Our other costs that are not volume related in the quarter represented about 42% of our revenue. That's down 3 points from the previous year, where it was 45% of our revenue. And so this is something that we will continue to do going forward as we focus on free cash flow generation and increasing our margins. With respect to the overall level of operating cost in the business, I think the third quarter is fairly representative of what we should look like going forward. We did have some noise in our year-over-year comparisons as we stood up an independent organization.

When we do that, the PayPal button is always implemented in a way that typically improves our share of checkout because it's our most advanced integration on that. With every one of those implementations, we add additional revenues and additional profit dollars. So although our take rate may come down, that's absolutely the right thing for us to do. And as we move towards more and more ubiquity for PayPal consumers to shop and move into more and more larger merchants, as John also mentioned, the more volume, the lower the take rate on that, but that's just a part of how the payments industry works.

And Xoom is a great example of that as we get to expand into the money remittance business and leverage what is already done there today with PayPal's 173 million customer base."

You mentioned the 400 basis points of FX headwind in the quarter and then the FX hedge timing. As we look at the guidance for 300 to 400 basis points in Q4, how does it work where we're seeing that impact declining or roughly declining quarter-over-quarter with the roll off on the hedge timing? I just want to make sure that we're thinking about that the right way. And then, Dan, when you say immense pipeline of booked business, how much of that is in the pipeline? Because, hey, it's fourth quarter and nobody wants to mess with their payments going into the end of the holiday season versus sort of more linear addition of customers and it's just the challenge of sort of any new implementation."

As we go into the fourth quarter, the year-over-year decrease or the way the dollar has -- what am I trying to say here? The exchange rate environment is better in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. However, the offset from the hedge position is not as good for us in the fourth quarter as it is in the third quarter. At today's exchange rates, our hedge gain in the fourth quarter would be in the $20 million to $25 million range."

It is a pipeline that has just grown each quarter, a lot of it coming into the Braintree platform, a lot of it -- all of it with the PayPal button design. So my -- as we've come through this quarter with 19% revenue growth on our top line, a real nice improvement on our EPS, and as I look forward, I've got a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for where this business can go. We just came off of our off-site for our 2016 planning. But not only did we come out of that with enthusiasm for what 2016 could look like, but I thought the most important takeaway was we came out of that thinking about really just how that sets us up for a great 2017, and that's really the way that we're thinking about the business. For all the capabilities that we're building, our internal development efforts are accelerating in a very nice fashion right now. We'll start to have some of our acquisitions come on board and then we'll be able to leverage some of that. Our customers are really responding to the new PayPal and you pull all that together, and we're obviously reiterating our medium-term guidance on this. But we feel good about the strength of our business and the momentum of it."
