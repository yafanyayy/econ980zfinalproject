Turning first to Kraft, net revenues decreased 4.9%, including a negative 1.4% impact from currency. Kraft organic net revenues decreased 3.3% consisting of 2.6% decline from volume/mix and a 0.7% decline from lower net pricing. The volume/mix decline include an approximate 1 percentage point negative impact from the timing of Easter-related shipments and approximate 1 percent point negative impact from lower ready-to-drink beverages sales, resulting from decreased promotion activity the prior year quarter as well as the [indiscernible] this year. 
Lower net pricing reflected pricing actions achieved in Foodservice business related to lower dairy cost. These were partially offset by the carryover impact of price increases taken in prior quarters. Operating income was $923 million and diluted EPS was $0.92 inclusive of one-off factors in the quarter. Excluding the impact of these factors in both years, operating income grew at the mid-single-digit rate and EPS grew at the double digits rate. This growth was primarily driven by a combination of favorable commodity costs, net of pricing, mainly in the dairy and meat categories, lower SG&A expenses driven by reduction in the [indiscernible] and lower manufacturing cost driven by [indiscernible] activity.
EPS growth for the quarter enhanced by a lower effective tax rate and lower net interest expense versus the prior year quarter.

This reflected what we improvement more than offset by increase in capital expenditures.

Net pricing increased by 4.2% driven by higher pricing across all segments, primarily Latin America. Volume increased 1.7%, driven by higher inventor tock at the U.S. retailers in the first quarter of 2014 prior to implementation of SAP as well as raw material and packaging supply constraints in Venezuela. These volume gains were partially offset by volume decline due to the timing of Ramadan festive season in Indonesia, reduced strict promotion in Russia, product rationalization in Europe and capital declines in Italy; adjusted EBITDA increased $46 million or 6.7% to $739 million, primarily driven by [indiscernible] as a result of increased sales in North America and Venezuela, cost of goods sold productivity initiatives and an overall reduction in SG&A.

It's my pleasure and my honor to be speaking to you as the CEO of the Kraft Heinz Company. 
Since this is our first call since the merger, I thought it would be good to start by sharing to you some highlights of our first 120 days as a combined company. 
After completing the merger on July 2, we moved quickly to establish our new leadership team and put in place a streamlined structure for our business in the U.S. and Canada zones. Have done that early on, our integration work has remained right on track, working on people, systems and process. We have been pleased with our ability to retain top talent, particularly front-of-the-house marketeers in key Kraft categories. 
We have been impressed with how the legacy Kraft team has embraced change in this performance-driven quarter. 
We instituted [indiscernible] routines that represent the discipline, accountability and methodology for how he will operate as one of the world's premier companies. This includes cascading core business practice that will continue to build our competitive advantage like zero-based budgets, revenue management and managed by objectives. 
We're currently rolling out our zero-based budget, ZBB, across the Kraft commercial units and functions and will be the basis for our 2016 planning process worldwide. 
In revenue management, we are building an internal function from the ground up to support our go-to-market across roughly 40 categories in North America. 
We are also now installing our third core business practice that we call managed by objectives, or MBOs, with all our legacy Kraft leaders as part of our integration efforts. MBO is an important language that clearly outlines measurable expectations, goals and deliverables for all our Kraft Heinz leaders. It connects our employees around the world to our goals that cascade down directly from me to my leadership team and then throughout the organization. 
On our merger announcement call in March, I mentioned that we had implemented our MBO process within the performance targets for almost 3,000 people of white-collared employees at Heinz. As we finalize our plans for 2016, approximately 5,200 of our employees will have specific, individualized MBOs in place. Collectively, zero-based budget, revenue management and managed by objective are systematic tools that we use to run our daily operations. 
Another important accomplishment during our first 120 days was the completion of an extensive review of our combined North America supply chain and manufacturing footprint, capabilities and capacity utilization. The actions under the resulting plan will take us 2 years to be complete but will make us more globally competitive and accelerate our future growth. We will talk about that more in details in a moment. 
We're also pleased with the fact that we have been able to maintain base business momentum as the institute significantly changed throughout the organization. Obviously, our reported numbers have been significantly impacted by currencies, headwinds all year. Excluding currency, both our top line and bottom line drivers being consistent with year-to-date throughout the third quarter. Our top line results have been mixed. 
On the positive side, we had had much [indiscernible] with the big innovations such as Lunchables, P3 and the Heinz Yellow Mustard. Investments we have made in ketchup and pasta sauce are driving solid consumption gains in the markets where we compete. 
Our sauces business in Asia-Pacific is doing well, and we are benefiting greatly in Europe from an improved product mix and higher investment in marketing behind our brand. 
At the same time, our challenge have continued in certain categories like ready-to-drink beverage and dinners in the United States and frozen meals in a number of world markets that has held back our growth. 
So more work needs to be done. 
On the pricing front, we have had net pricing gains in all geographies, and our price net of commodity helped drive profit growth in both the quarter and the year-to-date. 
And last but not least, the productivity and restructuring initiatives that both Kraft and Heinz put in place prior to the merger have been driving our bottom line all year. 
We also start to see the beginning of some integration saving in Q3. 
That's our 120-day update. Before I hand it over to George and Paulo to get more into the details of our third quarter results, I think it's important to talk about where are we going. 
If you are turning to our call today, I think you certainly know who Kraft Heinz is. From our diverse portfolio of sauces, cheese, meals, meats and beverage to our extensive global footprint, we dedicated Kraft Heinz employees in over 45 countries. And most important, our loved brands. $8 billion-plus brands, 5 brands between $500 million and $1 billion in sales and many, many $100 million-plus brands is spread across a broad range of categories and geographies. 
But that doesn't really tell you what Kraft Heinz is all about. Where are we going and how we intend to get there? 
It all begins with our vision, to be the best food company, growing a better world. It is a mission statement that guides our long-term objectives. It serves as the foundation for our building our business. Our vision speaks to our focus on transforming the industry, on becoming the most profitable food company that's powered by the industry top talent, igniting top line growth. It means that our products are the best quality, that we have the leading brands in all the categories in which we compete, that we can serve our customers and consumers to their highest expectation. 
The second part of our vision underscore our focus on growth. Make no mistake. We are committed to growing our great brands by accelerating big innovations investing more in working media and building aggressive sales teams. But we are also committed to being a good corporate citizen and focus on the sustainable health of our business, from our supply chain and package to our philanthropic and community investments. 
Globally, we have a singular committed to fighting hunger throughout our signature effort, the Kraft Heinz Micro Nutrient Campaign, which provides and distributes vitamin and mineral powders to children in poor countries. 
Our vision [indiscernible] path for future achievement and power plant for continued profitable growth. 
So how do we get there? How do we create value? How our strategy is based on 3 objectives: profitable sales growth, best-in-class margins and a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. 
Let me speak to each, starting with profitable sales growth. We are a sales organization. And as we have said before, we believe there are multiple avenues for sales growth ahead of us by focusing on 4 pillars: first, innovation. Fewer, bigger and bolder. That's why we call the big innovation. Second, by having high investment in working media dollars; third, to leverage the scale of our go-to-market capabilities by building aggressive sales team; and finally, by taking Kraft brands global over time. Through those 4 pillars, we will invest in talent in our business to support innovation that responds to customer needs, marketing that supports the health of our brands and product launch in the new markets to expand our global presence. 
We also will drive profitable growth through revenue management, which is all about optimizing price pack architecture and promotion strategy and improving the ROI on trade execution. 
Across all these efforts, we will rigorously measure the return on our investment and deploy capital in a disciplined manner. 
Our second objectives is to achieve and maintain best-in-class margin. Two of the main drivers here will be zero-based budgeting and making our manufacturing distribution footprint more efficient. And we have already made significant progress in each of those areas. 
Zero-based budget, or ZBB, is a systematic approach, not a onetime event. It's all about ownership and doing more with less. It drives accountability and encourages our employees to treat company dollars as if they are their own. And as far as our manufacturing distribution footprint, as I mentioned, after an extensive review of our combined capabilities, yesterday, we announced a difficult decision to close 7 manufacturing facilities and several distribution centers in North America. In doing so, we eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies for the new combined company. 
We will also invest heavily in modernizing many of our facilities with installation of state-of-the-art production lines, and this will facilitate further product quality improvement and innovation. 
Our third objective is with superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. This includes our commitment to maintaining the dividend policy, and Paulo will speak to the actions we are taking on that front a bit later. 
Now the path to creating more value at Kraft Heinz begins with execution, a fast, seamless integration in our biggest commercial business, the United States. 
So it's my pleasure to ask my partner, George, to provide some on-the-ground color on how we're doing this while still serving our consumers and our customers."

Let me give yo",630,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. To build on Bernardo's comments, what we've been most encouraged by and, in fact, most impressed with to date is the speed at which our people have integrated our commercial organization. 
Let me give you some statistics on what our team has been able to achieve since the merger closed. 
By day 1, we have the leadership team of the U.S. business appointed. By day 12, we had the top 67 leaders in place. 
On August 14, 5 weeks from closing, we stood up the commercial organization with all our sale, marketing, R&D, innovation and commercial teams in place. 
And by the end of September, we had business processes in place. Along the way, we've made a good number of promotions from within. 
Our new rituals and routines are already operational in areas such as sales and within our monthly performance reviews in our U.S. Commercial unit. We've taken the best of both approach, with ongoing improvement as we harmonize trading terms and develop joint business plans with our retail customers. 
And importantly, we are well positioned as we look forward to 2016. Our innovation pipeline is ready to be launched, and we'll talk more about that in the coming months. And we expect to continue the progress we've been making in shifting our advertising spend from nonworking to working media. 
Now this may all sound good, and we do feel good about where we are at. But I also understand that the number shows several challenges. 
During the third quarter in the U.S., while we didn't see anything fall off through the integration, our base business trends remained mixed. Overall, our market share in the United States has been stable, with some increases and declines despite the changes we went through. And across the top 20 or so category, our share is up or flat and roughly 2/3 of those categories. 
From a consumption perspective, the bars on the right of the slide show that our U.S. retail business grew in both Q3 and year-to-date. But what I am most encouraged by is the fact that our base for nonpromoted sales are up strongly. 
The investments we made in Heinz Ketchup, Classico Pasta Sauce, Oscar Mayer Select Natural Cold Cuts, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Coffee and Bagel Bites are driving a solid consumption gain. 
On the innovation front, we're seeing some encouraging momentum. Earlier this year, we made a big bet around Heinz Yellow Mustard. The result was a significant disruption to the mustard category in both the United States and Canada. We were able to achieve high single-digit market share in just 4 months, an unprecedented short amount of time. 
Lunchables uploaded and our P3 portable snack innovation are also growing strongly into their second years on the market. But in large part, this has been offset by lower volume from ongoing challenges we've had in our Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages, [indiscernible], including Mac and Cheese and our Smart Ones Frozen Meals. These are turnaround opportunities for us, and I look forward to updating you in the coming months on our plans. 
From a profitability perspective, I would note 2 things: one is that our ability to maintain pricing consistent with our cost. It has held up in what has been a high-pressure deflationary environment in some of our key categories. And we feel very good about that. Two is that the cost savings and productivity program that were in place in the U.S. prior to the merger were all executed and delivered as planned. 
So overall, a good start to our team in the United States, and we know where our opportunities to improve reside. But let me turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail."
278212,315348379,894295,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George. Before I get into our third Q results and the numbers, I'd like to spend some time on Slide 6, discussing our non-GAAP financial metrics. These 3 measures are what we use to evaluate our performance versus our internal plan and what w",2042,"Thank you, George. Before I get into our third Q results and the numbers, I'd like to spend some time on Slide 6, discussing our non-GAAP financial metrics. 
These 3 measures are what we use to evaluate our performance versus our internal plan and what will report out to you on a quarterly basis. 
The first one is organic net sales growth. And similar to most companies, we simply exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. 
The second is adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA figures exclude the impact of integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, stock-based comp, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains or losses on the sales of business and nonmonetary currency devaluations such as Venezuela, which we recognized in the second Q this year. 
The third measure is adjusted earnings per share. Similar to adjusted EBITDA, our adjusted EPS, we exclude the impact of integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains and losses on the sale of business and nonmonetary currency devaluations. 
So we adjust EPS in much the same way we adjust EBITDA, except that we do not back out the impact of stock-based compensation for adjusted EPS. 
Now a number of you have asked us about and maybe surprised by the fact that we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting from our adjusted EPS figures. The reason we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting is that the incremental noncash step-up in costs due to purchase accounting will largely be offset by incremental noncash favorability flowing through our income statement going forward. 
Beginning in Q4, we expect to see a stepped-up benefit from the amortization of prior service credits on our postretirement benefit plans due to plan changes. 
To give you some numbers, the amortization of prior service credits amounted to $28 million in Q3, driven by 1 month of amortization related to this plan changes. 
Q4 this year, in every quarter thereafter for the next several years, we'll reflect the 3 months of amortization at the same rate or roughly $325 million annually. 
So with that out of the way, let's turn to our Q3 results, starting with total company results on Slide 7. 
As you might have seen in this afternoon's earnings release, our GAAP or reported third quarter results are a bit disjoint due to a number of factors, including the fact that there were 5 calendar days of premerger Heinz results, while during the rest of the quarter, we operated as a combined Kraft Heinz business. 
So to keep things simple, my comments today will focus on our pro forma non-GAAP results. On that basis, for the total company in Q3, we saw mixed top line results, down 9% due to a 7 percentage point currency headwind while positive net pricing was offset by lower volume/mix. 
In terms of pricing, our 70 basis point net pricing increase reflected 2 factors: one, net pricing gains in our geographies, including pricing to address higher local input costs in Europe and developed marketings that more than offset our negative impact of approximately 1.5 percentage points related to lower net commodity cost across our big 4 commodities: dairy, meat, coffee and nut in the U.S. and Canada. 
Volume/mix declined 2.7% as solid growth in rest of the world segment was offset by lower volumes in ready-to-drink beverage, Foodservice, cheese and boxed dinners in the United States and Canada. 
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were both down to an 8.2 [ph] percentage point currency headwind at the EBITDA level. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 4.8%, and adjusted EPS would have been up in the mid-single-digit range as well. This reflected ongoing savings from premerger restructuring and productivity initiatives at both Kraft and Heinz and the beginning of the integration sales. 
Two, favorable pricing net of commodity costs and as well as solid volume/mix gains in Europe and Asia-Pacific. 
Adjusted EPS also faced an additional headwind in the form of a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was roughly 30% in Q3 2015 versus roughly 25% in Q3 last year when we had favorability from some discrete tax items on the Kraft site. 
As we move forward, we would expect to see integration-related savings taking on a bigger role, and as I mentioned earlier, we should begin to see the benefit of stepped up amortization of prior service credits under our postretirement benefit plans coming through beginning in Q4. 
That's the total company. Now let me provide some color on the results and state of business in our 4 reporting segments: the United States, Canada, Europe and rest of the world. 
In the U.S., we've been focused this past few months on executing a smooth business integration while minimizing disruption, as George talked about. You can see on Slide 8 that in Q3, organic net sales declined 3.7% [ph], as gains from pricing were more than offset by a decline in volume/mix versus the prior year period. 
On the pricing front, while net price in the U.S. was up only 20 basis points, this included a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points related to lower commodity costs in our big 4 commodities, primarily dairy and coffee. 
The volume/mix declines were primarily driven by lower volume in 3 areas: ready-to-drink beverage, where we reformulate [indiscernible] in an effort to reverse consumption declines but have to raise prices by about 25% to offset the higher cost of enhanced product quality; boxed dinners, where both consumer takeaway and our level of promotional activity were lower than the prior year; and foodservice, where shipments were lower from some lost bids at a couple of key customers. 
Unfortunately, these factors offset some significant gains from product innovation in Lunchables, P3, coffee and cream cheese as well as some trend spending in growth and market share that we're seeing from investments we've made in ketchup, mustard and pasta sauce. 
Pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. grew 1.4%, driven by a combination of favorable pricing net of costs, lower manufacturing costs and lower overhead. 
And these gains more than offsetting impacts of unfavorable volume/mix as well as higher marketing expenses and significantly higher bonus accruals versus Q3 last year. 
On Slide 9, in Canada, our focus on executing a smooth integration has been much the same as the U.S., only that our team north of the border has also been dealing with the pressure of higher local input costs in many of their categories. 
Organic net sales declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven by a 5.2 percentage point decline in volume/mix that was partially offset by a 2.6 percentage point increase from net pricing. 
Positive net pricing reflected price increases to offset higher local input cost, particularly in coffee. But I would point out that total net pricing also included a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point related to lower commodity cost in our big 4 commodity, mainly dairy. 
The volume/mix declines were driven by lower shipments in foodservice as well as the volume pressure caused by price increases in coffee. 
And the factors more than offset solid growth in pasta sauce and mustard. 
Canada's adjusted EBITDA in constant currency was down 2.4%, as unfavorable volume mix and negative pricing net of higher local input costs more than offset gains from premerger restructuring and productivity efforts as well as well as the start of integration savings. 
But price net of higher local input cost and the volume/mix decline held back Q3 profit growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Europe on Slide 10. In Europe, our team has been focused on 2 fronts: executing line extensions to drive better volume and mix performance; and driving increased efficiencies throughout our business, everything from packaged size monetization to rightsizing our footprint. And effort in both these fronts have really been paying off. 
Organic net sales grew 0.5 point, driven by a combination of higher net pricing and positive volume/mix. 
Given the net pricing reflected a reduction in inefficient promotional spending in our U.K. beans business and strategic pricing in ketchup across a number of markets. That was partially offset by a higher promotional spending to reinvigorate consumption in mayonnaise. 
Positive volume/mix was driven by ketchup and pasta sauce growth across Europe that more than offset the volume declines in Italy and soup in U.K. 
This healthy the top line growth was supported by a double-digit increase in marketing investments to support our brands. In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings, combined to deliver cost currency adjusted EBITDA growth of over 20%. 
Finally is rest of the world on Slide 11, which includes our operations in 3 regions: Asia-Pacific; Latin America; and Russia, India, Middle East and Africa or what we call RIMEA. 
Here we are focused on profitable top line growth and adopting to local consumer trends and dynamic marketplace in fast-growing emerging markets. 
In the near term, however, foreign exchange trends have been and will likely continue to be a challenge as we pass through pricing to offset higher local input costs. 
In the third quarter, organic net sales grew 7%, driven by a 4% volume/mix gain as well as roughly 3 [ph] points of net pricing. 
Net pricing growth was primarily driven by price increases to offset higher local costs in our RIMEA region. 
Volume/mix growth was driven by strength in ABC sauces in Asia, beverage in Indonesia related to Ramadan, frozen potato gains in Mexico and solid ketchup growth in most regions. These gains were partially offset by volume/mix declines in our [indiscernible] nutritional beverage business in India as well as pasta sauce in Brazil, where we've been experiencing some recent supply chain disruptions. 
Rest of world adjusted EBITDA declined 29% versus the prior year due to a 43.7 [ph] percentage points negative impact from currency, and approximately 25 percentage points of currency impact was due to the Venezuela devaluation that we recognized in Q2 that we are seeing the effect of beginning in this third quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, our rest of world adjusted EBITDA was up 14.3% [ph], driven primarily by gains from cost savings initiatives. 
Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with an update on synergies and our capital structure. I will start with synergies on Slide 12. 
Overall, we remain on track. The best way to frame how we think about our opportunity here is to think about our savings coming from 3 areas: organizational structure, overhead savings and manufacturing footprint. 
Our structure savings tend to come earlier than other areas and are really on an enabler to getting after the broader cost savings opportunity. 
Overhead savings are nonpeople-related and really driven by our ZBB system. 
The third piece, manufacturing footprint, tends to take the longest, as there is literally a lot of heavy-lifting involved. 
To date, we have announced 2 major cost-saving actions. In August, we made a difficult but necessary decision to develop a new streamlined structure for our business in the U.S. and Canada zones. 
These resulted in a reduction of 2,500 salary and contractual positions across the U.S. and Canada and will represent the bulk of our structure savings. 
And yesterday, Bernardo talked about we announced the consolidation of our manufacturing across Kraft Heinz North America supply chain network. This critical step
[Audio Gap]
with  you today Kraft Heinz Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.575 [ph] per common share. 
That's a 4.5 percentage increase versus the prior $0.55 per share and consistent with Kraft's historical practice and commitment we made at the time of the merger announcement to grow our dividend per share over time. 
We are excited to offer this increase so soon after the merger, and we'll continue to remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value. 
Importantly, we remain confident that we will be able to maintain our policy overtime while, at the same time, remaining an investment-grade company and delivering against our goals to reduce leverage to less than 3x adjusted EBITDA over the medium term. 
I will now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our discussion."

That's question one. And then question two is, and maybe I'm reading way too much into this, but is the other implication there that you're unlikely to make a large, complex acquisition until that process is done? I'm just curious why you are sort of emphasizing that and whether there's anything or to read into any of those."

That would be very useful again to understand better visibility of what you're actually doing. The second question would be that type of margin expansion in Europe, it's even more impressive when you think that was already in your highest margin division. And it's a very tough retail environment there and also a tough regulatory environment from the cost-cutting perspective compared to the U.S, if you can comment on that. And that three homages give us more color in terms of what you found and what LNG to put the top of margin expansion in Europe.

Addressing Europe on the business side before passing to Paulo here that can get into more details on the margin expansion and so on. I think you're right to say that cycle [indiscernible] that's paying out in Europe, and we actually pretend to expand in that, we see what's happening in Europe, that's innovation and aggressive go-to-market and higher working dollars investment that are pushing the growth. But we want to also restructure on the portfolio and on the sales in the last couple of years, to get us the base and the results to allow us to invest big on the segments and products and ideas that we really thought could be winning the marketplace. And what's happening right now is, if you see, is really the working dollars increasing in Europe. That will continue. And you're going to see more investment in Europe. So in a sense, it's coming to a point that now I'm investing more, and you're going to see our extension of margin [indiscernible], but more sales coming through more investment. In a retail environment that you're right also to say from that's extremely challenged. In order to be in that position, first of all, we need to have the big bats ideas and innovation that, I think, our pipeline not only in Europe, but also in United States, Canada and other places, are quite robust. What make me optimistic when I see 2017, '18 and beyond. And we need to be in a position of efficiency that you say, ""Hey, that is the right plateau you need to have so that we can come and invest big to win not only on the sales piece but expanding segments and product lines within the environment we are facing in Europe.""

Since this is our first call since the merger, I thought it would be good to start by sharing to you some highligh",1496,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure and my honor to be speaking to you as the CEO of The Kraft Heinz Company. 
Since this is our first call since the merger, I thought it would be good to start by sharing to you some highlights of our first 120 days as a combined company. 
After completing the merger on July 2, we moved quickly to establish our new leadership team and put in place a streamlined structure for our business in the U.S. and Canada zones. Having done that early on, our integration work has remained right on track, working on people, systems and process. We have been pleased with our ability to retain top talent, particularly front-of-the-house marketeers in key Kraft categories. We have been impressed with how the legacy Kraft team has embraced change in this performance-driven quarter. 
We instituted new rituals and routines that represent the discipline, accountability and methodology for how he will operate as one of the world's premier companies. This includes cascading core business practice that will continue to build our competitive advantage like zero-based budgeting, revenue management and manage by objectives.
We're currently rolling out our zero-based budget, or ZBB, across the legacy Kraft commercial units and functions and will be the basis for our 2016 planning process worldwide. 
In revenue management, we are building an internal structure from the ground up to support our go-to-market across roughly 40 categories in North America. 
We're also now installing our third core business practice that we call manage by objectives, or MBOs, with all our legacy Kraft leaders as part of our integration efforts. MBO is an important language that clearly outlines measurable expectations, goals and deliverables for all our Kraft Heinz leaders. It connects our employees around the world to our goals that cascade down directly from me to my leadership team and then throughout the organization. 
On our merger announcement call in March, I mentioned that we had implemented our MBO process with individual performance targets for over 3,000 people, white-collared employees at Heinz. As we finalize our plans for 2016, approximately 5,200 of our employees will have specific, individualized MBOs in place. Collectively, zero-based budgeting, revenue management and manage by objectives are systematic tools that we use to run our daily operations. 
Another important accomplishment during our first 120 days was the completion of an extensive review of our combined North America supply chain and manufacturing footprint, capabilities and capacity utilization. The actions under the resulting plan will take us 2 years to complete but will make us more globally competitive and accelerate our future growth. We will talk about that more in detail in a moment. 
We're also pleased with the fact that we have been able to maintain base business momentum as we institute significant change throughout the organization. Obviously, our reported numbers have been significantly impacted by currency headwinds all year. Excluding currency, both our top line and bottom line drivers have been consistent year-to-date throughout the third quarter. Our top line results have been mixed. 
On the positive side, we have had much success with the Big Bet innovations such as Lunchables, P3 and the Heinz Yellow Mustard. Investments we have made in ketchup and pasta sauce are driving solid consumption gains in the markets where we compete. Our sauces business in Asia-Pacific is doing well, and we are benefiting greatly in Europe from an improved product mix and higher investment in marketing behind our brand. 
At the same time, our challenge have continued in certain categories like ready-to-drink beverage and dinners in the United States and frozen meals in a number of world markets that has held back our growth. So more work needs to be done. 
On the pricing front, we have had net pricing gains in all geographies, and our price net of commodity helped drive profit growth in both the quarter and the year-to-date. 
And last but not least, the productivity and restructuring initiatives that both Kraft and Heinz put in place prior to the merger have been driving our bottom line all year. 
We also start to see the beginning of some integration saving in Q3. 
That's our 120-day update. Before I hand it over to George and Paulo to get more into the details of our third quarter results, I think it's important to talk about where are we going. 
If you are tuning to our call today, I think you certainly know who Kraft Heinz is. From our diverse portfolio of sauces, cheese, meals, meats and beverage to our extensive global footprint, we dedicated Kraft Heinz employees in over 45 countries. And mostly important, our loved brands. $8 billion-plus brands, 5 brands between $500 million and $1 billion in sales and many, many $100 million-plus brands spread across a broad range of categories and geographies. 
But that doesn't really tell you what Kraft Heinz is all about. Where are we going and how do we intend to get there? 
It all begins with our vision, to be the best food company, growing a better world. It is a mission statement that guides our long-term objectives. It serves as the foundation for our building our business. 
Our vision speaks to our focus on transforming the industry, on becoming the most profitable food company that's powered by the industry top talent, igniting top line growth. It means that our products are the best quality, that we have the leading brands in all the categories in which we compete, that we can serve our customers and consumers to their highest expectation. 
The second part of our vision underscore our focus on growth. Make no mistake. We're committed to growing our great brands by accelerating Big Bet innovations, investing more in working media and building aggressive sales teams. But we're also committed to being a good corporate citizen and focus on the sustainable health of our business, from our supply chain and package to our philanthropic and community investments. 
Globally, we have a singular commitment to fighting hunger throughout our signature effort, the Kraft Heinz Micronutrient Campaign, which provides and distributes vitamin and mineral powders to children in poor countries. 
Our vision [indiscernible] the path for future achievements, empowering plans for continued profitable growth. 
So how will we get there? How will we create value? Our strategy is based on 3 objectives: profitable sales growth, best-in-class margins and a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. 
Let me speak to each, starting with profitable sales growth. We are a sales organization. And as we have said before, we believe there are multiple avenues for sales growth ahead of us by focusing on 4 pillars: first, innovation. Fewer, bigger and bolder. That's what we call the Big Bet innovation. Second, by having high investment in working media dollars; third, to leverage the scale of our go-to-market capabilities by building an aggressive sales team; and finally, by taking Kraft brands global over time. Through these 4 pillars, we will invest in strategy in our business to support innovation that responds to customer needs, marketing that supports the health of our brands and product launch in the new markets to expand our global presence. 
We also will drive profitable growth through revenue management, which is all about optimizing price/pack architecture and promotion strategy and improving the ROI on trade execution. 
Across all these efforts, we will rigorously measure the return on our investment and deploy capital in a disciplined manner. 
Our second objectives is to achieve and maintain best-in-class margin. Two of the main drivers here will be zero-based budgeting and making our manufacturing distribution footprint more efficient. And we have already made significant progress in each of those areas. 
Zero-based budget, or ZBB, is a systematic approach, not a onetime event. It's all about ownership and doing more with less. It drives accountability and encourages our employees to treat company dollars as if they are their own. And as far as our manufacturing and distribution footprint, as I mentioned, after an extensive review of our combined capabilities, yesterday, we announced a difficult decision to close 7 manufacturing facilities and several distribution centers in North America. In doing so, we eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies for the new combined company. 
We will also invest heavily in modernizing many of our facilities with installation of state-of-the-art production lines, and this will facilitate further product quality improvements and innovation. 
Our third objective is the superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. This includes our commitment to maintaining the existing dividend policy, and Paulo will speak to the actions we're taking on that front a bit later. 
Now the path to creating more value at Kraft Heinz begins with executing a fast, seamless integration in our biggest commercial business, the United States. 
So it's my pleasure to ask my partner, George, to provide some on-the-ground color on how we're doing this while still serving our consumers and our customers."
278212,315348379,894609,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. To build on Bernardo's comments, what we've been most encouraged by and, in fact, most impressed with to date is the speed at which our people have integrated our commercial organization. Let me give yo",632,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. To build on Bernardo's comments, what we've been most encouraged by and, in fact, most impressed with to date is the speed at which our people have integrated our commercial organization. 
Let me give you some statistics on what our team has been able to achieve since the merger closed. By day 1, we had the leadership team of the U.S. business appointed. By day 12, we had the top 67 leaders in place. 
On August 14, 5 weeks from closing, we put [ph] up the commercial organization with all our sale, marketing, R&D, innovation and commercial teams in place. 
And by the end of September, we had business processes in place. Along the way, we've made a good number of promotions from within. 
Our new rituals and routines are already operational in areas such as sales and within our monthly performance reviews in our U.S. Commercial unit. We've taken the best of both approach, with ongoing improvement as we harmonize trading terms and develop joint business plans with our retail customers. 
And importantly, we are well positioned as we look forward to 2016. Our innovation pipeline is ready to be launched, and we'll talk more about that in the coming months. And we expect to continue the progress we'll been making in shifting our advertising spend from nonworking to working media. 
Now this may all sound good, and we do feel good about where we are at, but I also understand that the numbers show several challenges. 
During the third quarter in the U.S., while we didn't see anything fall off through the integration, our base business trends remained mixed. Overall, our market share in the United States has been stable, with some increases and declines despite the changes we went through. And across the top 20 or so category, our share is up or flat in roughly 2/3 of those categories. 
From a consumption perspective, the bars on the right of the slide show that our U.S. retail business grew in both Q3 and year-to-date. But what I am most encouraged by is the fact that our base for non-promoted sales are up strongly. 
The investments we made in Heinz Ketchup, Classico Pasta Sauce, Oscar Mayer Selects Natural Cold Cuts, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Coffee and Bagel Bites are driving a solid consumption gain. 
On the innovation front, we're seeing some encouraging momentum. Earlier this year, we made a big bet around Heinz Yellow Mustard. The result was a significant disruption to the mustard category in both the United States and Canada. We were able to achieve high single-digit market share in just 4 months, an unprecedented short amount of time. 
Lunchables Uploaded  and our P3 portable snack innovation are also growing strongly into their second years on the market. But in large part, this has been offset by lower volume from ongoing challenges we've had in our Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages, boxed dinners including Mac & Cheese and our Smart Ones frozen meals. These are turnaround opportunities for us, and I look forward to updating you in the coming months on our plans. 
From a profitability perspective, I would note 2 things. One is that our ability to maintain pricing consistent with our cost. It has held up in what has been a high-pressure deflationary environment in some of our key categories. And we feel very good about that. Two is that the cost savings and productivity programs that were in place in the U.S. prior to the merger were all executed and delivered as planned. 
So overall, a good start to our team in the United States, and we know where our opportunities to improve reside. But let me turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail."
278212,315348379,894609,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George. Before I get into our third Q results and the numbers, I'd like to spend some time on Slide 6, discussing our non-GAAP financial metrics. These 3 measures are what we use to evaluate our performance versus our internal plans and what wi",2172,"Thank you, George. Before I get into our third Q results and the numbers, I'd like to spend some time on Slide 6, discussing our non-GAAP financial metrics. These 3 measures are what we use to evaluate our performance versus our internal plans and what will report out to you on a quarterly basis. 
The first one is organic net sales growth. And similar to most companies, we simply exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. 
The second is adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA figures exclude the impact of integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, stock-based comp, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains or losses on the sales of business and non-monetary currency devaluations such as Venezuela, which we recognized in the second Q this year. 
The third measure is adjusted earnings per share. Similar to adjusted EBITDA, for adjusted EPS, we exclude the impact of integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains and losses on the sale of business and non-monetary currency devaluations. So we adjust EPS in much the same way we adjust EBITDA, except that we do not back out the impact of stock-based compensation for adjusted EPS. 
Now a number of you have asked us about and may be surprised by the fact that we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting from our adjusted EPS figures. The reason we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting is that the incremental noncash step-up in costs due to purchase accounting will largely be offset by incremental noncash favorability flowing through our income statement going forward. 
Beginning in Q4, we expect to see a stepped-up benefit from the amortization of prior service credits on our post-retirement benefit plans due to plan changes. 
To give you some numbers, the amortization of prior service credits amounted to $28 million in Q3, driven by 1 month of amortization related to this plan changes. Q4 this year, in every quarter thereafter for the next several years, we'll reflect the 3 months of amortization at the same rate or roughly $325 million annually. 
So with that out of the way, let's turn to our Q3 results, starting with total company results on Slide 7. As you might have seen in this afternoon's earnings release, our GAAP or reported third quarter results are a bit disjoint due to a number of factors, including the fact that there were 5 calendar days of premerger Heinz results, while during the rest of the quarter, we operated as a combined Kraft Heinz business. 
So to keep things simple, my comments today will focus on our pro forma non-GAAP results. On that basis, for the total company in Q3, we saw mix at top line results down 9% due to a 7 percentage point currency headwind, while positive net pricing was offset by lower volume/mix. 
In terms of pricing, our 70 basis point net pricing increase reflected 2 factors: One, net pricing gains in our geographies, including pricing to address higher local input costs in Europe in developing marketing that more than offset our negative impact of approximately 1.5 percentage points related to lower net commodity costs across our big 4 commodities: dairy, meat, coffee and nuts in the U.S. and Canada. 
Volume/mix declined 2.7% as solid growth in Rest of the World segment was offset by lower volumes in ready-to-drink beverage, foodservice, cheese and boxed dinners in the United States and Canada. 
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were both down to an 8.2 percentage point currency headwind at the EBITDA level. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 4.8%, and adjusted EPS would have been up in the mid-single-digit range as well. This reflected ongoing savings from premerger restructuring and productivity initiatives at both Kraft and Heinz and the beginning of the integration sales. 
Two, favorable pricing net of commodity costs and as well as solid volume/mix gains in Europe and Asia-Pacific. 
Adjusted EPS also faced an additional headwind in the form of a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was roughly 30% in Q3 2015 versus roughly 25% in Q3 last year when we had favorability from some discrete tax items on the Kraft side. 
As we move forward, we would expect to see integration-related savings taking on a bigger role, and as I mentioned earlier, we should begin to see the benefit of stepped-up amortization of prior service credits under our postretirement benefit plans coming through beginning in Q4. 
That's the total company. Now let me provide some color on the results and state of business in our 4 reporting segments: the United States, Canada, Europe and Rest of the World. 
In the U.S., we've been focused these past few months on executing a smooth business integration while minimizing disruption, as George talked about. You can see on Slide 8 that in Q3, organic net sales declined 3.7% as gains from pricing were more than offset by a decline in volume/mix versus the prior year period. 
On the pricing front, while net price in the U.S. was up only 20 basis points, this included a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points related to lower commodity costs in our big 4 commodities, primarily dairy and coffee. 
The volume/mix declines were primarily driven by lower volume in 3 areas: ready-to-drink beverage, where we reformulated Capri Sun in an effort to reverse consumption decline but have to raise prices by about 25% to offset the higher cost of enhanced product quality; boxed dinners, where both consumer takeaway and our level of promotional activity were lower than the prior year; and foodservice, where shipments were lower from some lost bids at a couple of key customers. 
Unfortunately, these factors offset some significant gains from product innovation in Lunchables, P3, coffee and cream cheese as well as some trend spending in growth and market share that we're seeing from investments we've made in ketchup, mustard and pasta sauce. 
Pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. grew 1.4%, driven by a combination of favorable pricing net of costs, lower manufacturing costs and lower overhead. And these gains more than offset the impacts of unfavorable volume/mix as well as higher marketing expenses and significantly higher bonus accruals versus Q3 last year. 
On Slide 9, in Canada, our focus on executing a smooth integration has been much the same as the U.S., only that our team north of the border has also been dealing with the pressure of higher local input costs in many of their categories. 
Organic net sales declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven by a 5.2 percentage point decline in volume/mix that was partially offset by a 2.6 percentage point increase from net pricing. 
Positive net pricing reflected price increases to offset higher local input costs, particularly in coffee. But I would point out that total net pricing also included a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point related to lower commodity cost in our big 4 commodity, mainly dairy. 
The volume/mix declines were driven by lower shipments in foodservice as well as the volume pressure caused by price increase in coffee. And these factors more than offset solid growth in pasta sauce and mustard. 
Canada's adjusted EBITDA in constant currency was down 2.4%, as unfavorable volume mix and negative pricing net of higher local input costs more than offset gains from premerger restructuring and productivity efforts as well as well as the start of integration savings. 
But price net of higher local input cost and the volume/mix decline held back Q3 profit growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Europe on Slide 10. In Europe, our team has been focused on 2 fronts: executing line extensions [indiscernible] to drive better volume and mix performance, and driving increased efficiencies throughout our business, everything from package size monetization to rightsizing our footprint, and efforts in both these fronts have really been paying off. 
Organic net sales grew 0.5 point, driven by a combination of higher net pricing and positive volume/mix. 
Gains in net pricing reflected a reduction in inefficient promotional spending in our U.K. beans business and strategic pricing in ketchup across a number of markets. That was partially offset by a higher promotional spending to reinvigorate consumption in mayonnaise. 
Positive volume/mix was driven by ketchup and pasta sauce growth across Europe that more than offset volume declines in infant nutrition Italy and soup in U.K. 
This healthy top line growth was supported by a double-digit increase in marketing investments to support our brands. In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings, combined to deliver cost currency adjusted EBITDA growth of over 20%. 
Finally is Rest of the World on Slide 11, which includes our operations in 3 regions: Asia-Pacific; Latin America; and Russia, India, Middle East and Africa, or what we call RIMEA. 
Here we are focused on profitable top line growth and adapting to local consumer trends and dynamic marketplace in fast-growing emerging markets. 
In the near term, however, foreign exchange trends have been and will likely continue to be a challenge as we pass through pricing to offset higher local input costs. 
In the third quarter, organic net sales grew 7%, driven by a 4% volume/mix gain as well as roughly 3 points of net pricing. 
Net pricing growth was primarily driven by price increases to offset higher local costs in our RIMEA region. 
Volume/mix growth was driven by strength in ABC sauces in Asia, beverage in Indonesia related to Ramadan, frozen potato gains in Mexico and solid ketchup growth in most regions. These gains were partially offset by volume/mix declines in our COMPLAN nutritional beverage business in India as well as Quero pasta sauce in Brazil, where we've been experiencing some recent supply chain disruptions. 
Rest of World adjusted EBITDA declined 29% versus the prior year due to a 43.7 percentage point negative impact from currency, and approximately 25 percentage points of currency impact was due to the Venezuela devaluation that we recognized in Q2 that we are seeing the effect of beginning in this third quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, our Rest of World adjusted EBITDA was at 14.3% driven primarily by gains from cost savings initiatives. 
Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with an update on synergies and our capital structure. I will start with synergies on Slide 12. 
Overall, we remain on track. The best way to frame how we think about our opportunity here is to think about our savings coming from 3 areas: organizational structure, overhead savings and manufacturing footprint. 
Org structure savings tend to come earlier than other areas and are really an enabler to getting after the broader cost savings opportunities. 
Overhead savings are non-people-related and really driven by our ZBB system. 
The third piece, manufacturing footprint, tends to take the longest, as there is literally a lot of heavy lifting involved. 
To date, we have announced 2 major cost-saving actions. In August, we made a difficult but necessary decision to develop a new streamlined structure for our business in the U.S. and Canada zones. This resulted in a reduction of 2,500 salary and contractual positions across the U.S. and Canada and will represent the bulk of our org structure savings. 
And yesterday, Bernardo talked about we announced the consolidation of our manufacturing across Kraft Heinz North America supply chain network. This critical step in our integration plan will take up to 2 years to complete. It will eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies, making us more competitive and improving our ability to drive profitable growth for many years to come. 
On the numbers side, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our initial financial expectations for the merger. This includes our aggressive cost savings target of $1.5 billion, which we now expect to deliver full in 2017. And as we validated and updated our plans, the cash cost to achieve those savings is consistent with our initial expectations, consisting of approximately $1.1 billion of upfront cash costs and roughly $1.1 billion of CapEx for footprint optimization over the next few years. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'm also pleased to share with you today that Kraft Heinz Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.575 per common share. That's a 4.5 percentage increase versus the prior $0.55 per share and consistent with Kraft's historical practice and the commitment we made at the time of the merger announcement to grow our dividend per share over time. We are excited to offer this increase so soon after the merger, and we'll continue to remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value. 
Importantly, we remain confident that we will be able to maintain our policy overtime while at the same time remaining an investment-grade company and delivering against our goal to reduce leverage to less than 3x adjusted EBITDA over the medium term. 
I will now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our discussion."

The second question would be, at that type of margin expansion in Europe, it's even more impressive when you think that, that was already your highest margin division, and it's a very tough retail environment there and also a tough regulatory environment from a cost-cutting perspective compared to the U.S. So if you can comment on that.

So in a sense, it's coming to a point that now I'm investing more, and you're going to see not an expansion of margin in that sense but more sales coming through more investment. In a retail environment that you're right also to say that the industry remains challenged. But in order to be in that position, first of all, we need to have the Big Bet ideas on innovation that I think our pipeline not only in Europe, but also in United States, Canada and other places, are quite robust, what makes me optimistic when I see 2017, '18 and beyond. And we need to be in a position of efficiency that you say, hey, that is the right plateau you need to have so that we can come and invest big to win not only on the sales piece but expanding segments and product lines within the environment we're facing in Europe. So commercially, you can expect more investment in marketing and selling in Europe as we continue to expand our product line in the region. Paulo, do you want to comment on the margin?"

It's my pleasure and my honor to be speaking to you as the CEO of The Kraft Heinz Company. 
Since this is our first call since the merger, I thought it would be good to start by sharing to you some highlights of our first 120 days as a combined company. 
After completing the merger on July 2, we moved quickly to establish our new leadership team and put in place a streamlined structure for our business in the U.S. and Canada zones. Having done that early on, our integration work has remained right on track, working on people, systems and process. We have been pleased with our ability to retain top talent, particularly front-of-the-house marketeers in key Kraft categories. We have been impressed with how the legacy Kraft team has embraced change in this performance-driven quarter. 
We are instituting new rituals and routines that represent the discipline, accountability and methodology for how he will operate as one of the world's premier companies. This includes cascading core business practice that will continue to build our competitive advantage like zero-based budgeting, revenue management and manage by objectives.
We're currently rolling out our zero-based budget, or ZBB, across the legacy Kraft commercial units and functions and will be the basis for our 2016 planning process worldwide. 
In revenue management, we are building an internal structure from the ground up to support our go-to-market across roughly 40 categories in North America. 
We're also now installing our third core business practice that we call manage by objectives, or MBOs, with all our legacy Kraft leaders as part of our integration efforts. MBO is an important language that clearly outlines measurable expectations, goals and deliverables for all our Kraft Heinz leaders. It connects our employees around the world to our goals that cascade down directly from me to my leadership team and then throughout the organization. 
On our merger announcement call in March, I mentioned that we had implemented our MBO process with individual performance targets for over 3,000 people, white-collared employees at Heinz. As we finalize our plans for 2016, approximately 5,200 of our employees will have specific, individualized MBOs in place. Collectively, zero-based budgeting, revenue management and manage by objectives are systematic tools that we use to run our daily operations. 
Another important accomplishment during our first 120 days was the completion of an extensive review of our combined North America supply chain and manufacturing footprint, capabilities and capacity utilization. The actions under the resulting plan will take us 2 years to complete but will make us more globally competitive and accelerate our future growth. We will talk about that more in detail in a moment. 
We're also pleased with the fact that we have been able to maintain base business momentum as we institute significant change throughout the organization. Obviously, our reported numbers have been significantly impacted by currency headwinds all year. Excluding currency, both our top line and bottom line drivers have been consistent year-to-date throughout the third quarter. Our top line results have been mixed. 
On the positive side, we have had much success with the Big Bet innovations such as Lunchables, P3 and the Heinz Yellow Mustard. Investments we have made in ketchup and pasta sauce are driving solid consumption gains in the markets where we compete. Our sauces business in Asia-Pacific is doing well, and we are benefiting greatly in Europe from an improved product mix and higher investment in marketing behind our brand. 
At the same time, our challenge have continued in certain categories like ready-to-drink beverage and dinners in the United States and frozen meals in a number of world markets that has held back our growth. So more work needs to be done. 
On the pricing front, we have had net pricing gains in all geographies, and our price net of commodity helped drive profit growth in both the quarter and the year-to-date. 
And last but not least, the productivity and restructuring initiatives that both Kraft and Heinz put in place prior to the merger have been driving our bottom line all year. 
We also start to see the beginning of some integration savings in Q3. 
That's our 120-day update. Before I hand it over to George and Paulo to get more into the details of our third quarter results, I think it's important to talk about where are we going. 
If you are tuning into our call today, I think you certainly know who Kraft Heinz is. From our diverse portfolio of sauces, cheese, meals, meats and beverage to our extensive global footprint, we dedicated Kraft Heinz employees in over 45 countries. And mostly important, our loved brands. $8 billion-plus brands, 5 brands between $500 million and $1 billion in sales and many, many $100 million-plus brands spread across a broad range of categories and geographies. 
But that doesn't really tell you what Kraft Heinz is all about. Where are we going and how do we intend to get there? 
It all begins with our vision to be the best food company growing a better world. It has a mission statement that guides our long-term objectives. It serves as the foundation for our building our business. 
Our vision speaks to our focus on transforming the industry, on becoming the most profitable food company that's powered by the industry top talent igniting top line growth. It means that our products are the best quality, that we have the leading brands in all the categories in which we compete, that we can serve our customers and consumers to their highest expectation. 
The second part of our vision underscore our focus on growth. Make no mistake. We're committed to growing our great brands by accelerating Big Bet innovations, investing more in working media and building aggressive sales teams. But we're also committed to being a good corporate citizen and focus on the sustainable health of our business, from our supply chain and package to our philanthropic and community investments. 
Globally, we have a singular commitment to fighting hunger throughout our signature effort, the Kraft Heinz Micronutrient Campaign, which provides and distributes vitamin and mineral powders to children in poor countries. 
Our vision outlines a path for future achievements, empowering plans for continued profitable growth. 
So how will we get there? How will we create value? Our strategy is based on 3 objectives: profitable sales growth, best-in-class margins and a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. 
Let me speak to each, starting with profitable sales growth. We are a sales organization. And as we have said before, we believe there are multiple avenues for sales growth ahead of us by focusing on 4 pillars: first, innovation -- fewer, bigger and bolder -- that's what we call the Big Bet innovation; second, by having high investment in working media dollars; third, to leverage the scale of our go-to-market capabilities by building an aggressive sales team; and finally, by taking Kraft brands global over time. Through those 4 pillars, we will invest in strategy in our business to support innovation that responds to customer needs, marketing that supports the health of our brands and product launch in the new markets to expand our global presence. 
We also will drive profitable growth through revenue management, which is all about optimizing price/pack architecture and promotion strategy and improving the ROI on trade execution. 
Across all these efforts, we will rigorously measure the return on our investment and deploy capital in a disciplined manner. 
Our second objective is to achieve and maintain best-in-class margin. Two of the main drivers here will be zero-based budgeting and making our manufacturing distribution footprint more efficient. And we have already made significant progress in each of those areas. 
Zero-based budget, or ZBB, is a systematic approach, not a onetime event. It's all about ownership and doing more with less. It drives accountability and encourages our employees to treat company dollars as if they are their own. And as far as our manufacturing and distribution footprint, as I mentioned, after an extensive review of our combined capabilities, yesterday, we announced a difficult decision to close 7 manufacturing facilities and several distribution centers in North America. In doing so, we eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies for the new combined company. 
We will also invest heavily in modernizing many of our facilities with installation of state-of-the-art production lines, and this will facilitate further product quality improvements and innovation. 
Our third objective is the superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. This includes our commitment to maintaining the existing dividend policy, and Paulo will speak to the actions we're taking on that front a bit later. 
Now the path to creating more value at Kraft Heinz begins with executing a fast, seamless integration in our biggest commercial business, the United States. 
So it's my pleasure to ask my partner, George, to provide some on-the-ground color on how we're doing this while still serving our consumers and our customers."

We've taken the best of both approach, with ongoing improvement as we harmonize trading terms and develop joint business plans with our retail customers. 
And importantly, we are well positioned as we look forward to 2016. Our innovation pipeline is ready to be launched, and we'll talk more about that in the coming months. And we expect to continue the progress we've been making in shifting our advertising spend from nonworking to working media. 
Now this may all sound good, and we do feel good about where we are at, but I also understand that the numbers show several challenges. 
During the third quarter in the U.S., while we didn't see anything fall off through the integration, our base business trends remained mixed. Overall, our market share in the United States has been stable, with some increases and declines despite the changes we went through. And across the top 20 or so category, our share is up or flat in roughly 2/3 of those categories. 
From a consumption perspective, the bars on the right of the slide show that our U.S. retail business grew in both Q3 and year-to-date. But what I am most encouraged by is the fact that our base for non-promoted sales are up strongly. 
The investments we made in Heinz Ketchup, Classico Pasta Sauce, Oscar Mayer Selects Natural Cold Cuts, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Coffee and Bagel Bites are driving a solid consumption gain. 
On the innovation front, we're seeing some encouraging momentum. Earlier this year, we made a big bet around Heinz Yellow Mustard. The result was a significant disruption to the mustard category in both the United States and Canada. We were able to achieve high single-digit market share in just 4 months, an unprecedented short amount of time. 
Lunchables Uploaded and our P3 portable snack innovation are also growing strongly into their second years on the market. But in large part, this has been offset by lower volume from ongoing challenges we've had in our Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages, boxed dinners including Mac & Cheese and our Smart Ones frozen meals. These are turnaround opportunities for us, and I look forward to updating you in the coming months on our plans. 
From a profitability perspective, I would note 2 things. One is that our ability to maintain pricing consistent with our cost, it has held up in what has been a high-pressure deflationary environment in some of our key categories. And we feel very good about that. Two is that the cost savings and productivity programs that were in place in the U.S. prior to the merger were all executed and delivered as planned. 
So overall, a good start to our team in the United States, and we know where our opportunities to improve reside. But let me turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail."
278212,315348379,894697,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George.

Before I get into our third Q results and the numbers, I'd like to spend some time on Slide 6, discussing our non-GAAP financial metrics. These 3 measures are what we use to evaluate our performance versus our internal plans and what will report out to you on a quarterly basis. 
The first one is organic net sales growth. And similar to most companies, we simply exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. 
The second is adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA figures exclude the impact of integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, stock-based comp, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains or losses on the sales of business and non-monetary currency devaluations such as Venezuela, which we recognized in the second Q this year. 
The third measure is adjusted earnings per share. Similar to adjusted EBITDA, for adjusted EPS, we exclude the impact of integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains and losses on the sale of business and non-monetary currency devaluations. So we adjust EPS in much the same way we adjust EBITDA, except that we do not back out the impact of stock-based compensation for adjusted EPS. 
Now a number of you have asked us about and may be surprised by the fact that we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting from our adjusted EPS figures. The reason we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting is that the incremental noncash step-up in costs due to purchase accounting will largely be offset by incremental noncash favorability flowing through our income statement going forward. 
Beginning in Q4, we expect to see a stepped-up benefit from the amortization of prior service credits on our post-retirement benefit plans due to plan changes. 
To give you some numbers, the amortization of prior service credits amounted to $28 million in Q3, driven by 1 month of amortization related to this plan changes. Q4 this year and every quarter thereafter for the next several years, will reflect the 3 months of amortization at the same rate or roughly $325 million annually. 
So with that out of the way, let's turn to our Q3 results, starting with total company results on Slide 7. As you might have seen in this afternoon's earnings release, our GAAP or reported third quarter results are a bit disjoint due to a number of factors, including the fact that there were 5 calendar days of premerger Heinz results, while during the rest of the quarter, we operated as a combined Kraft Heinz business. 
So to keep things simple, my comments today will focus on our pro forma non-GAAP results. On that basis, for the total company in Q3, we saw mix at top line results down 9% due to a 7 percentage point currency headwind, while positive net pricing was offset by lower volume/mix. 
In terms of pricing, our 70 basis point net pricing increase reflected 2 factors: One, net pricing gains in our geographies, including pricing to address higher local input costs in Europe and developing marketing that more than offset our negative impact of approximately 1.5 percentage points related to lower net commodity costs across our big 4 commodities: dairy, meat, coffee and nuts in the U.S. and Canada. 
Volume/mix declined 2.7% as solid growth in Rest of the World segment was offset by lower volumes in ready-to-drink beverage, foodservice, cheese and boxed dinners in the United States and Canada. 
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were both down to an 8.2 percentage point currency headwind at the EBITDA level. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 4.8%, and adjusted EPS would have been up in the mid-single-digit range as well. This reflected ongoing savings from premerger restructuring and productivity initiatives at both Kraft and Heinz and the beginning of the integration sales. 
Two, favorable pricing net of commodity costs and as well as solid volume/mix gains in Europe and Asia-Pacific. 
Adjusted EPS also faced an additional headwind in the form of a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was roughly 30% in Q3 2015 versus roughly 25% in Q3 last year when we had favorability from some discrete tax items on the Kraft side. 
As we move forward, we would expect to see integration-related savings taking on a bigger role, and as I mentioned earlier, we should begin to see the benefit of stepped-up amortization of prior service credits under our postretirement benefit plans coming through beginning in Q4. 
That's the total company. Now let me provide some color on the results and state of business in our 4 reporting segments: the United States, Canada, Europe and Rest of the World. 
In the U.S., we've been focused these past few months on executing a smooth business integration while minimizing disruption, as George talked about. You can see on Slide 8 that in Q3, organic net sales declined 3.7% as gains from pricing were more than offset by a decline in volume/mix versus the prior year period. 
On the pricing front, while net price in the U.S. was up only 20 basis points, this included a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points related to lower commodity costs in our big 4 commodities, primarily dairy and coffee. 
The volume/mix declines were primarily driven by lower volume in 3 areas: ready-to-drink beverage, where we reformulated Capri Sun in an effort to reverse consumption decline but have to raise prices by about 25% to offset the higher cost of enhanced product quality; boxed dinners, where both consumer takeaway and our level of promotional activity were lower than the prior year; and foodservice, where shipments were lower from some lost bids at a couple of key customers. 
Unfortunately, these factors offset some significant gains from product innovation in Lunchables, P3, coffee and cream cheese as well as some trend spending in growth and market share that we're seeing from investments we've made in ketchup, mustard and pasta sauce. 
Pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. grew 1.4%, driven by a combination of favorable pricing net of costs, lower manufacturing costs and lower overhead. And these gains more than offset the impacts of unfavorable volume/mix as well as higher marketing expenses and significantly higher bonus accruals versus Q3 last year. 
On Slide 9, in Canada, our focus on executing a smooth integration has been much the same as the U.S., only that our team north of the border has also been dealing with the pressure of higher local input costs in many of their categories. 
Organic net sales declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven by a 5.2 percentage point decline in volume/mix that was partially offset by a 2.6 percentage point increase from net pricing. 
Positive net pricing reflected price increases to offset higher local input costs, particularly in coffee. But I would point out that total net pricing also included a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point related to lower commodity cost in our big 4 commodity, mainly dairy. 
The volume/mix declines were driven by lower shipments in foodservice as well as the volume pressure caused by price increase in coffee. And these factors more than offset solid growth in pasta sauce and mustard. 
Canada's adjusted EBITDA in constant currency was down 2.4%, as unfavorable volume mix and negative pricing net of higher local input costs more than offset gains from premerger restructuring and productivity efforts as well as the start of integration savings. 
But price net of higher local input cost and the volume/mix decline held back Q3 profit growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Europe on Slide 10. In Europe, our team has been focused on 2 fronts: executing line extensions and premiumization to drive better volume and mix performance, and driving increased efficiencies throughout our business, everything from package size monetization to rightsizing our footprint, and efforts in both these fronts have really been paying off. 
Organic net sales grew 0.5 point, driven by a combination of higher net pricing and positive volume/mix. 
Gains in net pricing reflected a reduction in inefficient promotional spending in our U.K. beans business and strategic pricing in ketchup across a number of markets. That was partially offset by a higher promotional spending to reinvigorate consumption in mayonnaise. 
Positive volume/mix was driven by ketchup and pasta sauce growth across Europe that more than offset volume declines in infant nutrition in Italy and soup in U.K. 
This healthy top line growth was supported by a double-digit increase in marketing investments to support our brands. In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings, combined to deliver cost currency adjusted EBITDA growth of over 20%. 
Finally is Rest of the World on Slide 11, which includes our operations in 3 regions: Asia-Pacific; Latin America; and Russia, India, Middle East and Africa, or what we call RIMEA. 
Here we are focused on profitable top line growth and adapting to local consumer trends and dynamic marketplace in fast-growing emerging markets. 
In the near term, however, foreign exchange trends have been and will likely continue to be a challenge as we pass through pricing to offset higher local input costs. 
In the third quarter, organic net sales grew 7%, driven by a 4% volume/mix gain as well as roughly 3 points of net pricing. 
Net pricing growth was primarily driven by price increases to offset higher local costs in our RIMEA region. 
Volume/mix growth was driven by strength in ABC sauces in Asia, beverage in Indonesia related to Ramadan, frozen potato gains in Mexico and solid ketchup growth in most regions. These gains were partially offset by volume/mix declines in our COMPLAN nutritional beverage business in India as well as Quero pasta sauce in Brazil, where we've been experiencing some recent supply chain disruptions. 
Rest of World adjusted EBITDA declined 29% versus the prior year due to a 43.7 percentage point negative impact from currency, and approximately 25 percentage points of currency impact was due to the Venezuela devaluation that we recognized in Q2 that we are seeing the effect of beginning in this third quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, our Rest of World adjusted EBITDA was up 14.3% driven primarily by gains from cost savings initiatives. 
Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with an update on synergies and our capital structure. I will start with synergies on Slide 12. 
Overall, we remain on track. The best way to frame how we think about our opportunity here is to think about our savings coming from 3 areas: organizational structure, overhead savings and manufacturing footprint. 
Org structure savings tend to come earlier than other areas and are really an enabler to getting after the broader cost savings opportunities. 
Overhead savings are non-people-related and really driven by our ZBB system. 
The third piece, manufacturing footprint, tends to take the longest, as there is literally a lot of heavy lifting involved. 
To date, we have announced 2 major cost-savings actions. In August, we made a difficult but necessary decision to develop a new streamlined structure for our business in the U.S. and Canada zones. This resulted in a reduction of 2,500 salary and contractual positions across the U.S. and Canada and will represent the bulk of our org structure savings. 
And yesterday, Bernardo talked about we announced the consolidation of our manufacturing across Kraft Heinz North America supply chain network. This critical step in our integration plan will take up to 2 years to complete. It will eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies, making us more competitive and improving our ability to drive profitable growth for many years to come. 
On the numbers side, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our initial financial expectations for the merger. This includes our aggressive cost savings target of $1.5 billion, which we now expect to deliver full in 2017. And as we validated and updated our plans, the cash cost to achieve those savings is consistent with our initial expectations, consisting of approximately $1.1 billion of upfront cash costs and roughly $1.1 billion of CapEx for footprint optimization over the next few years. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'm also pleased to share with you today that Kraft Heinz Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.575 per common share. That's a 4.5 percentage increase versus the prior $0.55 per share and consistent with Kraft's historical practice and the commitment we made at the time of the merger announcement to grow our dividend per share over time. We are excited to offer this increase so soon after the merger, and we'll continue to remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value. 
Importantly, we remain confident that we will be able to maintain our policy over time, while at the same time remaining an investment-grade company and delivering against our goal to reduce leverage to less than 3x adjusted EBITDA over the medium term. 
I will now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our discussion."

And in that sense, you're right to say that the level Kraft already had achieved was positive within the industry, but we are finding significant opportunities, like Paulo described, already embedded in the $1.5 billion. And we are also learning things from the legacy Kraft side that we are applying on the Heinz side. Just to give you an example, Kraft used to have a bag of media by structure and cost that [indiscernible]. And then we leverage it the other way around in that sense.

Number one, we have a large number of contracts, particularly in large commodity segments, that are based on what we call mark-to-market. And in a deflationary market of dairy and meat, you just change the price automatically. And in the deflation effort, you see the pressure on the top line.

That would be very useful again to understand the visibility of what you're actually doing. The second question would be, that type of margin expansion in Europe, it's even more impressive when you think that, that was already your highest margin division, and it's a very tough retail environment there and also a tough regulatory environment from a cost-cutting perspective compared to the U.S. So if you can comment on that. And then three, just give us more color in terms of what you found and what allowed you to put that type of margin expansion in Europe.

Addressing Europe in the business side before passing to Paulo here that can get into more details on the margin expansion and so on. I think you're right to say that the cycle that's playing out in Europe, and we actually pretend to expand in that sense. But when we see what's happening in Europe, that's innovation and aggressive go-to-market and higher working dollars investment that are pushing the growth. But we went through also restructure on the portfolio and on the sales in the last couple of years to get us the base and the results to allow us to invest big on the segments and products and ideas that we really thought could be winning the marketplace. And what's happening right now is that, if you see, is really the working dollars increasing in Europe. That will continue. And you're going to see more investment in Europe. So in a sense, it's coming to a point that now I'm investing more, and you're going to see not an expansion of margin in that sense but more sales coming through more investment. In a retail environment that you're right also to say that's extremely challenged. But in order to be in that position, first of all, we need to have the Big Bet ideas on innovation that I think our pipeline not only in Europe, but also in United States, Canada and other places, are quite robust, what makes me optimistic when I see 2017, '18 and beyond. And we need to be in a position of efficiency that you say, hey, that is the right plateau you need to have so you can come and invest big to win not only on the sales piece but expanding segments and product lines within the environment we're facing in Europe. So commercially, you can expect more investment in marketing and selling in Europe as we continue to expand our product line in the region. Paulo, do you want to comment on the margin?"

It's my pleasure and my honor to be speaking to you as the CEO of The Kraft Heinz Company. 
Since this is our first call since the merger, I thought it would be good to start by sharing to you some highlights of our first 120 days as a combined company. 
After completing the merger on July 2, we moved quickly to establish our new leadership team and put in place a streamlined structure for our business in the U.S. and Canada zones. Having done that early on, our integration work has remained right on track, working on people, systems and process. We have been pleased with our ability to retain top talent, particularly front-of-the-house marketeers in key Kraft categories. We have been impressed with how the legacy Kraft team has embraced change in this performance-driven quarter. 
We are instituting new rituals and routines that represent the discipline, accountability and methodology for how he will operate as one of the world's premier companies. This includes cascading core business practice that will continue to build our competitive advantage like zero-based budgeting, revenue management and manage by objectives.
We're currently rolling out our zero-based budget, or ZBB, across the legacy Kraft commercial units and functions and will be the basis for our 2016 planning process worldwide. 
In revenue management, we are building an internal structure from the ground up to support our go-to-market across roughly 40 categories in North America. 
We're also now installing our third core business practice that we call manage by objectives, or MBOs, with all our legacy Kraft leaders as part of our integration efforts. MBO is an important language that clearly outlines measurable expectations, goals and deliverables for all our Kraft Heinz leaders. It connects our employees around the world to our goals that cascade down directly from me to my leadership team and then throughout the organization. 
On our merger announcement call in March, I mentioned that we had implemented our MBO process with individual performance targets for over 3,000 people, white-collared employees at Heinz. As we finalize our plans for 2016, approximately 5,200 of our employees will have specific, individualized MBOs in place. Collectively, zero-based budgeting, revenue management and manage by objectives are systematic tools that we use to run our daily operations. 
Another important accomplishment during our first 120 days was the completion of an extensive review of our combined North America supply chain and manufacturing footprint, capabilities and capacity utilization. The actions under the resulting plan will take us 2 years to complete but will make us more globally competitive and accelerate our future growth. We will talk about that more in detail in a moment. 
We're also pleased with the fact that we have been able to maintain base business momentum as we institute significant change throughout the organization. Obviously, our reported numbers have been significantly impacted by currency headwinds all year. Excluding currency, both our top line and bottom line drivers have been consistent year-to-date throughout the third quarter. Our top line results have been mixed. 
On the positive side, we have had much success with the Big Bet innovations such as Lunchables, P3 and the Heinz Yellow Mustard. Investments we have made in ketchup and pasta sauce are driving solid consumption gains in the markets where we compete. Our sauces business in Asia-Pacific is doing well, and we are benefiting greatly in Europe from an improved product mix and higher investment in marketing behind our brand. 
At the same time, our challenge have continued in certain categories like ready-to-drink beverage and dinners in the United States and frozen meals in a number of world markets that has held back our growth. So more work needs to be done. 
On the pricing front, we have had net pricing gains in all geographies, and our price net of commodity helped drive profit growth in both the quarter and the year-to-date. 
And last but not least, the productivity and restructuring initiatives that both Kraft and Heinz put in place prior to the merger have been driving our bottom line all year. 
We also start to see the beginning of some integration savings in Q3. 
That's our 120-day update. Before I hand it over to George and Paulo to get more into the details of our third quarter results, I think it's important to talk about where are we going. 
If you are tuning into our call today, I think you certainly know who Kraft Heinz is. From our diverse portfolio of sauces, cheese, meals, meats and beverage to our extensive global footprint, we dedicated Kraft Heinz employees in over 45 countries. And mostly important, our loved brands. $8 billion-plus brands, 5 brands between $500 million and $1 billion in sales and many, many $100 million-plus brands spread across a broad range of categories and geographies. 
But that doesn't really tell you what Kraft Heinz is all about. Where are we going and how do we intend to get there? 
It all begins with our vision to be the best food company growing a better world. It has a mission statement that guides our long-term objectives. It serves as the foundation for our building our business. 
Our vision speaks to our focus on transforming the industry, on becoming the most profitable food company that's powered by the industry top talent igniting top line growth. It means that our products are the best quality, that we have the leading brands in all the categories in which we compete, that we can serve our customers and consumers to their highest expectation. 
The second part of our vision underscore our focus on growth. Make no mistake. We're committed to growing our great brands by accelerating Big Bet innovations, investing more in working media and building aggressive sales teams. But we're also committed to being a good corporate citizen and focus on the sustainable health of our business, from our supply chain and package to our philanthropic and community investments. 
Globally, we have a singular commitment to fighting hunger throughout our signature effort, the Kraft Heinz Micronutrient Campaign, which provides and distributes vitamin and mineral powders to children in poor countries. 
Our vision outlines a path for future achievements, empowering plans for continued profitable growth. 
So how will we get there? How will we create value? Our strategy is based on 3 objectives: profitable sales growth, best-in-class margins and a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. 
Let me speak to each, starting with profitable sales growth. We are a sales organization. And as we have said before, we believe there are multiple avenues for sales growth ahead of us by focusing on 4 pillars: first, innovation -- fewer, bigger and bolder -- that's what we call the Big Bet innovation; second, by having high investment in working media dollars; third, to leverage the scale of our go-to-market capabilities by building an aggressive sales team; and finally, by taking Kraft brands global over time. Through those 4 pillars, we will invest in strategy in our business to support innovation that responds to customer needs, marketing that supports the health of our brands and product launch in the new markets to expand our global presence. 
We also will drive profitable growth through revenue management, which is all about optimizing price/pack architecture and promotion strategy and improving the ROI on trade execution. 
Across all these efforts, we will rigorously measure the return on our investment and deploy capital in a disciplined manner. 
Our second objective is to achieve and maintain best-in-class margin. Two of the main drivers here will be zero-based budgeting and making our manufacturing distribution footprint more efficient. And we have already made significant progress in each of those areas. 
Zero-based budget, or ZBB, is a systematic approach, not a onetime event. It's all about ownership and doing more with less. It drives accountability and encourages our employees to treat company dollars as if they are their own. And as far as our manufacturing and distribution footprint, as I mentioned, after an extensive review of our combined capabilities, yesterday, we announced a difficult decision to close 7 manufacturing facilities and several distribution centers in North America. In doing so, we eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies for the new combined company. 
We will also invest heavily in modernizing many of our facilities with installation of state-of-the-art production lines, and this will facilitate further product quality improvements and innovation. 
Our third objective is the superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. This includes our commitment to maintaining the existing dividend policy, and Paulo will speak to the actions we're taking on that front a bit later. 
Now the path to creating more value at Kraft Heinz begins with executing a fast, seamless integration in our biggest commercial business, the United States. 
So it's my pleasure to ask my partner, George, to provide some on-the-ground color on how we're doing this while still serving our consumers and our customers."
278212,315348379,895790,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. To build on Bernardo's comments, what we've been most encouraged by and, in fact, most impressed with to date is the speed at which our people have integrated our commercial organization. Let me give yo",631,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. To build on Bernardo's comments, what we've been most encouraged by and, in fact, most impressed with to date is the speed at which our people have integrated our commercial organization. 
Let me give you some statistics on what our team has been able to achieve since the merger closed. By day 1, we had the leadership team of the U.S. business appointed. By day 12, we had the top 67 leaders in place. 
On August 14, 5 weeks from closing, we stood up the commercial organization with all our sales, marketing, R&D, innovation and commercial teams in place. 
And by the end of September, we had business processes in place. Along the way, we've made a good number of promotions from within. 
Our new rituals and routines are already operational in areas such as sales and within our monthly performance reviews in our U.S. Commercial unit. We've taken the best of both approach, with ongoing improvement as we harmonize trading terms and develop joint business plans with our retail customers. 
And importantly, we are well positioned as we look forward to 2016. Our innovation pipeline is ready to be launched, and we'll talk more about that in the coming months. And we expect to continue the progress we've been making in shifting our advertising spend from nonworking to working media. 
Now this may all sound good, and we do feel good about where we are at, but I also understand that the numbers show several challenges. 
During the third quarter in the U.S., while we didn't see anything fall off through the integration, our base business trends remained mixed. Overall, our market share in the United States has been stable, with some increases and declines despite the changes we went through. And across the top 20 or so category, our share is up or flat in roughly 2/3 of those categories. 
From a consumption perspective, the bars on the right of the slide show that our U.S. retail business grew in both Q3 and year-to-date. But what I am most encouraged by is the fact that our base for non-promoted sales are up strongly. 
The investments we made in Heinz Ketchup, Classico Pasta Sauce, Oscar Mayer Selects Natural Cold Cuts, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Coffee and Bagel Bites are driving a solid consumption gain. 
On the innovation front, we're seeing some encouraging momentum. Earlier this year, we made a big bet around Heinz Yellow Mustard. The result was a significant disruption to the mustard category in both the United States and Canada. We were able to achieve high single-digit market share in just 4 months, an unprecedented short amount of time. 
Lunchables Uploaded and our P3 portable snack innovation are also growing strongly into their second years on the market. But in large part, this has been offset by lower volume from ongoing challenges we've had in our Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages, boxed dinners including Mac & Cheese and our Smart Ones frozen meals. These are turnaround opportunities for us, and I look forward to updating you in the coming months on our plans. 
From a profitability perspective, I would note 2 things. One is that our ability to maintain pricing consistent with our cost, it has held up in what has been a high-pressure deflationary environment in some of our key categories. And we feel very good about that. Two is that the cost savings and productivity programs that were in place in the U.S. prior to the merger were all executed and delivered as planned. 
So overall, a good start to our team in the United States, and we know where our opportunities to improve reside. But let me turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail."
278212,315348379,895790,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George. Before I get into our third Q results and the numbers, I'd like to spend some time on Slide 6, discussing our non-GAAP financial metrics. These 3 measures are what we use to evaluate our performance versus our internal plans and what wi",2173,"Thank you, George. Before I get into our third Q results and the numbers, I'd like to spend some time on Slide 6, discussing our non-GAAP financial metrics. These 3 measures are what we use to evaluate our performance versus our internal plans and what will report out to you on a quarterly basis. 
The first one is organic net sales growth. And similar to most companies, we simply exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. 
The second is adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA figures exclude the impact of integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, stock-based comp, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains or losses on the sales of business and non-monetary currency devaluations such as Venezuela, which we recognized in the second Q this year. 
The third measure is adjusted earnings per share. Similar to adjusted EBITDA, for adjusted EPS, we exclude the impact of integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains and losses on the sale of business and non-monetary currency devaluations. So we adjust EPS in much the same way we adjust EBITDA, except that we do not back out the impact of stock-based compensation for adjusted EPS. 
Now a number of you have asked us about and may be surprised by the fact that we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting from our adjusted EPS figures. The reason we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting is that the incremental noncash step-up in costs due to purchase accounting will largely be offset by incremental noncash favorability flowing through our income statement going forward. 
Beginning in Q4, we expect to see a stepped-up benefit from the amortization of prior service credits on our post-retirement benefit plans due to plan changes. 
To give you some numbers, the amortization of prior service credits amounted to $28 million in Q3, driven by 1 month of amortization related to this plan changes. Q4 this year and every quarter thereafter for the next several years, will reflect the 3 months of amortization at the same rate or roughly $325 million annually. 
So with that out of the way, let's turn to our Q3 results, starting with total company results on Slide 7. As you might have seen in this afternoon's earnings release, our GAAP or reported third quarter results are a bit disjoint due to a number of factors, including the fact that there were 5 calendar days of premerger Heinz results, while during the rest of the quarter, we operated as a combined Kraft Heinz business. 
So to keep things simple, my comments today will focus on our pro forma non-GAAP results. On that basis, for the total company in Q3, we saw mix at top line results down 9% due to a 7 percentage point currency headwind, while positive net pricing was offset by lower volume/mix. 
In terms of pricing, our 70 basis point net pricing increase reflected 2 factors: One, net pricing gains in our geographies, including pricing to address higher local input costs in Europe and developing marketing that more than offset our negative impact of approximately 1.5 percentage points related to lower net commodity costs across our big 4 commodities: dairy, meat, coffee and nuts in the U.S. and Canada. 
Volume/mix declined 2.7% as solid growth in Rest of the World segment was offset by lower volumes in ready-to-drink beverage, foodservice, cheese and boxed dinners in the United States and Canada. 
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were both down to an 8.2 percentage point currency headwind at the EBITDA level. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 4.8%, and adjusted EPS would have been up in the mid-single-digit range as well. This reflected ongoing savings from premerger restructuring and productivity initiatives at both Kraft and Heinz and the beginning of the integration sales. 
Two, favorable pricing net of commodity costs and as well as solid volume/mix gains in Europe and Asia-Pacific. 
Adjusted EPS also faced an additional headwind in the form of a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was roughly 30% in Q3 2015 versus roughly 25% in Q3 last year when we had favorability from some discrete tax items on the Kraft side. 
As we move forward, we would expect to see integration-related savings taking on a bigger role, and as I mentioned earlier, we should begin to see the benefit of stepped-up amortization of prior service credits under our postretirement benefit plans coming through beginning in Q4. 
That's the total company. Now let me provide some color on the results and state of business in our 4 reporting segments: the United States, Canada, Europe and Rest of the World. 
In the U.S., we've been focused these past few months on executing a smooth business integration while minimizing disruption, as George talked about. You can see on Slide 8 that in Q3, organic net sales declined 3.7% as gains from pricing were more than offset by a decline in volume/mix versus the prior year period. 
On the pricing front, while net price in the U.S. was up only 20 basis points, this included a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points related to lower commodity costs in our big 4 commodities, primarily dairy and coffee. 
The volume/mix declines were primarily driven by lower volume in 3 areas: ready-to-drink beverage, where we reformulated Capri Sun in an effort to reverse consumption decline but have to raise prices by about 25% to offset the higher cost of enhanced product quality; boxed dinners, where both consumer takeaway and our level of promotional activity were lower than the prior year; and foodservice, where shipments were lower from some lost bids at a couple of key customers. 
Unfortunately, these factors offset some significant gains from product innovation in Lunchables, P3, coffee and cream cheese as well as some trend spending in growth and market share that we're seeing from investments we've made in ketchup, mustard and pasta sauce. 
Pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. grew 1.4%, driven by a combination of favorable pricing net of costs, lower manufacturing costs and lower overhead. And these gains more than offset the impacts of unfavorable volume/mix as well as higher marketing expenses and significantly higher bonus accruals versus Q3 last year. 
On Slide 9, in Canada, our focus on executing a smooth integration has been much the same as the U.S., only that our team north of the border has also been dealing with the pressure of higher local input costs in many of their categories. 
Organic net sales declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven by a 5.2 percentage point decline in volume/mix that was partially offset by a 2.6 percentage point increase from net pricing. 
Positive net pricing reflected price increases to offset higher local input costs, particularly in coffee. But I would point out that total net pricing also included a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point related to lower commodity cost in our big 4 commodity, mainly dairy. 
The volume/mix declines were driven by lower shipments in foodservice as well as the volume pressure caused by price increase in coffee. And these factors more than offset solid growth in pasta sauce and mustard. 
Canada's adjusted EBITDA in constant currency was down 2.4%, as unfavorable volume mix and negative pricing net of higher local input costs more than offset gains from premerger restructuring and productivity efforts as well as the start of integration savings. 
But price net of higher local input cost and the volume/mix decline held back Q3 profit growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Europe on Slide 10. In Europe, our team has been focused on 2 fronts: executing line extensions and premiumization to drive better volume and mix performance, and driving increased efficiencies throughout our business, everything from package size monetization to rightsizing our footprint, and efforts in both these fronts have really been paying off. 
Organic net sales grew 0.5 point, driven by a combination of higher net pricing and positive volume/mix. 
Gains in net pricing reflected a reduction in inefficient promotional spending in our U.K. beans business and strategic pricing in ketchup across a number of markets. That was partially offset by a higher promotional spending to reinvigorate consumption in mayonnaise. 
Positive volume/mix was driven by ketchup and pasta sauce growth across Europe that more than offset volume declines in infant nutrition in Italy and soup in U.K. 
This healthy top line growth was supported by a double-digit increase in marketing investments to support our brands. In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings, combined to deliver cost currency adjusted EBITDA growth of over 20%. 
Finally is Rest of the World on Slide 11, which includes our operations in 3 regions: Asia-Pacific; Latin America; and Russia, India, Middle East and Africa, or what we call RIMEA. 
Here we are focused on profitable top line growth and adapting to local consumer trends and dynamic marketplace in fast-growing emerging markets. 
In the near term, however, foreign exchange trends have been and will likely continue to be a challenge as we pass through pricing to offset higher local input costs. 
In the third quarter, organic net sales grew 7%, driven by a 4% volume/mix gain as well as roughly 3 points of net pricing. 
Net pricing growth was primarily driven by price increases to offset higher local costs in our RIMEA region. 
Volume/mix growth was driven by strength in ABC sauces in Asia, beverage in Indonesia related to Ramadan, frozen potato gains in Mexico and solid ketchup growth in most regions. These gains were partially offset by volume/mix declines in our COMPLAN nutritional beverage business in India as well as Quero pasta sauce in Brazil, where we've been experiencing some recent supply chain disruptions. 
Rest of World adjusted EBITDA declined 29% versus the prior year due to a 43.7 percentage point negative impact from currency, and approximately 25 percentage points of currency impact was due to the Venezuela devaluation that we recognized in Q2 that we are seeing the effect of beginning in this third quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, our Rest of World adjusted EBITDA was up 14.3% driven primarily by gains from cost savings initiatives. 
Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with an update on synergies and our capital structure. I will start with synergies on Slide 12. 
Overall, we remain on track. The best way to frame how we think about our opportunity here is to think about our savings coming from 3 areas: organizational structure, overhead savings and manufacturing footprint. 
Org structure savings tend to come earlier than other areas and are really an enabler to getting after the broader cost savings opportunities. 
Overhead savings are non-people-related and really driven by our ZBB system. 
The third piece, manufacturing footprint, tends to take the longest, as there is literally a lot of heavy lifting involved. 
To date, we have announced 2 major cost-savings actions. In August, we made a difficult but necessary decision to develop a new streamlined structure for our business in the U.S. and Canada zones. This resulted in a reduction of 2,500 salary and contractual positions across the U.S. and Canada and will represent the bulk of our org structure savings. 
And yesterday, Bernardo talked about we announced the consolidation of our manufacturing across Kraft Heinz North America supply chain network. This critical step in our integration plan will take up to 2 years to complete. It will eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies, making us more competitive and improving our ability to drive profitable growth for many years to come. 
On the numbers side, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our initial financial expectations for the merger. This includes our aggressive cost savings target of $1.5 billion, which we now expect to deliver full in 2017. And as we validated and updated our plans, the cash cost to achieve those savings is consistent with our initial expectations, consisting of approximately $1.1 billion of upfront cash costs and roughly $1.1 billion of CapEx for footprint optimization over the next few years. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'm also pleased to share with you today that Kraft Heinz Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.575 per common share. That's a 4.5 percentage increase versus the prior $0.55 per share and consistent with Kraft's historical practice and the commitment we made at the time of the merger announcement to grow our dividend per share over time. We are excited to offer this increase so soon after the merger, and we'll continue to remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value. 
Importantly, we remain confident that we will be able to maintain our policy over time, while at the same time remaining an investment-grade company and delivering against our goal to reduce leverage to less than 3x adjusted EBITDA over the medium term. 
I will now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our discussion."

So in a sense, it's coming to a point that now I'm investing more, and you're going to see not an expansion of margin in that sense but more sales coming through more investment. In a retail environment that you're right also to say that's extremely challenged. But in order to be in that position, first of all, we need to have the Big Bet ideas on innovation that I think our pipeline not only in Europe, but also in United States, Canada and other places, are quite robust, what makes me optimistic when I see 2017, '18 and beyond. And we need to be in a position of efficiency that you say, hey, that is the right plateau you need to have so you can come and invest big to win not only on the sales piece but expanding segments and product lines within the environment we're facing in Europe. So commercially, you can expect more investment in marketing and selling in Europe as we continue to expand our product line in the region. Paulo, do you want to comment on the margin?"
