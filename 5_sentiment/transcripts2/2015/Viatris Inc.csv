Mylan is off to a phenomenal start this year. Our announcement this past Friday is a great example. Having successfully completed our acquisition of Abbott's non-U.S. developed markets, specialty and branded generics business, we now are beginning our next exciting chapter of growth. As we've been stating all along, this is absolutely then next right strategic transaction for Mylan and nearly doubles our size in our top 10 markets outside the United States, further expands and diversifies our product portfolio and customer base and gives us significant financial flexibility to aggressively pursue opportunities that make strategic and financial sense for the company. We expect the transaction to be approximately $0.20 accretive to EPS in 2015, $0.25 in the first full year and to increase thereafter through 2018. We also expect to maintain double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth rates through 2018. In addition, we see our tax rate declining to approximately 20% to 21% during the first full year and then falling into the high teens their after. 
Anticipating all of these benefits, we began planning with Abbott leadership as soon as we announced the deal back in July so as to lay the groundwork for what we believe will be a very smooth integration now that the transaction has closed. I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's Board of Directors and senior leaders to welcome Abbott's EPD employees to the Mylan family. We very much look forward to the contributions they'll make us eat take up our cause of delivery better health for a better world. 
As we take a moment and look back at 2014, we again delivered strong financial performance by leveraging the diversity and breadth of our global platform, maintaining our relentless focus on disciplined execution and seizing opportunities whenever and wherever they arose. Sales for the year totaled $7.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 13% compared to 2013. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $3.56, an increase of 23% compared to our prior year performance. Every one of our business segments contributed to this growth, with our North America and rest of world generics regions and our Specialty segment delivering double-digit revenue increases. In addition, EpiPen became our first product to generate $1 billion in annual sales. 
Our employees around the world deserve the credit for these great results. On behalf of our board and senior leaders, I'd like to thank them for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our cause. Their commitment will serve us well in 2015, which we believe will be yet another very strong year for the company. 
Specifically, we anticipate revenue growth of 33% and EPS growth of 21% both on a constant currency basis. In addition, we continue to see opportunities to accelerate our 2018 target of at least $6 in adjusted EPS. As I mentioned in 2014 at the EpiPen became our first product to reach $1 billion in annual sales. We're proud to have reached this milestone and note that we achieved it by growing the franchise at a compound annual growth of nearly 30% since '08, a reflection of the product's tremendous brand equity. As I've often reiterated, we have continued to expand the epinephrine market in unconventional ways, specifically by focusing on education, awareness and access. EpiPen for schools program is a great example, as is our advocacy on the regulatory front with 48 states now allowing undesignated epinephrine auto injectors in schools. 
Our assumptions around EpiPen for 2015 incorporate that we already participate in a highly competitive, multiplayer epinephrine marketplace and that we are operating in a very aggressive payer environment. And while we continue to believe that the regulatory barrier to entry for an AB rated generic EpiPen remains high, we also are factoring the impact of an AB rated competition into our guidance in the second half of the year. That said, we continue to invest in product innovation and geographic expansion as well as new formulations. We also continued to pursue our unconventional approach to growing this franchise. It focuses on shaping legislation to continue to expand access for consumers and other public entities, generating awareness about severe allergies, providing education to help those at risk take control and continually looking for ways to enhance consumer's experience. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

As you have heard, 2014 was another very strong year for Mylan, strategically, operationally and financially. We saw double-digit growth in our business, including 21% growth in specialty, 18% in rest of world 12% in North America and that 3% growth in Europe, which includes absorbing 4% to 5% of price erosion. 
Our strong performance in North America was particularly noteworthy as it comes despite us not being able to get certain key approvals due to continued regulatory delays at FDA. We believe that FDA has made some good progress implementing to do [indiscernible] program went into effect in October of 2012. The agency has increased its inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturers, although the median review time for ANDAs is standing at about 42 months. Nevertheless, we remain confident that over the long run, a properly resourced and transformed FDA will yield substantial benefits in the U.S. and beyond in the form of improved safety access and transparency. I would also note that Mylan received more FDA approvals in 2014 than any other company, including 6 first to  file, all of which have fueled our strong financial performance during the year. In addition we have more ANDAs pending approval than anyone in our industry. 283 in last week, including 44 pending first-to-file opportunities. 
As you know, at Mylan, we are never standing still and we have started off 2015 with the announcement of several additional complementary transactions that will further enhance our existing platform. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire certain [indiscernible] healthy business from Famy Care, which is the world's largest producer of generic oral contraceptive products. This acquisition will provide Mylan with an enhanced and now vertically integrated platform to accelerate our growth in the global women's health care space. Famy Care will bring us 4 high-quality manufacturing facilities in India, 2 of which have been approved by FDA and the European health authorities. They have one of the lowest cost and largest manufacturing footprints dedicated to oral contraceptive products and will bring Mylan's strong capabilities in OCP cycles, injectables, IUDs and tubal rings. On the commercial front, this acquisition was built on Mylan's existing partnerships with Famy Care in North America, Europe and Australia and will also make Mylan a hormonal contraceptive leader in high-growth emerging markets around the world. This transaction also complements the business acquired from Abbott, which includes the women's health care portfolio and sales and marketing capabilities. 
The purchase price represents a mid-teen EBITDA multiple on a forward basis on a high growth and profitable business. Looking ahead, we are anticipating annual EBITDA growth in excess of 25% over the next several years. Net acquisitions is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan's adjusted diluted EPS upon closing, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2015 subject to regulatory approvals and certain terms and conditions. We also recently announced a partnership with [indiscernible] biopharma on the development and commercialization of GD 4208 in novel investigational once daily nebulized drug acting muscarinic antagonist for COPD and other regulatory diseases. GD 4208 has shown positive top line results in COPD patients in multiple Phase II studies, and FDA recently agreed to design the Phase III program, which is anticipated to open this year. We believe GD 4208 has the potential to be the only FDA approved once-daily single agent nebulized product for COPD, and it may offer longer-term opportunities for a combination with other nebulized products. 
In addition, the patent portfolio GD-4208 is greatly extracted to provide exclusivity in the U.S. until at least 2025, which doesn't include any potential patent term extensions. In addition to the geographical portfolio expansion, we continue to make significant progress across all of other our key growth drivers. Continuing with respiratory, we are formally developing our presence in this space both through external [indiscernible] such as [indiscernible] and the internal development program.
Our Phase III clinical trials for generic Advair are progressing well, and we anticipate filing our application with FDA at the end of this year. We continue to believe that Mylan will be the first to bring to market an AB rated substitutable generic form of Advair in the U.S. We are in the process of giving final shape to our manufacturing in order to be positioned to handle the appropriate capacity upon launch. We also anticipate 2 European respiratory launches in 2015, generic Seretide MDI and Generic [indiscernible] MDI. Within last 2 complex, we continue to advance our insulin analog program. We commenced 2 Phase III trials for [indiscernible] which are progressing well. We continue to pursue the opportunity to have one of the first interchangeable insulin and a large [indiscernible]. We also have made significant progress in terms of manufacturing readiness. 
On the Copaxone front, as we told you last quarter, we have responded to all FDA requests to date in terms of our ANDA, and we remain confident that we are well positioned to receive approval for our application and be in a position to launch at market formation. On the legal front, the U.S. Supreme Court did not address that inability of the last remaining patent, and we believe that the front and validity ruling will be confirmed by the Federal Circuit. We are pleased with the Federal Circuit's excellent briefing schedule. From a guidance perspective, we are taking a collaborative approach and assuming launch in the second half of 2015. We also continue to advance our biosimilars program. We've strategically slated our portfolio with a primary focus on monoclonal antibodies. We are aggressively executing on the development of this global pipeline, which currently includes 6 products. We expect CFD's programs to be in Phase III in 2015. 
As we have noted before, we expect to launch these products initially in the Europe and rest of the world markets. As you know, we launched in the world first [indiscernible] biosimilar in India in 2014 and we have submitted this product in 15 more countries. We also continue to expand our injectable business, and today, we operate global portfolio of more than 230 injectable products in a broad range of dosage forms. We continue to take steps to integrate the Agila business and ensure its position as a high-quality reliable source of injectables for the long term. Hence, we are taking all steps in the Phase III to ensure that Mylan's one quality standard is deeply embedded across the Agila's manufacturing sites. While we may continue to have some issues as we implement our remediation efforts, we are confident that a deliberate [indiscernible] approach to ensure a sustainable consular compliance is the right way to capitalize on our Agila investment.
Turning to our infectious disease growth driver. During the fourth quarter, 2 of the 3 largest biosimilars antiretrovirals, the Global Fund and the [indiscernible] of South Africa completed 3-year tenure, and Mylan won a leading share in both cases. Today, we supply more than 40% of ARV volume in 12 [indiscernible] market and provide access to high-quality ARV treatments to more than 5 million patients each year. In addition, we continue to expand our infectious disease business beyond ARVs, signing several agreements with Gilead for the distribution of hepatitis C treatments. We were recently appointed an exclusive partner for the launch of Sovaldi and how many brands in India, and we expanded our nonexclusive rights to Sovaldi and Harvoni in 91 development countries. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will walk you through our financial performance in greater detail. Thanks."

I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures and I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call rega",1412,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures and I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures. Starting on Slide 16. As you can see, our total revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 experienced double-digit constant currency growth. We are very proud of the commercial performances of each of our businesses and regions in 2014.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a very strong 54%, up nearly 300 basis points from the same prior-year period. Our adjusted gross margin for the full year was 52%, up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year. Our strong gross margins are primarily the result of new product introductions in North America as well as a positive pricing environment and the growth in sales of EpiPen auto-injector. Importantly, 2014 represented the sixth consecutive year of gross margin growth that has resulted in our gross margins increasing from the mid-40% range to well over 50%. 
During 2014, our gross debt outstanding decreased slightly from the prior year, and with the purchase of Abbott, completed on a debt free basis, we have ample financial flexibility going into 2015. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates as the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was below 4% in 2014. Additionally, to further enhance our capital structure, during the fourth quarter, we redeemed our 2018 high-yield senior notes by issuing a term loan at substantially lower interest rate and extended our revolving credit facility on enhanced terms.
Turning to Slide 17. 2014 continued a 6-year period of exceptional growth in our business. As we look forward to 2015, we are very pleased with our consistent, double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS, all which demonstrate our unwavering commitment to achieving our target and enhancing shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to now discuss our expectations for 2015, which are laid out on Slide 18. At the bottom line, we are projecting an increase and our constant currency, adjusted diluted EPS guidance of 21% based upon the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. Our EPS guidance is after absorbing $0.15 per share of FX headwind on the combined business. This EPS guidance range is based upon the following income statement line item guidance metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis with the exception of total revenues. Total revenues are projected to be between $9.6 billion and $10.1 billion, the midpoint of which, on a constant currency basis, is an increase of 33% from the 2014 total revenues. Our generics business is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 40% in 2015, which includes revenues from acquisitions of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. Specialty revenue is expected to be flat as we have assumed generic competition for EpiPen in the second half of 2015. With the recently completed Abbott transaction and the pending Famy Care acquisition, we continue to diversify our business, both in terms of our portfolio and geographically. Following completion of these transactions, slightly more than 50% of our revenues will come from North America, about 1/3 will come from Europe and the balance will come from rest of world. I'll speak enough -- further in a few minutes on the drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth.
Gross margins will increase again to be between 53% and 55%, the midpoint of which is approximately 200 basis points higher than 2014. Drivers of the increase include new product revenues and the strength of our North American generics business as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix. Our gross margins are being further enhanced by the Abbott assets acquired combined with the efficiencies of our global platform.
SG&A will be between 19% and 21% of total revenue, a slight increase from the prior year due to the inclusion of the business acquired from Abbott, and R&D will be between 6.5% and 7.5% of total revenue as we continue to invest in our future. With these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion. Also, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21%, the midpoint of which is a 500 basis points decline from our adjusted effective tax rate in 2014 of 25%, which is attributable to our enhanced global tax structure and improved competitive positioning from the closing of the Abbott transaction.
Based upon 2015 guidance metrics for operating cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and capital expenditures between $400 million and $500 million, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion with the midpoint of $1.25 billion, a 41% increase from the prior year.
Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 495 million and 500 million shares utilizing and assume average full year sha reprice of approximately $60, which includes the impact of the shares issued in conjunction with the Abbott transaction. As a reminder, under our cash convertible notes we have approximately 43 million warrants outstanding with the majority of the warrants having a strike price of $30. We have assumed dilution from these warrants to be approximately 20 million to 22 million shares for 2015.
Turning to Slide 19, you will see a reminder of some of the key assumptions utilized in the 2015 guidance. Specifically, we have factored in the strength of the U.S. dollar and the expected foreign currency impact for 2015. Included in our earnings release is a table of assumed earned exchange rates used to in developing our 2015 financial guidance. The 2015 guidance includes the contribution from the Abbott EPD business from the day of close as well as the inclusion of Famy Care beginning in the second half of 2015.
Slide 20 provides further details regarding our revenue growth in 2015. We expect the legacy Mylan business to contribute approximately $700 million to $900 million of incremental revenue in 2015. Revenue from new product launches as well as volume growth in our base business will serve to offset single-digit price erosion under existing products. In terms of base pricing assumptions in the Generics segment, as we traditionally have, we've assumed low single-digit price erosion in North America. Further, we have assumed mid-single-digit price erosion in rest of world and mid to high single-digit price erosion in Europe. We expect revenue from acquisitions, principally the established products business we acquired from Abbott, to contribute approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of incremental revenue in 2015. The year-over-year negative impact of foreign currency translation, including the impact from the acquired businesses, is expected to be approximately $300 million to $400 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Slide 21 shows the projected bridge between our actual 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56 and the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range of $4.15, an increase of 17%. New product launches and revenue from acquisitions will drive our earnings growth in 2015. We expect our Q1 EPS to be in line with the prior year with each of the following 3 quarters EPS being higher than the prior year. We expect the third quarter EPS to, once again, be the strongest quarter in terms of earnings. Our second quarter EPS is expected to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter due to the anticipated timing of new product launches.
Turning to Slide 22. At the end of 2014, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.8:1, down considerably from our leverage ratio of 3.5:1 at the end of 2013. With the closing of the Abbott transaction, our balance sheet becomes even stronger as our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio now stands at approximately 2.3:1. We now benefit from a competitive global tax structure that strengthens our financial position and help to accelerate future growth. We remain committed to our stated M&A parameters and our long-term gross leverage targets an investment grade levels.
To summarize, our fourth quarter provided a very strong finish to 2014 and is a testament to the strength and diversity of Mylan. We look forward to doing more of the same in 2015 and beyond. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

As I have stated now for quite a while as expectations around our product innovation and life cycle, yes I've tried to maintain and reiterate the fact that we've grown the market in a very unconventional way around I think first",631,"So I'll start with EpiPen. As I have stated now for quite a while as expectations around our product innovation and life cycle, yes I've tried to maintain and reiterate the fact that we've grown the market in a very unconventional way around I think first the underlying fundamental strength of the brand equity, but what became obvious to us is that there was the lack of awareness and education and, quite frankly, just the ability to have access to EpiPen was quite low. So as we did EpiPen for schools for instance to allow undesignated EpiPens in schools and we are now continuing to take that into other public entities that I have said it has grown in unconventional ways. We wouldn't be looking at your traditional life cycle management brand product switches that we believe that are -- the EpiPen as not only brand equity but as well as the comfort and the ease of use after over 25 years of being on the market. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are absolutely continuing to look at product innovation and geographic expansion as well as new formulations, and you will continue to see us come out with some of those things so those features, but as it relates to brand-new products or a new device, our EpiPen and the brand equity around with is what will remain a mainstay in the U.S. market. As far as our assumptions, Ronny, also as we reiterated, as we continue to diversify ourselves and have many levers to pull on to manage this business, it makes each individual lever that less material. So I think what you should know and take comfort in, especially given our track record, that we've said that we've incorporated the multiplayer environment, the competitiveness of that, the reimbursement, the payer reimbursement and how we're seeing those dynamics continue to play out as well as and AB rated in the second half of the year. So I think we've taken a very balanced conservative approach around our assumption with EpiPen. I think we think it will continue to be a great product for us into the future kind of regardless of these near-term dynamics. So that would be on EpiPen. As far as Abbott, obviously, we had said a couple of things, that from a strategic and complementary perspective, it doubled the size of our top 10 markets outside of the U.S. and many of those -- most of those being in Europe. So to be able to take that business now and really leverage the physician channel as well as the pharmacy channel is by in our hands with the enhanced focus and investment behind it we can do more. And I think as you look at the portfolios and the complementary nature of where we could enhance from a physician call point and that branded generic model as well as enhance the scale and our breadth of our product portfolio to the pharmacy, we're going to be able to continue to leverage that franchise. And as we get into more granularity just as far as those product opportunities, I would say again, it's not about a product. It's much more about the therapeutic areas and the franchise and the breadth of that. If you look across cardiovascular and GI, some of the places that Abbott EPD, their strength has [indiscernible] and marries that very well and the breadth that we can bring on that. So I think in these coming months, after integration, we'll continue to keep you guys updated as we are successfully integrated the businesses, and as far as the reporting perspective, it will be absorbed in our Generics segment throughout our divisions between North America, Europe and rest of world."

There are still therapeutic categories that we recently bolstered our injectable to really put us in the ability to have a leadership position in injectable.

I want to tell you that we're looking at everything, actively pursuing, as I said, as you can imagine standing still is not in our DNA.

So we are truly looking that we could add, we believe, significantly both from a strategic perspective as well as the financial perspective here in the near term. As far as respiratory, I'll touch on that, and I will let Rajiv add to it. But obviously, we've continued to look at -- if you think of this in kind of a couple of buckets from a nice perspective, really our enhancement around COPD, our experience, our infrastructure, our relationships in that market, we believe, continued to put us, as you know, a very great partner in that space and I think that is something that we will continue to build readership on. When you think about whether it's our generic Advair and some of the other opportunities that franchise when we acquired it from Pfizer do really give us an opportunity to take some of these more complex, very difficult to manufacture products that have, we believe, a high barrier to entry to let us participate in these marketplaces. And as far as our go-to-market strategy, I think that continues to evolve, I think from the marketplace here in the U.S. throughout Europe that, that continues to evolve and the good news is, given how our scale whether across physician, hospital or retail, we're really going to be able to maximize those products at the time they come to market."

We have stated, I think that EpiPen is a very atypical product, and I believe a couple of things. Not only just from a brand equity perspective but as we've mentioned, the comfort and the familiarity of the use of that product and potentially life threatening situations, and we believe that, that's what put the very high barrier -- bar to an AB rated in the first place. But if an AB rated were to get approved, we also believe you would not see the typical conversion that you do around an oral solid product. And with that being said we've seen oral solid products, as you may know, whether it's a levothyroxine or a Dilantin, there are some products out there that people feel very secure about the product that they're on and we're just changing them for whether it's narrow therapeutic. So as you can imagine, none of those of fall into the category of having seconds count when you could be in a potential life-threatening situation. So we believe patient familiarity use and comfort with the product now that it has been in the market for over 25 years that there would not be a typical generic curve, but like I said, with that being said that we've taken a conservative approach and modeled a be competition in. But like I said, I think EpiPen will be a very important brand for us for many years to come. As far as x U.S. pricing goes, especially around in Europe, this year, this past year, we continued to see volume be able to overcome the price erosion that we did see, which is, as we still saw growth in that region despite the price erosion, and we have factored in middle single-digit erosion going forward. So with that being said, we're still seeing anticipating double-digit growth across all of our generic business segments next year. As far as Lidoderm is concerned, look, I put my crystal ball away last year because I would've said we absolutely were in a ready position to have that approval. As you know there's been a lot with GDUFA and the FDA's restructuring and there's been some very important first product market formation products that haven't been approved yet, and we consider Lidoderm to be one that's important. We certainly believe that hope to get an approval here soon, but with that being said, it's really kind of immaterial to any particular contribution because we've again anticipated and absorbed all of that in a range that we've given for 2015.

During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements relate to, among other matters, the acquisition of -- by Mylan N.V. of both Mylan Inc. and Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the Abbott business, our and Mylan N.V.'s expected or targeted future financial and operating performance, results, metrics and plans and expectations related thereto, the inability to obtain regulatory approvals and planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products. Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the transaction with Abbott; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of the Abbott business by Mylan being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating costs, customer loss and business disruptions being greater than expected following the transaction with Abbott; the impact of competition; situations where we or Mylan N.V. manufacture, market and/or sell products not withstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our or Mylan N.V.'s ability to bring new products to market; those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release and the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013, as updated by our Form 8-K filed on August 6, 2014, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2014, as well as our other filings with the SEC.

Mylan is off to a phenomenal start this year. Our announcement this past Friday is a great example. Having successfully completed our acquisition of Abbott's non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, we now are beginning our next exciting chapter of growth. As we've been stating all along, this is absolutely the next right strategic transaction for Mylan and nearly doubles our size in our top 10 markets outside the United States, further expands and diversifies our product portfolio and customer base and gives us significant financial flexibility to aggressively pursue opportunities that make strategic and financial sense for the company. We expect the transaction to be approximately $0.20 accretive to EPS in 2015, $0.25 in the first full year and to increase thereafter through 2018. We also expect to maintain double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth rates through 2018. In addition, we see our tax rate declining to approximately 20% to 21% during the first full year and then falling into the high teens thereafter.
Anticipating all of these benefits, we began planning with Abbott leadership as soon as we announced the deal back in July so as to lay the groundwork for what we believe will be a very smooth integration now that the transaction has closed. I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's Board of Directors and senior leaders to welcome Abbott's EPD employees to the Mylan family. We very much look forward to the contributions they'll make as they take up our cause of delivering better health for a better world.
As we take a moment and look back at 2014, we again delivered strong financial performance by leveraging the diversity and breadth of our global platform, maintaining our relentless focus on disciplined execution and seizing opportunities whenever and wherever they arose. Sales for the year totaled $7.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 13% compared to 2013. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $3.56, an increase of 23% compared to our prior year performance. Every one of our business segments contributed to this growth, with our North America and rest of world generics regions and our Specialty segment delivering double-digit revenue increases. In addition, EpiPen became our first product to generate $1 billion in annual sales.
Our employees around the world deserve the credit for these great results. On behalf of our board and senior leaders, I'd like to thank them for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our cause. Their commitment will serve us well in 2015, which we believe will be yet another very strong year for the company.
Specifically, we anticipate revenue growth of 33% and EPS growth of 21% both on a constant currency basis. In addition, we continue to see opportunities to accelerate our 2018 target of at least $6 in adjusted EPS. As I mentioned, in 2014, EpiPen became our first product to reach $1 billion in annual sales. We're proud to have reached this milestone and note that we achieved it by growing the franchise at a compound annual clip of nearly 30% since '08, a reflection of the product's tremendous brand equity. As I've often reiterated, we have continued to expand the epinephrine market in unconventional ways, specifically by focusing on education, awareness and access. Our EpiPen for schools program is a great example, as is our advocacy on the regulatory front, with 48 states now allowing undesignated epinephrine auto injectors in schools.
Our assumptions around EpiPen for 2015 incorporate that we already participate in a highly competitive, multiplayer epinephrine marketplace and that we are operating in a very aggressive payer environment. And while we continue to believe that the regulatory barrier to entry for an AB-rated generic EpiPen remains high, we also are factoring the impact of an AB-rated competition into our guidance in the second half of the year. That said, we continue to invest in product innovation and geographic expansion as well as new formulations. We also continue to pursue our unconventional approach to growing this franchise. It focuses on shaping legislation to continue to expand access for consumers and other public entities, generating awareness about severe allergies, providing education to help those at risk take control and continually looking for ways to enhance consumers' experience. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

As you have heard, 2014 was another very strong year for Mylan, strategically, operationally and financially. We saw double-digit growth in our business, including 21% growth in specialty, 18% in rest of world, 12% in North America, as well as 3% growth in Europe, which includes absorbing 4% to 5% of price erosion.
Our strong performance in North America was particularly noteworthy as it comes despite us not being able to get certain key approvals due to continued regulatory delays at FDA. We believe that FDA has made some good progress implementing to do first instance [ph] program went into effect in October of 2012. The agency has increased its inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturers, although the median review time for ANDAs is standing at about 42 months. Nevertheless, we remain confident that over the long run, a properly resourced and transformed FDA will yield substantial benefits in the U.S. and beyond in the form of improved safety access and transparency. I would also note that Mylan received more FDA approvals in 2014 than any other company, including 6 first to file, all of which helped fuel our strong financial performance during the year. In addition we have more ANDAs pending approval than anyone in our industry. 283 to be specific, including 44 pending first-to-file opportunities.
As you know, at Mylan, we are never standing still and we have started off 2015 with the announcement of several additional complementary transactions that will further enhance our existing platform. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire certain female health care businesses from Famy Care, which is the world's largest producer of generic oral contraceptive products. This acquisition will provide Mylan with an enhanced and now vertically integrated platform to accelerate our growth in the global women's health care space. Famy Care will bring us 4 high-quality manufacturing facilities in India, 2 of which have been approved by FDA and the European health authorities. They have one of the lowest cost and largest manufacturing footprints dedicated to oral contraceptive products and will bring Mylan's strong capabilities in OCP cycles, injectables, IUDs and tubal rings. On the commercial front, this acquisition was built on Mylan's existing partnerships with Famy Care in North America, Europe and Australia, and will also make Mylan a hormonal contraceptive leader in high-growth emerging markets around the world. This transaction also complements the business acquired from Abbott, which includes a women's health care portfolio and sales and marketing capabilities.
The purchase price represents a mid-teen EBITDA multiple on a forward basis on a high growth and profitable business. Looking ahead, we are anticipating annual EBITDA growth in excess of 25% over the next several years. Net acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan's adjusted diluted EPS upon closing, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2015 subject to regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions. We also recently announced a partnership with Theravance Biopharma on the development and commercialization of TD-4208 in novel investigational once daily nebulized, long-acting muscarinic antagonist for COPD and other respiratory diseases. TD-4208 has shown positive top line results in COPD patients in multiple Phase II studies, and FDA recently agreed to design of the Phase III program, which is anticipated to begin this year. We believe TD-4208 has the potential to be the only FDA-approved once-daily single agent nebulized product for COPD, and it may offer longer-term opportunities for a combination with other nebulized products.
In addition, the patent portfolio for TD-4208 is currently extracted to provide exclusivity in the U.S. until at least 2025, which doesn't include any potential patent term extensions. In addition to the geographical portfolio expansion, we continue to make significant progress across all of other our key growth drivers. Continuing with respiratory, we are formally developing our presence in this space both through external activities such as Theravance and the internal development program.
Our Phase III clinical trials for generic Advair are progressing well, and we anticipate filing our application with FDA at the end of this year. We continue to believe that Mylan will be the first to bring to market an AB-rated substitutable generic form of Advair in the U.S. We are in the process of giving final shape to our manufacturing in order to be positioned to handle the appropriate capacity upon launch. We also anticipate 2 European respiratory launches in 2015, generic Seretide MDI and generic Flixotide MDI. With regards to complex products, we continue to advance our insulin analog program. We commenced 2 Phase III trials for Glargine, which are progressing well. We continue to pursue the opportunity to have one of the first interchangeable insulin analog to Lantus. We also have made significant progress in terms of manufacturing readiness.
On the Copaxone front, as we told you last quarter, we have responded to all FDA requests to date in terms of our ANDA, and we remain confident that we are well positioned to receive approval for our application and be in a position to launch at market formation. On the legal front, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision did not address the invalidity of the last remaining patent, and we believe that the first [ph] invalidity ruling will be confirmed by the Federal Circuit. We are pleased with the Federal Circuit's accelerated briefing schedule. From a guidance perspective, we are taking a conservative approach and assuming launch in the second half of 2015. We also continue to advance our biosimilars program. We've strategically selected our portfolio with a primary focus on monoclonal antibodies. We are aggressively executing on the development of this global pipeline, which currently includes 6 products. We expect 3 of these programs to be in Phase III in 2015.
As we have noted before, we expect to launch these products initially into Europe and rest of the world markets. As you know, we launched the world's first trastuzumab biosimilar in India in 2014, and we have now submitted this product in 15 more countries. We also continue to expand our injectable business, and today, we offer a global portfolio of more than 230 injectable products in a broad range of dosage forms. We continue to take steps to integrate the Agila business and ensure its position as a high-quality reliable source of injectables for the long term. Hence, we are taking all steps necessary to ensure that Mylan's one quality standard is deeply embedded across the Agila's manufacturing sites. While we may continue to have some issues as we implement our remediation efforts, we are confident that a deliberate, thorough approach to ensure a sustainable culture of compliance is the right way to capitalize on our Agila investment.
Turning to our infectious disease growth driver. During the fourth quarter, 2 of the 3 largest buyers of antiretrovirals, the Global Fund and the government of South Africa completed 3-year tenders, and Mylan won a leading share in both cases. Today, we supply more than 40% of ARV volume in wealthy markets and provide access to high-quality ARV treatments to more than 5 million patients each year. In addition, we continue to expand our infectious disease business beyond ARVs, signing several agreements with Gilead for the distribution of hepatitis C treatments. We were recently appointed as exclusive partner for the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni brands in India, and we expanded our nonexclusive rights to Sovaldi and Harvoni in 91 developing countries. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will walk you through our financial performance in greater detail. Thanks."

I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures, and I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures. Starting on Slide 16. As you can see, our total revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 experienced double-digit constant currency growth. We are very proud of the commercial performances of each of our businesses and regions in 2014.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a very strong 54%, up nearly 300 basis points from the same prior-year period. Our adjusted gross margin for the full year was 52%, up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year. Our strong gross margins are primarily the result of new product introductions in North America as well as a positive pricing environment and growth in sales of EpiPen auto-injector. Importantly, 2014 represented the sixth consecutive year of gross margin growth that has resulted in our gross margins increasing from the mid-40% range to well over 50%.
During 2014, our gross debt outstanding decreased slightly from the prior year, and with the purchase of Abbott, completed on a debt-free basis, we have ample financial flexibility going into 2015. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates as the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was below 4% in 2014. Additionally, to further enhance our capital structure, during the fourth quarter, we redeemed our 2018 high-yield senior notes by issuing a term loan at substantially lower interest rate and extended our revolving credit facility on enhanced terms.
Turning to Slide 17. 2014 continued a 6-year period of exceptional growth in our business. As we look forward to 2015, we are very pleased with our consistent double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS, all of which demonstrate our unwavering commitment to achieving our target and enhancing shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to now discuss our expectations for 2015, which are laid out on Slide 18. At the bottom line, we are projecting an increase in our constant currency adjusted diluted EPS guidance of 21% based upon the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. Our EPS guidance is after absorbing $0.15 per share of FX headwind on the combined business. This EPS guidance range is based upon the following income statement line item guidance metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis with the exception of total revenues. Total revenues are projected to be between $9.6 billion and $10.1 billion, the midpoint of which, on a constant currency basis, is an increase of 33% from the 2014 total revenues. Our generics business is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 40% in 2015, which includes revenues from acquisitions of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. Specialty revenue is expected to be flat as we have assumed generic competition for EpiPen in the second half of 2015. With the recently completed Abbott transaction and the pending Famy Care acquisition, we continue to diversify our business, both in terms of our portfolio and geographically. Following completion of these transactions, slightly more than 50% of our revenues will come from North America, about 1/3 will come from Europe and the balance will come from rest of world. I'll speak in a few -- further in a few minutes on the drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth.
Gross margins will increase again to be between 53% and 55%, the midpoint of which is approximately 200 basis points higher than 2014. Drivers of the increase include new product revenues and the strength of our North American generics business as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix. Our gross margins are being further enhanced by the Abbott assets acquired combined with the efficiencies of our global platform.
SG&A will be between 19% and 21% of total revenue, a slight increase from the prior year due to the inclusion of the business acquired from Abbott, and R&D will be between 6.5% and 7.5% of total revenue as we continue to invest in our future. With these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion. Also, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21%, the midpoint of which is a 500 basis point decline from our adjusted effective tax rate in 2014 of 25%, which is attributable to our enhanced global tax structure and improved competitive positioning from the closing of the Abbott transaction.
Based upon 2015 guidance metrics for operating cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and capital expenditures between $400 million and $500 million, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion with the midpoint of $1.25 billion, a 41% increase from the prior year.
Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 495 million and 500 million shares, utilizing an assumed average full year share price of approximately $60, which includes the impact of the shares issued in conjunction with the Abbott transaction. As a reminder, under our cash convertible notes, we have approximately 43 million warrants outstanding, with the majority of the warrants having a strike price of $30. We have assumed dilution from these warrants to be approximately 20 million to 22 million shares for 2015.
Turning to Slide 19, you will see a reminder of some of the key assumptions utilized in the 2015 guidance. Specifically, we have factored in the strength of the U.S. dollar and the expected foreign currency impact for 2015. Included in our earnings release is a table of assumed foreign exchange rates used in developing our 2015 financial guidance. The 2015 guidance includes the contribution from the Abbott EPD business from the date of close as well as the inclusion of Famy Care beginning in the second half of 2015.
Slide 20 provides further details regarding our revenue growth in 2015. We expect the legacy Mylan business to contribute approximately $700 million to $900 million of incremental revenue in 2015. Revenue from new product launches as well as volume growth in our base business will serve to offset single-digit price erosion under existing products. In terms of base pricing assumptions, in the Generics segment, as we traditionally have, we've assumed low single-digit price erosion in North America. Further, we have assumed mid-single-digit price erosion in rest of world and mid to high single-digit price erosion in Europe. We expect revenue from acquisitions, principally the established products business we acquired from Abbott, to contribute approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of incremental revenue in 2015. The year-over-year negative impact of foreign currency translation, including the impact from the acquired businesses, is expected to be approximately $300 million to $400 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Slide 21 shows the projected bridge between our actual 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56 and the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range of $4.15, an increase of 17%. New product launches and revenue from acquisitions will drive our earnings growth in 2015. We expect our Q1 EPS to be in line with the prior year, with each of the following 3 quarters' EPS being higher than the prior year. We expect the third quarter EPS to, once again, be the strongest quarter in terms of earnings. Our second quarter EPS is expected to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter due to the anticipated timing of new product launches.
Turning to Slide 22. At the end of 2014, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.8:1, down considerably from our leverage ratio of 3.5:1 at the end of 2013. With the closing of the Abbott transaction, our balance sheet becomes even stronger as our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio now stands at approximately 2.3:1. We now benefit from a competitive global tax structure that strengthens our financial position and will help to accelerate future growth. We remain committed to our stated M&A parameters and our long-term gross leverage targets at investment grade levels.
To summarize, our fourth quarter provided a very strong finish to 2014 and is a testament to the strength and diversity of Mylan. We look forward to doing more of the same in 2015 and beyond. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

So I'll start with EpiPen. As I have stated now for quite a while as expectations around our product innovation and life cycle, yes, I've tried to maintain and reiterate the fact that we've grown the market in a very unconventional way around, I think, first, the underlying fundamental strength of the brand equity. But what became obvious to us is that there was the lack of awareness and education and, quite frankly, just the ability to have access to EpiPen was quite low. So as we did EpiPen for schools for instance to allow undesignated EpiPens in schools and we now are continuing to take that into other public entities, that I have said while it has grown in unconventional ways, we wouldn't be looking at your traditional life cycle management brand product switches that we believe that are -- the EpiPen has not only brand equity but as well as the comfort and the ease of use after over 25 years of being on the market. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are absolutely continuing to look at product innovation and geographic expansion as well as new formulations, and you will continue to see us come out with some of those things, those features, but as it relates to a brand-new product or a new device, our EpiPen and the brand equity around it is what will remain our mainstay in the U.S. market. As far as our assumptions, Ronny, also as we reiterated, as we continue to diversify ourselves and have many levers to pull on to manage this business, it makes each individual lever that less material. So I think what you should know and take comfort in, especially given our track record, that we've said that we've incorporated the multiplayer environment, the competitiveness of that, the reimbursement, the payer reimbursement, and how we're seeing that -- those dynamics continue to play out as well as an AB-rated in the second half of the year. So I think we've taken a very balanced, conservative approach around our assumption with EpiPen. I think we think it will continue to be a great product for us into the future kind of regardless of these near-term dynamics. So that would be on EpiPen. As far as Abbott, obviously, we had said a couple of things, that from a strategic and complementary perspective, it doubled the size of our top 10 markets outside of the U.S. and many of those -- most of those being in Europe. So to be able to take that business now and really leverage both the physician channel as well as the pharmacist channel we believe is why in our hands, with the enhanced focus and investment behind it, we can do more. And I think as you look at the portfolios and the complementary nature of where we could enhance from a physician call point in that branded generic model as well as enhance the scale and our breadth of product portfolio to the pharmacy, we're going to be able to continue to leverage that franchise. And as we get into more granularity, just as far as those product opportunities, I would say again, it's not about a product. It's much more about the therapeutic -- in the therapeutic areas and the franchise and the breadth of that. If you look across cardiovascular and GI, some of the places that Abbott EPD, their strength has lied -- marries that very well now with the breadth that we can bring on that. So look, I think in these coming months, after integration, we'll continue to keep you guys updated as we are successfully integrating the businesses, and as far as reporting perspective, it will be absorbed in our Generics segment throughout our divisions between North America, Europe and rest of world."

And what I mean by that, that everything from whether it's enhancing on the specialty side, enhancing on the generics side through geographic expansion, as well as other categories or dosage forms we're not in. We've said many times that we're at 12%, 13% market share here in the United States. There are still therapeutic categories, just as we recently bolstered our injectable to really put us in the ability to have a leadership position in injectable. So I think as you think about these different categories, we have an opportunity to add. And so with that being said, it allows us to kind of be smart and patient as we find that right next transaction from Mylan. So I don't want to hone in on any one area. I want to tell you that we're looking at everything, actively pursuing, as I said. As you can imagine, standing still is not in our DNA. And especially given the environment that we're in today, which is I consider there still to be kind of a hyper consolidation activity going on in our sector. So we are truly looking that we could add, we believe, significantly both from a strategic perspective as well as a financial perspective here in the near term. As far as respiratory, I'll touch on that, then I'll let Rajiv add to it. But obviously, we've continued to look at very -- if you think of this in kind of a couple of buckets from a niche perspective, really our enhancement around COPD, our experience, our infrastructure, our relationships in that market, we believe, continued to put us -- as you know, they're a great partner in that space, and I think that's something that we will continue to build leadership on. When you think about whether it's our generic Advair and some of the other opportunities, the franchise, when we acquired it from Pfizer, really gave us the opportunity to take some of these more complex, very difficult to manufacture products that have, we believe, a high barrier to entry to let us participate in those marketplaces. And as far as our go-to-market strategy, I think that continues to evolve, I think from the marketplace here in the U.S. throughout Europe that, that continues to evolve. And the good news is, given now our scale whether across physician, hospital or retail, we're really going to be able to maximize those products at the time they come to market."

So I will, David, try to hit you -- hit each one of them. So EpiPen. We have stated, I don't -- I think that EpiPen is a very atypical product, and I believe a couple of things. Not only just from a brand equity perspective but as we've mentioned, the comfort and the familiarity of the use of that product in a life and potentially life-threatening situations, and we believe that, that's what put the very high barrier -- bar to an AB-rated in the first place. But if an AB-rated were to get approved, we also believe you would not see the typical conversion that you do around an oral solid product. And with that being said, we've even seen oral solid products, as you may know, whether it's a levothyroxine or a Dilantin, there are some products out there that people feel very secure about the product that they're on and resist changing them, whether it's narrow therapeutic. So as you can imagine, none of those fall into the category of having seconds count when you could be in a potentially life-threatening situation. So we believe patient familiarity, use and comfort with the product now that's been in the market for over 25 years, that this would -- there would not be a typical generic curve. But like I said, with that being said, we've taken the conservative approach and modeled AB competition in. But like I said, I think EpiPen will be a very important brand for us for many years to come. As far as x U.S. pricing goes, especially around in Europe, this year, this past year, we continued to see volume be able to overcome the price erosion that we did see, which is, we still saw growth in that region despite the price erosion, and we have factored in middle single-digit erosion going forward. So with that being said, we're still seeing, anticipating double-digit growth across all of our generic business segments next year. As far as Lidoderm is concerned, look, I put my crystal ball away last year because I would've said we absolutely were in a ready position to have that approval. As you know, there's been a lot with GDUFA and the FDA's restructuring and there's been some very important first product market formation products that haven't been approved yet, and we consider Lidoderm to be one that's important. We certainly believe that -- hope to get an approval here soon, but with that being said, it's really kind of immaterial to any particular contribution because we've again anticipated and absorbed all of that in the range that we've given for 2015.

I think we have been quite -- we're operating obviously in a highly competitive marketplace over there, but we have continued to see kind of actually regaining us the market share. We have been doing some direct advertising as well as building that Mylan brand and that Mylan equity. And I think we've seen great growth when I look at Italy and some of the other -- the substitution countries. What I think now, married up with Abbott, what this provides us is to take their strength in about 8 of these top markets in Europe, whether it's Germany, U.K., some of the Central Eastern Europe, and really allows to now bring this critical mass across all of Europe. So while, like I said, I'm excited with our growth in Europe last year on a legacy basis, I'm more excited about what I think the Abbott-Mylan business can now do together and the kind of growth that we're going to see in Europe. As far as the rest of Asia, Asia grew double digits in 2014, led again by India and our emerging markets. Our HIV franchise, the ARVs, continues to grow at an accelerated double-digit rate. And lastly, Australia and Japan continue to do very well and meet our expectations."

During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements relate to, among other matters, the acquisition of -- by Mylan N.V. of both Mylan Inc. and Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the Abbott business; our and Mylan N.V.'s expected or targeted future financial and operating performance, results, metrics and plans and expectations related thereto; the inability to obtain regulatory approvals and planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products. Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the transaction with Abbott; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of the Abbott business by Mylan being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating costs, customer loss and business disruptions being greater than expected following the transaction with Abbott; the impact of competition; situations where we or Mylan N.V. manufacture, market and/or sell products notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our or Mylan N.V.'s ability to bring new products to market; those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release and the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013, as updated by our Form 8-K filed on August 6, 2014; our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014; our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2014; as well as our other filings with the SEC.

Mylan is off to a phenomenal start this year. Our announcement this past Friday is a great example. Having successfully completed our acquisition of Abbott's non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, we now are beginning our next exciting chapter of growth. As we've been stating all along, this is absolutely the next right strategic transaction for Mylan and nearly doubles our size in our top 10 markets outside the United States, further expands and diversifies our product portfolio and customer base and gives us significant financial flexibility to aggressively pursue opportunities that make strategic and financial sense for the company. We expect the transaction to be approximately $0.20 accretive to EPS in 2015, $0.25 in the first full year and to increase thereafter through 2018. We also expect to maintain double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth rates through 2018. In addition, we see our tax rate declining to approximately 20% to 21% during the first full year and then falling into the high teens thereafter.
Anticipating all of these benefits, we began planning with Abbott leadership as soon as we announced the deal back in July so as to lay the groundwork for what we believe will be a very smooth integration now that the transaction has closed. I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's Board of Directors and senior leaders to welcome Abbott's EPD employees to the Mylan family. We very much look forward to the contributions they'll make as they take up our cause of delivering better health for a better world.
As we take a moment and look back at 2014, we again delivered strong financial performance by leveraging the diversity and breadth of our global platform, maintaining our relentless focus on disciplined execution and seizing opportunities whenever and wherever they arose. Sales for the year totaled $7.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 13% compared to 2013. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $3.56, an increase of 23% compared to our prior year performance. Every one of our business segments contributed to this growth, with our North America and Rest of World Generics regions and our Specialty segment delivering double-digit revenue increases. In addition, EpiPen became our first product to generate $1 billion in annual sales.
Our employees around the world deserve the credit for these great results. On behalf of our board and senior leaders, I'd like to thank them for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our cause. Their commitment will serve us well in 2015, which we believe will be yet another very strong year for the company.
Specifically, we anticipate revenue growth of 33% and EPS growth of 21%, both on a constant currency basis. In addition, we continue to see opportunities to accelerate our 2018 target of at least $6 in adjusted EPS. As I mentioned, in 2014, EpiPen became our first product to reach $1 billion in annual sales. We're proud to have reached this milestone and note that we achieved it by growing the franchise at a compound annual clip of nearly 30% since '08, a reflection of the product's tremendous brand equity. As I've often reiterated, we have continued to expand the epinephrine market in unconventional ways, specifically by focusing on education, awareness and access. Our EpiPen4Schools program is a great example, as is our advocacy on the regulatory front, with 48 states now allowing undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors in schools.
Our assumptions around EpiPen for 2015 incorporate that we already participate in a highly competitive, multiplayer epinephrine marketplace and that we are operating in a very aggressive payer environment. And while we continue to believe that the regulatory barrier to entry for an AB-rated generic EpiPen remains high, we also are factoring the impact of an AB-rated competition into our guidance in the second half of the year. That said, we continue to invest in product innovation and geographic expansion as well as new formulations. We also continue to pursue our unconventional approach to growing this franchise. It focuses on shaping legislation to continue to expand access for consumers and other public entities, generating awareness about severe allergies, providing education to help those at risk take control and continually looking for ways to enhance consumers' experience. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

As you have heard, 2014 was another very strong year for Mylan, strategically, operationally and financially. We saw double-digit growth in our business, including 21% growth in Specialty, 18% in Rest of W",1260,"Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have heard, 2014 was another very strong year for Mylan, strategically, operationally and financially. We saw double-digit growth in our business, including 21% growth in Specialty, 18% in Rest of World, 12% in North America, as well as 3% growth in Europe, which includes absorbing 4% to 5% of price erosion.
Our strong performance in North America was particularly noteworthy as it comes despite us not being able to get certain key approvals due to continued regulatory delays at the FDA. We believe that the FDA has made some good progress implementing GDUFA since the program went into effect in October of 2012. The agency has increased its inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturers, although the median review time for ANDAs is standing at about 42 months. Nevertheless, we remain confident that over the long run, a properly resourced and transformed FDA will yield substantial benefits in the U.S. and beyond in the form of improved safety, access and transparency. I would also note that Mylan received more FDA approvals in 2014 than any other company, including 6 first to file, all of which helped fuel our strong financial performance during the year. In addition we have more ANDAs pending approval than anyone in our industry, 283 to be specific, including 44 pending first-to-file opportunities.
As you know, at Mylan, we are never standing still and we have started off 2015 with the announcement of several additional complementary transactions that will further enhance our existing platform. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire certain female health care businesses from Famy Care, which is the world's largest producer of generic oral contraceptive products. This acquisition will provide Mylan with an enhanced and now vertically integrated platform to accelerate our growth in the global women's health care space. Famy Care will bring us 4 high-quality manufacturing facilities in India, 2 of which have been approved by FDA and the European health authorities. They have one of the lowest cost and largest manufacturing footprints dedicated to oral contraceptive products and will bring Mylan's strong capabilities in OCP cycles, injectables, IUDs and tubal rings. On the commercial front, this acquisition was built on Mylan's existing partnerships with Famy Care in North America, Europe and Australia, and will also make Mylan a hormonal contraceptive leader in high-growth emerging markets around the world. This transaction also complements the business acquired from Abbott, which includes a women's health care portfolio and sales and marketing capabilities.
The purchase price represents a mid-teen EBITDA multiple on a forward basis for a high-growth and profitable business. Looking ahead, we are anticipating annual EBITDA growth in excess of 25% over the next several years. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan's adjusted diluted EPS upon closing, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2015 subject to regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions. We also recently announced a partnership with Theravance Biopharma on the development and commercialization of TD-4208 in novel investigational once-daily, nebulized, long-acting muscarinic antagonist for COPD and other respiratory diseases. TD-4208 has shown positive top line results in COPD patients in multiple Phase II studies, and FDA recently agreed to design of the Phase III program, which is anticipated to begin this year. We believe TD-4208 has the potential to be the only FDA-approved once-daily, single-agent, nebulized product for COPD, and it may offer longer-term opportunities for a combination with other nebulized products.
In addition, the patent portfolio for TD-4208 is currently expected to provide exclusivity in the U.S. until at least 2025, which doesn't include any potential patent term extensions. In addition to the geographical portfolio expansion, we continue to make significant progress across all of other our key growth drivers. Continuing with respiratory, we are formally developing our presence in this space, both through external activities such as Theravance and internal development programs.
Our Phase III clinical trials for generic Advair are progressing well, and we anticipate filing our application with FDA at the end of this year. We continue to believe that Mylan will be the first to bring to market an AB-rated substitutable generic form of Advair in the U.S. We are in the process of giving final shape to our manufacturing in order to be positioned to handle the appropriate capacity upon launch. We also anticipate 2 European respiratory launches in 2015, generic Seretide MDI and generic Flixotide MDI. With regards to complex products, we continue to advance our insulin analog program. We commenced 2 Phase III trials for Glargine, which are progressing well. We continue to pursue the opportunity to have one of the first interchangeable insulin analogs to Lantus. We also have made significant progress in terms of manufacturing readiness.
On the Copaxone front, as we told you last quarter, we have responded to all FDA requests to date in terms of our ANDA, and we remain confident that we are well positioned to receive approval for our application and be in a position to launch at market formation. On the legal front, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision did not address the invalidity of the last remaining patent, and we believe that the prior invalidity ruling will be confirmed by the Federal Circuit. We are pleased with the Federal Circuit's accelerated briefing schedule. From a guidance perspective, we are taking a conservative approach and assuming launch in the second half of 2015. We also continue to advance our biosimilars program. We've strategically selected our portfolio with a primary focus on monoclonal antibodies. We are aggressively executing on the development of this global pipeline, which currently includes 6 products. We expect 3 of these programs to be in Phase III in 2015.
As we have noted before, we expect to launch these products initially into Europe and rest of the world markets. As you know, we launched the world's first trastuzumab biosimilar in India in 2014, and we have now submitted this product in 15 more countries. We also continue to expand our injectable business, and today, we offer a global portfolio of more than 230 injectable products in a broad range of dosage forms. We continue to take steps to integrate the Agila business and ensure its position as a high-quality reliable source of injectables for the long term. Hence, we are taking all steps necessary to ensure that Mylan's one quality standard is deeply embedded across the Agila's manufacturing sites. While we may continue to have some issues as we implement our remediation efforts, we are confident that a deliberate, thorough approach to ensure a sustainable culture of compliance is the right way to capitalize on our Agila investment.
Turning to our infectious disease growth driver. During the fourth quarter, 2 of the 3 largest buyers of antiretrovirals in the world, the Global Fund and the government of South Africa, completed 3-year tenders, and Mylan won a leading share in both cases. Today, we supply more than 40% of ARV volume in developing markets and provide access to high-quality ARV treatments to more than 5 million patients each year. In addition, we continue to expand our infectious disease business beyond ARVs, signing several agreements with Gilead for the distribution of hepatitis C treatments. We were recently appointed as exclusive partner for the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni brands in India, and we expanded our nonexclusive rights to Sovaldi and Harvoni in 91 developing countries. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will walk you through our financial performance in greater detail. Thanks."

I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis.

I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures, and I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures. Starting on Slide 16. As you can see, our total revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 experienced double-digit constant currency growth. We are very proud of the commercial performances of each of our businesses and regions in 2014.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a very strong 54%, up nearly 300 basis points from the same prior-year period. Our adjusted gross margin for the full year was 52%, up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year. Our strong gross margins are primarily the result of new product introductions in North America as well as a positive pricing environment and the growth in sales of EpiPen auto-injector. Importantly, 2014 represented the sixth consecutive year of gross margin growth that has resulted in our gross margin increasing from the mid-40% range to well over 50%.
During 2014, our gross debt outstanding decreased slightly from the prior year, and with the purchase of Abbott, completed on a debt-free basis, we have ample financial flexibility going into 2015. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates, as the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was below 4% in 2014. Additionally, to further enhance our capital structure, during the fourth quarter, we redeemed our 2018 high-yield senior notes by issuing a term loan at a substantially lower interest rate and extended our revolving credit facility on enhanced terms.
Turning to Slide 17. 2014 continued a 6-year period of exceptional growth in our business. As we look forward to 2015, we are very pleased with our consistent double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS, all of which demonstrate our unwavering commitment to achieving our targets and enhancing shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to now discuss our expectations for 2015, which are laid out on Slide 18. At the bottom line, we are projecting an increase in our constant currency adjusted diluted EPS guidance of 21% based upon the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. Our EPS guidance is after absorbing $0.15 per share of FX headwind on the combined business. This EPS guidance range is based upon the following income statement line item guidance metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis with the exception of total revenues. Total revenues are projected to be between $9.6 billion and $10.1 billion, the midpoint of which, on a constant currency basis, is an increase of 33% from the 2014 total revenues. Our Generics business is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 40% in 2015, which includes revenues from acquisitions of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. Specialty revenue is expected to be flat, as we have assumed generic competition for EpiPen in the second half of 2015. With the recently completed Abbott transaction and the pending Famy Care acquisition, we continue to diversify our business, both in terms of our portfolio and geographically. Following completion of these transactions, slightly more than 50% of our revenues will come from North America, about 1/3 will come from Europe and the balance will come from Rest of World. I'll speak in a few -- further in a few minutes on the drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth.
Gross margins will increase again to be between 53% and 55%, the midpoint of which is approximately 200 basis points higher than 2014. Drivers of the increase include new product revenues and the strength of our North American Generics business as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix. Our gross margins are being further enhanced by the Abbott assets acquired, combined with the efficiencies of our global platform.
SG&A will be between 19% and 21% of total revenue, a slight increase from the prior year due to the inclusion of the business acquired from Abbott. And R&D will be between 6.5% and 7.5% of total revenue as we continue to invest in our future. With these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion. Also, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21%, the midpoint of which is a 500-basis-point decline from our adjusted effective tax rate in 2014 of 25%, which is attributable to our enhanced global tax structure and improved competitive positioning from the closing of the Abbott transaction.
Based upon 2015 guidance metrics for operating cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and capital expenditures between $400 million and $500 million, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, with the midpoint of $1.25 billion a 41% increase from the prior year.
Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 495 million and 500 million shares, utilizing an assumed average full year share price of approximately $60, which includes the impact of the shares issued in conjunction with the Abbott transaction. As a reminder, under our cash convertible notes, we have approximately 43 million warrants outstanding, with the majority of the warrants having a strike price of $30. We have assumed dilution from these warrants to be approximately 20 million to 22 million shares for 2015.
Turning to Slide 19, you will see a reminder of some of the key assumptions utilized in the 2015 guidance. Specifically, we have factored in the strength of the U.S. dollar and the expected foreign currency impact for 2015. Included in our earnings release is a table of assumed foreign exchange rates used in developing our 2015 financial guidance. The 2015 guidance includes the contribution from the Abbott EPD business from the date of close, as well as the inclusion of Famy Care beginning in the second half of 2015.
Slide 20 provides further details regarding our revenue growth in 2015. We expect the legacy Mylan business to contribute approximately $700 million to $900 million of incremental revenue in 2015. Revenue from new product launches as well as volume growth in our base business will serve to offset single-digit price erosion on our existing products. In terms of base pricing assumptions, in the Generics segment, as we traditionally have, we've assumed low single-digit price erosion in North America. Further, we have assumed mid-single-digit price erosion in Rest of World and mid to high single-digit price erosion in Europe. We expect revenue from acquisitions, principally the established products business we acquired from Abbott, to contribute approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of incremental revenue in 2015. The year-over-year negative impact of foreign currency translation, including the impact from the acquired businesses, is expected to be approximately $300 million to $400 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Slide 21 shows the projected bridge between our actual 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56 and the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range of $4.15, an increase of 17%. New product launches and revenue from acquisitions will drive our earnings growth in 2015. We expect our Q1 EPS to be in line with the prior year, with each of the following 3 quarters' EPS being higher than the prior year. We expect the third quarter EPS to, once again, be the strongest quarter in terms of earnings. Our second quarter EPS is expected to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter due to the anticipated timing of new product launches.
Turning to Slide 22. At the end of 2014, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.8:1, down considerably from our leverage ratio of 3.5:1 at the end of 2013. With the closing of the Abbott transaction, our balance sheet becomes even stronger as our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio now stands at approximately 2.3:1. We now benefit from a competitive global tax structure that strengthens our financial position and will help to accelerate future growth. We remain committed to our stated M&A parameters and our long-term gross leverage targets at investment-grade levels.
To summarize, our fourth quarter provided a very strong finish to 2014 and is a testament to the strength and diversity of Mylan. We look forward to doing more of the same in 2015 and beyond. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

Second question about your European plan. Now that you had a little bit more time to look at the Abbott asset, can you just drive a little bit into that business with a bit more granularity? What are the few things you have to execute on in 2015? What products will drive the growth? What countries will drive the growth? How much cost synergies are you looking for? Is there some synergy assumption in there? Just a bit more granularity about how this business will go forward and, frankly, how are you going to report it? That is, how can we from the outside track your progress over the next couple of years with this business?"

As I have stated now for quite a while as expectations around our product innovation and life cycle, I've tried to maintain and reiterate the fact that we've grown the market in a very unconventional way",639,"Ronny, well, thank you. So I'll start with EpiPen. As I have stated now for quite a while as expectations around our product innovation and life cycle, I've tried to maintain and reiterate the fact that we've grown the market in a very unconventional way around, I think, first, the underlying fundamental strength of the brand equity. But what became obvious to us is that there was the lack of awareness and education and, quite frankly, just the ability to have access to EpiPen was quite low. So as we did EpiPen4Schools, for instance, to allow undesignated EpiPens in schools and we now are continuing to take that into other public entities, that I have said while it has grown in unconventional ways, we wouldn't be looking at your traditional life cycle management brand product switches, that we believe that are -- the EpiPen has not only brand equity but as well as the comfort and the ease of use after over 25 years of being on the market. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are absolutely continuing to look at product innovation and geographic expansion as well as new formulations, and you will continue to see us come out with some of those things, those features, but as it relates to a brand-new product or a new device, our EpiPen and the brand equity around it is what will remain our mainstay in the U.S. market. As far as our assumptions, Ronny, also as we reiterated, as we continue to diversify ourselves and have many levers to pull on to manage this business, it makes each individual lever that less material. So I think what you should know and take comfort in, especially given our track record, that we've said that we've incorporated the multiplayer environment, the competitiveness of that, the reimbursement, the payer reimbursement, and how we're seeing that. Those dynamics continue to play out, as well as an AB-rated in the second half of the year. So I think we've taken a very balanced, conservative approach around our assumption with EpiPen. I think we think it will continue to be a great product for us into the future kind of regardless of these near-term dynamics. So that would be on EpiPen. As far as Abbott, obviously, we had said a couple of things, that from a strategic and complementary perspective, it doubled the size of our top 10 markets outside of the U.S., and many of those -- most of those being in Europe. So to be able to take that business now and really leverage both the physician channel as well as the pharmacist channel we believe is why in our hands, with the enhanced focus and investment behind it, we can do more. And I think as you look at the portfolios and the complementary nature of where we could enhance from a physician call point in that branded generic model as well as enhance the scale and our breadth of product portfolio to the pharmacy, we're going to be able to continue to leverage that franchise. And as we get into more granularity, just as far as those product opportunities, I would say again, it's not about a product. It's much more about the therapeutic and the therapeutic areas and the franchise and the breadth of that. If you look across cardiovascular and GI, some of the places that Abbott EPD, their strength has lied, it marries up very well now with the breadth that we can bring on that. So look, I think in these coming months, after integration, we'll continue to keep you guys updated as we are successfully integrating the businesses. And as far as the reporting perspective, it will be absorbed in our Generics segment throughout our divisions between North America, Europe and Rest of World."

And what I mean by that, that everything from whether it's enhancing on the Specialty side, enhancing on the Generics side through geographic expansion, as well as other categories or dosage forms we're not in. We've said many times that we're at 12%, 13% market share here in the United States. There are still therapeutic categories, just as we recently bolstered our injectable to really put us in the ability to have a leadership position in injectable. So I think as you think about these different categories, we have an opportunity to add. And so with that being said, it allows us to kind of be smart and patient as we find that right next transaction for Mylan. So I don't want to hone in on any one area. I want to tell you that we're looking at everything, actively pursuing, as I said. As you can imagine, standing still is not in our DNA. And especially given the environment that we're in today, which is, I consider, still to be kind of a hyper consolidation activity going on in our sector. So we are truly looking that we could add, we believe, significantly both from a strategic perspective as well as a financial perspective here in the near term. As far as respiratory, I'll touch on that, then I'll let Rajiv add to it. But obviously, we've continued to look at very -- if you think of this in kind of a couple of buckets from a niche perspective, really our enhancement around COPD, our experience, our infrastructure, our relationships in that market, we believe, continue to put us -- as you know, they're a great partner in that space, and I think that's something that we will continue to build leadership on. When you think about whether it's our generic Advair and some of the other opportunities, the franchise, when we acquired it from Pfizer, really gave us the opportunity to take some of these more complex, very difficult-to-manufacture products that have, we believe, a high barrier to entry to let us participate in those marketplaces. And as far as our go-to-market strategy, I think that continues to evolve, I think from the marketplace here in the U.S. throughout Europe that, that continues to evolve. And the good news is, given now our scale, whether across physician, hospital or retail, we're really going to be able to maximize those products at the time they come to market."

So I will, David, try to hit you -- hit each one of them. So EpiPen. We have stated, I don't -- I think that EpiPen is a very atypical product, and I believe a couple of things. Not only just from a brand equity perspective but as we've mentioned, the comfort and the familiarity of the use of that product in a life -- in potentially life-threatening situations, and we believe that, that's what put the very high barrier -- bar to an AB-rated in the first place. But if an AB-rated were to get approved, we also believe you would not see the typical conversion that you do around an oral solid product. And with that being said, we've even seen oral solid products, as you may know, whether it's a levothyroxine or a Dilantin, there are some products out there that people feel very secure about the product that they're on and resist changing them, whether it's narrow therapeutic. So as you can imagine, none of those fall into the category of having seconds count when you could be in a potentially life-threatening situation. So we believe patient familiarity, use and comfort with the product now that's been in the market for over 25 years, that this would -- there would not be a typical generic curve. But like I said, with that being said, we've taken the conservative approach and modeled AB competition in. But like I said, I think EpiPen will be a very important brand for us for many years to come. As far as x U.S. pricing goes, especially around in Europe, this year -- this past year, we continued to see volume be able to overcome the price erosion that we did see, which is, we still saw growth in that region despite the price erosion, and we have factored in middle single-digit erosion going forward. So with that being said, we're still seeing -- anticipating double-digit growth across all of our generic business segments next year. As far as Lidoderm is concerned, look, I put my crystal ball away last year because I would've said we absolutely were in a ready position to have that approval. As you know, there's been a lot with GDUFA and the FDA's restructuring and there's been some very important first product market formation products that haven't been approved yet, and we consider Lidoderm to be one that's important. We certainly believe that -- hope to get an approval here soon, but with that being said, it's really kind of immaterial to any particular contribution because we've again anticipated and absorbed all of that in the range that we've given for 2015.

What I would say is that we continue to expand and diversify ourselves to be a health care provider, and I think that spans across everything from the physician, the retail, the hospital. And when I think about our ability to take a very broad portfolio, and whether it's as we're interfacing with a much more consolidated customer base from a global perspective, the GPOs, I think that it's this breadth across our portfolio that really is continuing to put us in a differentiated category. So as we look at opportunities, I'm not saying we're more branded-focused, we're more generic-focused, we're more OTC-focused. What I can say is that we continue to look at ways that we can mean the most to our customer, that we -- gives us that diversification across geographies as well as across products and, like I said, just allows us to continue to deliver on our mission of wanting to reach 7 billion people. So I think just to underscore that there's many, many assets out there available that will let us accomplish this in many different ways. As far as Pfizer and Hospira goes, look, I think that consolidation always lends itself to opportunity. And I think going back to when, whether from Bioniche and then when we added Agila, we said that we believe that put us in an opportunity to really leapfrog to a leadership position in the injectable space, and I think we continue to have a great opportunity to do so."

But I think now, married up with Abbott, what this provides us is to take their strength in about 8 of these top markets in Europe, whether it's Germany, U.K., some of the Central Eastern Europe, and really allows to now bring this critical mass across all of Europe. So while, like I said, I'm excited with our growth in Europe last year on a legacy basis, I'm more excited about what I think the Abbott-Mylan business can now do together and the kind of growth that we're going to see in Europe. As far as the rest of Asia, Asia grew double digits in 2014, led again by India and our emerging markets. Our HIV franchise, the ARVs, continue to grow at an accelerated double-digit rate.

Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to: Uncertainties related to the Perrigo proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatment of the Abbott transaction and the Perrigo proposal; changes in relevant tax and other loss; the integration of Perrigo and the Abbott business being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating cost, customer loss and business disruptions being greater than expected following the Perrigo proposal and the Abbott transaction; the impact of competition, situations, where we manufacture market and our self products notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set firth in Mylan N.V.'s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014, as well as other filings with the SEC.

As you can see on Slide 7, Mylan delivered solid first quarter results, kicking off what we believe will be yet another year of strong financial performance for the company. Sales during the quarter totaled nearly USD 1.9 billion, a constant currency increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted attributed EPS came in at $0.70, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2014.
As highlighted on this slide, all of our regions within the Generics segment experienced strong content currency revenue growth, which was a result of new product introductions, combined with faster impact, especially in Europe, of the acquisition of the non-U.S. EPD business.
Within our Specialty segment, third-party net sales in the first quarter increased 8% compared to the prior year period, as EpiPen autoinjector continue to experience volume growth. In addition, the integration of the recently acquired EPD business is proceeding smoothly, and we already have begun realizing the substantial value we envision from the strategic transaction.
Turning to Slide 8. We have been very active during the first quarter with respect to execution of our growth drivers. For instance, recruitment for our comparative effectiveness study for generic Advair is nearly complete, and we look forward to getting back in front of FDA in next summer and remain on track for filing our ANDA by year-end. 
As you are aware, we have established a strategic leverage and return for the development and commercialization of TD-4208, which is expected to be approved as a once-daily nebulized lama product for COPD patients. Our technical and clinical teams have been working diligently together, and we can now tell you that we expect to initiate our clinically efficacy trials in the second half of this year. We also remain on track to launch our 2 other respiratory programs in Europe this year: Generic Seretide MDI and generic MDI. Similarly, with respect to our 2 Phase III studies for Glargine, we have completed recruitment for type 1 diabetes studies ahead of schedule and we expect to wrap up recruitment for the type 2 diabetes study in July.
We remain on track to commission our commercial production facility by this summer's end. On the Baltics front, we continue to progress with on trastuzumab global Phase III trial. We are pleased to report that the Phase III trial for sans is well underway, and we also have recently initiated our global Phase III study for adalimumab. With regard to our ANDA for generic Copaxone, as previously stated, we responded to all FDA request today. We remain fully confident that we are well-positioned to receive approval for our application.
The approval of the standard ANDA demonstrates that FDA is moving forward with approvals of substitutable generic version of this product. We are further encouraged by FDA's denial of [indiscernible]. The FDA's response outlines their criteria for approval in Mylan is confident that our ANDA meets each of these criteria.
We also completed the clinical [indiscernible] trial for us for as per FDA's guidance and look forward to the next steps to adding another complex product to our portfolio. 
Finally, I would like to [indiscernible] sentiment by thanking our employees for their unwavering dedication to our cause of delivering better health for a better world. With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

Looking at Slide 9. As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were $1.9 billion, which included one month of results from the established products business we acquired.
Sales were unfavorablly impacted by approximately $93 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, the yen and the Australian dollar. However, on a constant currency basis, revenues in our Generics segment increased 15% when compared to the prior year period, an increase that includes revenues of $147 million contributed from the EPD business.
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 53%, up 240 basis points from the same prior year period. Our strong margin were primarily the result of new product introductions in North America combined with the positive contribution from the EPD business.
R&D expense, on an adjusted basis, was $152 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect R&D spending, as a percentage of total revenues, to be within our guidance range for the full year.
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $409 million or approximately 22% of total revenues, which includes the impact of the EPD business combined with our continued investment in the EpiPen autoinjector.
Our first quarter adjusted net income was $309 million or $0.70 per share, a 6% increase from our Q1 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.66 per share. Our adjusted diluted EPS was above our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of the significant currency headwinds we encountered.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $336 million and first quarter capital spending was $48 million, as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. 
At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.1 to 1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity, including our recently announced credit agreement for the proposed Perrigo Transaction. And we remain committed to our long-term leverage target, which are consistent with investment grade.
To summarize, our first quarter provided an excellent start to 2015, and we remain committed to our 2015 guidance metrics, which we communicated during our Q4 2014 earnings call in March. For the second quarter 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.90 per share, which would be a 28% increase over the prior year quarter, and we remain confident in our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Heather."

Close to a decade ago, we laid out Mylan's vision and strategy and since pursued them relentlessly and consistently. Never doing transactions for transaction's sake, never doing transactions whose main focus was cost synergies, never doing transactions for the sole purpose of lowering our tax rate. Instead, we have always focused on doing transactions that complement our strategy, support long-term, sustainable growth, allow us to further enhance and leverage what we've built and help us move closer to achieving our vision of delivering better health for a better world to 7 billion people.
As we have demonstrated, Mylan aggressively pursue such transaction, and we have repeatedly stated that we would be using our enhanced financial flexibility to do other large deals. And for those of you who know Mylan well, we do what we say we're going to do. 
The combination with Perrigo is simply the next important strategic step in our evolution and building our strong platform, consistent with our long-standing and clearly articulated vision and strategy. We have long believed the combination of Perrigo and Mylan represents an extraordinary opportunity. As you have seen through our actions over the past few weeks, we are committed to making this combination a reality. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo demonstrates clear and compelling industrial logic. The potential here is truly transformative and the transaction would redefine the delivery of global health care.
A combined Mylan and Perrigo would be ideally positioned at the forefront of the mega trends driving change throughout the health care industry, including the growing number of RX-to-OTC switches underway. Together, we could better serve our customers and patients, create more opportunities for our employees and communities and generate additional value for our shareholders and stakeholders.
Mylan and Perrigo are highly complementary businesses. And together, we would have unmatched reach and impact. Each company augments the other platform to create something that is better, not just bigger in terms of portfolio and pipeline, commercial footprint, operational leverage across customer channels and manufacturing and supply chain capability.
Let me quickly highlight some of the key strategic and financial benefits of the transaction. As a combined company, we will have a meaningful presence across all customer channel, and we will have critical mass and leadership across GS, Rx-to-OTC with one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolios. We will have the opportunity to offer our customers a compelling value proposition through a unique ability to deliver products and services in an environment where scale and reach are increasingly important.
We will also have unmatched global scale, an immense geographic reach in order to maximize this portfolio across existing and new markets. The scale and reach will improve patient access to affordable, high-quality medicine. 
In addition to an enhanced commercial platform, we will have a massive global manufacturing platform and supply chain. This will provide a real critical advantage because it will allow us to deliver the reliability and cost advantages our customers have come to rely on.
We are well-positioned to optimize the enhanced platform of the combined company, as well as Mylan's strong brand equity, to capitalize on trends shaping the health care industry and drive future growth and financial performance. The combined company will be a stronger, larger and more diverse business with approximately $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014 and significant free cash flow. 
Importantly, the transaction is accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis. We expect to achieve annual pretax operational synergies of at least $800 million fully realizable by year 4 after closing. We also expect to maintain our investment grade credit rating.
The strong industrial and financial rational will redefine how we can deliver on our mission to provide the world's 7 billion people access to affordable, high-quality medicine.
Turning to Slide 12. You can see that this transaction aligns with our existing growth drivers, enhancing our capabilities in respiratory and complex products, providing access to new geographic markets, while adding an exciting new opportunity in OTC. This product platform enhances our ability to provide customers with health care solutions, not just products.
We have long thought that OTC could be very important piece of the Mylan story and have carefully evaluated the best ways to expand our presence in this area. In fact, the acquisition of the EPD business gave us a foothold in OTC that platform would complement and enhance Perrigo's existing global growth plan.
Moving on to Slide 13. Importantly, our history of doing good and doing well would only be improved by this combination. Our broader product portfolio, significant commitment to R&D and larger cost advantages and factoring platform would better position us to serve our patients and customers and further enhance our ability to provide access to medicines and bring new innovations to market. The transaction also would create more opportunities for employees because they would be part of a larger and even stronger organization with significant growth potential. We have a great admiration for Perrigo's management workforce and there will be opportunities for best practice sharing cost the combined company.
Mylan has long been considered a partner of choice. Given our platform and geographic for us, and this transaction will only enhance that positioning. The increased scale and significant free cash flows will directly enhance the position of our creditors and suppliers as well. And as we will outline in more detail now, this transaction has significant potential for shareholder value creation.
You can't just valuate your greatness, you have to earn it through execution and performance. Both Mylan and Perrigo shareholders can have great confidence in the value potential of the combined company based on our management team's proven ability to deliver shareholder value and achieve our goals through strategic, organic and inorganic growth initiatives. 
As we have outlined here on Slide 14, we have carefully pursued transactions in the past that enhance our strategic positioning in the industry and add key capabilities, expanding geographic reach or enhancing operation.
For instance, in 2007, we acquired Matrix and began building a horizontally and vertically integrated platform that today would be nearly impossible to replicate. Matrix also gave us a presence in India, which today is home to nearly half of our operations and employees. We subsequently build upon this transformational transaction, creating a global footprint that we now leverage to deliver high-quality products efficiently and cost-effectively around the world.
Importantly, Mylan has the right team to execute and integrate this transaction. We have a strong track record of creating value from M&A and exceeding our synergy targets. Our integration of Mercs Generics and specialty business is an example of sitting or synergy target in a large transformative transaction. We delivered acquisitions synergies of approximately $500 million from this deal, which was double our original target.
These transactions and continued consistent strong execution on our business have resulted in strong performance and value creation for our shareholders, as you can see on Slide 15. The team that delivered this double-digit top and bottom line growth and that integrated these prior deals is the team running this business today.
Our performance is best seen through our annualized 3-year total shareholder return, which is 50% higher than the S&P 500 pharma benchmark and more than double the S&P 500 over the same period. The current Mylan team also would benefit from the experience, expertise and institutional knowledge of core executives from the Perrigo and Omega team, and we have proposed joined leadership team of the combined company precisely because we have great respect to what they have built.
Rajiv will now review how this combination will enhance our operational and commercial excellence."

I also am very excited about the potential of this transaction and the many opportunities that it would create for both Mylan and Perrigo. 
On Slide 17, you can start to see how we will mean more to our customers as a result of this combination. We will have an impressive, diversified and differentiated product portfolio with an ability to offer all of our customers thousands of marketed products across GX, Rx and OTC and across therapeutic categories and dosage forms.
The chart on this slide really spell out how the competition will expand and diversify both businesses portfolios, including increasing Mylan's OTC offering from 2% of revenue to almost 30%. A combined Mylan and Perrigo will have an unmatched ability to serve the front and back pharmacies and other retail locations.
Mylan's portfolio would be further strengthened by Perrigo's strong and complementary positioning in nutritional and animal health products, which would allow us to bring even more value to customers around the world.
Turning to Slide 18. You can see how the combined company will be well placed to build and strengthen its existing portfolio by developing and commercializing new products. Both Mylan and Perrigo have robust pipeline in GX and OTC opportunities. In the past few years, we have really distinguished ourselves from our peers through our ability to secure going forward. For example, in 2014, we were the leading ANDA filer, and we currently have an impressive 2 59 [ph] ANDA spending with FDA, including 44 first-to-file opportunity. We also have a track record of securing towards across multiple countries and currently have more than 3,700 global filings pending regulatory approval. At the same time, Perrigo has an exciting opportunity ahead of its market trends in OTC, continue to move favorably in its direction. As Perrigo recently stated, it expects nearly $1 billion in total new products revenues over the next 3 years.
Mylan's efficiency and clear record of success in execution can play an important role in helping ensure that Perrigo captures the potential of these products around the world. In short, the combined company has a clear opportunity to further expand its portfolio by bringing hundreds of new products to market every year across categories and dosage form and drive organic growth will into the future.
Turning to Slide 19. Mylan and Perrigo share many values, and we have great respect for what Perrigo has accomplished. One common area of focus for our company is R&D and its ability to unlock future growth drivers as the global health care system continues to dual. At Mylan, we have been talking about the exciting opportunities in Biologics category and other complex products for some time now, and we are making great progress in many of these areas.
Similarly, Perrigo's performance will continue to evolve through strategic R&D investment to capitalize on macrotrends, especially the powerful and ongoing move from Rx-to-OTC and the opportunities for branded OTC expansion. Shared commitment R&D, plus ability to secure approvals, will continue to drive the growth of the combined company and position it to capitalize on the opportunities of the changing global health care industry.
On Slide 20, you can immediately see that the combined Mylan and Perrigo will have a massive vertically integrated manufacturing platform with 70 production sites around the world.
Moving on to the next slide. This combined platform will have annual capacity of more than 100 billion tablets and capsules and leveraging capacity across the combined companies to impact perform will drive growth and our ability to turn, bring products to market while minimizing the need for near-term investment in additional capacity.
This platform also will be differentiated by both company's commitment to and track record of quality and prudent ability to manage the entire global supply chain. All of this will give us flexibility to deliver the quality, reliability and cost advantages that customers have come to rely upon.
In addition to our strong presence in old products, we have broad capabilities across EPIs, injectables, [indiscernible], semi solids, appointments, greens and liquids. Further, we are enhancing these capabilities with additional complex technology capabilities, including respiratory, biologics and insulin. In short, this platform would be a one-of-a-kind assets capable of delivering all of what our customers need today while supporting future growth.
Slide 22 demonstrates just how strong the company, combined companies, consumer focus platform would be. Together, Mylan and Perrigo would close a broad portfolio of curable, market-leading, consumer facing products across specialty, branded generics, Nutritionals and OTC.
Mylan's strong existing consumer focus portfolio, which includes leading brands, such as Epifen, Brufen, performers, and among others, will be further strengthened by Perrigo powerful brands, such as [indiscernible] Schumer and [indiscernible]. The strong portfolio will be supported and further enhanced by Mylan's consistent investment in its brand equity across customer channels.
Moving to Slide 23, you can see what we mean by this combination, redefining the delivery of health care. With the addition of Perrigo, we would have an unmatched ability to deliver for all of our customers and ultimately, patients. We would have critical mass across all customer channels and will be able to leverage our operating platform and commercial best practices for customers in every segments especially the retail pharmacy space.
We'll go-to-market as One Mylan with the ability to meet the critical needs of all our customers and patient growth and deliver meaningful health care solutions. Also, we'll be optimally positioned to capital is macrotrends the industry environment, including revolving distributor and peer dynamics, the need for increased scale and reach, and RX-to-OTC switches.
Now let's turn to Slide 24 to look at how this impressive portfolio will be leveraged by our broad commercial footprint. The combined company would have a significant commercial presence covering approximately 145 countries worldwide. This global platform, which Perrigo, This and have today will [indiscernible] early-stage global expansion efforts and great expansion revenue growth opportunities by introducing Perrigo products a new geographies. Perrigo will also facilitate Mylan's entry into some new exciting geographies, such as Mexico, Russia and Israel, providing opportunities to introduce Mylan's broad portfolio in these countries.
Further, the combination would optimize each companies performed in both North America and Europe. There is significant opportunity to drive additional value in Europe because Mylan could leverage its recently acquired from Abbott and Perrigo's recent acquisition of Omega to accelerate brand growth in the region. This will create greater opportunities for employees and allow us to better serve patients and customer in the region.
The EPD business complements Mylan's generic sales force in Europe because of its deep experience in specialty and branded generics. Through this transaction, Mylan's platform will be further enhanced by Omega's OTC sales force. 
The complementary nature of Mylan and Perrigo platform would create additional growth opportunities through cross-selling and sharing best practices. The opportunities in Europe are especially exciting, given the unique dynamics of its pharmacy  model. 
I will now introduce Tony, President of North America, to provide you with the details on how this transaction would enhance our presence in our largest market, North America."

As Heather and Rajiv clearly laid out, we're very excited about the opportunity to create a new kind of value for customers and patients in North America through the acquisition of Perrigo. Valued that can be experienced across every stage of life are much a range of acute and chronic conditions, in aisles of every pharmacy, as well as behind the counter. 
For instance, Mylan accounts for approximately 1 in every 13 prescription expense in the U.S., showcasing our reach with pharmacists and physicians while the majority of Perrigo's product portfolio is consumer facing. By adding Perrigo's large OTC and complementary generics portfolio to Mylan's extensive and existing product offering and commercial organization in North America, we're looking at a total offering of more than 430 generics and more than 1,900 SKUs and over 400 OTC product families.
In the U.S., Mylan and Perrigo enjoy long-standing relationships with the vast majority of retail pharmacies. Currently, 5 of Mylan's top customers account for more than 75% of our generic business. The continued consolidation of our customer base and remaining existing supply network has created a unique opportunity for Mylan and Perrigo to combine a front and back store portfolio that would allow our customers to meet patients need in a whole new way. 
Enhancing our position as a supplier of choice in North America means providing an agile supply of high-quality product, while ensuring the scale inefficiency our customers need to act quickly in today's ever evolving marketplace. 
Finally, strengthening our North American offering will build unmatched brand equity across every point in the patient's journey. From behind the counter to front store consumer facing offerings, the combination of Mylan Perrigo North America creates a one-of-a-kind opportunity to focus less on individual products or treatment categories and more on providing patient solutions.
Now let me turn the call back over to Rajiv."

As Heather stated earlier, these Complementary assets are expected to drive at least $800 million of annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year 4",270,"Thanks, Tony. On Slide 26, you can see that this transaction will generate significant synergies. As Heather stated earlier, these Complementary assets are expected to drive at least $800 million of annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year 4 following completion of the transaction. We have a lot of confidence in our synergy targets. I also know that the Irish takeover rules require such [indiscernible] mix in 2 [ph] period using a sound process and be independently focused on, in our case, by PWC and Goldman Sachs. .
As we said before, this team has a proven history of meeting the goals it sets for itself and oftentimes exceeding those goals. Though Mylan recognizes history and our synergy goals should be viewed in the context of what our team has been able to accomplish in the past. We believe we can leverage the sense of both organization to achieve our target, while at the same time, accelerate their growth of the combined company.
Given the scale of our platform, we see significant opportunities for enhanced efficiencies. This also will limit our need for planned expansion. As you will recall, Mylan had previously planned to increase its oral solid capacity to more than $80 billion, and this [indiscernible] beyond our goal.
We also see opportunities to do more with our combined R&D operations and work more efficiently as we develop products for GX and OTC markets. Please note that this target of at least $800 million doesn't take into account the sales growth potential we see from coming together.
Now let me turn the call over to John again."

As a result, we expect to maintain our investment grade credit rating after the transaction closes. With the addition of Perrigo, we would create an even stronger, larger and more diverse platform with about $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014. Importantly, the acquisition of Perrigo would be accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis.
Our strong balance sheet would enable the combined company to remain forward-looking and able to continue to pursue expansion through business development and acquisitions. Furthermore, there would be significant opportunity for meaningful growth, given the strength of the combined businesses, which pipeline of launches and opportunities to mean more to customers across business lines.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Heather to walk through this compelling transaction."
290203,292577670,804324,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Now let me discuss the legally binding commitment we announced on April 29 to make this combination a reality. Under Irish takeover rules, Mylan's roll 2.5 announcement means we are legally commitment to launch the offer and take this attrac",1010,"Thanks, John. Now let me discuss the legally binding commitment we announced on April 29 to make this combination a reality. Under Irish takeover rules, Mylan's roll 2.5 announcement means we are legally commitment to launch the offer and take this attractive proposal directly to Perrigo's shareholders, offering them certainty. This offer consists of $75 in cash and 2.3 Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, which based on Mylan's closing stock price of 68 36 on April, 8. The first day after overwhelming market reaction to our initial proposal, which equates to $232.23 per share.
This represents a multiple of approximately 25x Perrigo calendar year 2014 EBITDA pro forma for its recent acquisition of Omega Pharma, which compares favorably to recent transactions in our industry. 
After close, Perrigo shareholders will own approximately 39% of the combined company, while Mylan shareholders will own approximately 61%.
Turning to Slide 30. I'd like to reiterate importantly for Perrigo's shareholders, that there is a clear and certain path to completion of the transaction. We are confident that we can close the deal before the end of the year. We have committed financing in place and have already incurred significant non-refundable credit financing fees. We have already filed for HSR approval and made a Heller Highwater commitment with respect to U.S. antitrust clearance, and we've also started the pre-navigation process with the European Commission. Furthermore, our offer is not conditional in due diligence. We are in the process of preparing tender offer documentation for Perrigo's shareholders and believe that they will recognize the compelling nature of our offer.
Additionally, the process required to secure the Mylan shareholder vote is well underway. The Mylan shareholder meeting is expected to occur early in the third quarter, and we are confident in our ability to secure approval from Mylan shareholders.
Looking at Slide 31, it is clear we are not alone in seeing the potential of this combination. Perrigo share price was up [ph] 18% and Mylan share price was up 15% upon the initial announcement of the transaction on April 8. These share price spikes have occurred while the broader market have remained relatively stable, underscoring the market's belief in the logic of this transaction.
Further, as shown on Slide 32, analysts and other third parties also quickly recognize the compelling strategic rationale of this combination. Moving onto the next slide. Another way to think about the attractiveness of our offer for Perrigo shareholders is to consider EPS. 
At the midpoint of this guidance range, Perrigo expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $7.75 in 2015. Under Mylan's offer, Perrigo shareholders will get more than $10 in adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis, plus $75 per share in cash. Clearly, this adjusted EPS figure substantially more than Perrigo could achieve on a stand-alone basis or through pursuing alternative acquisitions.
In addition, Perrigo shareholders will continue to benefit from the combined company strong growth platform and future value creation.
Turning to Slide 34. I would like now to spend a few minutes addressing the dilution of this offer in a bit more detail. As you know, Perrigo has stated that they value our offer based on Mylan's closing price as of March 10, 2015. We think this is simply misleading for shareholders.
Once our offer was made public on April 8, the market spoke loud and clear as we already stated. The closing price on April 8 of $68.36 is the true unaffected share price, with which to calculate the value of our offer. Prior to April 8, the volume of shares traded and percent change of our stock price was entirely in line with normal averages discounting for the secondary offering of Abbott shares.
I would also like to note that the implied multiple of this offer is very much in line with previous President transaction. Regardless, of which Mylan share price he used to calculate it. Furthermore, the analyst price target of the combined Mylan. We need to measure the value creation with even the low end target of $70 representing a value exceeding $236 per share. Put simply, we believe and it is clear the market believes, our offer is significantly above the self-serving math that the Perrigo Board has been using. On Slide 35, you can see why in summary this proposal is the right choice for Mylan and Perrigo's shareholders.
This combination offers an attractive cash and stock proposal, the opportunity to participate in the future growth of the stronger combined company and a clear and certain task to completion. We believe this combination produces values above what Perrigo shareholders can expect on a stand-alone basis. Given the undeniable financial and strategic logic of this transaction, we still believe the engagement is in the best interest of our shareholders and other stakeholders of those company.
Finally, turning to Slide 36. We have said it throughout the call, that those who know Mylan know that we have clear and unwavering over the last decade about our vision and our strategy for the future. This decision have called for complementary and strategic transaction that enhance our company, while at the same time, achieving results for our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We have consistently managed the integration and execution of organic growth drivers to grow our earnings per share on a 27% compounded annual growth rate.
This world-class ability to execute to give us the confidence in achieving our target of at least $6 adjusted diluted EPS by 2018. Mylan does not use simply for the synergies needed to build a bridge to the next transaction. We are patient and persistent to find the right transactions that deliver on our vision and maintain our track record of steadily increasing shareholder return. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo is no different. We are excited about the potential for this transaction to create long-term, sustainable value for all stakeholders and look forward to advancing through this process rapidly.

And like, I think that if you look at our transactions historically, whether I go back to Matrix, which nobody saw the rationale at the time and do think that the what that was able to strategically will deliver from a vertical integration and the horizontal and is now, as I've said, how half of our operations and employees, really having, I think, one of the best global supply chain throughout the industry at a very cost-effective and efficient model. When I look at Merck, I don't need to remind any of those in the phone, but the transaction and what people, with those metrics are on a sheet of paper. But obviously, the commercial reach skill the that brought us overnight was being able to leverage then the matrix transaction, the Mylan platform. That's what have allowed us to grow to 27% CAGR over the last 8 years and continue to deliver that. So we see Perrigo no differently. We believe that the combination, what it will allow us to deliver to both shareholders will be substantial and would be better than either organization can do on a stand-alone basis."

Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan; and President, North America, Tony Mauro.
During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements may include without limitation statements about the proposed acquisition of Perrigo by Mylan, which I will refer to as the Perrigo Proposal; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the Abbott transaction, of Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the Abbott business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo Proposal or Abbott Transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan's, Perrigo's or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition and other expectations and targets for future periods.  Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo Proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatment of the Abbott Transaction and the Perrigo Proposal; changes in relevant tax and other loss; the integration of Perrigo and the Abbott business being more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; operating cost, customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo Proposal and the Abbott Transaction; the impact of competition, situations where we manufacture market and/or sell products notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V.'s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014, as well as our other filings with the SEC. These risks, as well as those other risk associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 and the proxy statement we are filing today in connection with the Perrigo proposal. We undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.
In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Please refer to today's earnings release and the slide deck used during today's call, both of which are available on our website, as they contain detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material new information or significant new opinion, which have not been publicly announced.

As promised, we've been busy since we last spoke to you on our fourth quarter earnings call. Our primary focus today will be on our strong first quarter results and on our legal binding commitment to acquire Perrigo. Mylan fully intends to comply with all requirements of the Irish Takeover Rules that govern this process. As such, we would like to caution investors that we will be limited in our ability to disclose certain forward-looking information.
Further during this call, we will not be discussing board or board-related matters. As such, we will not be speaking to Teva's unsolicited expression of interest or answering questions on this topic. We believe that our board's response speaks for itself.
Before I turn the call over to Rajiv and John, who will briefly review our first quarter earnings, I'd like to say hello and thank you to all Mylan employees around the world joining us on the call today, including our new Mylan EPD employees. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their hard work, dedication and continued focus and execution, all of which topped up to deliver the strong first quarter performance we will be discussing today."

As you can see on Slide 7, Mylan delivered solid first quarter results, kicking off what we believe will be yet another year of strong financial performance for the company. Sales during the quarter totale",577,"Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see on Slide 7, Mylan delivered solid first quarter results, kicking off what we believe will be yet another year of strong financial performance for the company. Sales during the quarter totaled nearly USD 1.9 billion, a constant-currency increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.70, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2014.
As highlighted on this slide, all of our regions within the Generics segment experienced strong constant-currency revenue growth, which was a result of new product introductions combined with positive impact, especially in Europe, of the acquisition of the non-U.S. EPD business. Within our Specialty segment, third-party net sales in the first quarter increased 8% compared to the prior year period as EpiPen Auto-Injector continued to experience volume growth. In addition, the integration of the recently acquired EPD Business is proceeding smoothly, and we already have begun realizing the substantial value we envision from this strategic transaction.
Turning to Slide 8. We have been very active during the first quarter with respect to execution of our growth drivers. For instance, recruitment for our comparative effectiveness study for generic Advair is nearly complete, and we look forward to getting back in front of FDA in next summer and remain on track for filing our ANDA by year end.
As you are aware, we have established a strategic collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for the development and commercialization of TD-4208, which is expected to be approved as a once-daily nebulized LAMA product for COPD patients. Our technical and clinical teams have been working diligently together, and we can now tell you that we expect to initiate our Phase III efficacy trials in the second half of this year. We also remain on track to launch our 2 other respiratory programs in Europe this year: generic Seretide MDI and generic Flixotide MDI. Similarly, with respect to our 2 Phase III studies for Glargine, we have completed recruitment for type 1 diabetes studies ahead of schedule, and we expect to wrap up recruitment for the type 2 diabetes study in July. We remain on track to commission our commercial manufacturing facility by this summer's end.
On the biologics front, we continue to progress with our partner, Biocon, on trastuzumab global Phase III trial. We are pleased to report that the Phase III trial for Paxil [indiscernible] is well underway, and we also have recently initiated our global Phase III study for adalimumab.
With regard to our ANDA for generic Copaxone, as previously stated, we responded to all FDA requests today. We remain fully confident that we are well positioned to receive approval for our application. The approval of the standard ANDA demonstrates that FDA is moving forward with approvals of substitutable generic version of this product. We are further encouraged by FDA's denial of Teva's 808 Patent petition [ph] . The FDA's response outlines their criteria for approval, and Mylan is confident that our ANDA meets each of these criteria.
We also completed the clinical equalness trial for, Estradiol vaginal cream as per FDA's guidance and look forward to the next steps to adding another complex product to our portfolio.
Finally, I would like to [indiscernible] our sincere sentiment by thanking our employees for their unwavering dedication to our cause of delivering better health for a better world. With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were $1.9 billion, which included 1 month of results from the established products business we acquired. Sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $93 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, the yen and the Australian dollar. However, on a constant-currency basis, revenues in our Generics segment increased 15% when compared to the prior year period, an increase that includes revenues of $147 million contributed from the EPD Business.
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 53%, up 240 basis points from the same prior year period. Our strong margins were primarily the result of new product introductions in North America combined with the positive contribution from the EPD Business.
R&D expense, on an adjusted basis, was $152 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continued to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect R&D spending, as a percentage of total revenues, to be within our guidance range for the full year. At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $409 million or approximately 22% of total revenues, which includes the impact of the EPD Business combined with our continued investment in the EpiPen Auto-Injector.
Our first quarter adjusted net income was $309 million or $0.70 per share, a 6% increase from our Q1 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.66 per share. Our adjusted diluted EPS was above our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of the significant currency headwinds we encountered.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $336 million, and first quarter capital spending was $48 million, as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.1:1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity, including our recently announced bridge credit agreement for the proposed Perrigo transaction, and we remain committed to our long-term leverage targets, which are consistent with investment grade.
To summarize, our first quarter provided an excellent start to 2015, and we remain committed to our 2015 guidance metrics, which we communicated during our Q4 2014 earnings call in March. For the second quarter 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.90 per share, which would be a 28% increase over the prior year quarter, and we remain confident in our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share.

Close to a decade ago, we laid out Mylan's vision and strategy and since pursued them relentlessly and consistently, never doing transactions for transaction's sake, never doing transactions whose main focus was cost synergies, never doing transactions for the sole purpose of lowering our tax rate. Instead, we have always focused on doing transactions that complement our strategy; support long-term, sustainable growth; allow us to further enhance and leverage what we've built; and help us move closer to achieving our vision of delivering better health for a better world to 7 billion people.
As we have demonstrated, Mylan aggressively pursued such transactions, and we have repeatedly stated that we would be using our enhanced financial flexibility to do other large deals. And for those of you who know Mylan well, we do what we say we're going to do.
The combination with Perrigo is simply the next important strategic step in our evolution and builds on our strong platform, consistent with our long-standing and clearly articulated vision and strategy. We have long believed the combination of Perrigo and Mylan represents an extraordinary opportunity. As you have seen through our actions over the past few weeks, we are committed to making this combination a reality. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo demonstrates clear and compelling industrial logic. The potential here is truly transformative and the transaction would redefine the delivery of global health care.
A combined Mylan and Perrigo would be ideally positioned at the forefront of the megatrends driving change throughout the health care industry, including the growing number of Rx-to-OTC switches underway. Together, we could better serve our customers and patients, create more opportunities for our employees and communities and generate additional value for our shareholders and stakeholders.
Mylan and Perrigo are highly complementary businesses, and together, we would have unmatched reach and impact. Each company augments the other's platform to create something that is better, not just bigger, in terms of portfolio and pipeline, commercial footprint, operational leverage across customer channels and manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.
Let me quickly highlight some of the key strategic and financial benefits of the transaction. As a combined company, we will have a meaningful presence across all customer channels, and we will have critical mass and leadership across Gx, Rx and OTC with one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolios. We will have the opportunity to offer our customers a compelling value proposition through a unique ability to deliver products and services in an environment where scale and reach are increasingly important. We will also have unmatched global scale and immense geographic reach in order to maximize this portfolio across existing and new markets. The scale and reach would improve patient access to affordable, high-quality medicine.
In addition to an enhanced commercial platform, we will have a massive global manufacturing platform and supply chain. This will provide a real critical advantage because it will allow us to deliver the reliability and cost advantages our customers have come to rely on.
We are well positioned to optimize the enhanced platform of the combined company as well as Mylan's strong brand equity to capitalize on trends shaping the health care industry and drive future growth and financial performance. The combined company will be a stronger, larger and more diverse business with approximately $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014 and significant free cash flow.
Importantly, the transaction is accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis. We expect to achieve annual pretax operational synergies of at least $800 million fully realizable by year 4 after closing. We also expect to maintain our investment-grade credit rating.
The strong industrial and financial rationale will redefine how we can deliver on our mission to provide the world's 7 billion people access to affordable, high-quality medicine.
Turning to Slide 12. You can see that this transaction aligns with our existing growth drivers, enhancing our capabilities in respiratory and complex products, providing access to new geographic markets while adding an exciting new opportunity in OTC. This broader platform enhances our ability to provide customers with health care solutions, not just products.
We have long thought that OTC could be a very important piece of the Mylan story and have carefully evaluated the best ways to expand our presence in this area. In fact, the acquisition of the EPD Business gave us a foothold in OTC. That platform would complement and enhance Perrigo's existing global growth plan.
Moving on to Slide 13. Importantly, our history of doing good and doing well would only be improved by this combination. Our broader product portfolio, significant commitment to R&D and larger cost advantage manufacturing platform would better position us to serve our patients and customers and further enhance our ability to provide access to medicines and bring new innovations to market. The transaction also would create more opportunities for employees because they would be part of a larger and even stronger organization with significant growth potential. We have a great admiration for Perrigo's management and workforce, and there would be opportunities for best practice sharing across the combined company.
Mylan has long been considered a partner of choice. Given our platform and geographic breadth, and this transaction would only enhance that positioning. The increased scale and significant free cash flows will directly enhance the position of our creditors and suppliers as well. And as we will outline in more detail now this transaction has significant potential for shareholder value creation.
You can't just buy your way to greatness. You have to earn it through execution and performance. Both Mylan and Perrigo shareholders can have great confidence in the value potential of the combined company based on our management team's proven ability to deliver shareholder value and achieve our goals through strategic, organic and inorganic growth initiatives. As we have outlined here on Slide 14, we have carefully pursued transactions in the past that enhance our strategic positioning in the industry and add key capabilities, expanding geographic reach or enhancing operations.
For instance, in 2007, we acquired Matrix and began building a horizontally and vertically integrated platform that today would be nearly impossible to replicate. Matrix also gave us a presence in India, which today is home to nearly half of our operations and employees. We subsequently built upon this transformational transaction, creating a global footprint that we now leverage to deliver high-quality products efficiently and cost effectively around the world.
Importantly, Mylan has the right team to execute and integrate this transaction. We have a strong track record of creating value from M&A and exceeding our synergy targets. Our integration of Merck's generics and specialty business is an example of exceeding our synergy target in a large transformative transaction. We delivered acquisition synergies of approximately $500 million from this deal, which was double our original target.
These transactions and continued consistent strong execution on our business have resulted in strong performance and value creation for our shareholders, as you can see on Slide 15. The team that delivered this double-digit top and bottom line growth and that integrated these prior deals is the team running this business today.
Our performance is best seen through our annualized 3-year total shareholder return, which is 50% higher than the S&P 500 pharma benchmark and more than double the S&P 500 over the same period. The current Mylan team also would benefit from the experience, expertise and institutional knowledge of core executives from the Perrigo and Omega team, and we have proposed to join the leadership team of the combined company precisely because we have great respect to what they have built.
Rajiv will now review how this combination will enhance our operational and commercial excellence."

I also am very excited about the potential of this transaction and the many opportunities that it would create for both Mylan and Perrigo.
On Slide 17, you can start to see how we will mean more to our customers as a result of this combination. We will have an impressive, diversified and differentiated product portfolio with an ability to offer all of our customers thousands of marketed products across Gx, Rx and OTC and across therapeutic categories and dosage forms.
The chart on this slide really spell out how the competition will expand and diversify both businesses' portfolios, including increasing Mylan's OTC offering from 2% of revenue to almost 30%. A combined Mylan and Perrigo would have an unmatched ability to serve the front and back of pharmacies and other retail locations. Mylan's portfolio would be further strengthened by Perrigo's strong and complementary positioning in nutritional and animal health products, which would allow us to bring even more value to customers around the world.
Turning to Slide 18. You can see how the combined company would be well placed to build and strengthen its existing portfolio by developing and commercializing new products. Both Mylan and Perrigo have robust pipeline in Gx and OTC opportunities. In the past few years, we have really distinguished ourselves from our peers through our ability to secure new approvals. For example, in 2014, we were the leading ANDA filer, and we currently have an impressive 269 ANDAs pending with FDA, including 44 first-to-file opportunities. We also have a track record of securing approvals across multiple countries and currently have more than 3,700 global filings pending regulatory approval. At the same time, Perrigo has an exciting opportunity ahead of its market trends in OTC, continue to move favorably in its direction. As Perrigo recently stated, it expects nearly $1 billion in total new product revenues over the next 3 years.
Mylan's efficiency and clear record of success in execution can play an important role in helping ensure that Perrigo captures the potential of these products around the world. In short, the combined company has a clear opportunity to further build its portfolio by bringing hundreds of new products to market every year across therapeutic categories and dosage forms and drive organic growth well into the future.
Turning to Slide 19. Mylan and Perrigo share many values, and we have great respect for what Perrigo has accomplished. One common area of focus for our companies is R&D and its ability to unlock future growth drivers as the global health care system continues to evolve. At Mylan, we have been talking about the exciting opportunities in biologics, respiratory and other complex products for some time now and we are making great progress in many of these areas.
Similarly, Perrigo's platform will continue to evolve through strategic R&D investments to capitalize on macro trends, especially the powerful and ongoing move from Rx to OTC and the opportunities for branded OTC expansions. This shared commitment to R&D, coupled with a proven ability to secure approvals, would continue to drive the growth of the combined company and position it to capitalize on the opportunities of the changing global health care industry.
On Slide 20, you can immediately see that the combined Mylan and Perrigo would have a massive vertically integrated manufacturing platform with 70 production sites around the world.
Moving on to the next slide. This combined platform will have annual capacity of more than 100 billion tablets and capsules, and leveraging capacity across the combined company's manufacturing platform will drive growth and our ability to bring products to market while minimizing the need for near-term investment in additional capacity.
This platform also will be differentiated by both companies' commitment to and track record of quality and proven ability to manage the entire global supply chain. All of this will give us the flexibility to deliver the quality, reliability and cost advantages that customers have come to rely upon.
In addition to our strong presence in oral products, we'll have broad capabilities across APIs, injectables, transdermals, semi solids, ointments, creams and liquids. Further, we are enhancing these capabilities with additional complex technology capabilities, including respiratory, biologics and insulin. In short, this platform would be a one-of-a-kind asset capable of delivering all of what our customers need today while supporting future growth.
Slide 22 demonstrates just how strong the company -- combined company's consumer focus platform would be. Together, Mylan and Perrigo would boast a broad portfolio of durable, market-leading, consumer-facing products across specialty, branded generics, nutritionals and OTC.
Mylan's strong existing consumer focus portfolio, which includes leading brands such as EpiPen, Brufen, Perforomist, and Creon among others, would be further strengthened by Perrigo's powerful brands such as Lactacyd, Physiomer and Paranix. This strong portfolio will be supported and further enhanced by Mylan's consistent investment in its brand equity across customer channels.
Moving to Slide 23. You can see what we mean by this combination, redefining the delivery of health care. With the addition of Perrigo, we would have an unmatched ability to deliver for all of our customers and ultimately, patients. We would have critical mass across all customer channels and would be able to leverage our operating platform and commercial best practices for customers in every segment especially the retail and pharmacy space.
We'll go to market as One Mylan with the ability to meet the critical needs of all our customers and patient groups and deliver meaningful health care solutions. Also, we'll be optimally positioned to capitalize on macro trends in the industry environment, including evolving distributor and peer dynamics, the need for increased scale and reach, and Rx-to-OTC switches.
Now let's turn to Slide 24 to look at how this impressive portfolio would be leveraged by a broad commercial footprint. The combined company would have a significant commercial presence covering approximately 145 countries worldwide. This global platform, which Perrigo doesn't have today, would de-risk Perrigo's early-stage global expansion efforts and create expansion and revenue growth opportunities by introducing Perrigo's products in these new geographies. Perrigo would also facilitate Mylan's entry into some new exciting geographies such as Mexico, Russia and Israel, providing opportunities to introduce Mylan's broad portfolio in these countries.
Further, the combination would optimize each company's platform in both North America and Europe. There is significant opportunity to drive additional value in Europe because Mylan could leverage its recently acquired assets from Abbott and Perrigo's recent acquisition of Omega to accelerate brand growth in the region. This will create greater opportunities for employees and allow us to better serve patients and customer in the region.
The EPD Business complements Mylan's Generic sales force in Europe because of its deep experience in specialty and branded generics. Through this transaction, Mylan's platform would be further enhanced by Omega's OTC sales force.
The complementary nature of Mylan and Perrigo platform would create additional growth opportunities through cross selling and sharing best practices. The opportunities in Europe are especially exciting given the unique dynamics of its pharmacy model.
I will now introduce Tony Mauro, President of North America, to provide you with the details on how this transaction would enhance our presence in our largest market, North America."
290203,292577670,804582,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone.

As Heather and Rajiv clearly laid out, we're very excited about the opportunity to create a new kind of value for customers and patients in North America through the acquisition of Perrigo. Value that can be experienced across every stage of life from a range of acute and chronic conditions in aisles of every pharmacy as well as behind the counter.
For instance, Mylan accounts for approximately 1 in every 13 prescriptions expense in the U.S., showcasing our reach with pharmacists and physicians, while the majority of Perrigo's product portfolio is consumer facing. By adding Perrigo's large OTC and complementary generics portfolio to Mylan's extensive and existing product offering and commercial organization in North America, we're looking at a total offering of more than 430 generics and more than 1,900 SKUs and over 400 OTC product families.
In the U.S., Mylan and Perrigo enjoy long-standing relationships with the vast majority of retail pharmacies. Currently, 5 of Mylan's top customers account for more than 75% of our generic business. The continued consolidation of our customer base and remaining existing supply network has created a unique opportunity for Mylan and Perrigo to combine a front- and back-store portfolio that would allow our customers to meet patients' needs in a whole new way. Enhancing our position as a supplier of choice in North America means providing an agile supply of high-quality products while ensuring the scale and efficiency our customers need to act quickly in today's ever evolving marketplace.
Finally, strengthening our North American offering will build unmatched brand equity across every point in the patient's journey. From behind the counter to front-store, consumer-facing offerings, the combination of Mylan and Perrigo North America creates a one-of-a-kind opportunity to focus less on individual products or treatment categories and more on providing patient solutions.
Now let me turn the call back over to Rajiv."

As Heather stated earlier, these complementary assets are expected to drive at least $800 million of annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year 4",269,"Thanks, Tony. On Slide 26, you can see that this transaction will generate significant synergies. As Heather stated earlier, these complementary assets are expected to drive at least $800 million of annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year 4 following completion of the transaction.
We have a lot of confidence in our synergy targets. I also know that the Irish Takeover Rules require such estimates be prepared using a sound process and be independently reported on, in our case, by PwC and Goldman Sachs.
As we said before, this team has a proven history of meeting the goals it sets for itself and oftentimes exceeding those goals. Those who know Mylan recognizes history, and our synergy goals should be viewed in the context of what our team has been able to accomplish in the past. We believe we can leverage the sense of both organizations to achieve our target while, at the same time, accelerate the growth of the combined company.
Given the scale of our platform, we see significant opportunities for enhanced efficiencies. This also will limit our need for planned expansion. As you will recall, Mylan had previously planned to increase its oral solid capacity to more than $80 billion, and this gets us beyond our goal.
We also see opportunities to do more with our combined R&D operations and work more efficiently as we develop products for Gx and OTC markets. Please note that this target of at least $800 million doesn't take into account the sales growth potential we see from coming together.

Strong profitability would drive substantial cash flow generation and support deleveraging as well as continued investment in new business development and R&D.
As a result, we expect to maintain our investment-grade credit rating after the transaction closes. With the addition of Perrigo, we would create an even stronger, larger and more diverse platform with about $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014. Importantly, the acquisition of Perrigo would be accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis.
Our strong balance sheet would enable the combined company to remain forward-looking and able to continue to pursue expansion through business development and acquisitions. Furthermore, there would be significant opportunity for meaningful growth given the strength of the combined businesses, rich pipeline of launches and opportunities to mean more to customers across business lines.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Heather to walk through this compelling transaction."
290203,292577670,804582,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Now let me discuss the legally binding commitment we announced on April 29 to make this combination a reality. Under Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan's Rule 2.5 announcement means we are legally committed to launch the offer and take this attract",1011,"Thanks, John. Now let me discuss the legally binding commitment we announced on April 29 to make this combination a reality. Under Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan's Rule 2.5 announcement means we are legally committed to launch the offer and take this attractive proposal directly to Perrigo's shareholders, offering them certainty. This offer consists of $75 in cash and 2.3 Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, which based on Mylan's closing stock price of $68.36 on April 8, the first day of -- after overwhelming market reaction to our initial proposal, which equates to $232.23 per share. This represents a multiple of approximately 25x Perrigo's calendar year 2014 EBITDA pro forma for its recent acquisition of Omega Pharma, which compares favorably to recent transactions in our industry. After close, Perrigo shareholders will own approximately 39% of the combined company, while Mylan shareholders will own approximately 61%.
Turning to Slide 30. I'd like to reiterate, importantly for Perrigo shareholders, that there is a clear and certain path to completion of the transaction. We are confident that we can close the deal before the end of the year. We have committed financing in place and have already incurred significant non-refundable committed financing fees. We have already filed for HSR approval and made a ""hell or high water"" commitment with respect to U.S. antitrust clearance. And we've also started the pre-notification process with the European Commission.
Furthermore, our offer is not conditional in due diligence. We are in the process of preparing tender offer documentation for Perrigo shareholders and believe that they will recognize the compelling nature of our offer.
Additionally, the process required to secure the Mylan shareholder vote is well underway. The Mylan shareholder meeting is expected to occur early in the third quarter, and we are confident in our ability to secure approval from Mylan shareholders.
Looking at Slide 31. It is clear we are not alone in seeing the potential of this combination. Perrigo's share price was up 18%, and Mylan's share price was up 15% upon the initial announcement of the transaction on April 8. These share price spikes have occurred while the broader market has remained relatively stable, underscoring the market's belief in the logic of this transaction.
Further, as shown on Slide 32, analysts and other third parties also quickly recognize the compelling strategic rationale of this combination.
Moving onto the next slide. Another way to think about the attractiveness of our offer for Perrigo shareholders is to consider EPS. At the midpoint of its guidance range, Perrigo expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $7.75 in 2015. Under Mylan's offer, Perrigo shareholders will get more than $10 in adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis plus $75 per share in cash. Clearly, this adjusted EPS figure is substantially more than Perrigo could achieve on a stand-alone basis or through pursuing alternative acquisition. In addition, Perrigo shareholders will continue to benefit from the combined company's strong growth platform and future value creation.
Turning to Slide 34. I would like now to spend a few minutes addressing the valuation of this offer in a bit more detail. As you know, Perrigo has stated that they value our offer based on Mylan's closing price as of March 10, 2015. We think this is simply misleading for shareholders. Once our offer was made public on April 8, the market spoke loud and clear as we already stated. The closing price on April 8 of $68.36 is the true unaffected share price with which to calculate the value of our offer. Prior to April 8, the volume of shares traded and percent change of our stock price was entirely in line with normal averages discounting for the secondary offering of Abbott shares.
I would also like to note that the implied multiple of this offer is very much in line with previous precedent transactions regardless of which Mylan share price you use to calculate it. Furthermore, the analyst price target of the combined Mylan, Perrigo clearly demonstrates the value creation with even a the low-end target of $70 representing a value exceeding $236 per share. Put simply, we believe and it is clear the market believes our offer is significantly above the self-serving math that the Perrigo board has been using.
On Slide 35, you can see why, in summary, this proposal is the right choice for Mylan and Perrigo shareholders. This combination offers an attractive cash and stock proposal, the opportunity to participate in the future growth of a stronger combined company and a clear and certain path to completion. We believe this combination produces values above what Perrigo shareholders can expect on a stand-alone basis. Given the undeniable financial and strategic logic of this transaction, we still believe engagement is in the best interest of our shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies.
Finally, turning to Slide 36. We have said it throughout the call that those who know Mylan know that we have been clear and unwavering over the last decade about our vision and our strategy for the future. This vision has called for complementary and strategic transactions that enhance our company while at the same time achieving results for our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We have consistently managed the integration and execution of organic growth drivers to grow our earnings per share on a 27% compounded annual growth rate. This world-class ability to execute gives us the confidence in achieving our target of at least $6 adjusted diluted EPS by 2018.
Mylan does not use yield simply for the synergies needed to build a bridge to the next transaction. We are patient and persistent to find the right transactions that deliver on our vision and maintain our track record of steadily increasing shareholder return. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo is no different. We are excited about the potential for this transaction to create long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders and look forward to advancing through this process rapidly.
Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

And I think that if you look at our transactions historically, whether I go back to Matrix, which nobody saw the rationale at the time and to think that the -- what that was able to strategically deliver from a vertical integration and a horizontal and is now as I've said, has half of our operations and employees, really having, I think, one of the best global supply chains throughout the industry at a very cost-effective and efficient model. When I look at Merck, I don't need to remind any of those on the phone what that transaction and what people, what those metrics are on a sheet of paper. But obviously, the commercial reach and scale that, that brought us overnight was being able to leverage then the Matrix transaction, the Mylan platform.

We will have the addition of the EPD Business in the second half -- fully consolidated in the second half of the year, and we're really excited here from the initial performance in the first quarter and into the first month of the second quarter. So I think all of those things will contribute to a very strong second half of the year for our business."

But what I will say is that, as you can imagine, when you're able to bring a very holistic view and as Tony talked about, bringing this value proposition, especially here in the United States, a very consolidated customer base and payer base that we have today, having this broad portfolio allows us to think about, really, the delivery of patient solutions and thinking about front of the store, back of the store and how to uniquely come to market. So I just would say there's many opportunities, both throughout U.S. as well as Europe, as we've talked about, kind of their unique pharmacy model certainly provides for cross channel, cross selling between the physician channel as well as the pharmacy channel. And when you think about now the current Mylan infrastructure in Europe with our Mylan EPD, our retail pharmacy sales force now in combination with the Omega sales force, there would really be a true trifecta of coming to that market across all channels and really being able to optimize these assets across the globe."

It's really about not doing transactions just based on synergies. It's really about the complementary and strategic and compelling offering that we're going to be able to offer to our customers and patients.

And then, John, I was a little bit confused by the way you answered one of the previous questions with respect to how much the Abbott business contributed. So like, for instance, with the Rest of the World, I thought you said that the base and then the EPD were both equal as far as the growth.

So we're still very happy to see that market continuing to expand by our efforts around education and awareness, and that's continuing to take our disproportionate share of that. So we're looking forward and ramping up for a big allergy season. My understanding is because of the extreme cold weather that leads to perhaps even a more robust allergy season.

Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan; and President, North America, Tony Mauro.
During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition of Perrigo by Mylan, which I will refer to as the Perrigo Proposal; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the Abbott transaction, of Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the Abbott business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo Proposal or Abbott Transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan's, Perrigo's or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition and other expectations and targets for future periods.  Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo Proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatment of the Abbott Transaction and the Perrigo Proposal; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of Perrigo and the Abbott business being more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; operating cost, customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo Proposal and the Abbott Transaction; the impact of competition, situations where we manufacture market and/or sell products notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V.'s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014, as well as our other filings with the SEC. These risks, as well as those other risk associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 and the proxy statement we are filing today in connection with the Perrigo proposal. We undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.
In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Please refer to today's earnings release and the slide deck used during today's call, both of which are available on our website, as they contain detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material new information or significant new opinions, which have not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares in Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult their professional advisers.
Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.

As you can see on Slide 7, Mylan delivered solid first quarter results, kicking off what we believe will be yet another year of strong financial performance for the company. Sales during the quarter totaled nearly USD 1.9 billion, a constant-currency increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.70, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2014.
As highlighted on this slide, all of our regions within the Generics segment experienced strong constant-currency revenue growth, which was a result of new product introductions combined with positive impact, especially in Europe, of the acquisition of the non-U.S. EPD business. Within our Specialty segment, third-party net sales in the first quarter increased 8% compared to the prior year period as EpiPen Auto-Injector continued to experience volume growth. In addition, the integration of the recently acquired EPD Business is proceeding smoothly, and we already have begun realizing the substantial value we envision from this strategic transaction.
Turning to Slide 8. We have been very active during the first quarter with respect to execution of our growth drivers. For instance, recruitment for our comparative effectiveness study for generic Advair is nearly complete, and we look forward to getting back in front of FDA in late summer and remain on track for filing our ANDA by year end.
As you are aware, we have established a strategic collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for the development and commercialization of TD-4208, which is expected to be approved as a once-daily nebulized LAMA product for COPD patients. Our technical and clinical teams have been working diligently together, and we can now tell you that we expect to initiate our Phase III efficacy trials in the second half of this year. We also remain on track to launch our 2 other respiratory programs in Europe this year: generic Seretide MDI and generic Flixotide MDI. Similarly, with respect to our 2 Phase III studies for Glargine, we have completed recruitment for type 1 diabetes studies ahead of schedule, and we expect to wrap up recruitment for the type 2 diabetes study in July. We remain on track to commission our commercial manufacturing facility by this summer's end.
On the biologics front, we continue to progress with our partner, Biocon, on trastuzumab global Phase III trial. We are pleased to report that the Phase III trial for Paxil glastin [ph] is well underway, and we also have recently initiated our global Phase III study for adalimumab.
With regard to our ANDA for generic Copaxone, as previously stated, we responded to all FDA requests today. We remain fully confident that we are well positioned to receive approval for our application. The approval of the standard ANDA demonstrates that FDA is moving forward with approvals of substitutable generic version of this product. We are further encouraged by FDA's denial of Teva's eighth citizen petition . The FDA's response outlines their criteria for approval, and Mylan is confident that our ANDA meets each of these criteria.
We also completed the clinical equalness trial for, Estradiol vaginal cream as per FDA's guidance and look forward to the next steps to adding another complex product to our portfolio.
Finally, I would like to echo Heather's sincere sentiment by thanking our employees for their unwavering dedication to our cause of delivering better health for a better world. With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were $1.9 billion, which included 1 month of results from the established products business we acquired. Sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $93 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, the yen and the Australian dollar. However, on a constant-currency basis, revenues in our Generics segment increased 15% when compared to the prior year period, an increase that includes revenues of $147 million contributed from the EPD Business.
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 53%, up 240 basis points from the same prior year period. Our strong margins were primarily the result of new product introductions in North America combined with the positive contribution from the EPD Business.
R&D expense, on an adjusted basis, was $152 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continued to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect R&D spending, as a percentage of total revenues, to be within our guidance range for the full year. At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $409 million or approximately 22% of total revenues, which includes the impact of the EPD Business combined with our continued investment in the EpiPen Auto-Injector.
Our first quarter adjusted net income was $309 million or $0.70 per share, a 6% increase from our Q1 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.66 per share. Our adjusted diluted EPS was above our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of the significant currency headwinds we encountered.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $336 million, and first quarter capital spending was $48 million, as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.1:1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity, including our recently announced bridge credit agreement for the proposed Perrigo transaction, and we remain committed to our long-term leverage targets, which are consistent with investment grade.
To summarize, our first quarter provided an excellent start to 2015, and we remain committed to our 2015 guidance metrics, which we communicated during our Q4 2014 earnings call in March. For the second quarter 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.90 per share, which would be a 28% increase over the prior year quarter, and we remain confident in our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Heather."

Close to a decade ago, we laid out Mylan's vision and strategy and since pursued them relentlessly and consistently, never doing transactions for transaction's sake, never doing transactions whose main focus was cost synergies, never doing transactions for the sole purpose of lowering our tax rate. Instead, we have always focused on doing transactions that complement our strategy, support long-term sustainable growth, allow us to further enhance and leverage what we've built and help us move closer to achieving our vision of delivering better health for a better world to 7 billion people.
As we have demonstrated, Mylan aggressively pursued such transactions, and we have repeatedly stated that we would be using our enhanced financial flexibility to do other large deals. And for those of you who know Mylan well, we do what we say we're going to do.
The combination with Perrigo is simply the next important strategic step in our evolution and builds on our strong platform, consistent with our long-standing and clearly articulated vision and strategy. We have long believed the combination of Perrigo and Mylan represents an extraordinary opportunity. As you have seen through our actions over the past few weeks, we are committed to making this combination a reality. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo demonstrates clear and compelling industrial logic. The potential here is truly transformative and the transaction would redefine the delivery of global health care.
A combined Mylan and Perrigo would be ideally positioned at the forefront of the megatrends driving change throughout the health care industry, including the growing number of Rx-to-OTC switches underway. Together, we could better serve our customers and patients, create more opportunities for our employees and communities and generate additional value for our shareholders and stakeholders.
Mylan and Perrigo are highly complementary businesses, and together, we would have unmatched reach and impact. Each company augments the other's platform to create something that is better, not just bigger, in terms of portfolio and pipeline, commercial footprint, operational leverage across customer channels and manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.
Let me quickly highlight some of the key strategic and financial benefits of the transaction. As a combined company, we will have a meaningful presence across all customer channels, and we will have critical mass and leadership across Gx, Rx and OTC with one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolios. We will have the opportunity to offer our customers a compelling value proposition through a unique ability to deliver products and services in an environment where scale and reach are increasingly important. We will also have unmatched global scale and immense geographic reach in order to maximize this portfolio across existing and new markets. The scale and reach would improve patient access to affordable, high-quality medicine.
In addition to an enhanced commercial platform, we will have a massive global manufacturing platform and supply chain. This will provide a real critical advantage because it will allow us to deliver the reliability and cost advantages our customers have come to rely on.
We are well positioned to optimize the enhanced platform of the combined company as well as Mylan's strong brand equity to capitalize on trends shaping the health care industry and drive future growth and financial performance. The combined company will be a stronger, larger and more diverse business with approximately $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014 and significant free cash flow.
Importantly, the transaction is accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis. We expect to achieve annual pretax operational synergies of at least $800 million fully realizable by year 4 after closing. We also expect to maintain our investment-grade credit rating.
The strong industrial and financial rationale will redefine how we can deliver on our mission to provide the world's 7 billion people access to affordable, high-quality medicine.
Turning to Slide 12. You can see that this transaction aligns with our existing growth drivers, enhancing our capabilities in respiratory and complex products, providing access to new geographic markets while adding an exciting new opportunity in OTC. This broader platform enhances our ability to provide customers with health care solutions, not just products.
We have long thought that OTC could be a very important piece of the Mylan story and have carefully evaluated the best ways to expand our presence in this area. In fact, the acquisition of the EPD Business gave us a foothold in OTC. That platform would complement and enhance Perrigo's existing global growth plan.
Moving on to Slide 13. Importantly, our history of doing good and doing well would only be improved by this combination. Our broader product portfolio, significant commitment to R&D and larger cost-advantaged manufacturing platform would better position us to serve our patients and customers and further enhance our ability to provide access to medicines and bring new innovations to market. The transaction also would create more opportunities for employees because they would be part of a larger and even stronger organization with significant growth potential. We have a great admiration for Perrigo's management and workforce, and there would be opportunities for best practice sharing across the combined company.
Mylan has long been considered a partner of choice. Given our platform and geographic breadth, and this transaction would only enhance that positioning. The increased scale and significant free cash flows will directly enhance the position of our creditors and suppliers as well. And as we will outline in more detail now this transaction has significant potential for shareholder value creation.
You can't just buy your way to greatness. You have to earn it through execution and performance. Both Mylan and Perrigo shareholders can have great confidence in the value potential of the combined company based on our management team's proven ability to deliver shareholder value and achieve our goals through strategic, organic and inorganic growth initiatives. As we have outlined here on Slide 14, we have carefully pursued transactions in the past that enhance our strategic positioning in the industry and add key capabilities, expanding geographic reach or enhancing operations.
For instance, in 2007, we acquired Matrix and began building a horizontally and vertically integrated platform that today would be nearly impossible to replicate. Matrix also gave us a presence in India, which today is home to nearly half of our operations and employees. We subsequently built upon this transformational transaction, creating a global footprint that we now leverage to deliver high-quality products efficiently and cost effectively around the world.
Importantly, Mylan has the right team to execute and integrate this transaction. We have a strong track record of creating value from M&A and exceeding our synergy targets. Our integration of Merck's generics and specialty business is an example of exceeding our synergy target in a large transformative transaction. We delivered acquisition synergies of approximately $500 million from this deal, which was double our original target.
These transactions and continued consistent strong execution on our business have resulted in strong performance and value creation for our shareholders, as you can see on Slide 15. The team that delivered this double-digit top and bottom line growth and that integrated these prior deals is the team running this business today.
Our performance is best seen through our annualized 3-year total shareholder return, which is 50% higher than the S&P 500 pharma benchmark and more than double the S&P 500 over the same period. The current Mylan team also would benefit from the experience, expertise and institutional knowledge of core executives from the Perrigo and Omega team, and we have proposed to join the leadership team of the combined company precisely because we have great respect to what they have built.
Rajiv will now review how this combination will enhance our operational and commercial excellence."

I also am very excited about the potential of this transaction and the many opportunities that it would create for both Mylan and Perrigo.
On Slide 17, you can start to see how we will mean more to our customers as a result of this combination. We will have an impressive, diversified and differentiated product portfolio with an ability to offer all of our customers thousands of marketed products across Gx, Rx and OTC and across therapeutic categories and dosage forms.
The chart on this slide really spell out how the competition will expand and diversify both businesses' portfolios, including increasing Mylan's OTC offering from 2% of revenue to almost 30%. A combined Mylan and Perrigo would have an unmatched ability to serve the front and back of pharmacies and other retail locations. Mylan's portfolio would be further strengthened by Perrigo's strong and complementary positioning in nutritional and animal health products, which would allow us to bring even more value to customers around the world.
Turning to Slide 18. You can see how the combined company would be well placed to build and strengthen its existing portfolio by developing and commercializing new products. Both Mylan and Perrigo have robust pipeline in Gx and OTC opportunities. In the past few years, we have really distinguished ourselves from our peers through our ability to secure new approvals. For example, in 2014, we were the leading ANDA filer, and we currently have an impressive 269 ANDAs pending with FDA, including 44 first-to-file opportunities. We also have a track record of securing approvals across multiple countries and currently have more than 3,700 global filings pending regulatory approval. At the same time, Perrigo has an exciting opportunity ahead of its market trends in OTC, continue to move favorably in its direction. As Perrigo recently stated, it expects nearly $1 billion in total new product revenues over the next 3 years.
Mylan's efficiency and clear record of success in execution can play an important role in helping ensure that Perrigo captures the potential of these products around the world. In short, the combined company has a clear opportunity to further build its portfolio by bringing hundreds of new products to market every year across therapeutic categories and dosage forms and drive organic growth well into the future.
Turning to Slide 19. Mylan and Perrigo share many values, and we have great respect for what Perrigo has accomplished. One common area of focus for our companies is R&D and its ability to unlock future growth drivers as the global health care system continues to evolve. At Mylan, we have been talking about the exciting opportunities in biologics, respiratory and other complex products for some time now and we are making great progress in many of these areas.
Similarly, Perrigo's platform will continue to evolve through strategic R&D investments to capitalize on macro trends, especially the powerful and ongoing move from Rx to OTC and the opportunities for branded OTC expansions. This shared commitment to R&D, coupled with a proven ability to secure approvals, would continue to drive the growth of the combined company and position it to capitalize on the opportunities of the changing global health care industry.
On Slide 20, you can immediately see that the combined Mylan and Perrigo would have a massive vertically integrated manufacturing platform with 70 production sites around the world.
Moving on to the next slide. This combined platform will have annual capacity of more than 100 billion tablets and capsules, and leveraging capacity across the combined company's manufacturing platform will drive growth and our ability to bring products to market while minimizing the need for near-term investment in additional capacity.
This platform also will be differentiated by both companies' commitment to and track record of quality and proven ability to manage the entire global supply chain. All of this will give us the flexibility to deliver the quality, reliability and cost advantages that customers have come to rely upon.
In addition to our strong presence in oral products, we'll have broad capabilities across APIs, injectables, transdermals, semi solids, ointments, creams and liquids. Further, we are enhancing these capabilities with additional complex technology capabilities, including respiratory, biologics and insulin. In short, this platform would be a one-of-a-kind asset capable of delivering all of what our customers need today while supporting future growth.
Slide 22 demonstrates just how strong the company -- combined company's consumer focus platform would be. Together, Mylan and Perrigo would boast a broad portfolio of durable, market-leading, consumer-facing products across specialty, branded generics, nutritionals and OTC.
Mylan's strong existing consumer focus portfolio, which includes leading brands such as EpiPen, Brufen, Perforomist, and Creon among others, would be further strengthened by Perrigo's powerful brands such as Lactacyd, Physiomer and Paranix. This strong portfolio will be supported and further enhanced by Mylan's consistent investment in its brand equity across customer channels.
Moving to Slide 23. You can see what we mean by this combination, redefining the delivery of health care. With the addition of Perrigo, we would have an unmatched ability to deliver for all of our customers and ultimately, patients. We would have critical mass across all customer channels and would be able to leverage our operating platform and commercial best practices for customers in every segment especially the retail and pharmacy space.
We'll go to market as One Mylan with the ability to meet the critical needs of all our customers and patient groups and deliver meaningful health care solutions. Also, we'll be optimally positioned to capitalize on macro trends in the industry environment, including evolving distributor and peer dynamics, the need for increased scale and reach, and Rx-to-OTC switches.
Now let's turn to Slide 24 to look at how this impressive portfolio would be leveraged by a broad commercial footprint. The combined company would have a significant commercial presence covering approximately 145 countries worldwide. This global platform, which Perrigo doesn't have today, would de-risk Perrigo's early-stage global expansion efforts and create expansion and revenue growth opportunities by introducing Perrigo's products in these new geographies. Perrigo would also facilitate Mylan's entry into some new exciting geographies such as Mexico, Russia and Israel, providing opportunities to introduce Mylan's broad portfolio in these countries.
Further, the combination would optimize each company's platform in both North America and Europe. There is significant opportunity to drive additional value in Europe because Mylan could leverage its recently acquired assets from Abbott and Perrigo's recent acquisition of Omega to accelerate brand growth in the region. This will create greater opportunities for employees and allow us to better serve patients and customer in the region.
The EPD Business complements Mylan's Generic sales force in Europe because of its deep experience in specialty and branded generics. Through this transaction, Mylan's platform would be further enhanced by Omega's OTC sales force.
The complementary nature of Mylan and Perrigo platform would create additional growth opportunities through cross selling and sharing best practices. The opportunities in Europe are especially exciting given the unique dynamics of its pharmacy model.
I will now introduce Tony Mauro, President of North America, to provide you with the details on how this transaction would enhance our presence in our largest market, North America."
290203,292577670,804679,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone.

As Heather and Rajiv clearly laid out, we're very excited about the opportunity to create a new kind of value for customers and patients in North America through the acquisition of Perrigo. Value that can be experienced across every stage of life from a range of acute and chronic conditions in aisles of every pharmacy as well as behind the counter.
For instance, Mylan accounts for approximately 1 in every 13 prescriptions dispensed in the U.S., showcasing our reach with pharmacists and physicians, while the majority of Perrigo's product portfolio is consumer facing. By adding Perrigo's large OTC and complementary generics portfolio to Mylan's extensive and existing product offering and commercial organization in North America, we're looking at a total offering of more than 430 generics and more than 1,900 SKUs and over 400 OTC product families.
In the U.S., Mylan and Perrigo enjoy long-standing relationships with the vast majority of retail pharmacies. Currently, 5 of Mylan's top customers account for more than 75% of our generic business. The continued consolidation of our customer base and remaining existing supply network has created a unique opportunity for Mylan and Perrigo to combine a front- and back-store portfolio that would allow our customers to meet patients' needs in a whole new way. Enhancing our position as a supplier of choice in North America means providing an agile supply of high-quality products while ensuring the scale and efficiency our customers need to act quickly in today's ever evolving marketplace.
Finally, strengthening our North American offering will build unmatched brand equity across every point in the patient's journey. From behind the counter to front-store, consumer-facing offerings, the combination of Mylan and Perrigo North America creates a one-of-a-kind opportunity to focus less on individual products or treatment categories and more on providing patient solutions.
Now let me turn the call back over to Rajiv."

On Slide 26, you can see that this transaction will generate significant synergies. As Heather stated earlier, these complementary assets are expected to drive at least $800 million of annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year 4",270,"Thanks, Tony. On Slide 26, you can see that this transaction will generate significant synergies. As Heather stated earlier, these complementary assets are expected to drive at least $800 million of annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year 4 following completion of the transaction.
We have a lot of confidence in our synergy targets. I also know that the Irish Takeover Rules require such estimates be prepared using a sound process and be independently reported on, in our case, by PwC and Goldman Sachs.
As we said before, this team has a proven history of meeting the goals it sets for itself and oftentimes exceeding those goals. Those who know Mylan recognize this history, and our synergy goals should be viewed in the context of what our team has been able to accomplish in the past. We believe we can leverage the sense of both organizations to achieve our target while, at the same time, accelerate the growth of the combined company.
Given the scale of our platform, we see significant opportunities for enhanced efficiencies. This also will limit our need for planned expansion. As you will recall, Mylan had previously planned to increase its oral solid capacity to more than $80 billion, and this gets us beyond our goal.
We also see opportunities to do more with our combined R&D operations and work more efficiently as we develop products for Gx and OTC markets. Please note that this target of at least $800 million doesn't take into account the sales growth potential we see from coming together.
Now let me turn the call over to John again."

Strong profitability would drive substantial cash flow generation and support deleveraging as well as continued investment in new business development and R&D.
As a result, we expect to maintain our investment-grade credit rating after the transaction closes. With the addition of Perrigo, we would create an even stronger, larger and more diverse platform with about $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014. Importantly, the acquisition of Perrigo would be accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis.
Our strong balance sheet would enable the combined company to remain forward-looking and able to continue to pursue expansion through business development and acquisition. Furthermore, there would be significant opportunity for meaningful growth given the strength of the combined businesses, rich pipeline of launches and opportunities to mean more to customers across business lines.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Heather to walk through this compelling transaction."
290203,292577670,804679,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Now let me discuss the legally binding commitment we announced on April 29 to make this combination a reality. Under Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan's Rule 2.5 announcement means we are legally committed to launch the offer and take this attract",1011,"Thanks, John. Now let me discuss the legally binding commitment we announced on April 29 to make this combination a reality. Under Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan's Rule 2.5 announcement means we are legally committed to launch the offer and take this attractive proposal directly to Perrigo's shareholders, offering them certainty. This offer consists of $75 in cash and 2.3 Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, which based on Mylan's closing stock price of $68.36 on April 8, the first day of -- after overwhelming market reaction to our initial proposal, which equates to $232.23 per share. This represents a multiple of approximately 25x Perrigo's calendar year 2014 EBITDA pro forma for its recent acquisition of Omega Pharma, which compares favorably to recent transactions in our industry. After close, Perrigo shareholders will own approximately 39% of the combined company, while Mylan shareholders will own approximately 61%.
Turning to Slide 30. I'd like to reiterate, importantly for Perrigo shareholders, that there is a clear and certain path to completion of the transaction. We are confident that we can close the deal before the end of the year. We have committed financing in place and have already incurred significant non-refundable committed financing fees. We have already filed for HSR approval and made a ""hell or high water"" commitment with respect to U.S. antitrust clearance. And we've also started the pre-notification process with the European Commission.
Furthermore, our offer is not conditional in due diligence. We are in the process of preparing tender offer documentation for Perrigo shareholders and believe that they will recognize the compelling nature of our offer.
Additionally, the process required to secure the Mylan shareholder vote is well underway. The Mylan shareholder meeting is expected to occur early in the third quarter, and we are confident in our ability to secure approval from Mylan shareholders.
Looking at Slide 31. It is clear we are not alone in seeing the potential of this combination. Perrigo's share price was up 18%, and Mylan's share price was up 15% upon the initial announcement of the transaction on April 8. These share price spikes have occurred while the broader market has remained relatively stable, underscoring the market's belief in the logic of this transaction.
Further, as shown on Slide 32, analysts and other third parties also quickly recognize the compelling strategic rationale of this combination.
Moving onto the next slide. Another way to think about the attractiveness of our offer for Perrigo shareholders is to consider EPS. At the midpoint of its guidance range, Perrigo expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $7.75 in 2015. Under Mylan's offer, Perrigo shareholders will get more than $10 in adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis plus $75 per share in cash. Clearly, this adjusted EPS figure is substantially more than Perrigo could achieve on a stand-alone basis or through pursuing alternative acquisitions. In addition, Perrigo shareholders will continue to benefit from the combined company's strong growth platform and future value creation.
Turning to Slide 34. I would like now to spend a few minutes addressing the valuation of this offer in a bit more detail. As you know, Perrigo has stated that they value our offer based on Mylan's closing price as of March 10, 2015. We think this is simply misleading for shareholders. Once our offer was made public on April 8, the market spoke loud and clear as we already stated. The closing price on April 8 of $68.36 is the true unaffected share price with which to calculate the value of our offer. Prior to April 8, the volume of shares traded and percent change of our stock price was entirely in line with normal averages discounting for the secondary offering of Abbott shares.
I would also like to note that the implied multiple of this offer is very much in line with previous precedent transactions regardless of which Mylan share price you use to calculate it. Furthermore, the analyst price targets of the combined Mylan, Perrigo clearly demonstrates the value creation with even a the low-end target of $70 representing a value exceeding $236 per share. Put simply, we believe and it is clear the market believes our offer is significantly above the self-serving math that the Perrigo board has been using.
On Slide 35, you can see why, in summary, this proposal is the right choice for Mylan and Perrigo shareholders. This combination offers an attractive cash and stock proposal, the opportunity to participate in the future growth of a stronger combined company and a clear and certain path to completion. We believe this combination produces value above what Perrigo shareholders can expect on a stand-alone basis. Given the undeniable financial and strategic logic of this transaction, we still believe engagement is in the best interest of our shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies.
Finally, turning to Slide 36. We have said it throughout the call that those who know Mylan know that we have been clear and unwavering over the last decade about our vision and our strategy for the future. This vision has called for complementary and strategic transactions that enhance our company while at the same time achieving results for our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We have consistently managed the integration and execution of organic growth drivers to grow our earnings per share on a 27% compounded annual growth rate. This world-class ability to execute gives us the confidence in achieving our target of at least $6 adjusted diluted EPS by 2018.
Mylan does not do deals simply for the synergies needed to build a bridge to the next transaction. We are patient and persistent to find the right transactions that deliver on our vision and maintain our track record of steadily increasing shareholder return. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo is no different. We are excited about the potential for this transaction to create long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders and look forward to advancing through this process rapidly.
Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Now you see that we were in the middle of the Abbott Transaction, and Perrigo was in the middle of the Omega transaction. So for us, it just became now a matter of after we were able to get the Abbott Transaction closed, we said that we were going to be aggressively pursuing a transactions that the financial flexibility that the Abbott Transaction would afford us, we would be putting immediately to work.

This is truly about what -- how Mylan is uniquely positioned, Perrigo is uniquely positioned. We think these are 2 best-in-class assets that, as we come together, the value creation that we are looking at is for, like I said, not just near and mid, which we will deliver value, but the sustainable long-term value creation and proposition of truly redefining global health care. And I think that if you look at our transactions historically, whether I go back to Matrix, which nobody saw the rationale at the time and to think that the -- what that was able to strategically deliver from a vertical integration and a horizontal and is now as I've said, has half of our operations and employees, really having, I think, one of the best global supply chains throughout the industry at a very cost-effective and efficient model. 
When I look at Merck, I don't need to remind any of those on the phone what that transaction and what people -- what those metrics are on a sheet of paper. But obviously, the commercial reach and scale that, that brought us overnight was being able to leverage then the Matrix transaction, the Mylan platform. That's what has allowed us to grow to 27% CAGR over the last 8 years and continue to deliver that. So we see Perrigo no differently. We believe that the combination, what it will allow us to deliver to both shareholders will be substantial and would be better than either organization can do on a stand-alone basis."

But what I will say is that, as you can imagine, when you're able to bring a very holistic view and as Tony talked about, bringing this value proposition, especially here in the United States, a very consolidated customer base and payer base that we have today, having this broad portfolio allows us to think about, really, the delivery of patient solutions and thinking about front of the store, back of the store and how to uniquely come to market. So I just would say there's many opportunities, both throughout U.S. as well as Europe, as we've talked about, kind of their unique pharmacy model certainly provides for cross channel, cross selling between the physician channel as well as the pharmacy channel. And when you think about now the current Mylan infrastructure in Europe with our Mylan EPD, our retail pharmacy sales force now in combination with the Omega sales force, there would really be a true trifecta of coming to that market across all channels and really being able to optimize these assets across the globe."

As far as the fully synergized amount, obviously, as you're familiar with the Irish Takeover Rule, I think that the best way to think about it is -- again, I'm going to get back to our other transactions. It's really about not doing transactions just based on synergies. It's really about the complementary and strategic and compelling offering that we're going to be able to offer to our customers and patients.

So we're still very happy to see that market continuing to expand by our efforts around education and awareness, and that's continuing to take our disproportionate share of that. So we're looking forward and ramping up for a big allergy season. My understanding is because of the extreme cold weather that leads to perhaps even a more robust allergy season.

Sales during the quarter totale",577,"Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see on Slide 7, Mylan delivered solid first quarter results, kicking off what we believe will be yet another year of strong financial performance for the company. Sales during the quarter totaled nearly USD 1.9 billion, a constant-currency increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.70, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2014.
As highlighted on this slide, all of our regions within the Generics segment experienced strong constant-currency revenue growth, which was a result of new product introductions combined with positive impact, especially in Europe, of the acquisition of the non-U.S. EPD business. Within our Specialty segment, third-party net sales in the first quarter increased 8% compared to the prior year period as EpiPen Auto-Injector continued to experience volume growth. In addition, the integration of the recently acquired EPD Business is proceeding smoothly, and we already have begun realizing the substantial value we envision from this strategic transaction.
Turning to Slide 8. We have been very active during the first quarter with respect to execution of our growth drivers. For instance, recruitment for our comparative effectiveness study for generic Advair is nearly complete, and we look forward to getting back in front of FDA in late summer and remain on track for filing our ANDA by year end.
As you are aware, we have established a strategic collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for the development and commercialization of TD-4208, which is expected to be approved as a once-daily nebulized LAMA product for COPD patients. Our technical and clinical teams have been working diligently together, and we can now tell you that we expect to initiate our Phase III efficacy trials in the second half of this year. We also remain on track to launch our 2 other respiratory programs in Europe this year: generic Seretide MDI and generic Flixotide MDI. Similarly, with respect to our 2 Phase III studies for Glargine, we have completed recruitment for type 1 diabetes studies ahead of schedule, and we expect to wrap up recruitment for the type 2 diabetes study in July. We remain on track to commission our commercial manufacturing facility by this summer's end.
On the biologics front, we continue to progress with our partner, Biocon, on trastuzumab global Phase III trial. We are pleased to report that the Phase III trial for Paxil glastin [ph] is well underway, and we also have recently initiated our global Phase III study for adalimumab.
With regard to our ANDA for generic Copaxone, as previously stated, we responded to all FDA requests today. We remain fully confident that we are well positioned to receive approval for our application. The approval of the standard ANDA demonstrates that FDA is moving forward with approvals of substitutable generic version of this product. We are further encouraged by FDA's denial of Teva's eighth citizen petition . The FDA's response outlines their criteria for approval, and Mylan is confident that our ANDA meets each of these criteria.
We also completed the clinical equalness trial for, Estradiol vaginal cream as per FDA's guidance and look forward to the next steps to adding another complex product to our portfolio.
Finally, I would like to echo Heather's sincere sentiment by thanking our employees for their unwavering dedication to our cause of delivering better health for a better world. With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were $1.9 billion, which included 1 month of results from the established products business we acquired. Sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $93 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, the yen and the Australian dollar. However, on a constant-currency basis, revenues in our Generics segment increased 15% when compared to the prior year period, an increase that includes revenues of $147 million contributed from the EPD Business.
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 53%, up 240 basis points from the same prior year period. Our strong margins were primarily the result of new product introductions in North America combined with the positive contribution from the EPD Business.
R&D expense, on an adjusted basis, was $152 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continued to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect R&D spending, as a percentage of total revenues, to be within our guidance range for the full year. At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $409 million or approximately 22% of total revenues, which includes the impact of the EPD Business combined with our continued investment in the EpiPen Auto-Injector.
Our first quarter adjusted net income was $309 million or $0.70 per share, a 6% increase from our Q1 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.66 per share. Our adjusted diluted EPS was above our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of the significant currency headwinds we encountered.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $336 million, and first quarter capital spending was $48 million, as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.1:1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity, including our recently announced bridge credit agreement for the proposed Perrigo transaction, and we remain committed to our long-term leverage targets, which are consistent with investment grade.
To summarize, our first quarter provided an excellent start to 2015, and we remain committed to our 2015 guidance metrics, which we communicated during our Q4 2014 earnings call in March. For the second quarter 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.90 per share, which would be a 28% increase over the prior year quarter, and we remain confident in our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Heather."

Close to a decade ago, we laid out Mylan's vision and strategy and since pursued them relentlessly and consistently, never doing transactions for transaction's sake, never doing transactions whose main focus was cost synergies, never doing transactions for the sole purpose of lowering our tax rate. Instead, we have always focused on doing transactions that complement our strategy, support long-term sustainable growth, allow us to further enhance and leverage what we've built and help us move closer to achieving our vision of delivering better health for a better world to 7 billion people.
As we have demonstrated, Mylan aggressively pursued such transactions, and we have repeatedly stated that we would be using our enhanced financial flexibility to do other large deals. And for those of you who know Mylan well, we do what we say we're going to do.
The combination with Perrigo is simply the next important strategic step in our evolution and builds on our strong platform, consistent with our long-standing and clearly articulated vision and strategy. We have long believed the combination of Perrigo and Mylan represents an extraordinary opportunity. As you have seen through our actions over the past few weeks, we are committed to making this combination a reality. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo demonstrates clear and compelling industrial logic. The potential here is truly transformative and the transaction would redefine the delivery of global health care.
A combined Mylan and Perrigo would be ideally positioned at the forefront of the megatrends driving change throughout the health care industry, including the growing number of Rx-to-OTC switches underway. Together, we could better serve our customers and patients, create more opportunities for our employees and communities and generate additional value for our shareholders and stakeholders.
Mylan and Perrigo are highly complementary businesses, and together, we would have unmatched reach and impact. Each company augments the other's platform to create something that is better, not just bigger, in terms of portfolio and pipeline, commercial footprint, operational leverage across customer channels and manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.
Let me quickly highlight some of the key strategic and financial benefits of the transaction. As a combined company, we will have a meaningful presence across all customer channels, and we will have critical mass and leadership across Gx, Rx and OTC with one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolios. We will have the opportunity to offer our customers a compelling value proposition through a unique ability to deliver products and services in an environment where scale and reach are increasingly important. We will also have unmatched global scale and immense geographic reach in order to maximize this portfolio across existing and new markets. The scale and reach would improve patient access to affordable, high-quality medicine.
In addition to an enhanced commercial platform, we will have a massive global manufacturing platform and supply chain. This will provide a real critical advantage because it will allow us to deliver the reliability and cost advantages our customers have come to rely on.
We are well positioned to optimize the enhanced platform of the combined company as well as Mylan's strong brand equity to capitalize on trends shaping the health care industry and drive future growth and financial performance. The combined company will be a stronger, larger and more diverse business with approximately $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014 and significant free cash flow.
Importantly, the transaction is accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis. We expect to achieve annual pretax operational synergies of at least $800 million fully realizable by year 4 after closing. We also expect to maintain our investment-grade credit rating.
The strong industrial and financial rationale will redefine how we can deliver on our mission to provide the world's 7 billion people access to affordable, high-quality medicine.
Turning to Slide 12. You can see that this transaction aligns with our existing growth drivers, enhancing our capabilities in respiratory and complex products, providing access to new geographic markets while adding an exciting new opportunity in OTC. This broader platform enhances our ability to provide customers with health care solutions, not just products.
We have long thought that OTC could be a very important piece of the Mylan story and have carefully evaluated the best ways to expand our presence in this area. In fact, the acquisition of the EPD Business gave us a foothold in OTC. That platform would complement and enhance Perrigo's existing global growth plan.
Moving on to Slide 13. Importantly, our history of doing good and doing well would only be improved by this combination. Our broader product portfolio, significant commitment to R&D and larger cost-advantaged manufacturing platform would better position us to serve our patients and customers and further enhance our ability to provide access to medicines and bring new innovations to market. The transaction also would create more opportunities for employees because they would be part of a larger and even stronger organization with significant growth potential. We have a great admiration for Perrigo's management and workforce, and there would be opportunities for best practice sharing across the combined company.
Mylan has long been considered a partner of choice. Given our platform and geographic breadth, and this transaction would only enhance that positioning. The increased scale and significant free cash flows will directly enhance the position of our creditors and suppliers as well. And as we will outline in more detail now this transaction has significant potential for shareholder value creation.
You can't just buy your way to greatness. You have to earn it through execution and performance. Both Mylan and Perrigo shareholders can have great confidence in the value potential of the combined company based on our management team's proven ability to deliver shareholder value and achieve our goals through strategic, organic and inorganic growth initiatives. As we have outlined here on Slide 14, we have carefully pursued transactions in the past that enhance our strategic positioning in the industry and add key capabilities, expanding geographic reach or enhancing operations.
For instance, in 2007, we acquired Matrix and began building a horizontally and vertically integrated platform that today would be nearly impossible to replicate. Matrix also gave us a presence in India, which today is home to nearly half of our operations and employees. We subsequently built upon this transformational transaction, creating a global footprint that we now leverage to deliver high-quality products efficiently and cost effectively around the world.
Importantly, Mylan has the right team to execute and integrate this transaction. We have a strong track record of creating value from M&A and exceeding our synergy targets. Our integration of Merck's generics and specialty business is an example of exceeding our synergy target in a large transformative transaction. We delivered acquisition synergies of approximately $500 million from this deal, which was double our original target.
These transactions and continued consistent strong execution on our business have resulted in strong performance and value creation for our shareholders, as you can see on Slide 15. The team that delivered this double-digit top and bottom line growth and that integrated these prior deals is the team running this business today.
Our performance is best seen through our annualized 3-year total shareholder return, which is 50% higher than the S&P 500 pharma benchmark and more than double the S&P 500 over the same period. The current Mylan team also would benefit from the experience, expertise and institutional knowledge of core executives from the Perrigo and Omega team, and we have proposed to join the leadership team of the combined company precisely because we have great respect to what they have built.
Rajiv will now review how this combination will enhance our operational and commercial excellence."

I also am very excited about the potential of this transaction and the many opportunities that it would create for both Mylan and Perrigo.
On Slide 17, you can start to see how we will mean more to our customers as a result of this combination. We will have an impressive, diversified and differentiated product portfolio with an ability to offer all of our customers thousands of marketed products across Gx, Rx and OTC and across therapeutic categories and dosage forms.
The chart on this slide really spell out how the competition will expand and diversify both businesses' portfolios, including increasing Mylan's OTC offering from 2% of revenue to almost 30%. A combined Mylan and Perrigo would have an unmatched ability to serve the front and back of pharmacies and other retail locations. Mylan's portfolio would be further strengthened by Perrigo's strong and complementary positioning in nutritional and animal health products, which would allow us to bring even more value to customers around the world.
Turning to Slide 18. You can see how the combined company would be well placed to build and strengthen its existing portfolio by developing and commercializing new products. Both Mylan and Perrigo have robust pipeline in Gx and OTC opportunities. In the past few years, we have really distinguished ourselves from our peers through our ability to secure new approvals. For example, in 2014, we were the leading ANDA filer, and we currently have an impressive 269 ANDAs pending with FDA, including 44 first-to-file opportunities. We also have a track record of securing approvals across multiple countries and currently have more than 3,700 global filings pending regulatory approval. At the same time, Perrigo has an exciting opportunity ahead of its market trends in OTC, continue to move favorably in its direction. As Perrigo recently stated, it expects nearly $1 billion in total new product revenues over the next 3 years.
Mylan's efficiency and clear record of success in execution can play an important role in helping ensure that Perrigo captures the potential of these products around the world. In short, the combined company has a clear opportunity to further build its portfolio by bringing hundreds of new products to market every year across therapeutic categories and dosage forms and drive organic growth well into the future.
Turning to Slide 19. Mylan and Perrigo share many values, and we have great respect for what Perrigo has accomplished. One common area of focus for our companies is R&D and its ability to unlock future growth drivers as the global health care system continues to evolve. At Mylan, we have been talking about the exciting opportunities in biologics, respiratory and other complex products for some time now and we are making great progress in many of these areas.
Similarly, Perrigo's platform will continue to evolve through strategic R&D investments to capitalize on macro trends, especially the powerful and ongoing move from Rx to OTC and the opportunities for branded OTC expansions. This shared commitment to R&D, coupled with a proven ability to secure approvals, would continue to drive the growth of the combined company and position it to capitalize on the opportunities of the changing global health care industry.
On Slide 20, you can immediately see that the combined Mylan and Perrigo would have a massive vertically integrated manufacturing platform with 70 production sites around the world.
Moving on to the next slide. This combined platform will have annual capacity of more than 100 billion tablets and capsules, and leveraging capacity across the combined company's manufacturing platform will drive growth and our ability to bring products to market while minimizing the need for near-term investment in additional capacity.
This platform also will be differentiated by both companies' commitment to and track record of quality and proven ability to manage the entire global supply chain. All of this will give us the flexibility to deliver the quality, reliability and cost advantages that customers have come to rely upon.
In addition to our strong presence in oral products, we'll have broad capabilities across APIs, injectables, transdermals, semi solids, ointments, creams and liquids. Further, we are enhancing these capabilities with additional complex technology capabilities, including respiratory, biologics and insulin. In short, this platform would be a one-of-a-kind asset capable of delivering all of what our customers need today while supporting future growth.
Slide 22 demonstrates just how strong the company -- combined company's consumer focus platform would be. Together, Mylan and Perrigo would boast a broad portfolio of durable, market-leading, consumer-facing products across specialty, branded generics, nutritionals and OTC.
Mylan's strong existing consumer focus portfolio, which includes leading brands such as EpiPen, Brufen, Perforomist, and Creon among others, would be further strengthened by Perrigo's powerful brands such as Lactacyd, Physiomer and Paranix. This strong portfolio will be supported and further enhanced by Mylan's consistent investment in its brand equity across customer channels.
Moving to Slide 23. You can see what we mean by this combination, redefining the delivery of health care. With the addition of Perrigo, we would have an unmatched ability to deliver for all of our customers and ultimately, patients. We would have critical mass across all customer channels and would be able to leverage our operating platform and commercial best practices for customers in every segment especially the retail and pharmacy space.
We'll go to market as One Mylan with the ability to meet the critical needs of all our customers and patient groups and deliver meaningful health care solutions. Also, we'll be optimally positioned to capitalize on macro trends in the industry environment, including evolving distributor and peer dynamics, the need for increased scale and reach, and Rx-to-OTC switches.
Now let's turn to Slide 24 to look at how this impressive portfolio would be leveraged by a broad commercial footprint. The combined company would have a significant commercial presence covering approximately 145 countries worldwide. This global platform, which Perrigo doesn't have today, would de-risk Perrigo's early-stage global expansion efforts and create expansion and revenue growth opportunities by introducing Perrigo's products in these new geographies. Perrigo would also facilitate Mylan's entry into some new exciting geographies such as Mexico, Russia and Israel, providing opportunities to introduce Mylan's broad portfolio in these countries.
Further, the combination would optimize each company's platform in both North America and Europe. There is significant opportunity to drive additional value in Europe because Mylan could leverage its recently acquired assets from Abbott and Perrigo's recent acquisition of Omega to accelerate brand growth in the region. This will create greater opportunities for employees and allow us to better serve patients and customer in the region.
The EPD Business complements Mylan's Generic sales force in Europe because of its deep experience in specialty and branded generics. Through this transaction, Mylan's platform would be further enhanced by Omega's OTC sales force.
The complementary nature of Mylan and Perrigo platform would create additional growth opportunities through cross selling and sharing best practices. The opportunities in Europe are especially exciting given the unique dynamics of its pharmacy model.
I will now introduce Tony Mauro, President of North America, to provide you with the details on how this transaction would enhance our presence in our largest market, North America."

As Heather and Rajiv clearly laid out, we're very excited about the opportunity to create a new kind of value for customers and patients in North America through the acquisition of Perrigo. Value that can be experienced across every stage of life from a range of acute and chronic conditions in aisles of every pharmacy as well as behind the counter.
For instance, Mylan accounts for approximately 1 in every 13 prescriptions dispensed in the U.S., showcasing our reach with pharmacists and physicians, while the majority of Perrigo's product portfolio is consumer facing. By adding Perrigo's large OTC and complementary generics portfolio to Mylan's extensive and existing product offering and commercial organization in North America, we're looking at a total offering of more than 430 generics and more than 1,900 SKUs and over 400 OTC product families.
In the U.S., Mylan and Perrigo enjoy long-standing relationships with the vast majority of retail pharmacies. Currently, 5 of Mylan's top customers account for more than 75% of our generic business. The continued consolidation of our customer base and remaining existing supply network has created a unique opportunity for Mylan and Perrigo to combine a front- and back-store portfolio that would allow our customers to meet patients' needs in a whole new way. Enhancing our position as a supplier of choice in North America means providing an agile supply of high-quality products while ensuring the scale and efficiency our customers need to act quickly in today's ever evolving marketplace.
Finally, strengthening our North American offering will build unmatched brand equity across every point in the patient's journey. From behind the counter to front-store, consumer-facing offerings, the combination of Mylan and Perrigo North America creates a one-of-a-kind opportunity to focus less on individual products or treatment categories and more on providing patient solutions.

On Slide 26, you can see that this transaction will generate significant synergies. As Heather stated earlier, these complementary assets are expected to drive at least $800 million of annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year 4 following completion of the transaction.
We have a lot of confidence in our synergy targets. I also know that the Irish Takeover Rules require such estimates be prepared using a sound process and be independently reported on, in our case, by PwC and Goldman Sachs.
As we said before, this team has a proven history of meeting the goals it sets for itself and oftentimes exceeding those goals. Those who know Mylan recognize this history, and our synergy goals should be viewed in the context of what our team has been able to accomplish in the past. We believe we can leverage the sense of both organizations to achieve our target while, at the same time, accelerate the growth of the combined company.
Given the scale of our platform, we see significant opportunities for enhanced efficiencies. This also will limit our need for planned expansion. As you will recall, Mylan had previously planned to increase its oral solid capacity to more than $80 billion, and this gets us beyond our goal.
We also see opportunities to do more with our combined R&D operations and work more efficiently as we develop products for Gx and OTC markets. Please note that this target of at least $800 million doesn't take into account the sales growth potential we see from coming together.

As a result, we expect to maintain our investment-grade credit rating after the transaction closes. With the addition of Perrigo, we would create an even stronger, larger and more diverse platform with about $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014. Importantly, the acquisition of Perrigo would be accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis.
Our strong balance sheet would enable the combined company to remain forward-looking and able to continue to pursue expansion through business development and acquisition. Furthermore, there would be significant opportunity for meaningful growth given the strength of the combined businesses, rich pipeline of launches and opportunities to mean more to customers across business lines.

Under Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan's Rule 2.5 announcement means we are legally committed to launch the offer and take this attractive proposal directly to Perrigo's shareholders, offering them certainty. This offer consists of $75 in cash and 2.3 Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, which based on Mylan's closing stock price of $68.36 on April 8, the first day of -- after overwhelming market reaction to our initial proposal, which equates to $232.23 per share. This represents a multiple of approximately 25x Perrigo's calendar year 2014 EBITDA pro forma for its recent acquisition of Omega Pharma, which compares favorably to recent transactions in our industry. After close, Perrigo shareholders will own approximately 39% of the combined company, while Mylan shareholders will own approximately 61%.
Turning to Slide 30. I'd like to reiterate, importantly for Perrigo shareholders, that there is a clear and certain path to completion of the transaction. We are confident that we can close the deal before the end of the year. We have committed financing in place and have already incurred significant non-refundable committed financing fees. We have already filed for HSR approval and made a ""hell or high water"" commitment with respect to U.S. antitrust clearance. And we've also started the pre-notification process with the European Commission.
Furthermore, our offer is not conditional in due diligence. We are in the process of preparing tender offer documentation for Perrigo shareholders and believe that they will recognize the compelling nature of our offer.
Additionally, the process required to secure the Mylan shareholder vote is well underway. The Mylan shareholder meeting is expected to occur early in the third quarter, and we are confident in our ability to secure approval from Mylan shareholders.
Looking at Slide 31. It is clear we are not alone in seeing the potential of this combination. Perrigo's share price was up 18%, and Mylan's share price was up 15% upon the initial announcement of the transaction on April 8. These share price spikes have occurred while the broader market has remained relatively stable, underscoring the market's belief in the logic of this transaction.
Further, as shown on Slide 32, analysts and other third parties also quickly recognize the compelling strategic rationale of this combination.
Moving onto the next slide. Another way to think about the attractiveness of our offer for Perrigo shareholders is to consider EPS. At the midpoint of its guidance range, Perrigo expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $7.75 in 2015. Under Mylan's offer, Perrigo shareholders will get more than $10 in adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis plus $75 per share in cash. Clearly, this adjusted EPS figure is substantially more than Perrigo could achieve on a stand-alone basis or through pursuing alternative acquisitions. In addition, Perrigo shareholders will continue to benefit from the combined company's strong growth platform and future value creation.
Turning to Slide 34. I would like now to spend a few minutes addressing the valuation of this offer in a bit more detail. As you know, Perrigo has stated that they value our offer based on Mylan's closing price as of March 10, 2015. We think this is simply misleading for shareholders. Once our offer was made public on April 8, the market spoke loud and clear as we already stated. The closing price on April 8 of $68.36 is the true unaffected share price with which to calculate the value of our offer. Prior to April 8, the volume of shares traded and percent change of our stock price was entirely in line with normal averages discounting for the secondary offering of Abbott shares.
I would also like to note that the implied multiple of this offer is very much in line with previous precedent transactions regardless of which Mylan share price you use to calculate it. Furthermore, the analyst price targets of the combined Mylan, Perrigo clearly demonstrates the value creation with even a the low-end target of $70 representing a value exceeding $236 per share. Put simply, we believe and it is clear the market believes our offer is significantly above the self-serving math that the Perrigo board has been using.
On Slide 35, you can see why, in summary, this proposal is the right choice for Mylan and Perrigo shareholders. This combination offers an attractive cash and stock proposal, the opportunity to participate in the future growth of a stronger combined company and a clear and certain path to completion. We believe this combination produces value above what Perrigo shareholders can expect on a stand-alone basis. Given the undeniable financial and strategic logic of this transaction, we still believe engagement is in the best interest of our shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies.
Finally, turning to Slide 36. We have said it throughout the call that those who know Mylan know that we have been clear and unwavering over the last decade about our vision and our strategy for the future. This vision has called for complementary and strategic transactions that enhance our company while at the same time achieving results for our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We have consistently managed the integration and execution of organic growth drivers to grow our earnings per share on a 27% compounded annual growth rate. This world-class ability to execute gives us the confidence in achieving our target of at least $6 adjusted diluted EPS by 2018.
Mylan does not do deals simply for the synergies needed to build a bridge to the next transaction. We are patient and persistent to find the right transactions that deliver on our vision and maintain our track record of steadily increasing shareholder return. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo is no different. We are excited about the potential for this transaction to create long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders and look forward to advancing through this process rapidly.
Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

So I think as the FTC looks at very large transactions, they take a lot into consideration. It's not just about the product overlap.

And I think that if you look at our transactions historically, whether I go back to Matrix, which nobody saw the rationale at the time and to think that the -- what that was able to strategically deliver from a vertical integration and a horizontal and is now as I've said, has half of our operations and employees, really having, I think, one of the best global supply chains throughout the industry at a very cost-effective and efficient model. 
When I look at Merck, I don't need to remind any of those on the phone what that transaction and what people -- what those metrics are on a sheet of paper. But obviously, the commercial reach and scale that, that brought us overnight was being able to leverage then the Matrix transaction, the Mylan platform.

So I just would say there's many opportunities, both throughout U.S. as well as Europe, as we've talked about, kind of their unique pharmacy model certainly provides for cross channel, cross selling between the physician channel as well as the pharmacy channel.

As far as the fully synergized amount, obviously, as you're familiar with the Irish Takeover Rule, I think that the best way to think about it is -- again, I'm going to get back to our other transactions. It's really about not doing transactions just based on synergies. It's really about the complementary and strategic and compelling offering that we're going to be able to offer to our customers and patients.

During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the postacquisition, which I will refer to as the Perrigo proposal of Perrigo Company, which I will refer to as Perrigo by Mylan; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the EPD transaction of Mylan and Abbott Laboratories non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the EPD Business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo proposal or EPD transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined companies and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan's, Perrigo's or the combined companies future operation, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition and other expectations and targets for future periods.
Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatment for the transaction related to the Perrigo proposal and the EPD transaction; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of Perrigo and the EPD business being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating costs, consumer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo proposal and the EPD transaction; the impact of competition, situations where we manufacture, market and/or sell products notwithstanding unresolved allegations of infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; and those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release and the risk factors set forth in Mylan and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC. 
These risks as well as the other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the registration statement on Form S-4 that includes offer to exchange perspectives that Mylan filed with the SEC on May 5 as amended on June 9 and July 16, 2015, of which has not yet been declared effective and a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14a that Mylan filed with the SEC on July 28, 2015, and began mailing to its shareholders on or about July 31, 2015, in connection with the Perrigo proposal. 
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any statements made today whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.
In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.
Please refer to today's earnings release, which is available on our website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material new information or significant new opinions, which have not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares in Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult his or her professional adviser.

Mylan had a great second quarter. Top line sales totaled nearly $2.4 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year. This result represents double-digit growth in our legacy bus",560,"Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan had a great second quarter. Top line sales totaled nearly $2.4 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year. This result represents double-digit growth in our legacy business as well as enhanced double-digit growth with the addition of the EPD Business. 
I note as well that EpiPen continues to post strong results and maintains an 86% share in the multi-epinephrine market and has delivered double-digit growth year-to-date. 
On the bottom line, our adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.91 for the second quarter, up 32% compared to the same period last year and exceeding our expectations. Again, this result represents double-digit growth in our legacy business as well as enhanced double-digit growth with the addition of the EPD Business. 
Our exceptional performance this quarter continues to underscore the underlying strength and diversity of our base business and our relentless focus in execution even in the face of ongoing regulatory delays as well as external activity. 
Given the strength and momentum in our business, we are raising our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $4.15 to $4.35, an increase of 19% or 23% on a constant currency basis compared to our performance in 2014. Our guidance now excludes any contribution from generic Copaxone and includes potential generic composition on EpiPen in the second half of the year. In addition, we see the potential for opportunities on the horizon, and we'll provide any updates as appropriate. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you more than ever to all of our employees around the world for staying focused on executing and delivering great performance. 
With respect to the external activity, you saw last week that Teva announced an agreement to acquire Allergan generic drug unit and its withdrawal of its unsolicited expression of interest to acquire Mylan. We very much believe that this is the right outcome for both companies and their shareholders. We believe the transaction further demonstrates Mylan as the industry's only predominantly global generics player and will enhance our ability to gain additional share in markets around the world. 
We believe our offer to acquire Perrigo represents the right next step for Mylan because it further diversifies our business. It creates a paradigm shift in how we'll do business and establishes a unique platform with the size and scale that allows us to continue being a leading consolidator in our industry. 
Together, Mylan and Perrigo will create a one-of-a-kind global health care company with complementary businesses, unmatched scale in our operation, one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolios and immense reach across distribution channels around the world, allowing us to mean the most to our customers and consumers. 
We very much look forward to our shareholder vote on August 28, and as a reminder, we intend to take our offer to acquire Perrigo directly to its shareholders. We are confident that they, too, see the compelling value in our offer and this combination will support the transaction. 
In addition, as an update to yesterday's press release, we have now executed an amendment with all of our bridge credit facility lenders that gives us full discretion to lower the acceptance condition from 80% to greater than 50% if we so choose. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rajiv."

As Heather mentioned, all of our regions and businesses contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the second quarter with each of the regions delivering very impressive double-digit growth. 
Our global Generics segment generated third-party net sales of just over $2 billion, an increase year-over-year of 43% on constant currency basis. In North America, sales totaled $937 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our legacy business grew by 22%. This impressive growth is attributed to continued strong performance of sales from new products as well as stable pricing and higher volume from existing products. 
In Europe, sales stood at $571 million, a 62% increase as compared to the second quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to contribution of our acquired EPD Business as our legacy business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter whereas we benefited from sales of new products, saw higher volumes on existing ones primarily in Italy and France, further enhancing our market share. 
In our rest of the world region, sales totaled $547 million, a year-over-year increase of 51%. Sales from our legacy business grew 43% on a constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes from our India operations especially our antiretroviral franchise. 
As for our Specialty segment revenues totaled $302 million, an increase of 5% compared to the last year's second quarter based on double-digit volume growth. We have made very good progress in integrating the EPD Business across our various regions. Overall, we have not only successfully arrested the decline of the business, but we also saw constant currency low single-digit growth in revenues across the geographies, and the improvement in this business has come quicker than expected. We expect this performance to remain stable this year on a pro forma year-over-year basis. 
Also, we continue to analyze on a country-by-country basis and explore how we can tap portfolio opportunities for additional value creation that builds on our respective strengths such as cross-leveraging channels that are not available to either organization on a stand-alone basis. We look forward to executing on these value-creating opportunities to realize the full potential of this combined asset. 
We also continue to make progress executing against our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future. Starting with the respiratory. We remain on track to file our ANDA for generic Advair by this year-end. 
In June, we launched our first and only alternative to GSK Seretide under the brand name in U.K. We only saw a couple of weeks impact of this product in the second quarter. However, we were very pleased with its large performance and the boost it gave our business in U.K. We also recently launched the product in Germany. 
It's worth noting that we leverage the EPD sales force for this launch, another example of how we are creating value through the combination. We continue to further build out our global respiratory pipeline. For instance, we announced an agreement with the for a clinical stage bronchodilator therapy being studied for COPD. It's the first small molecule formulation from the inhale technology. 
Regarding our Copaxone program, we are very pleased to see FDA's response to the final. We clearly laid out general criteria for of a generic Copaxone such as same fundamental chemical reaction scheme, same physical chemical properties and composition, same structural signature for polarization and depolymerization and the same response in assay. We are confident that we are fundamentally on the same page regarding the timing and criteria to demonstrate sameness with FDA. 
Furthermore, we have just recently received some additional clarifying questions from the agency, which give us even more confidence that any residual concern of sameness are now behind us. 
Turning to biologics. Following our launch in India, we have now launched our products in several countries in Africa and have filing spending in additional markets across Asia, EMEA and Latin America. 
In addition, we have also begun filing marketing authorization for insulin Glargine in Africa, Asia, Latin America and MENA. The 2 global critical trials for generic insulin Glargine have made significant progress with recruitment for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes that is now complete. Our insulin Glargine commercial manufacturing facility is now fully commissioned, and we expect it will be fully qualified by the end of this quarter. 
We continue to progress the development of biologics platform. Our trastuzumab Phase III clinical trials are progressing very well towards completion. We are continuing our Phase III study with adalimumab, and we have also initiated a Phase I PK compatibility study for our trastuzumab program. 
With regards to our infectious disease growth driver, we launched our Paranix Sovaldi in generic sofosbuvir product for treatment of hep C in India. Additionally, we are making regulatory submissions in multiple emerging markets. We are also developing other combination products for treatment of hep C. 
As for the latest statistics, more than 150 million people are affected with hep C in emerging markets, and Mylan is committed to provide access to the hep C drugs for the patient across these markets in partnership with Gilead. Our products now have approximately half of all people being treated for HIV in the developing world, not just in sub-Saharan Africa but also in markets such as Brazil and Thailand. 
Just last month, the United Nations announced that the world has met the target for reaching 15 million people with HIV treatment by 2015, and that the guidelines will now call for reaching 30 million people in the coming years. Mylan is committed to doing our part to reach that goal, which means continued and sustainable growth in this franchise. 
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are on track to close our acquisition of Remicade by the end of the third quarter, which will further enhance our presence in women's health care. In addition to the strength of this business in the U.S. and other developed markets, we see significant opportunities to leverage this business through the Mylan platform in emerging markets to enhance access to the contraceptives for more women. We are excited about momentum we have going into the second half of the year. For example, we launched our generic Nexium in the U.S. earlier this week and believe that we are only the second generic to launch to date. We believe this product has the potential to be a great opportunity for us. 
I would also like to mention that we are seeing fairly good improvement from FDA in terms of pace of approvals and the level of transparency and communications from the agency. I believe this bodes well for the additional approvals we expect and our overall optimism in the second half of the year. 
In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to our employees, who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission everyday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by a full quarter of results from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $402 million, of which $250 million was from Europe, and $110 million was in our Rest of World with the remainder coming from EPD Canada.

For the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, total revenues were $4.2 billion, an increase of 26% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period, which includes revenues from the EPD Business of approximately $550 million. 
Revenues for the first 6 months of 2015 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $221 million. As a result of the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency operation into U.S. dollars, we now expect full year foreign currency translation to negatively impact our reported U.S. dollar revenues by approximately $200 million versus the foreign exchange rates used for providing our 2015 guidance. 
As such, without further weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the principal currencies in which we -- our businesses operate, we expect that our actual reported 2015 revenues will be at the lower end of our 2015 guidance range. 
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter and first 6 months of 2015 was a very strong 54%, up approximately 400 basis points for the quarter and 325 basis points in the year-to-date period. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the EPD Business, new product introductions and increased margins on existing products in North America. We expect the strong margins we saw in the first half of 2015 to continue, and we now expect our full year gross margin to be in the upper half of our 2015 guidance range. 
R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $168 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter as a result of continued investment in our respiratory, insulin and biologic growth programs as well as the impact of the EPD Business. However, as a result of the strong increase in quarter-over-quarter revenue, R&D as a percent of sales fell from 8% to 7%. 
For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $320 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of total revenue to be within our guidance range for the full year. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $506 million or approximately 21% of total revenues for the quarter, which includes the impact of the EPD Business along with investment in our infrastructure to support the growth of the company. For the 6-month period, adjusted SG&A was approximately $914 million or 22% of total revenues. 
For the full year, as a result of the strength of the expected revenues in the second half of 2015, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be closer to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. 
We continue to realize tax benefits from the EPB transaction and inversion that was completed earlier this year, and as a result, we reported a second quarter adjusted tax rate of 18%, which includes the cumulative effect of reducing in the second quarter our annual effective tax rate to 19% from the 20% we reported in Q1. We are continuing to identify opportunities to reduce our overall adjusted effective tax rate, and it is possible that in the second half of 2015, we will be able to further reduce this tax rate. 
Our second quarter adjusted net earnings were $474 million or $0.91 per share, a 32% increase from our Q2 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.69 per share. This adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of delays in new product approvals and a negative $0.02 per share impact from the foreign currency translation that we encountered during the quarter. 
Furthermore, foreign currency translation had a negative $0.05 per share impact on adjusted diluted EPS quarter-over-quarter from the prior year. For the 6-month period, adjusted net earnings were $783 million or $1.62 per share. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was $490 million, a decrease of approximately $69 million from the prior year period, which is the result of timing of customer remittances due to changes in contract terms and new agreements entered into in the current year. We expect the impact of this change will be mitigated in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date capital spending was $122 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. At the end of the quarter, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.2:1. 
We continue to have ample borrowing capacity, including our recently announced 2015 term loan, $1 billion of which we utilized to redeem the 2020 senior notes in July, and we expect the remaining amount will be utilized for the redemption of the cash convertible notes, which mature in September. We remain fully confident in our -- we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after the successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo and including any event that we decide to reduce the acceptance level of the tender offer to greater than 50%. 
With regards to full year adjusted diluted EPS, as Heather indicated, we are raising our full year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.35 per share even after considering the impact of potential generic EpiPen competition sometime in the second half of 2015 and including the removal of a Copaxone launch. The midpoint of this revised guidance range of $4.25 per share represents a 23% constant currency growth in adjusted diluted EPS, reflecting the ongoing strength of our global business. 
We are also forecasting that our full year adjusted EBITDA will be in the upper half of our $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion guidance range. For the third quarter 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 per share, which would be a 22% increase over the prior year quarter. This guidance range assumes no generic competition for EpiPen in Q3 and will be achieved without the launch of generic Copaxone. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Eric for questions."

There's lots of assets available out there that we believe very much would complement our platform that we would be able to leverage the infrastructure of both commercial and operational excellence that we have in place today. So we've been actively looking at many targets out there. And as I said in my opening remarks, we believe that there's many different ways to get to the scale and size needed for us to continue to be a leading consolidator in this industry. As far as Copaxone, and then I'll let John take your other question on investment grade. We just did what we believe to be the financial responsible thing to do given where we are in the year, given the momentum of our business, of our core business. And as we said, the ability to show not only a strong quarter, raise our guidance that we didn't need to keep uncertainty in there. So the more as you get more into the year and the more we can take uncertainty out of the numbers, we thought that was the prudent thing to do. I can assure you from a getting the product approved, we are continuing to work as diligently as we ever have to get it approved. We think it's great. As we've said before moment to getting the first product approvals showing that there is possible to have generic Copaxone. We believe as I think Rajiv laid out in his remarks, we're still very confident that we've met the expectations of the agency, and we look forward to that approval. But -- so our bullishness on the product really has nothing to do with us just wanted to remove any uncertainty that we can from our numbers."

And I'll just maybe more comment on the customer in a macro level, and then I'll John speak to the agreements.

Ronny, I would hope that especially demonstrating this quarter and us raising our guidance, under -- showing that, underscoring the strength of our core business, not relying on any one product or any one territory.

So I won't speak or have a crystal ball on anybody else's approvals coming, but I can tell you that as always, we're managing a whole basket of risk and opportunities around the globe, and so we wouldn't be speaking to modeling of any one particular opportunity except that it just continues to show the strength in our core business as well as our ability to continue to receive approvals. As far as the complexity, really, the way that the Irish Takeover Rules work and as we stated back in our -- when we got the 2.5 giving us the ability to go directly to Perrigo's shareholders, we put in there that we had optionality to go down to the 50% plus 1% and really the -- I would not say there's any operational complexity. There is a time period of perhaps 1 to 2 months of taking over the board. And then so once that happens, you've got full operational control of the company.

And I'm just wondering it seems like confidence has sort of waned in the transaction just sort of judging by Mylan's stock price.

Or do you think it's just a function more of unique considerations around the transaction that have sort of fled to now rather pronounced slippage, I guess, in terms of Mylan's equity value versus at the time when the transaction was first announced?"

What then subsequently happened I absolutely believe Wall Street became very fixated on a near term what they perceive to be an opportunity. So we needed to get that behind us so people could focus back again on the industrial logic of Perrigo. I think now that, that has happened, sure, our stock -- we've taken a little bit of a dramatic hit. There was trauma in the marketplace given Teva's action, and I would say they're kind of disingenuous about maintaining that they were coming with a real offer and surprising the market by doing the Allergan deal. And as I said, I think that was the right deal for those both companies, and this is a short term temporary blip in our stock. I think we know our value. We know what we've created for shareholders. We know what we'll continue to create both in the near, medium and long term. And I think our results today just underscore the strength of our business, both in the here and now and then obviously, as we've demonstrated by raising our guidance for the year due to the Irish Takeover Rules, we can't say, give any forecast beyond that. But I can tell you the strength and momentum in our business is strong, and I think our stock price will quickly come back to reflect that. And as you know, the tender to the Perrigo shareholders won't be till the September, October time frame, and we think by then, all of this noise will have worked itself out. And I think that we still feel as we're talking to shareholders that they're back focusing on the Perrigo deal, realizing the industrial logic of it, and we believe that Perrigo's shareholders think that we have a very fair and compelling offer on the table. So we're excited about the next steps and think that we'll see once we get to our vote and then move hopefully to the tender offer."

We continue to see other OTC opportunities that would allow us to continue to be able to throw out that channel. So I would say that like I said, we've been very clear about our priorities. But with that being said, we believe there is a lot of -- from a priorities and dosage form and the channels, we want to reach critical mass, mean the most our customers and to the consumers, and we believe there's a lot of different assets that can get us there. It's just that the Perrigo kind of accelerates that for us and as well as for them as they talk about their base plus, plus, plus business, we get them to base plus overnight.

But additionally, we said there was much more macro issues that they needed to take into consideration. And in fact, I actually used the example that if you look at the 4 top leaders in our industry, 3 of them are predominantly in the brand. That leaves only Mylan as the true global generic company. And therefore, if one of the other 3 consolidated, which has now happened, you take Teva and Actavis that we thought the brunt of the marketplace would be much less significant than in taking only generic advocate out of the industry would be. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks not only do I see it as different, I see it as a huge opportunity for Mylan. I mean, if we look historically as these large consolidations have taken place, we've been able to disproportionally gain market share as other lose it as they divest and sell off assets.

Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition, which I will refer to as the Perrigo Proposal -- Perrigo Company, which I will refer to as Perrigo, by Mylan; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the ECB transaction of Mylan and Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the EPD Business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo Proposal or EPD transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined companies and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan, Perrigo's or the combined companies' future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition and other expectations and targets for future periods. 
Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo Proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatment of the transaction related to the Perrigo Proposal and the EPD transaction; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of Perrigo and the EPD business being more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; operating cost, customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo Proposal and the EPD transaction; the impact of competition, situations where we manufacture market and/or sell products notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; and those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V.'s Form 10-K for the period [ph] ended March 31, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC. 
These risks, as well as the other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 that includes an offer to exchange perspective that Mylan filed with the SEC on May 5, as amendment on June 9 and July 16, 2015, of which has not yet been declared effective, and the definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A that Mylan has we filed with the SEC on July 28, 2015, and befan mailing to its shareholders on or about July 31, 2015, in connection with the Perrigo Proposal. 
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.
In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.
Please refer to today's earnings release, which is available on our website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material, new information or significant new opinions, which have not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares in Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult his or her professional adviser. 
Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.

Mylan had a great second quarter. Top line sales totaled nearly $2.4 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year. This result represents double-digit growth in our legacy bus",560,"Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan had a great second quarter. Top line sales totaled nearly $2.4 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year. This result represents double-digit growth in our legacy business as well as enhanced double-digit growth with the addition of the EPD Business. 
I'd note as well that EpiPen continues to post strong results and maintains an 86% share in a multi-epinephrine market and has delivered double-digit growth year-to-date. 
On the bottom line, our adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.91 for the second quarter, up 32% compared to the same period last year and exceeding our expectations. Again, this result represents double-digit growth in our legacy business as well as enhanced double-digit growth with the addition of the EPD Business. 
Our exceptional performance this quarter continues to underscore the underlying strength and diversity of our base business and our relentless focus on execution even in the face of ongoing regulatory delays as well as external activity. 
Given the strength and momentum in our business, we are raising our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $4.15 to $4.35, an increase of 19% or 23% on a constant currency basis compared to our performance in 2014. Our guidance now excludes any contribution from generic Copaxone and includes potential generic competition on EpiPen in the second half of the year. In addition, we see the potential for opportunities on the horizon, and we'll provide any updates as appropriate. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you more than ever to all of our employees around the world for staying focused on executing and delivering great performance. 
With respect to the external activity, you saw last week that Teva announced an agreement to acquire Allergan's generic drug unit and its withdrawal of its unsolicited expression of interest to acquire Mylan. We very much believe that this is the right outcome for both companies and their shareholders. We believe the transaction further demonstrates Mylan as the industry's only predominantly global generics player and will enhance our ability to gain additional share in markets around the world. 
We believe our offer to acquire Perrigo represents the right next step for Mylan because it further diversifies our business. It creates a paradigm shift in how we'll do business and establishes a unique platform with the size and scale that allows us to continue being a leading consolidator in our industry. 
Together, Mylan and Perrigo will create a one-of-a-kind global health care company with complementary businesses, unmatched scale in our operation, one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolios and immense reach across distribution channels around the world, allowing us to mean the most to our customers and consumers. 
We very much look forward to our shareholder vote on August 28, and as a reminder, we intend to take our offer to acquire Perrigo directly to its shareholders. We are confident that they, too, see the compelling value in our offer and this combination will support the transaction. 
In addition, as an update to yesterday's press release, we have now executed an amendment with all of our bridge credit facility lenders that gives us full discretion to lower the acceptance condition from 80% to greater than 50% if we so choose. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rajiv."

As Heather mentioned, all of our regions and businesses contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the second quarter with each of the regions delivering very impressive double-digit growth. 
Our global Generics segment generated third-party net sales of just over $2 billion, an increase year-over-year of 43% on constant currency basis. In North America, sales totaled $937 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our legacy business grew by 22%. This impressive growth is attributed to continued strong performance of sales from new products at less stable pricing and higher volumes on existing products. 
In Europe, sales stood at $571 million, a 62% increase as compared to the second quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to contribution of our acquired EPD Business as our legacy business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, whereas we benefited from sales of new products, saw higher volumes on existing ones primarily in Italy and France, further enhancing our market share. 
In our rest of the world region, sales totaled $547 million, a year-over-year increase of 51%. Sales from our legacy business grew 43% on a constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes from our India operations, especially our antiretroviral franchise. 
As for our Specialty segment revenues totaled $302 million, an increase of 5% compared to the last year's second quarter based on double-digit volume growth. We have made very good progress in integrating the EPD Business across our various regions. Overall, we have not only successfully arrested the decline of the business, but we also saw constant currency low single-digit growth in revenues across the geographies, and the improvement in this business has come quicker than expected. We expect this performance to remain stable this year on a pro forma year-over-year basis. 
Also, we continue to analyze on a country-by-country basis and explore how we can tap portfolio opportunities for additional value creation that builds on our respective strengths, such as cross-leveraging channels that were not available to either organization on a stand-alone basis. We look forward to executing on these value-creating opportunities to realize the full potential of this combined asset. 
We also continue to make progress executing against our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future. Starting with the respiratory. We remain on track to file our ANDA for generic Advair by this year end. 
In June, we launched our first and only bioequivalent alternative to GSK Seretide under the brand name Sirdupla in U.K. We only saw a couple of weeks' impact of this product in the second quarter. However, we were very pleased with its launch performance and the boost it gave our business in the U.K. We also recently launched the product in Germany. 
It's worth noting that we leverage the EPD sales force for this launch, another example of how we are creating value through the combination. We continue to further build out our global respiratory pipeline. For instance, we announced an agreement with Pulmatrix for a clinical-stage bronchodilator therapy being studied for COPD. It's the first small-molecule formulation from the Pulmatrix, novel inhaled dry powder technology. 
Regarding our Copaxone program, we are very pleased to see FDA's response to the final Teva CP, where they clearly laid out a general criteria for sameness of a generic Copaxone, such as same fundamental chemical reaction scheme, same physical chemical properties and composition, same structural signature for polymerization and depolymerization and the same response in a biological assay. We are confident that we are fundamentally on the same page regarding the signs and criteria to demonstrate sameness with FDA. 
Furthermore, we have just recently received some additional clarifying questions from the agency, which give us even more confidence that any residual concern of sameness are now behind us. 
Turning to biologics. Following our launch in India, we have now launched our trastuzumab products in several countries in Africa and have filing spending in additional markets across Asia, MENA and Latin America. 
In addition, we have also begun filing marketing authorization for insulin Glargine in Africa, Asia, Latin America and MENA. The 2 global clinical trials for generic insulin Glargine have made significant progress with the recruitment for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes studies now complete. Our insulin Glargine commercial manufacturing facility is now fully commissioned and we expect will be fully qualified by the end of this quarter. 
We continue to progress the development of biologics platform. Our trastuzumab and [indiscernible] Glargine Phase III clinical trials are progressing very well towards completion. We are continuing our Phase III study with adalimumab, and we have also initiated a Phase I PK compatibility study for our bevacizumab program. 
With regards to our infectious disease growth driver, we launched our branded Sovaldi and generic MyHep Sofosbuvir product for treatment of hep C in India. Additionally, we are making regulatory submissions in multiple emerging markets. We are also developing other combination products for treatment of hep C. 
As for the latest statistics, more than 150 million people are affected with hep C in emerging markets, and Mylan is committed to provide access to the hep C drugs to the patients across these markets in partnership with Gilead. Our ARV products now have approximately half of all people being treated for HIV in the developing world, not just in sub-Saharan Africa but also in markets, such as Brazil and Thailand. 
Just last month, the United Nations announced that the world has met the target for reaching 15 million people with ARV treatment by 2015, and that the guidelines will now call for reaching 30 million people in the coming years. Mylan is committed to doing our part to reach that goal, which means continue reliable and sustainable growth in this franchise. 
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are on track to close our acquisition of Famy Care by the end of the third quarter, which will further enhance our presence in women's health care. In addition to the strength of this business in the U.S. and other developed markets, we see significant opportunities to leverage this business through the Mylan platform in emerging markets to enhance access to the contraceptives for more women. We are excited about the momentum we have going into the second half of the year. For example, we launched our generic Nexium in the U.S. earlier this week and believe that we are only the second generic to launch to date. We believe this product has the potential to be a great opportunity for us. 
I would also like to mention that we are seeing fairly good improvements from FDA in terms of pace of approvals and the level of transparency in communications from the agency. I believe this bodes well for the additional approvals we expect and our overall optimism in the second half of the year. 
In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to our employees, who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission everyday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."
290203,307625537,851370,"Mylan N.V., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rajiv. Good morning, everyone. As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were $2.4 billion, an increase of 29% or 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by fore",1177,"Thanks, Rajiv. Good morning, everyone. As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were $2.4 billion, an increase of 29% or 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. 
Revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by approximately $127 million in the current quarter, primarily reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, yen, rupee and Australian dollar. 
Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by a full quarter of results from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $402 million, of which $250 million was from Europe, and $110 million was in our Rest of World with the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
We will continue to provide EPD-specific quarterly revenue for 2015. However, by the beginning of 2016, the EPD and Mylan commercial businesses will be operating as one. And as such, separate revenue information will no longer be available. 
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, total revenues were $4.2 billion, an increase of 26% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period, which includes revenues from the EPD Business of approximately $550 million. 
Revenues for the first 6 months of 2015 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $221 million. As a result of the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency operation into U.S. dollars, we now expect full year foreign currency translation to negatively impact our reported U.S. dollar revenues by approximately $200 million versus the foreign exchange rates used for providing our 2015 guidance. 
As such, without further weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the principal currencies in which we -- our businesses operate, we expect that our actual reported 2015 revenues will be at the lower end of our 2015 guidance range. 
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter and first 6 months of 2015 was a very strong 54%, up approximately 400 basis points for the quarter and 325 basis points in the year-to-date period. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the EPD Business, new product introductions and increased margins on existing products in North America. We expect the strong margins we saw in the first half of 2015 to continue, and we now expect our full year gross margin to be in the upper half of our 2015 guidance range. 
R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $168 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter as a result of continued investment in our respiratory, insulin and biologic growth programs as well as the impact of the EPD Business. However, as a result of the strong increase in quarter-over-quarter revenue, R&D as a percent of sales fell from 8% to 7%. 
For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $320 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of total revenue to be within our guidance range for the full year. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $506 million or approximately 21% of total revenues for the quarter, which includes the impact of the EPD Business along with investment in our infrastructure to support the growth of the company. For the 6-month period, adjusted SG&A was approximately $914 million or 22% of total revenues. 
For the full year, as a result of the strength of the expected revenues in the second half of 2015, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be closer to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. 
We continue to realize tax benefits from the EPB transaction and inversion that was completed earlier this year, and as a result, we reported a second quarter adjusted tax rate of 18%, which includes the cumulative effect of reducing in the second quarter our annual effective tax rate to 19% from the 20% we reported in Q1. We are continuing to identify opportunities to reduce our overall adjusted effective tax rate, and it is possible that in the second half of 2015, we will be able to further reduce this tax rate. 
Our second quarter adjusted net earnings were $474 million or $0.91 per share, a 32% increase from our Q2 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.69 per share. This adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of delays in new product approvals and a negative $0.02 per share impact from the foreign currency translation that we encountered during the quarter. 
Furthermore, foreign currency translation had a negative $0.05 per share impact on adjusted diluted EPS quarter-over-quarter from the prior year. For the 6-month period, adjusted net earnings were $783 million or $1.62 per share. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was $490 million, a decrease of approximately $69 million from the prior year period, which is the result of timing of customer remittances due to changes in contract terms and new agreements entered into in the current year. We expect the impact of this change will be mitigated in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date capital spending was $122 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. At the end of the quarter, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.2:1. 
We continue to have ample borrowing capacity, including our recently announced 2015 term loan, $1 billion of which we utilized to redeem the 2020 senior notes in July, and we expect the remaining amount will be utilized for the redemption of the cash convertible notes, which mature in September. We remain fully confident in our -- we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after the successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo and including in the event that we decide to reduce the acceptance level of the tender offer to greater than 50%. 
With regards to full year adjusted diluted EPS, as Heather indicated, we are raising our full year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.35 per share even after considering the impact of potential generic EpiPen competition sometime in the second half of 2015 and including the removal of a Copaxone launch. The midpoint of this revised guidance range of $4.25 per share represents a 23% constant currency growth in adjusted diluted EPS, reflecting the ongoing strength of our global business. 
We are also forecasting that our full year adjusted EBITDA will be in the upper half of our $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion guidance range. For the third quarter of 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 per share, which would be a 22% increase over the prior year quarter. This guidance range assumes no generic competition for EpiPen in Q3 and will be achieved without the launch of generic Copaxone. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Eric for questions."

So as far as alternatives to Perrigo, I think that we have continued ever since closing our Abbott Transaction to say that it was going to be the first of a series. Obviously, we believe Perrigo is the right next transaction for Mylan based on the strategic initiatives that we laid out. But as we've said before, we like Perrigo, but we don't have to have Perrigo. There's lots of assets available out there that we believe very much would complement our platform that we would be able to leverage the infrastructure, both commercial and operational excellence that we have in place today. So we've been actively looking at many targets out there. And as I've said in my opening remarks, we believe that there's many different ways to get to the scale and size needed for us to continue to be a leading consolidator in this industry. As far as Copaxone, and then I'll let John take your other question on investment grade. What we -- we just did what we believe to be the financial responsible thing to do given where we are in the year, given the momentum of our business, of our core business. And as we said, the ability to show not only a strong quarter, raise our guidance that we didn't need to keep uncertainty in there. So the more as you get more into the year and the more we can take uncertainty out of the numbers, we thought that was the prudent thing to do. I can assure you from a getting the product approved, we are continuing to work as diligently as we ever have to get it approved. We think it's great. As we've said before moment to getting the first product approvals showing that there -- it's possible to have generic Copaxone. We believe, as I think Rajiv laid out in his remarks, we're still very confident that we've met the expectations of the agency, and we look forward to that approval. But -- so our bullishness on the product really has nothing to do with us just wanting to remove any uncertainty that we can from our numbers."

And I'll just maybe more comment on the customer in a macro level, and then I'll let John speak to the agreements. But Greg, what we have said and what we continue to see is with the consolidation of our customers, especially from a global perspective, our ability to have proven to be that global reliable supply chain continues to prove itself and continue to put us in a position that not only are we able to secure and maintain overall longer period of time our business, but are able to really, like I said, drive and benefit from the stability of our supply."

I would absolutely not characterize it as exactly how you said it but as big bully or something like that. So it was a win-win from our perspective to conclude this agreement with customers.

So, Ronny, I'll start with your Nexium. Ronny, I would hope that especially demonstrating this quarter and us raising our guidance, under -- showing that, underscoring the strength of our core business, not relying on any one product or any one territory. So Nexium obviously, great product, and right now there don't seem to be other -- any other final approvals, and there was no one else really tied to the August 3 date because we were the only generic company that had it settled. So I won't speak or have a crystal ball on anybody else's approvals coming, but I can tell you that as always, we're managing a whole basket of risk and opportunities around the globe and so we wouldn't be speaking to modeling of any one particular opportunity except that it just continues to show the strength in our core business as well as our ability to continue to receive approvals. As far as the complexity, really, the way that the Irish Takeover Rules work and as we stated back in our -- when we got the 2.5 giving us the ability to go directly to Perrigo's shareholders, we put in there that we had optionality to go down to the 50% plus 1% and really the other  -- I would not say there's any operational complexity. There is a time period of perhaps 1 to 2 months of taking over the board. And then so once that happens, you've got full operational control of the company. So it really allows you to be running the company with 50% plus 1% of the vote in a very short period of time. So anything that there would be, it would be a very small temporary blunt of time that we weren't in control."

I think a lot of shares traded that day and settled out with us at that $68 range, and we felt that was the right range and we continue to maintain that. What then subsequently happened, I absolutely believe Wall Street became very fixated on a near term what they perceive to be an opportunity. And so we needed to get that behind us so people could focus back again on the industrial logic of Perrigo. And I think now that, that has happened, sure, our stock -- we've taken a little bit of a traumatic hit. There was trauma in the marketplace, given Teva's actions and I would say they're kind of disingenuous about maintaining that they were coming with a real offer and surprising the market by doing the Allergan deal. And as I've said, I think that was the right deal for those both companies, and this is a short-term temporary blunt in our stock. I think we know our value. We know what we've created for shareholders. We know what we'll continue to create both in the near, medium and long term. And I think our results today just underscore the strength of our business, both in the here and now and then obviously, as we've demonstrated by raising our guidance for the year and due to the Irish Takeover Rules, we can't say -- give any forecast beyond that. But I can tell you the strength and momentum in our business is strong, and I think our stock price will quickly come back to reflect that. And as you know, the tender to the Perrigo shareholders won't be till the September, October time frame, and we think by then, all of this noise will have worked itself out. And I think that we still feel as we're talking to shareholders that they're back focusing on the Perrigo deal, realizing the industrial logic of it and we believe that Perrigo's shareholders think that we have a very fair and compelling offer on the table. So we're excited about the next steps and think that we'll see once we get to our vote and then move, hopefully, to the tender offer."

We see interesting bolt-on opportunities that will continue to enhance the infrastructure we have in place. We see assets in Europe that could, again, given now our commercial infrastructure with Abbott EPD and our legacy business that would complement that. We continue to see other OTC opportunities that would allow us to continue to be able to throw out that OX [ph] channel. So I would say that like I said, we've been very clear about our priorities.

And therefore, if one of the other 3 consolidated, which has now happened, you take Teva and Actavis, that we thought the brunt to the marketplace would be much less significant than in taking the only generic advocate out of the industry would be.

Mylan had a great second quarter. Top line sales totaled nearly $2.4 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year. This result represents double-digit growth in our legacy bus",560,"Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan had a great second quarter. Top line sales totaled nearly $2.4 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year. This result represents double-digit growth in our legacy business as well as enhanced double-digit growth with the addition of the EPD Business. 
I'd note as well that EpiPen continues to post strong results and maintains an 86% share in a multi-epinephrine market and has delivered double-digit growth year-to-date. 
On the bottom line, our adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.91 for the second quarter, up 32% compared to the same period last year and exceeding our expectations. Again, this result represents double-digit growth in our legacy business as well as enhanced double-digit growth with the addition of the EPD Business. 
Our exceptional performance this quarter continues to underscore the underlying strength and diversity of our base business and our relentless focus on execution even in the face of ongoing regulatory delays as well as external activity. 
Given the strength and momentum in our business, we are raising our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $4.15 to $4.35, an increase of 19% or 23% on a constant currency basis compared to our performance in 2014. Our guidance now excludes any contribution from generic Copaxone and includes potential generic competition on EpiPen in the second half of the year. In addition, we see the potential for opportunities on the horizon, and we'll provide any updates as appropriate. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you more than ever to all of our employees around the world for staying focused on executing and delivering great performance. 
With respect to the external activity, you saw last week that Teva announced an agreement to acquire Allergan's generic drug unit and its withdrawal of its unsolicited expression of interest to acquire Mylan. We very much believe that this is the right outcome for both companies and their shareholders. We believe the transaction further demonstrates Mylan as the industry's only predominantly global generics player and will enhance our ability to gain additional share in markets around the world. 
We believe our offer to acquire Perrigo represents the right next step for Mylan because it further diversifies our business. It creates a paradigm shift in how we'll do business and establishes a unique platform with the size and scale that allows us to continue being a leading consolidator in our industry. 
Together, Mylan and Perrigo will create a one-of-a-kind global health care company with complementary businesses, unmatched scale in our operation, one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolios and immense reach across distribution channels around the world, allowing us to mean the most to our customers and consumers. 
We very much look forward to our shareholder vote on August 28, and as a reminder, we intend to take our offer to acquire Perrigo directly to its shareholders. We are confident that they, too, see the compelling value in our offer and this combination will support the transaction. 
In addition, as an update to yesterday's press release, we have now executed an amendment with all of our bridge credit facility lenders that gives us full discretion to lower the acceptance condition from 80% to greater than 50% if we so choose. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rajiv."

As Heather mentioned, all of our regions and businesses contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the second quarter with each of the regions delivering very impressive double-digit grow",1188,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. As Heather mentioned, all of our regions and businesses contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the second quarter with each of the regions delivering very impressive double-digit growth. 
Our global Generics segment generated third-party net sales of just over $2 billion, an increase year-over-year of 43% on constant currency basis. In North America, sales totaled $937 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our legacy business grew by 22%. This impressive growth is attributed to continued strong performance of sales from new products at less stable pricing and higher volumes on existing products. 
In Europe, sales stood at $571 million, a 62% increase as compared to the second quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to contribution of our acquired EPD Business as our legacy business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, whereas we benefited from sales of new products, saw higher volumes on existing ones primarily in Italy and France, further enhancing our market share. 
In our rest of the world region, sales totaled $547 million, a year-over-year increase of 51%. Sales from our legacy business grew 43% on a constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes from our India operations, especially our antiretroviral franchise. 
As for our Specialty segment, revenues totaled $302 million, an increase of 5% compared to the last year's second quarter based on double-digit volume growth. We have made very good progress in integrating the EPD Business across our various regions. Overall, we have not only successfully arrested the decline of the business, but we also saw constant currency low single-digit growth in revenues across the geographies, and the improvement in this business has come quicker than expected. We expect this performance to remain stable this year on a pro forma year-over-year basis. 
Also, we continue to analyze on a country-by-country basis and explore how we can tap portfolio opportunities for additional value creation that builds on our respective strengths, such as cross-leveraging channels that were not available to either organization on a stand-alone basis. We look forward to executing on these value-creating opportunities to realize the full potential of this combined asset. 
We also continue to make progress executing against our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future. Starting with the respiratory. We remain on track to file our ANDA for generic Advair by this year end. 
In June, we launched our first and only bioequivalent alternative to GSK Seretide under the brand name Sirdupla in U.K. We only saw a couple of weeks' impact of this product in the second quarter. However, we were very pleased with its launch performance and the boost it gave our business in the U.K. We also recently launched the product in Germany. 
It's worth noting that we leverage the EPD sales force for this launch, another example of how we are creating value through the combination. We continue to further build out our global respiratory pipeline. For instance, we announced an agreement with Pulmatrix for a clinical-stage bronchodilator therapy being studied for COPD. It's the first small-molecule formulation from the Pulmatrix novel inhaled dry powder technology. 
Regarding our Copaxone program, we are very pleased to see FDA's response to the final Teva CP, where they clearly laid out a general criteria for sameness of a generic Copaxone, such as same fundamental chemical reaction scheme, same physical chemical properties and composition, same structural signature for polymerization and depolymerization and the same response in a biological assay. We are confident that we are fundamentally on the same page regarding the signs and criteria to demonstrate sameness with FDA. 
Furthermore, we have just recently received some additional clarifying questions from the agency, which give us even more confidence that any residual concern of sameness are now behind us. 
Turning to biologics. Following our launch in India, we have now launched our trastuzumab products in several countries in Africa and have filing spending in additional markets across Asia, MENA and Latin America. 
In addition, we have also begun filing marketing authorization for insulin Glargine in Africa, Asia, Latin America and MENA. The 2 global clinical trials for generic insulin Glargine have made significant progress with the recruitment for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes studies now complete. Our insulin Glargine commercial manufacturing facility is now fully commissioned and we expect will be fully qualified by the end of this quarter. 
We continue to progress the development of biologics platform. Our trastuzumab and [indiscernible] Glargine Phase III clinical trials are progressing very well towards completion. We are continuing our Phase III study with adalimumab, and we have also initiated a Phase I PK compatibility study for our Bevacizumab program. 
With regards to our infectious disease growth driver, we launched our branded Sovaldi and generic MyHep Sofosbuvir product for treatment of hep C in India. Additionally, we are making regulatory submissions in multiple emerging markets. We are also developing other combination products for treatment of hep C. 
As for the latest statistics, more than 150 million people are affected with hep C in emerging markets, and Mylan is committed to provide access to the hep C drugs to the patients across these markets in partnership with Gilead. Our ARV products now have approximately half of all people being treated for HIV in the developing world, not just in sub-Saharan Africa but also in markets such as Brazil and Thailand. 
Just last month, the United Nations announced that the world has met the target for reaching 15 million people with ARV treatment by 2015, and that the guidelines will now call for reaching 30 million people in the coming years. Mylan is committed to doing our part to reach that goal, which means continue reliable and sustainable growth in this franchise. 
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are on track to close our acquisition of Famy Care by the end of the third quarter, which will further enhance our presence in women's health care. In addition to the strength of this business in the U.S. and other developed markets, we see significant opportunities to leverage this business through the Mylan platform in emerging markets to enhance access to the contraceptives for more women. We are excited about the momentum we have going into the second half of the year. For example, we launched our generic Nexium in the U.S. earlier this week and believe that we are only the second generic to launch to date. We believe this product has the potential to be a great opportunity for us. 
I would also like to mention that we are seeing fairly good improvements from FDA in terms of pace of approvals and the level of transparency in communications from the agency. I believe this bodes well for the additional approvals we expect and our overall optimism in the second half of the year. 
In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to our employees, who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission every day. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were $2.4 billion, an increase of 29% or 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by fore",1177,"Thanks, Rajiv. Good morning, everyone. As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were $2.4 billion, an increase of 29% or 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. 
Revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by approximately $127 million in the current quarter, primarily reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, yen, rupee and Australian dollar. 
Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by a full quarter of results from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $402 million, of which $250 million was from Europe, and $110 million was in our Rest of World with the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
We will continue to provide EPD-specific quarterly revenue for 2015. However, by the beginning of 2016, the EPD and Mylan commercial businesses will be operating as one. And as such, separate revenue information will no longer be available. 
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, total revenues were $4.2 billion, an increase of 26% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period, which includes revenues from the EPD Business of approximately $550 million. 
Revenues for the first 6 months of 2015 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $221 million. As a result of the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency operation into U.S. dollars, we now expect full year foreign currency translation to negatively impact our reported U.S. dollar revenues by approximately $200 million versus the foreign exchange rates used for providing our 2015 guidance. 
As such, without further weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the principal currencies in which we -- our businesses operate, we expect that our actual reported 2015 revenues will be at the lower end of our 2015 guidance range. 
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter and first 6 months of 2015 was a very strong 54%, up approximately 400 basis points for the quarter and 325 basis points in the year-to-date period. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the EPD Business, new product introductions and increased margins on existing products in North America. We expect the strong margins we saw in the first half of 2015 to continue, and we now expect our full year gross margin to be in the upper half of our 2015 guidance range. 
R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $168 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter as a result of continued investment in our respiratory, insulin and biologic growth programs as well as the impact of the EPD Business. However, as a result of the strong increase in quarter-over-quarter revenue, R&D as a percent of sales fell from 8% to 7%. 
For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $320 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of total revenue to be within our guidance range for the full year. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $506 million or approximately 21% of total revenues for the quarter, which includes the impact of the EPD Business along with investment in our infrastructure to support the growth of the company. For the 6-month period, adjusted SG&A was approximately $914 million or 22% of total revenues. 
For the full year, as a result of the strength of the expected revenues in the second half of 2015, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be closer to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. 
We continue to realize tax benefits from the EPB transaction and inversion that was completed earlier this year, and as a result, we reported a second quarter adjusted tax rate of 18%, which includes the cumulative effect of reducing in the second quarter our annual effective tax rate to 19% from the 20% we reported in Q1. We are continuing to identify opportunities to reduce our overall adjusted effective tax rate, and it is possible that in the second half of 2015, we will be able to further reduce this tax rate. 
Our second quarter adjusted net earnings were $474 million or $0.91 per share, a 32% increase from our Q2 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.69 per share. This adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of delays in new product approvals and a negative $0.02 per share impact from the foreign currency translation that we encountered during the quarter. 
Furthermore, foreign currency translation had a negative $0.05 per share impact on adjusted diluted EPS quarter-over-quarter from the prior year. For the 6-month period, adjusted net earnings were $783 million or $1.62 per share. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was $490 million, a decrease of approximately $69 million from the prior year period, which is the result of timing of customer remittances due to changes in contract terms and new agreements entered into in the current year. We expect the impact of this change will be mitigated in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date capital spending was $122 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. At the end of the quarter, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.2:1. 
We continue to have ample borrowing capacity, including our recently announced 2015 term loan, $1 billion of which we utilized to redeem the 2020 senior notes in July, and we expect the remaining amount will be utilized for the redemption of the cash convertible notes, which mature in September. We remain fully confident in our -- we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after the successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo and including in the event that we decide to reduce the acceptance level of the tender offer to greater than 50%. 
With regards to full year adjusted diluted EPS, as Heather indicated, we are raising our full year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.35 per share even after considering the impact of potential generic EpiPen competition sometime in the second half of 2015 and including the removal of a Copaxone launch. The midpoint of this revised guidance range of $4.25 per share represents a 23% constant currency growth in adjusted diluted EPS, reflecting the ongoing strength of our global business. 
We are also forecasting that our full year adjusted EBITDA will be in the upper half of our $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion guidance range. For the third quarter of 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 per share, which would be a 22% increase over the prior year quarter. This guidance range assumes no generic competition for EpiPen in Q3 and will be achieved without the launch of generic Copaxone. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Eric for questions."

So as far as alternatives to Perrigo, I think that we have continued ever since closing our Abbott Transaction to say that it was going to be the first of a series. Obviously, we believe Perrigo is the right next transaction for Mylan based on the strategic initiatives that we laid out. But as we've said before, we like Perrigo, but we don't have to have Perrigo. There's lots of assets available out there that we believe very much would complement our platform, that we would be able to leverage the infrastructure, both commercial and operational excellence that we have in place today. So we've been actively looking at many targets out there. And as I've said in my opening remarks, we believe that there's many different ways to get to the scale and size needed for us to continue to be a leading consolidator in this industry. As far as Copaxone, and then I'll let John take your other question on investment grade. What we -- we just did what we believe to be the financial responsible thing to do given where we are in the year, given the momentum of our business, of our core business. And as we said, the ability to show not only a strong quarter, raise our guidance, that we didn't need to keep uncertainty in there. So the more -- as you get more into the year and the more we can take uncertainty out of the numbers, we thought that was the prudent thing to do. I can assure you from a getting the product approved, we are continuing to work as diligently as we ever have to get it approved. We think it's great. As we've said before, Momenta getting the first product approvals showing that there -- it's possible to have generic Copaxone. We believe, as I think Rajiv laid out in his remarks, we're still very confident that we've met the expectations of the agency, and we look forward to that approval. But -- so our bullishness on the product really has nothing to do with us just wanting to remove any uncertainty that we can from our numbers."

So, Ronny, I'll start with your Nexium. Ronny, I would hope that especially demonstrating this quarter and us raising our guidance, under -- showing that, underscoring the strength of our core business, not relying on any one product or any one territory. So Nexium, obviously great product, and right now there don't seem to be other -- any other final approvals, and there was no one else really tied to the August 3 date because we were the only generic company that hadn't settled. So I won't speak or have a crystal ball on anybody else's approvals coming, but I can tell you that as always, we're managing a whole basket of risk and opportunities around the globe and so we wouldn't be speaking to modeling of any one particular opportunity except that it just continues to show the strength in our core business as well as our ability to continue to receive approvals. As far as the complexity, really, the way that the Irish Takeover Rules work and as we stated back in our -- when we got the 2.5 giving us the ability to go directly to Perrigo's shareholders, we put in there that we had optionality to go down to the 50% plus 1% and really the other  -- I would not say there's any operational complexity. There is a time period of perhaps 1 to 2 months of taking over the board. And then so once that happens, you've got full operational control of the company. So it really allows you to be running the company with 50% plus 1% of the vote in a very short period of time. So anything that there would be, it would be a very small temporary blunt of time that we weren't in control."

Obviously, when you first announced it, there was a very strong initial brace of the industrial logic that you guys had outlined around the transaction. And obviously, you've been out and about, meeting with a lot of investors since that time. And I'm just wondering, it seems like confidence has sort of waned in the transaction, just sort of judging by Mylan's stock price. I'm just kind of wondering sort of based on your read of the investment community, do you think it's a function of the fact that people were overly fixated on the Teva transaction, maybe not paying enough attention to the stand-alone merits of the Mylan-Perrigo combination? Or do you think it's just a function more of unique considerations around the transaction that have sort of led to now rather pronounced slippage, I guess, in terms of Mylan's equity value versus at the time when the transaction was first announced?"

Look, I think it started in the right place, which was people's reaction in April. And that instinctive -- both I think instinctive, but the fact that it was strategic and compelling and the right natural fit, I think everybody got right off the bat. I think a lot of shares traded that day and settled out with us at that $68 range, and we felt that was the right range and we continue to maintain that. What then subsequently happened, I absolutely believe Wall Street became very fixated on a near term what they perceive to be an opportunity. And so we needed to get that behind us so people could focus back again on the industrial logic of Perrigo. And I think now that, that has happened, sure, our stock -- we've taken a little bit of a traumatic hit. There was trauma in the marketplace, given Teva's actions and I would say they're kind of disingenuous about maintaining that they were coming with a real offer and surprising the market by doing the Allergan deal. And as I've said, I think that was the right deal for those companies, and this is a short-term temporary blunt in our stock. I think we know our value. We know what we've created for shareholders. We know what we'll continue to create both in the near, medium and long term. And I think our results today just underscore the strength of our business, both in the here and now and then obviously, as we've demonstrated by raising our guidance for the year and due to the Irish Takeover Rules, we can't say -- give any forecast beyond that. But I can tell you, the strength and momentum in our business is strong, and I think our stock price will quickly come back to reflect that. And as you know, the tender to the Perrigo shareholders won't be till the September, October time frame, and we think by then, all of this noise will have worked itself out. And I think that we still feel as we're talking to shareholders that they're back focusing on the Perrigo deal, realizing the industrial logic of it and we believe that Perrigo's shareholders think that we have a very fair and compelling offer on the table. So we're excited about the next steps and think that we'll see once we get to our vote and then move, hopefully, to the tender offer."

And in fact, I actually used the example that if you look at the 4 top players in our industry, 3 of them are predominantly in the brand. That leaves only Mylan as the true global generic company. And therefore, if one of the other 3 consolidated, which has now happened, you take Teva and Actavis, that we thought the brunt to the marketplace would be much less significant than if taking the only generic advocate out of the industry would be. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, not only do I see it as different, I see it as a huge opportunity for Mylan. I mean, if we look historically, as these large consolidations have taken place, we've been able to disproportionately gain market share as others lose it as they divest and sell off assets. So we see it as a great opportunity to build our market around -- build up our markets around the world."

Welcome to Mylan's conference call to discuss our third quarter with 2015 earnings and our offer to acquire Perrigo Company. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Executive Chairman, Robert Coury; Mylan's Chief Executive, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and CFO, John Sheehan.
During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition of Perrigo by Mylan, which I will refer to as the Perrigo proposal; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the EPD transaction of Mylan Inc. and Abbott Laboratories non-U.S. developed end markets; specialty invented Generics business, which I will refer to as the EPD Business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo proposal or EPB transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition, Mylan having sufficient supply of EpiPen Auto-Injector to meet anticipated demand due to Sanofi voluntary recall and other expectations and targets for future periods.
Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the EPD transaction; and the Perrigo proposal; changes in relevant tax and other loss; the integration of Perrigo and EPD Business being more difficult, time consuming or than expected; operating cost, customer loss and business reception being greater than expected following the Perrigo proposal; and the EPD transaction; the impact of competition situations where we manufacture, market and/or sell products notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; any changes in our differences with our inventory of or ability to manufacture and distribute the EpiPen Auto-Injector; and those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V. quarterly results on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31 and June 30, 2015; as well as our other filings with the SEC.
These risks as well as other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the registration statement on Form S-4, which includes an offer to exchange perspective and was declared effective on September 10, 2015, in connection with the Perrigo proposal. The offer to exchange perspectives filed with Mylan with the SEC on Schedule CO on September 14, 2015, constitutes the offer document for purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules.
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any statements made today whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.
In addition, we will be referring to actual and certain projected financial metrics of Mylan, Perrigo on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.
Please refer to today's earnings release and the presentation used during today's call, both of which are available on our website as they contain detailed reconciliations, where possible, of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is given by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material new information or significant new opinion, which have not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares of Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult his or her professional adviser.
Before I turn the call over to Robert, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to welcome our employees around the world to the call and thank them for their unwavering dedication, hard work and focus, which is what makes our consistently strong results possible. I would also like to welcome Perrigo employees listening in today. We certainly look forward to welcoming all of you to the Mylan family soon as we have never been more confident in completing what we believe will be a very successful tender offer. 
In addition, I would like to say a special hello to the Perrigo employees in Israel today. We are very excited to have now received approval to list on the Tel Aviv Exchange and to finally have the opportunity to acquaint ourselves more closely with Israel, Israeli investors and Perrigo Israeli employees. 
Before I turn the call over to Heather, Rajiv and John, who have a lot to cover today, I would like to make a couple of points regarding our offer for Perrigo and to clear up some of the possible misinformation. 
First, the notion conveyed by Perrigo that the Mylan offer is a bad feel for Perrigo's shareholders is simply preposterous and disingenuous. We will show once again today with math, using Perrigo's own updated numbers, that this is a substantial and compelling offer to Perrigo's shareholders. 
Let me also simply highlight that Perrigo themselves have left their own shareholders no other options except to rely on nonstrategic measures such as cost cuts as well as the hope that they will trade at a very high P/E multiple at a time when multiples have been completely reset throughout the industry in order to generate their stand-alone long-term shareholder value. This strategy is flawed. It simply will not produce sustainable growth over the longer term and in sharp contrast to Mylan's well-established long-term strategy and exceptional operation performance that you will hear more about today. 
With that said, as you will see later, it really doesn't matter which unrealistic multiple Perrigo wants to apply to itself because the immediate and significant earnings accretion to be realized by the Perrigo shareholder, which is potentially an excess of 80%, speaks for itself. If Perrigo is correct and the math doesn't lie, then you will see that the math will speak loudly in favor of the Mylan offer. 
Here is just one clear example of how the math alone will demonstrate the compelling value of the Mylan offer. Perrigo has recently projected its maximum stand-alone earnings capability for 2016 to be at $9.45, including the completion of a $500 million share buyback by year-end. What they haven't told you and what we will demonstrate using Perrigo's own math is that Perrigo's shareholders have the opportunity to earn $16.48 in 2016 if they simply accept Mylan's offer and reinvest $75 in cash back into Mylan's stock at the current share price. 
Even if you accept the premise that Perrigo can achieve a forward 16x P/E multiple without our offer, their stock will still only be traded in the $150 range. In comparison, what we will show today is that our combined earnings, after reinvesting the $75 in cash, would be worth approximately $200 per share using only a 12x multiple, which I believe will only increase over time. 
This substantial value is also in sharp contrast when you also consider the potential downside in Perrigo's stock should Mylan not receive the greater than 50% of acceptances by 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 13. 
With this immediate and substantial accretion offered by our proposal to the Perrigo shareholders, this is anything but a bad deal for Perrigo. Therefore, in order to realize this immediate and significant value, you should tender your shares by the close of November 12 or risk losing the stock. 
Lastly, with the October 23 deadline, which is now past for Perrigo to make material announcements, I did reach out to Joe Papa this past weekend and again offered to sit down with him, so that we can plan with our management teams as responsible leaders should and bring in our 2 great companies together. We filed this communication this morning with the SEC. 
I also made clear that I would be open to discussing corporate governance as part of this conversation with the aim of coming to a negotiated transaction. Unfortunately, Joe once again rebuffed my offer and missed the opportunity to discuss his thoughts on this matter. As I've said in my meetings with shareholders, I am very open to a conversation about corporate governance for the Mylan-Perrigo combination, and we'll continue to maintain an active dialogue with shareholders on this matter. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Heather."
290203,312848745,887018,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.

To say the least, the last few months and days have been about eventful. We have had a great quarter. We have a great outlook for the remainder of the year and a tremendous growth trajectory supported by many opportunities in front of us. 
In addition to reviewing our quarter, we will again discuss our compelling offer for Perrigo and give an update on our integration planning for once the transaction is complete. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter, where we've broken a number of records. On the top line, adjusted sales totaled $2.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year with our Mylan legacy business delivering 14% growth on a constant currency basis, reflecting our diversification and scale. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS came in at $1.43, up 23% compared to third quarter of 2014. This performance was fueled by strong revenue growth across our Generics segment with each of our regions experiencing year-over-year constant currency increases in adjusted sales. 
Turning to our Specialty segment. We continue to believe now more than ever in the underlying strength of the EpiPen franchise as well as the growth potential for the market overall going forward. We have continued to be proactive and competitive in maintaining our 85% market share. So while we saw a slight softening in the overall epinephrine market in Q3, Total Script volume remains positive for EpiPen on a year-over-year basis. 
Against this backdrop, we note statement that it will not be in a position to potentially launch ADX or AD-rated alternative to EpiPen any earlier than the second half of 2015. 
Additionally, Sanofi has instituted a nationwide recall of Auvi-Q, affecting hospitals, retailers and consumers. We have confirmed that we have sufficient supply of products to meet any anticipated demand. We are confident that the widespread familiarity with EpiPen established over more than 25 years, coupled with our robust trading resources, will provide access and support for those impacted by the recall. 
We take our leadership position on the epinephrine auto-injector market very seriously, and we'd like to point out that there are approximately 28 million at-risk individuals in the United States. Of the approximately 14 million people who have been diagnosed, about 10% are carrying auto-injectors, leaving more than [indiscernible] substantial upside. 
Additionally, anaphylactic events can occur in people with no known allergies. This was demonstrated by a recent survey at schools participating in our EpiPen4Schools program. The study indicated that more than 20% of the students or others on school grounds who had an anaphylactic episode and were treated have no idea they had any allergies. Obviously, this underscores the continued opportunity to build education and awareness about the need for access to our products, including public entities as well as the run rate that still exists for our EpiPen franchise. 
As a result of these developments, we see additional opportunities this year. We, therefore, expect adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of our range for 2015. This represents once again greater than 20% EPS growth. Moreover, given the long-term landscape change for the EpiPen market, we see EpiPen contributing an additional range of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 to adjusted EPS next year, which will only enhance the already stated significant growth rates projected for Mylan-Perrigo on a combined basis. 
Before leaving EpiPen, I'd like to add that the recent developments [indiscernible] and the epinephrine market as a whole are particularly significant given the number of organic catalyst we see for Mylan in 2017 and beyond, which Rajiv will be discussing. That said, we have never had a strategy to build a business based on one product or one-off event. Instead, we remain committed to building differentiated platform that will deliver long-term sustainable growth for shareholders while at the same time, benefiting our patients and other stakeholders. 
Our results so far this year are a testament to our strategy, ability to execute it and exceed our expectations and our scale and leveraging assets that we brought together, whether it's returning EPD Business to growth, lowering our tax rate or continuing to invest in R&D. 
Given current market dynamics especially in the pharmaceutical sector, trading on fundamentals has never been more important, which is why a Mylan-Perrigo combination is so compelling. On last week's call, we've got another glimpse at Perrigo's operating performance, which is struggling. 
On sales, they reduced their guidance by $150 million to $250 million. On EPS, while they announced adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 that was above consensus, take a closer look, the change is driven by employee reductions and other cost cuts as well as financial measures. 
Stripping all of that away, adjusted diluted EPS guidance on the core business was actually reduced by $0.24 below consensus. This ultimate reduction in guidance is not a result of onetime items but of continued degradation across their Consumer Health Care business. Furthermore, API has declined by 16% year-to-date. 
Looking at Tysabri, the longer-term hope has evaporated. Patient usage is down by approximately 4% annually since 2010 with the recent failure in the Phase III study of SPMS, there is potential for further decline as SPMS patient used Tysabri off label turn to other alternatives. Tysabri, as we know, contributes almost 1/3 of Perrigo's adjusted diluted EPS. 
The complementary Mylan-Perrigo combination will not only derisk Perrigo's shareholders on a stand-alone basis, it will provide enhanced growth, scale and capability. As such, we strongly believe that Perrigo's shareholders will see past the company's latest round of one-off initiatives. They will appreciate that Perrigo's stand-alone strategy is simply not a viable alternative to Mylan's offer. They will grab the compelling value of our offer, which provides immediate accretion in excess of 80% as well as greater growth potential for the long term and respond by tendering their shares. 
Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to thank all of our employees around the world for their continued dedication to our cause and for remain focused on executing and delivering the outstanding performance our shareholders expect and deserve. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

And I am very excited to review the performance of business, update you on our progress on some of our key growth drivers and provide some insight into our integration planning for Perrigo, including a high-level overview of our plans for our first 60 days of owning this business. 
As Heather mentioned, all of our regions contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the third quarter, with each delivering very impressive double-digit revenue growth. Our global Generics segment generated third-party net sales of more than $2.3 billion, a year-over-year increase of 48% on a constant currency basis. 
In North America, sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our legacy business grew by 24% as a result of continued strong performance of sales from new products as well as higher volumes on existing products, offset by lower net pricing. We continue to see an improved flow of approvals coming out of FPA, and we launched 14 new products in U.S. this quarter, including several first generics to market and complex products such as lidocaine and omeprazole. 
In Europe, adjusted sales were approximately $630 million, a 95% constant currency increase as compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to the contribution of our acquired EPD Business. Our legacy business grew 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis as a result of sales of new products and higher volumes on existing ones, primarily in Italy and France. These increases were offset by imposed pricing reductions and competitive market conditions. 
In our Rest of World business, sales totaled just under $550 million, a year-over-year increase of 47% on constant currency basis. Sales from our legacy business grew 21% on constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes from our operations especially our franchise and our pharmacy business. 
We continue to be very pleased with the integration process of our Abbott EPD Business across our various business taking a country-by-country approach to maximizing the potential opportunities from this combination. We have put in place new operating structures in several countries and are beginning to realize the benefits of cross-selling and an enhanced focused on key products. 
We are extremely pleased to see a continuation of low single-digit growth in revenues across the EPD geographies in the third quarter, which historically declined in this business, and we see this continuing through the end of the year. As we noted last quarter, the improvement in this business has been quicker than expected, and we are currently tracking ahead on our execution plan. 
We also continue to make progress executing against a number of our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future. Let me start with our respiratory platform. Continues to be a nice product in Europe. We are very pleased with how we [indiscernible] on the launch of this product and now have more than 500 out of 1,160 clinics dispensing the product in the U.K. As we continue to build on our respiratory platform, our once-a-day LAMA nebulized product for COPD partner with parabens and turning to a Phase III clinical program in September. This program currently remains on track for an NDA submission in the later part of 2017. 
We are also making good progress on our generic program for U.S., which we have partnered with Prophonics. Generic, which is a same product in Europe, is on track to be approved in Q1 2016. We are excited to update you on our significant progress in our generic Advair program. As you are aware, the FDA draft guidance requires several key elements to achieve an ABA-rated generic product. We are very pleased to report to you today that we have successfully achieved the forming milestones for this product and are on track to submit our ANDA this December. 
Formulation design has been developed to be qualitatively and quantitatively the same as the reference product. We have completed our clinical endpoints study and have shown our product to meet all guidance criteria as device robustness and human factor studies have now been completed and demonstrate that our device can be used successfully with new patients as well as those trained on Advair systems. These studies met all predefined protocol criteria. 
In vitro studies against the reference products have met all acceptance criteria. We have also completed PK studies for the 2 of the 3 [indiscernible] to meet all draft guidance by criteria. The third and the final PK Study is ongoing and will be available throughout for our December submission. 
In addition, we have had excellent engagement with FDA throughout our development program and have recently completed a productive and collaborative preANDA meeting with the agency. 
Moving on to our biologics and insulin analogue program with our partner, Biopharm. We are very excited about the progress these programs have made during the last year with 5 programs successfully completing Phase I clinical trials and 4 programs in active Phase III. 
To this end, we plan on submitting in 2016 [indiscernible] similar applications and one Glargine application in the U.S. and Europe. As an update to our trastuzumab development program, we have now completed enrollment of our Phase III study with a first study results expected to be available in the second half of 2016. We expect to submit our application in the first half of 2016. 
For we have now completed the enrollment in our Phase III trials. We plan on filing this product application in the first half of 2016. 
The Phase III clinical program for our is advancing well and is expected to complete by the second half of 2016 submission. 
Finally, we have now completed recruitment for both type 1 and type 2 studies for our Glargine program, and we expect to have these studies completed by the mid-2016. We continue to pursue our discussions with FDA regarding interchangeability. We also are very pleased with the completion and qualification of the state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia and with our active Phase II transfer products into that facility. 
We plan to submit a European filing and our U.S. application in the second half of 2016. While we continue to execute on the current portfolio, we also continue to actively explore opportunities to further enhance Mylan's biologics portfolio around the globe. 
Regarding our Copaxone program, as we indicated last quarter, we have responded to all FDA request today. We remain confident that we are positioned to receive approval for our product. 
The U.S. data trademark office has instituted an interparty review proceeding of all claims against 3 Copaxone 40-milligram patients, and a hearing has been scheduled for May 2016. We generally believe that the 40-milligram franchisee is weak. 
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are looking forward to close our acquisition of health care businesses from Famy Care by the end of the year although the close has been delayed a bit as we await final approval from FICD in India, which we expect very soon. 
Turning now to Perrigo. Let me start off by being very clear. We are capable, confident and ready to run the Perrigo business as soon as we close and have been putting in place a comprehensive readiness plan to allow us to do so. Of course, the first step will be ensuring business continuity of the existing businesses and maintaining the operational and commercial excellence that Perrigo and Mylan are known for. 
As we discussed during the last call, I don't think anyone should doubt our ability to manage Perrigo's generic or API businesses. These capabilities are at Mylan's core, and our strong capabilities in these areas will only enhance the Perrigo asset. 
Also, we are very confident that we can do more with Omega within our combined commercial platform in Europe than what Perrigo has done or to do with this asset on a stand-alone basis especially given our strong track record in the region with the Merck and Abbott EPD integration. 
Now let me talk about the private label manufacturing. One of the key factors which has been called out for success in this area is supply chain excellence. Mylan's supply chain, manufacturing and packaging capabilities are well recognized as being second to none. 
Our global supply chain operations are based in Dublin, and this hub has been operational since 2009. Our complex platform manages more than 1,400 products and 15,000 SKUs from around 40 internal manufacturing sites and more than 1,400 third-party suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations. With this platform, we sell approximately 145 markets around the world, have more than 35,000 customers, and we serve these customers and markets in 40 different languages with varying packaging and artwork. All of this makes adding Perrigo supply chain to our existing business very straightforward. 
I also want to address the comments made by Perrigo about the lack of realistic opportunities in the API business. First, I would like to note that API synergies are a relatively small part of our estimate. That said, the opportunity we see here is having a broad and diverse platform and deploying that platform, including its capacity, capability and portfolios in an opportunistic way. 
For example, after the Merck Generics acquisition, we successfully integrated 50% of the pipeline in portfolio despite not having relevant capabilities prior to the acquisition. 
Turning to the next slide. We manage a complex and diverse network of more than 30 finished [indiscernible] internal sites that are strategically located across the network and maintain a close proximity to key markets. Our ability to manage this complexity is a result of our continued focus on operational excellence, including quality and delivery of a broad range of portfolio to customers at the right time and in the right quantities. 
We can bring Perrigo into our network and even more effectively deploy their assets to the benefit of our business and customers. As you know, we have successfully executed a number of global and transformational integrations, and we have established a permanent integration office. 
As part of this process, we have identified interim leaders for key Perrigo functional areas to lead the integration in addition to Ray Chaudhuri, who we announced today to be the global commercial leader of our OTC business. These leaders are prepared and fully capable of managing these functions in the event that Perrigo leaders in those areas choose to depart upon closing. We have also retained third-party consultants to support us in this process with significant experience in the OTC space. 
This will only further ensure that we are well prepared to manage the business. A critical for us will be to get to know the at Perrigo and implement retention programs. We believe that as we communicate with leaders and their employees, they will see the significant opportunities for their future growth that this combination presents, and they will be excited to engage with us on achieving a shared vision for the combined business. We very much hope to make this a collaborative effort, and we'll seek to retain as many of Perrigo leaders as possible. 
Within the first 60 days, we will have developed a clear road map for integration of our businesses, a plan for realization and last, a defined operating model. With regards to synergy realization, I would like to reiterate our confidence in our estimate that the combined company will achieve at least $800 million in annual pretax operational synergies by the end of the year or following the consummation of the offer. 
Perrigo's cost-cutting actions announced last week further validate the synergy potential for a much larger combined Mylan-Perrigo platform, for instance, Mylan's global supply chain operations are already located at our Center of Excellence in Ireland, where Perrigo is looking to consolidate their supply chain operations providing strategic and synergistic opportunities, and we are already advanced in the implementation of Mylan's global shared service structure, another area Perrigo identify for efficiencies, which could be implemented more effectively as part of Mylan. 
Working with the Perrigo team, we expect to identify additional opportunities from the combined assets. We are confident in achieving these synergies both in a controlled subsidiary or a 100% ownership situation although we have stated we believe some different steps may be taken to achieve that synergy realization depending on the ownership level. 
Finally, I would like to remind everyone again that Mylan has successfully integrated several large and highly complex transactions, dealing with multiple geographies, new business areas and convoluted structures, including operating metrics as a majority-owned controlled public entity for several years. While this combination with Perrigo has its own unique dynamic and complicating factors, we are realistic about the challenges, confident in our planning and experience and optimistic that once we get to day 1, our combined teams will put the [indiscernible] of the last few months aside and get to work together to ensure our mutual success. 
In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to Mylan's employees, who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission every day and are now energized about the Perrigo opportunity and looking forward to welcoming their new colleagues to Mylan. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated du",1620,"Thanks, Rajiv. As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated during the quarter. 
Our adjusted total revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were $2.7 billion, an increase of 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. Adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $122 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, yen, rupee and Australian dollar. 
When compared to exchange rates at the beginning of the quarter, our adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $23 million. 
Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $462 million, of which approximately $314 million was in Europe, $105 million was in our Rest of World region and the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
As stated during our second quarter conference call, foreign currency translation has significantly impacted by reported revenues as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. As such, we expect that our actual reported full year 2015 adjusted revenues will be at the low end of our 2015 guidance range. On a constant currency basis, however, we expect to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for 2015 adjusted revenues. 
Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was a very strong 58%, up approximately 400 basis points over the prior year. Our strong margins are primarily the results of the positive contribution from EPD Business combined with new product introductions and increased margins on existing products within our America. We continue to expect our full year adjusted gross margins to be at the upper end of our 2015 guidance range. 
On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $174 million or 6% -- approximately 6% of total revenues for the quarter. Adjusted R&D expense has actually increased over the prior year quarter as a result of the impact of the EPD Business. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of adjusted total revenues to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year. 
At the same time, and also on an adjusted basis, SG&A was $492 million or approximately 18% of total revenues for the quarter. The acquisition of the EPD Business accounted for the majority of the increase in adjusted SG&A for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be close to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. 
We continue to realize significant tax benefits from our inversion transaction and as a result of our ongoing efforts to optimize our tax structure, during the third quarter, we adjusted our full year 2015 estimated annual effective tax rate to 18% from our previous assumption of 19%. This resulted in an adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of approximately 17%. 
As we move towards the end of 2015, we continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our tax rate. Our third quarter adjusted net earnings were $734 million or $1.43 per share, a 23% increase from our Q3 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.16 per share. 
Excluding the gain that we recognized in the prior year period for the settlements of contingent consideration related to the acquisition, adjusted diluted EPS increased an impressive 42%. The EPS growth in 2015 was achieved in spite of foreign currency headwinds, thanks to the strength of our global operating platform, including the recently acquired EPD Business combined with revenue growth across our legacy Generics business. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was a record $1.1 billion for the current quarter, representing an increase of approximately $655 million from the prior year period, which is the result of the growth in adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. 
Through diligent cash flow management, our free cash flow increased 158% to $1 billion. Over the first 9 months of 2015, free cash flow has risen 72% to $1.4 billion as compared to $818 million in the prior year period. Year-end capital spending was down slightly as compared to the prior year at $207 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. As a result of our strong operating cash flow, at the end of the quarter, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2:1. 
We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million receivables facility or $1.65 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, we further optimized our capital structure through the redemption of our $1 billion 2020 senior notes, the repayment of our cash convertible notes, which matured in September. We funded these transactions through a $1.6 billion term loan, which we entered into at the beginning of the quarter. 
We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after a successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo, and we continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. As a reminder, we have a fully committed financing facility to fund the acquisition of the Perrigo shares pursuant to our tender offer. 
For the full year, as Heather stated earlier, we expect to be at the high end of our 2015 guidance range at $4.35 per adjusted diluted share. I would note that we are not assuming the launch of generic Copaxone or EpiPen competition in 2015. 
Now turning back to our tender offer for Perrigo. I'd like to quickly review -- revisit the. As we showed a few weeks ago using Perrigo's own updated numbers and even using their proxy peer group, we believe that Perrigo would trade at $153 per share or a 15x EBITDA multiple, which is a discount to where they're trading today and is a significant discount to the value of our offer. 
Turning to Slide 21. On a stand-alone basis, Perrigo has told you that their plan would deliver $9.45 of EPS in 2016 based on their recently announced financial initiatives or $9.83 if you give them credit for the run rate cost savings they hope to achieve within 3 years. Applying an illustrative 14 to 16x multiple to that EPS estimate, Perrigo would be worth between $132 and $151 per share next year assuming phased-in cost savings or up to $157 if you give them credit for run rate cost savings on a stand-alone basis. 
In comparison, Mylan's offer for Perrigo is in Perrigo's own number -- numbers, would deliver $9.55 of earnings attributable to each Perrigo share assuming phased-in synergies or $10.83 per Perrigo share assuming run rate synergies. This represents accretion of 3% to 16% to Perrigo shareholders. 
Even if you only apply an illustrative 12 to 14x multiple to this EPS and they had $75 in cash, it implies a total value of $190 to $226 per share. It is important to note that these per share amounts are based upon Mylan analyst consensus estimate and do not include the $0.25 to $0.30 of the EpiPen Auto-Injector 2016 upside opportunity as Heather referred to earlier. 
And if shareholders choose to reinvest their $75 of cash consideration in the combined company, they would receive $16.48 of EPS assuming phased-in synergies and $18.70 assuming run rate synergies. This represents 77% to 101% earnings accretion attributable to Perrigo's shareholders due to the premium embedded in our offer. 
Again, even if you only apply an illustrative 12 to 14x multiple to this EPS, it implies a total value of $198 to $262 per share, a substantial premium to what Perrigo could deliver on a stand-alone basis. So if shareholders choose Perrigo's stand-alone strategy, even if you assume a higher range of multiples of 14 to 16x, your shares would be, at best, be worth $151 per share. 
However, if you vote in favor of the transaction, your shares will be worth more, no matter what you choose to believe in terms of multiples. Again, let's return to the math. 
Assuming only an illustrative 12x multiple and phased-in synergies, based on Perrigo's numbers, your shares would be worth $190 with no reinvestment and $198 with reinvestment, a substantial premium to the best case scenario of Perrigo's stand-alone or a $37 to $45 premium to Perrigo's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. 
Giving credit for run rate synergies at a blended multiple 14x, the earnings attributed to the Perrigo shareholder would represent a value of $209 per share without reinvestment and $231 with reinvestment, a $56 to $78 premium to today's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. 
Remember, in order to reach this substantial value and for the transaction to be completed, greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shares will need to be tendered into the offer. We would, therefore, encourage Perrigo shareholders to tender their shares before the close on November 12. There is no risk to you of tendering early. If you tender before the 12th and the tender fails, you will receive your Perrigo shares back. If you do not tender, however, you will risk losing the significant value we are offering. Wait and see is not the right choice if you want to benefit from the premium we are offering. Bottom line, the math is a clear and compelling value proposition relative to Perrigo's stand-alone plan. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Stephanie for questions."

As far as inventories are concerned, we have not seen -- I think I had mentioned the actual last quarter as well. We have not seen any irregular thing happening or our customers selling them because they were anticipating a Teva launch. I think that there has been -- there has not been any commentary about Teva coming onto the market, and obviously, they've now clarified yesterday that it won't be at least until the second half of 2016. So our inventory levels were running due course. So there were no issues there as I mentioned. There is a little softness in the overall epinephrine market in the third quarter, but as you know, we continue to see double-digit growth year-over-year, and so the comparables had been very high. With that being said, we still see EpiPen grow in volume year-to-date. And as far as all of the recent events, I would say that our dynamic with the payers will stage that I think very dynamic. As I noted throughout this year, we have been very proactive and competitive to maintain our market share. Obviously, in light of some of the recent developments, I think that we'll continue to have opportunities to improve that situation because it's not as competitive as it was. So as happens in this space, the competition landscape can change very rapidly, and I think our ability to first and most importantly, be there for the patient and the safety issue, and we have been very closely monitoring and assisting to make sure patients can get the scripts of EpiPen. So they're not going without product. So no, I would say all in all, as I mentioned in my commentary, the runway looks very bright, and I think the future of the EpiPen franchise is just going to be one that's got a lot of brand equity and a lot of sustainability to it."

So first, Greg, let me before I turn over to Heather for her commentary, the Mylan shareholders have already spoken in terms of the Perrigo transaction and the opportunity we spent an exorbitant amount of time with the Mylan shareholder describing to them why this asset in our hands is the right next opportunity to bolt on to our existing platform with our existing assets, and we convinced them when they supported us in the August 28 vote, we convinced them because we pointed to other assets that we've acquired that we've said very consistently on a stand-alone basis, if you look at what we paid for the other assets, this is vote. We've never -- there've been many assets that we bolted onto our platform that we do not really like on a stand-alone basis. But then bolted onto our platform as you can see through the demonstration of our continued very strong execution and performance, we were able to deliver continual double-digit growth to our shareholders. So I think that Perrigo is going to be no different. In terms of -- and I'll let Heather explain that in more detail, in terms of the corporate governance, I've been very, very open, very, very direct and very transparent about one, saying that the entire whole corporate governance discussion over this transaction has been nothing but a red herring. With that said, I do listen to shareholders and Perrigo's shareholders and particularly I extended -- that's why I extended my offer to Joe Papa and their Board of Directors to sit down and have a dialogue. If this is really something that's all that's left out there, then let's sit down and talk about for the combination of the Mylan-Perrigo combination, so that new structure, that new company profile, the new size and scale that the combined company will be absolutely warrants an open discussion about not just what's on my mind, but I'd like them to participate. I would like them to have a say so. I've offered them Board of Directors seats to help oversee not just participate, but actually help oversee on a going-forward basis. You can't get any more transparent than I have been about open enough or wanting to open up a dialogue and leave everything on the table because I think it's the appropriate thing to do. Heather?"

So the gross margins have been sustained. They have steadily increased over the last 5, 6 years. We've done that with most importantly, from my perspective, a best-in-class operating platform, which has been driving annual cost reductions in our product portfolio. The vertical integration that we have in that operating platform, the very strong integration of API into -- our own API into our products. It also has been driven by the positive pricing environment that we've seen especially over the last couple of years in North America. And yes, I would agree that BPD has been a portion of the increase that we've seen this year in 2015.

I'd say it's far as business development opportunities yes, we've said we are focused on the OTC channel and continuing to build out in advance that platform. Obviously, Perrigo accelerates that what we're interested in building, and we believe there's great product opportunities and other assets out there that would let us continue to build the OTC, both in the U.S. as well as Rest of World. And as we said before, we continue to believe there's dosage forms of therapeutic categories that we still don't have critical mass.

As far as the Perrigo businesses in our commentary on their price cuts, what businesses they're selling, look, I think it would be premature for us to comment on those assets, and I think that's why as Rajiv talked about our first 60 days is really getting in there and assessing both the people and the businesses and before making any kind of quick, rush decisions about what may or may not make sense going forward.

I think it's very important rather than do this in a vacuum or on our own, I think it's very important that 2 boards come together and discuss this matter openly. I think it should be discussed with shareholders. Certainly, I would seek speak to Mylan shareholders.

With that said, this is really about the Perrigo transaction right now, but I will always be open with the -- about the Mylan and Perrigo shareholders on an ongoing basis and all the type of governance changes that you've outlined, I will absolutely be open to all of those things with a good discussion. I believe first, we need to deal with the Perrigo -- at the Perrigo potential transaction because I think again, Ronny, a lot of this is a big red herring. I truly believe it's much more of an excuse, and that's being used right now than the reality. We are a public company. A company as a public company is for sale every single day. That's what a public company is. We, as a board, we've made our position abundantly clear that we will not hold this company back. There's been several types of transactions I have mentioned that we would be open for, both in value and in structure. And especially transactions that would accelerate the mission and strategy of the company while delivering value for shareholders. So I want you to understand because I know this is something that you wrote about, something that you -- and I'm certain we're going to have a lot more discussions about, but I can't be any more transparent. Let's not use this as [indiscernible]. So in a way to take it off the table why I mentioned this morning, why I reached out to Joe after I saw that he went to the shareholders no other alternative than to rely on some high P/E multiple. I'm giving him and the Board of Directors an opportunity to have dialogue. I will invite their board members to participate in any questions or considerations on a going-forward basis. And I will also invite their board members to come on the board and represent the Perrigo side, the Perrigo shareholders.

So it's not necessarily a relevant point. I guess I'll just also hit, Heather, the purchase accounting amortization that is when we make an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the allocation of the purchase price to the value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, so that -- and the intangible assets are then amortized. That's a noncash amortization charge, which has been a consistent adjustment that we've made associated with our adjustment from GAAP to adjusted earnings. And lastly, the financing charges, those represent the cost associated with the refinancing of our capital, our balance sheet, including the committed bridge loan that we have in place associated with our Perrigo tender offer."

During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition of Perrigo by Mylan, which I will refer to as the Perrigo proposal; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the EPD transaction of Mylan Inc. and Abbott Laboratories non-U.S. developed end markets; specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the EPD Business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo proposal or EPD transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan's, Perrigo's or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition, Mylan having sufficient supply of EpiPen Auto-Injector to meet anticipated demand due to Sanofi's voluntary recall and other expectations and targets for future periods.
Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the EPD transaction and the Perrigo proposal; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of Perrigo and EPD Business being more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; operating costs, customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo proposal and the EPD transaction; the impact of competition situations where we manufacture, market and/or sell products, notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; any changes in our differences with our inventory of or ability to manufacture and distribute the EpiPen Auto-Injector; and those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V. quarterly results on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC.
These risks as well as other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the registration statement on Form S-4, which includes an offer to exchange perspective and was declared effective on September 10, 2015, in connection with the Perrigo proposal. The offer to exchange perspectives filed with Mylan with the SEC on Schedule TO on September 14, 2015, constitutes the offer document for purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules.
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.
In addition, we will be referring to actual and certain projected financial metrics of Mylan and Perrigo on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.
Please refer to today's earnings release and the presentation used during today's call, both of which are available on our website, as they contain detailed reconciliations, where possible, of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any materials, new information or significant new opinion which have not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares of Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult his or her professional advisers.
Before I turn the call over to Robert, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.

I would like to welcome our employees around the world to the call and thank them for their unwavering dedication, hard work and focus, which is what makes our consistently strong results possible. I would also like to welcome any Perrigo and Omega employees listening in today. We certainly look forward to welcoming all of you to the Mylan family soon as we have never been more confident in completing what we believe will be a very successful tender offer. 
In addition, I would like to say a special hello to the Perrigo employees in Israel today. We are very excited to have now received approval to dual list on the Tel Aviv Exchange and to finally have the opportunity to acquaint ourselves more closely with Israel, Israeli investors and Perrigo Israeli employees. 
Before I turn the call over to Heather, Rajiv and John, who have a lot to cover today, I would like to make a couple of points regarding our offer for Perrigo and to clear up some of the possible misinformation. 
First, the notion conveyed by Perrigo that the Mylan offer is a bad feel for Perrigo's shareholders is simply preposterous and disingenuous. We will show once again today with math, using Perrigo's own updated numbers, that this is a substantial and compelling offer to Perrigo's shareholders. 
Let me also simply highlight that Perrigo themselves have left their own shareholders no other options except to rely on nonstrategic measures such as cost cuts as well as the hope that they will trade at a very high P/E multiple at a time when multiples have been completely reset throughout the industry in order to generate their standalone long-term shareholder value. This strategy is flawed and it simply will not produce sustainable growth over the longer term and in sharp contrast to Mylan's well-established long-term strategy and exceptional operation performance that you will hear more about today. 
With that said, as you will see later, it really doesn't matter which unrealistic multiple Perrigo wants to apply to itself because the immediate and significant earnings accretion to be realized by the Perrigo shareholder, which is potentially an excess of 80%, speaks for itself. If Perrigo is correct and the math doesn't lie, then you will see that the math will speak loudly in favor of the Mylan offer. 
Here is just one clear example of how the math alone will demonstrate the compelling value of the Mylan offer. Perrigo has recently projected its maximum standalone earnings capability for 2016 to be at $9.45, including the completion of a $500 million share buyback by year-end. What they haven't told you and what we will demonstrate using Perrigo's own math is that Perrigo's shareholders have the opportunity to earn $16.48 in 2016 if they simply accept Mylan's offer and reinvest $75 in cash back into Mylan's stock at the current share price. 
Even if you accept the premise that Perrigo can achieve a forward 16x P/E multiple without our offer, their stock will still only be traded in the $150 range. In comparison, what we will show today is that our combined earnings after reinvesting the $75 in cash would be worth approximately $200 per share using only a 12x multiple, which I believe will only increase over time. 
This substantial value is also in sharp contrast when you also consider the potential downside in Perrigo's stock should Mylan not receive a greater 50% of acceptances by 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 13. 
With this immediate and substantial accretion offered by our proposal to the Perrigo shareholders, this is anything but a bad deal for Perrigo. Therefore, in order to realize this immediate and significant value, you should tender your shares by the close of November 12 or risk losing this offer. 
Lastly, with the October 23 deadline, which is now past for Perrigo to make material announcements, I did reach out to Joe Papa this past weekend and again offered to sit down with him so that we can plan with our management teams, as responsible leaders should, and bring in our 2 great companies together. We filed this communication this morning with the SEC. 
I also made clear that I would be open to discussing corporate governance as part of this conversation with the aim of coming to a negotiated transaction. Unfortunately, Joe once again rebuffed my offer and missed the opportunity to discuss his thoughts on this matter. As I've said in my meetings with shareholders, I am very open to a conversation about corporate governance for the Mylan-Perrigo combination, and we'll continue to maintain an active dialogue with shareholders on this matter. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Heather."
290203,312848745,887268,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.

To say the least, the last few months and days have been eventful. We have had a great quarter. We have a great outlook for the remainder of the year and a tremendous growth trajectory, supported by many opportunities in front of us. 
In addition to reviewing our quarter, we will again discuss our compelling offer for Perrigo and give an update on our integration planning for once the transaction is complete. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter where we've broken a number of records. On the top line, adjusted sales totaled $2.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year, with our Mylan legacy business delivering 14% growth on a constant currency basis, reflecting our diversification and scale. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS came in at $1.43, up 23% compared to third quarter of 2014. This performance was fueled by strong revenue growth across our Generics segment, with each of our regions experiencing year-over-year constant currency increases in adjusted sales. 
Turning to our Specialty segment. We continue to believe now more than ever in the underlying strength of the EpiPen franchise as well as the growth potential for the market overall going forward. We have continued to be proactive and competitive in maintaining our 85% market share. So while we saw a slight softening in the overall epinephrine market in Q3, total script volume remains positive for EpiPen on a year-over-year basis. 
Against this backdrop, we note to have a statement that it will not be in a position to potentially launch a BX or AB-rated alternative to EpiPen any earlier than the second half of 2016.
Additionally, Sanofi has instituted a nationwide recall of Auvi-Q, affecting hospitals, retailers and consumers. We have confirmed that we have sufficient supply of products to meet any anticipated demand. We're confident that the widespread familiarity with EpiPen established over more than 25 years, coupled with our robust training resources, will provide access and support for those impacted by the recall. 
We take our leadership position on the epinephrine auto-injector market very seriously, and we'd like to point out that there are approximately 28 million at-risk individuals in the United States. Of the approximately 14 million people who have been diagnosed, about 10% are carrying auto-injectors, leaving Mylan for substantial upside. 
Additionally, anaphylactic events can occur in people with no known allergies. This was demonstrated by a recent survey at schools participating in our EpiPen4Schools program. The study indicated that more than 20% of the students or other's off-school grounds who had an anaphylactic episode and were treated had no idea they had any allergies. Obviously, this underscores the continued opportunity to build education and awareness about the need for access to our products, including public entities as well as the run rate that still exists for our EpiPen franchise. 
As a result of these developments, we see additional opportunities this year. We therefore expect adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of our range for 2015. This represents, once again, greater than 20% EPS growth. Moreover, given the long-term landscape change for the EpiPen market, we see EpiPen contributing an additional range of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 to adjusted EPS next year, which will only enhance the already stated significant growth rates projected for Mylan-Perrigo on a combined basis. 
Before leaving EpiPen, I'd like to add that the recent developments [indiscernible] and the epinephrine market as a whole are particularly significant given the number of organic catalyst we see for Mylan in 2017 and beyond, which Rajiv will be discussing. That said, we have never had a strategy to build a business based on one product or one-off event. Instead, we remain committed to building a differentiated platform that will deliver long-term sustainable growth for shareholders, while at the same time, benefiting our patients and other stakeholders. 
Our results so far this year are a testament to our strategy, ability to execute it and exceed expectations and our scale in leveraging assets that we brought together, whether it's returning EPD Business to growth, lowering our tax rate or continuing to invest in R&D. 
Given current market dynamics, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, trading on fundamentals has never been more important, which is why a Mylan-Perrigo combination is so compelling. On last week's call, we've got another glimpse at Perrigo's operating performance, which is struggling. 
On sales, they reduced their guidance by $150 million to $250 million. On EPS, while they announced adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 that was above consensus, taking a closer look, the change is driven by employee reductions and other cost cuts as well as financial measures. 
Stripping all of that away, adjusted diluted EPS guidance on the core business was actually reduced by $0.24 below consensus. This ultimate reduction in guidance is not a result of onetime item but of continued degradation across their Consumer Health Care business. Furthermore, API has declined by 16% year-to-date. 
Looking at Tysabri, the longer-term hope has evaporated. Patient usage is down by approximately 4% annually since 2010 with the recent failure in the Phase III study of SPMS, there is potential for further decline as SPMS patients who used Tysabri off label turned to other alternatives. Tysabri, as we know, contributes almost 1/3 of Perrigo's adjusted diluted EPS. 
The complementary Mylan-Perrigo combination will not only derisk Perrigo's shareholders on a standalone basis, it will provide enhanced growth, scale and capability. As such, we strongly believe that Perrigo's shareholders will see past the company's latest round of one-off initiatives. They will appreciate that Perrigo's standalone strategy is simply not a viable alternative to Mylan's offer. They will grasp the compelling value of our offer, which provides immediate accretion in excess of 80% as well as greater growth potential for the long term and respond by tendering their shares. 
Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to thank all of our employees around the world for their continued dedication to our cause and for remaining focused on executing and delivering the outstanding performance our shareholders expect and deserve. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

I am very excited to review the performance of business, update you on our progress on some of our key growth drivers and provide some insight into our integration planning for Perrigo, including a high-level overview of our plans for our first 60 days of owning this business. 
As Heather mentioned, all of our regions contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the third quarter, with each delivering very impressive double-digit revenue growth. Our global Generics segment generated third-party net sales of more than $2.3 billion, a year-over-year increase of 48% on a constant currency basis. 
In North America, sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our legacy business grew by 24% as a result of continued strong performance of sales from new products as well as higher volumes on existing products, offset by lower net pricing. We continue to see an improved flow of approvals coming out of FDA, and we launched 14 new products in U.S. this quarter, including several first generics to market and complex products such as lidocaine, transdermal, paliperidone and esomeprazole. 
In Europe, adjusted sales were approximately $630 million, a 95% constant currency increase as compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to the contribution of our acquired EPD Business. Our legacy business grew 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis as a result of sales of new products and higher volumes on existing ones, primarily in Italy and France. These increases were offset by government-imposed pricing reductions and competitive market conditions. 
In our Rest of World business, sales totaled just under $550 million, a year-over-year increase of 47% on constant currency basis. Sales from our legacy business grew 21% on constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes from our India operations, especially our [indiscernible] franchise and our promising business in Brazil.
We continue to be very pleased with the integration process of our Abbott EPD Business across our various businesses taking a country-by-country approach to maximizing the potential opportunities from this combination. We have put in place new operating structures in several countries and are beginning to realize the benefits of cross-selling and an enhanced focused on key products. 
We are extremely pleased to see a continuation of low single-digit growth in revenues across our EPD geographies in the third quarter, which historically declined in this business, and we see this continuing through the end of the year. As we noted last quarter, the improvement in this business has been quicker than expected, and we are currently tracking ahead on our execution plan. 
We also continue to make progress executing against a number of our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future. Let me start with our respiratory platform. Sirdupla continues to be a nice product in Europe. We are very pleased with how we executed on the launch of this product and now have more than 500 out of 1,160 clinics dispensing the product in the U.K. As we continue to build on our respiratory platform, our once-a-day LAMA revefenacin nebulized product for COPD, partnered with Theravance, entered into a Phase III clinical program in September. This program currently remains on track for an NDA submission in the later part of 2017. 
We are also making good progress on our generic Flovent program for U.S., which we have partnered with Prosonix. Generic Flixotide, which is the same product in Europe, is on track to be approved in Q1 2016. We are excited to update you on our significant progress in our generic Advair program. As you are aware, the FDA draft guidance requires several key elements to achieve an AB-rated generic product. We are very pleased to report to you today that we have successfully achieved the forming milestones for this product and are on track to submit our ANDA this December. 
Formulation design has been developed to be qualitatively and quantitatively the same as the reference product. We have completed our clinical endpoint study and have shown our product to meet all draft guidance criteria as device robustness and human factor studies have now been completed and demonstrate that our device can be used successfully with new patients as well as those trained on Advair [indiscernible]. These studies met all predefined protocol criteria.
In-vitro [indiscernible] studies against the reference products have met all acceptance criteria. We have also completed PK bioequivalence studies for the 2 of the 3 stems to meet all draft guidance bioequivalence criteria. The third and the final PK study is ongoing and will be available throughout for our December submission. 
In addition, we have had excellent engagement with FDA throughout our development program and have recently completed a productive and collaborative pre-ANDA meeting with the agency. 
Moving on to our biologics and insulin analog program with our partner, Biocon. We are very excited about the progress these programs have made during the last year with 5 programs successfully completing Phase I clinical trials and 4 programs in active Phase III testing.
To this end, we plan on submitting in 2016 [indiscernible] similar applications and one Glargine application in the U.S. and Europe. As an update to our trastuzumab development program, we have now completed enrollment of 4 Phase III study, with the first study results expected to be available in the second half of 2016. We expect to submit our application in the first half of 2016. 
For [indiscernible], we have now completed the enrollment in our Phase III trials. We plan on filing this product application in the first half of 2016. 
The Phase III clinical program for our adalimumab is advancing well and is expected to complete for its second half of 2016 submission. 
Finally, we have now completed recruitment for both type 1 and type 2 case studies for our Glargine program, and we expect to have these studies completed by mid-2016. We continue to pursue our discussions with FDA regarding interchangeability. We also are very pleased with the completion and qualification of the state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia and with our active Phase II transfer products into that facility. 
We plan to submit a European filing and our U.S. application in the second half of 2016. While we continue to execute on the current portfolio, we also continue to actively explore opportunities to further enhance Mylan's biologics portfolio around the globe. 
Regarding our Copaxone program, as we indicated last quarter, we have responded to all FDA request today. We remain confident that we are positioned to receive approval for our product. 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has instituted an interparty review proceedings of all claims against 3 Copaxone 40-milligram patents, and a hearing has been scheduled for May 2016. We generally believe that the IP zoning of 40-milligram franchise is weak. 
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are looking forward to close our acquisition of certain women health care businesses from Famy Care by the end of the year, although the close has been delayed a bit as we await final approval from FIPB in India, which we expect very soon. 
Turning now to Perrigo. Let me start off by being very clear. We are capable, confident and ready to run the Perrigo business as soon as we close and have been putting in place a comprehensive readiness plan to allow us to do so. Of course, the first step will be ensuring business continuity of the existing businesses and maintaining the operational and commercial excellence that Perrigo and Mylan are known for. 
As we discussed during the last call, I don't think anyone should doubt our ability to manage Perrigo's generics or API businesses. These capabilities are at Mylan's core, and our strong capabilities in these areas will only enhance the Perrigo asset. 
Also, we are very confident that we can do more with Omega within our combined commercial platform in Europe than what Perrigo has done or to do with this asset on a standalone basis, especially given our strong track record in the region with the Merck and Abbott EPD integration. 
Now let me talk about the private label manufacturing. One of the key factors which has been called out for success in this area is supply chain excellence. Mylan's supply chain, manufacturing and packaging capabilities are well-recognized as being second to none. 
Our global supply chain operations are based in Dublin, and this hub has been operational since 2009. Our complex platform manages more than 1,400 products and 15,000 SKUs from around 40 internal manufacturing sites and more than 1,400 third-party suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations. With this platform, we serve approximately 145 markets around the world, have more than 35,000 customers, and we serve these customers and markets in 40 different languages with varying packaging and artwork. All of this makes adding Perrigo supply chain to our existing business very straightforward. 
I also want to address the comments made by Perrigo about the lack of realistic opportunities in the API business. First, I would like to note that API synergies are a relatively small part of our estimate. That said, the opportunity we see here is about having a broad and diverse platform and deploying that platform, including its capacity, capability and portfolios in an opportunistic way. 
For example, after the Merck Generics acquisition, we successfully integrated 50% of the pipeline and portfolio despite not having the relevant capabilities prior to the acquisition. 
Turning to the next slide. We manage a complex and diverse network of more than 30 finish process internal sites that are strategically located across the network and maintain a close proximity to key markets. Our ability to manage this complexity is a result of our continued focus on operational excellence, including quality and delivery of a broad range of portfolio to customers at the right time and in the right quantities. 
We can bring Perrigo into our network and even more effectively deploy their assets to the benefit of our business and customers. As you know, we have successfully executed a number of global and transformational integrations, and we have established a permanent integration office. 
As part of this process, we have identified interim leaders for key Perrigo functional areas to lead the integration in addition to Ranjan Chaudhuri, whom we announced today to be the global commercial leader of our OTC business. These leaders are prepared and fully capable of managing these functions in the event that Perrigo leaders in those areas choose to depart upon closing. We have also retained third-party consultants to support us in this process with significant experience in the OTC space. 
This will only further ensure that we are well-prepared to manage the business. A critical clarity for us will be to get to know the key talents at Perrigo and implement retention programs. We believe that as we communicate with leaders and their employees, they will see the significant opportunities for their future growth that this combination presents and they will be excited to engage with us on achieving a shared vision for the combined business. We very much hope to make this a collaborative effort, and we'll seek to retain as many of Perrigo leaders as possible. 
Within the first 60 days, we will have developed a clear roadmap for integration of our businesses, a planned personal realization as well as a defined operating model. With regards to synergy realization, I would like to reiterate our confidence in our estimate that the combined company will achieve at least $800 million in annual pretax operational synergies by the end of the year or following the consummation of the offer. 
Perrigo's cost-cutting actions announced last week further validate the synergy potential from a much larger combined Mylan-Perrigo platform. For instance, Mylan's global supply chain operations are already located at our Center of Excellence in Ireland where Perrigo is looking to consolidate their supply chain operations providing strategic and synergistic opportunities, and we are already advanced in the implementation of Mylan's global shared service structure, another area Perrigo identified for efficiencies, which could be implemented more effectively as part of Mylan. 
Working with the Perrigo team, we expect to identify additional opportunities from the combined assets. We are confident in achieving these synergies both in a controlled subsidiary or a 100% ownership situation, although we have stated we believe some different steps may be taken to achieve that synergy realization, depending on the ownership level achieved.
 
Finally, I would like to remind everyone again that Mylan has successfully integrated several large and highly complex transactions, dealing with multiple geographies, new business areas and convoluted structures, including operating metrics as a majority-owned controlled public entity for several years. While this combination with Perrigo has its own unique dynamic and complicating factors, we are realistic about the challenges, confident in our planning and experience and optimistic that once we get to day 1, our combined teams will put down bias of the last few months aside and get to work together to ensure our mutual success. 
In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to Mylan's employees who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission every day and are now energized about the Perrigo opportunity and looking forward to welcoming their new colleagues to Mylan. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated du",1619,"Thanks, Rajiv. As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated during the quarter. 
Our adjusted total revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were $2.7 billion, an increase of 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. Adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $122 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, yen, rupee and Australian dollar. 
When compared to exchange rates at the beginning of the quarter, our adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $23 million. 
Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $462 million, of which approximately $314 million was in Europe, $105 million was in our Rest of World region and the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
As stated during our second quarter conference call, foreign currency translation has significantly impacted our reported revenues as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. As such, we expect that our actual reported full year 2015 adjusted revenues will be at the low end of our 2015 guidance range. On a constant currency basis, however, we expect to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for 2015 adjusted revenues. 
Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was a very strong 58%, up approximately 400 basis points over the prior year. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the EPD Business combined with new product introductions and increased margins on existing products within North America. We continue to expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be at the upper end of our 2015 guidance range. 
On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $174 million or 6% -- approximately 6% of total revenues for the quarter. Adjusted R&D expense has actually increased over the prior year quarter as a result of the impact of the EPD Business. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of adjusted total revenues to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year. 
At the same time, and also on an adjusted basis, SG&A was $492 million or approximately 18% of total revenues for the quarter. The acquisition of the EPD Business accounted for the majority of the increase in adjusted SG&A for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be close to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. 
We continue to realize significant tax benefits from our inversion transaction and as a result of our ongoing efforts to optimize our tax structure, during the third quarter, we adjusted our full year 2015 estimated annual effective tax rate to 18% from our previous assumption of 19%. This resulted in an adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of approximately 17%. 
As we move towards the end of 2015, we continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our tax rate. Our third quarter adjusted net earnings were $734 million or $1.43 per share, a 23% increase from our Q3 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.16 per share. 
Excluding the gain that we recognized in the prior year period for the settlements of contingent consideration related to the Agila acquisition, adjusted diluted EPS increased an impressive 42%. The EPS growth in 2015 was achieved in spite of foreign currency headwinds, thanks to the strength of our global operating platform, including the recently acquired EPD Business combined with revenue growth across our legacy Generics business. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was a record $1.1 billion for the current quarter, representing an increase of approximately $655 million from the prior year period, which is the result of the growth in adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. 
Through diligent cash flow management, our free cash flow increased 158% to $1 billion. Over the first 9 months of 2015, free cash flow has risen 72% to $1.4 billion as compared to $818 million in the prior year period. Year-to-date capital spending was down slightly as compared to the prior year at $207 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. As a result of our strong operating cash flow, at the end of the quarter, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2:1. 
We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million receivables facility or $1.65 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, we further optimized our capital structure through the redemption of our $1 billion 2020 senior notes, the repayment of our cash convertible notes, which matured in September. We funded these transactions through a $1.6 billion term loan, which we entered into at the beginning of the quarter. 
We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after a successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo, and we continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. As a reminder, we have a fully committed financing facility to fund the acquisition of the Perrigo shares pursuant to our tender offer. 
For the full year, as Heather stated earlier, we expect to be at the high end of our 2015 guidance range at $4.35 per adjusted diluted share. I would note that we are not assuming the launch of generic Copaxone or EpiPen competition in 2015. 
Now turning back to our tender offer for Perrigo. I'd like to quickly review -- revisit the HASP. As we showed a few weeks ago using Perrigo's own updated numbers and even using their proxy peer group, we believe that Perrigo would trade at $153 per share or a 15x EBITDA multiple, which is a discount to where they're trading today and is a significant discount to the value of our offer. 
Turning to Slide 21. On a stand-alone basis, Perrigo has told you that their plan would deliver $9.45 of EPS in 2016 based on their recently announced financial initiatives or $9.83, if you give them credit for the run rate cost savings they hope to achieve within 3 years. Applying an illustrative 14 to 16x multiple to that EPS estimate, Perrigo would be worth between $132 and $151 per share next year assuming phased-in cost savings or up to $157 if you give them credit for run rate cost savings on a stand-alone basis. 
In comparison, Mylan's offer for Perrigo using Perrigo's own number -- numbers, would deliver $9.55 of earnings attributable to each Perrigo share assuming phased-in synergies or $10.83 per Perrigo share assuming run rate synergies. This represents accretion of 3% to 16% to Perrigo shareholders. 
Even if you only apply an illustrative 12 to 14x multiple to this EPS and add $75 in cash, it implies a total value of $190 to $226 per share. It is important to note that these per share amounts are based upon Mylan analyst consensus estimates and do not include the $0.25 to $0.30 of the EpiPen Auto-Injector 2016 upside opportunity Heather referred to earlier. 
And if shareholders choose to reinvest their $75 of cash consideration in the combined company, they would receive $16.48 of EPS assuming phased-in synergies and $18.70 assuming run rate synergies. This represents 77% to 101% earnings accretion attributable to Perrigo's shareholders due to the premium embedded in our offer. 
Again, even if you only apply an illustrative 12 to 14x multiple to this EPS, it implies a total value of $198 to $262 per share, a substantial premium to what Perrigo could deliver on a stand-alone basis. So if shareholders choose Perrigo's stand-alone strategy, even if you assume a higher range of multiples of 14 to 16x, your shares would be, at best, be worth $151 per share. 
However, if you vote in favor of the transaction, your shares will be worth more, no matter what you choose to believe in terms of multiples. Again, let's return to the math. 
Assuming only an illustrative 12x multiple and phased-in synergies, based on Perrigo's numbers, your shares would be worth $190 with no reinvestment and $198 with reinvestment, a substantial premium to the best case scenario of Perrigo's stand-alone or a $37 to $45 premium to Perrigo's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. 
Giving credit for run rate synergies and a blended multiple 14x, the earnings attributed to the Perrigo shareholder would represent a value of $209 per share without reinvestment and $231 with reinvestment, a $56 to $78 premium to today's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. 
Remember, in order to reach this substantial value and for the transaction to be completed, greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shares will need to be tendered into the offer. We would, therefore, encourage Perrigo shareholders to tender their shares before the close on November 12. There is no risk to you of tendering early. If you tender before the 12th and the tender fails, you will receive your Perrigo shares back. If you do not tender, however, you risk losing the significant value we are offering. Wait and see is not the right choice if you want to benefit from the premium we are offering. Bottom line, the M-A-T-H is a clear and compelling value proposition relative to Perrigo's stand-alone plan. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Stephanie for questions."

As far as inventories are concerned, we have not seen -- I think I had mentioned you asked them last quarter as well. We have not seen any irregular things happening or our customers selling them because they were anticipating a Teva launch. I think that there had been -- there has not been any commentary about Teva coming into the market, and obviously, they've now clarified yesterday that it won't be at least till the second half of 2016. So our inventory levels were running due course. So there were no issues there as I mentioned. There is a little softness in the overall epinephrine market in the third quarter, but as you know, we continue to see double-digit growth year-over-year, and so the comparables had been very high. With that being said, we had still see EpiPen grow in volume year-to-date. And as far as all of the recent events, I would say that our dynamic with the payers will stay just that, I think very dynamic. As I noted throughout this year, we had been very proactive and competitive to maintain our market share. Obviously, in light of some of the recent developments, I think that we'll continue to have opportunities to improve that situation because it's not as competitive as it was. So as happens in this space, the competition landscape can change very rapidly, and I think our ability to first and most importantly, be there for the patient and the safety issue, and we have been very closely monitoring and assisting to make sure patients can get the scripts of EpiPen. So they're not going without product. So I would say all in all, as I mentioned in my commentary, the runway looks very bright, and I think the future of the EpiPen franchise is just going to be one that's got a lot of brand equity and a lot of sustainability to it."

So first, Gregg, let me before I turn over to Heather for her commentary. The Mylan shareholders have already spoken in terms of the Perrigo transaction and the opportunity we spent an exorbitant amount of time with the Mylan shareholder describing to them why this asset in our hands is the right next opportunity to bolt on to our existing platform with our existing assets, and we convinced them when they supported us in the August 28 vote, we convinced them because we pointed to other assets that we've acquired that we've said very consistently on a stand-alone basis, if you look at what we paid for the other assets, this almost de javu. We've never -- there are many assets that we bolted onto our platform that we do not really like on a stand-alone basis. But then bolted onto our platform as you can see through the demonstration of our continued very strong execution and performance, we were able to deliver continual double-digit growth to our shareholders. So I think that Perrigo is going to be no different. In terms of -- and I'll let Heather explain that in more detail, in terms of the corporate governance, I've been very, very open, very, very direct and very transparent about: One, saying that the entire whole corporate governance discussion over this transaction has been nothing but a red herring. With that said, I do listen to shareholders and Perrigo's shareholders in particularly, I extended -- that's why I extended my offer to Joe Papa and their Board of Directors to sit down and have a dialogue. If this is really something that's all that's left out there, then let's sit down and talk about for the combination of the Mylan-Perrigo combination, for that new structure, that new company profile, the new size and scale that the combined company will be, absolutely wants an open discussion about not just what's on my mind, but I'd like them to participate. I would like them to have a say so. I've offered them Board of Directors seats to help oversee not just participate, but actually help oversee on a going-forward basis. You can't get any more transparent than I have been about opening up or wanting to open up a dialogue and leave everything on the table because I think it's the appropriate thing to do. Heather?"

Our customers are becoming larger and global and to be able to have the scale and the ability to rapidly adapt to that we think happens on this combined basis better than them on a stand-alone. And as we've said many times to the Europe platform, Omega, they don't -- they didn't have any existing infrastructure there. So if you look at our critical math now around Rx channel and the Gx channel and our successful integration of EPD and how we see -- how we turned that business around, it really just shows and highlights that now adding Ox to that channel, again, our ability to really leverage this business and create make 1 plus 1 equal more than 3 is what -- how we've always approached transactions, and that's why we've approached the Perrigo and trying to lay out the realities of Perrigo on a stand-alone basis versus combined with Mylan.

With respect to gross margin, I guess I would start by pointing out that since 2010, our gross margins have increased from 45% up to the high end of the guidance range that we indicated we would be at this year of 55%. So the gross margins have been sustained. They have steadily increased over the last 5, 6 years. We've done that with most importantly, from my perspective, a best-in-class operating platform, which has been driving annual cost reductions in our product portfolio. The vertical integration that we have in that operating platform, the very strong integration of API into -- our own API into our products. It also has been driven by the positive pricing environment that we've seen especially over the last couple of years in North America. And yes, I would agree that EPD has been a portion of the increase that we've seen this year in 2015. But to your question of sustainability on a going-forward basis, I would say that what we've demonstrated over the last 5 years, I see that we continued to be sustainable especially as we continue to add complex new products like generic Advair and our biologics products."

So it's really just bringing the scale together and being able to leverage these complimentary platforms that 1 plus 1 equals to more than 3 or 4. And that's what as we've said, our -- the history of our track record has shown that we've continued to be able to do that with the transaction. I'd say as far as business development opportunities yes, we've said we are focused on the OTC channel and continuing to build out and enhance that platform. Obviously, Perrigo accelerates that. But we're interested in building, and we believe there's great product opportunities and other assets out there that would let us continue to build the OTC, both in the U.S. as well as Rest of World. And as we've said before, we continue to believe there's dosage forms therapeutic categories that we still don't have critical mass in.

We believe that we've got other areas such as balsamic that we can continue to bolt on and really leverage our global commercial platform."

So I would say what we continue to see is because of the shortages and some of the issues with the FDA that our ability to have that reliable supply has really been a differentiator for Mylan and has allowed us to continue to do more and optimize the assets we have.

I believe first, we need to deal with the Perrigo -- in the Perrigo potential transaction because I think again, Ronny, a lot of this is a big red herring. I truly believe it's much more of an excuse, and that's being used right now than the realities. We are a public company. A company as a public company is for sale every single day. That's what a public company is. We, as a board, we've made our position abundantly clear that we will not hold this company back.

So in a way to take it off the table why I mentioned this morning, why I reached out to Joe after I saw that he left the shareholders no other alternative than to rely on some high P/E multiple. I'm giving him and the Board of Directors an opportunity to have dialogue. I will invite their board members to participate in any questions or considerations on a going-forward basis. And I will also invite their board members to come on the board and represent the Perrigo side, the Perrigo shareholders.

So it's not necessarily a relevant point. I guess I'll just also hit, Heather, the purchase accounting amortization that is when we make an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the allocation of the purchase price to the value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, so that -- and the intangible assets are then amortized. That's a noncash amortization charge, which is the -- had been a consistent adjustment that we've made associated with our adjustment from GAAP to adjusted earnings.

During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition of Perrigo by Mylan, which I will refer to as the Perrigo proposal; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the EPD transaction of Mylan Inc. and Abbott Laboratories non-U.S. developed end markets; specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the EPD Business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo proposal or EPD transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan's, Perrigo's or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition, Mylan having sufficient supply of EpiPen Auto-Injector to meet anticipated demand due to Sanofi's voluntary recall, and other expectations and targets for future periods.
Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the EPD transaction and the Perrigo proposal; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of Perrigo and the EPD Business being more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; operating costs, customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo proposal and the EPD transaction; the impact of competition situations where we manufacture, market and/or sell products, notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; any changes in our differences with our inventory of or ability to manufacture and distribute the EpiPen Auto-Injector; and those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V.'s quarterly results on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC.
These risks as well as other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the registration statement on Form S-4, which includes an offer to exchange prospectus and was declared effective on September 10, 2015, in connection with the Perrigo proposal. The offer to exchange prospectus filed with Mylan with the SEC on Schedule TO on September 14, 2015, constitutes the offer document for purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules.
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.
In addition, we will be referring to actual and certain projected financial metrics of Mylan and Perrigo on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.
Please refer to today's earnings release and the presentation used during today's call, both of which are available on our website, as they contain detailed reconciliations, where possible, of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material new information or significant new opinion which have not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares of Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult his or her professional advisers.
Before I turn the call over to Robert, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to welcome our employees around the world to the call and thank them for their unwavering dedication, hard work and focus, which is what makes our consistently strong results possible. I would also like to welcome any Perrigo and Omega employees listening in today. We certainly look forward to welcoming all of you to the Mylan family soon as we have never been more confident in completing what we believe will be a very successful tender offer. 
In addition, I would like to say a special hello to the Perrigo employees in Israel today. We are very excited to have now received approval to dual list on the Tel Aviv exchange and to finally have the opportunity to acquaint ourselves more closely with Israel, Israeli investors and Perrigo Israeli employees. 
Before I turn the call over to Heather, Rajiv and John, who have a lot to cover today, I would like to make a couple of points regarding our offer for Perrigo and to clear up some of the possible misinformation. 
First, the notion conveyed by Perrigo that the Mylan offer is a bad deal for Perrigo shareholders is simply preposterous and disingenuous. We will show once again today with math, using Perrigo's own updated numbers, that this is a substantial and compelling offer to Perrigo's shareholders. 
Let me also simply highlight that Perrigo themselves have left their own shareholders no other options except to rely on nonstrategic measures such as cost cuts as well as the hope that they will trade at a very high P/E multiple at a time when multiples have been completely reset throughout the industry in order to generate their stand-alone long-term shareholder value. This strategy is flawed and simply will not produce sustainable growth over the longer term and is in sharp contrast to Mylan's well-established long-term strategy and exceptional operational performance that you will hear more about today. 
With that said, as you will see later, it really doesn't matter which unrealistic multiple Perrigo wants to apply to itself because the immediate and significant earnings accretion to be realized by the Perrigo shareholder, which is potentially in excess of 80%, speaks for itself. If Perrigo is correct and the math doesn't lie, then you will see that the math will speak loudly in favor of the Mylan's offer. 
Here is just one clear example of how the math alone will demonstrate the compelling value of the Mylan offer. Perrigo has recently projected its maximum stand-alone earnings capability for 2016 to be at $9.45, including the completion of a $500 million share buyback by year-end. What they haven't told you and what we will demonstrate using Perrigo's own math is that Perrigo's shareholders have the opportunity to earn $16.48 in 2016 if they simply accept Mylan's offer and reinvest $75 in cash back into Mylan's stock at the current share price. 
Even if you accept the premise that Perrigo can achieve a forward 16x P/E multiple without our offer, their stock will still only be traded in the $150 range. In comparison, what we will show today is that our combined earnings after reinvesting the $75 in cash would be worth approximately $200 per share using only a 12x multiple, which I believe will only increase over time. 
This substantial value is also in sharp contrast when you also consider the potential downside in Perrigo's stock should Mylan not receive a greater of 50% of acceptances by 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 13. 
With this immediate and substantial accretion offered by our proposal to the Perrigo shareholders, this is anything but a bad deal for Perrigo. Therefore, in order to realize this immediate and significant value, you should tender your shares by the close of November 12 or risk losing this offer. 
Lastly, with the October 23 deadline, which is now past, for Perrigo to make material announcements, I did reach out to Joe Papa this past weekend and again offered to sit down with him so that we can plan with our management teams, as responsible leaders should, and bringing our 2 great companies together. We filed this communication this morning with the SEC. 
I also made clear that I would be open to discussing corporate governance as part of this conversation with the aim of coming to a negotiated transaction. Unfortunately, Joe once again rebuffed my offer and missed the opportunity to discuss his thoughts on this matter. As I've said in my meetings with shareholders, I am very open to a conversation about corporate governance for the Mylan-Perrigo combination and will continue to maintain an active dialogue with shareholders on this matter. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Heather."
290203,312848745,887607,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. To say the least, the last few months and days have been eventful. We have had a great quarter.

To say the least, the last few months and days have been eventful. We have had a great quarter. We have a great outlook for the remainder of the year and a tremendous growth trajectory, supported by many opportunities in front of us. 
In addition to reviewing our quarter, we will again discuss our compelling offer for Perrigo and give an update on our integration planning for once the transaction is complete. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter, where we've broken a number of records. On the top line, adjusted sales totaled $2.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year, with our Mylan legacy business delivering 14% growth on a constant currency basis, reflecting our diversification and scale. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS came in at $1.43, up 23% compared to third quarter of 2014. This performance was fueled by strong revenue growth across our Generics segment, with each of our regions experiencing year-over-year constant currency increases in adjusted sales. 
Turning to our Specialty segment. We continue to believe now more than ever in the underlying strength of the EpiPen franchise as well as the growth potential for the market overall going forward. We have continued to be proactive and competitive in maintaining our 85% market share. So while we saw a slight softening in the overall epinephrine market in Q3, total script volume remains positive for EpiPen on a year-over-year basis. 
Against this backdrop, we note Teva's statement that it will not be in a position to potentially launch a BX- or AB-rated alternative to EpiPen any earlier than the second half of 2016.
Additionally, Sanofi has instituted a nationwide recall of Auvi-Q, affecting hospitals, retailers and consumers. We have confirmed that we have sufficient supply of products to meet any anticipated demand. We're confident that the widespread familiarity with EpiPen established over more than 25 years, coupled with our robust training resources, will provide access and support for those impacted by the recall. 
We take our leadership position on the epinephrine auto-injector market very seriously, and we'd like to point out that there are approximately 28 million at-risk individuals in the United States. Of the approximately 14 million people who have been diagnosed, about 10% are carrying auto-injectors, leaving room for substantial upside. 
Additionally, anaphylactic events can occur in people with no known allergies. This was demonstrated by a recent survey of schools participating in our EpiPen4Schools program. The study indicated that more than 20% of the students or others on school grounds who had an anaphylactic episode and were treated had no idea they had any allergies. Obviously, this underscores the continued opportunity to build education and awareness about the need for access to our products, including public entities, as well as the runway that still exists for our EpiPen franchise. 
As a result of these developments, we see additional opportunities this year. We therefore expect adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of our range for 2015. This represents, once again, greater than 20% EPS growth. Moreover, given the long-term landscape change for the EpiPen market, we see EpiPen contributing an additional range of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 to adjusted EPS next year, which will only enhance the already stated significant growth rates projected for Mylan-Perrigo on a combined basis. 
Before leaving EpiPen, I'd like to add that the recent developments in the news and the epinephrine market as a whole are particularly significant given the number of organic catalysts we see for Mylan in 2017 and beyond, which Rajiv will be discussing. That said, we have never had a strategy to building business based on one product or one-off event. Instead, we remain committed to building a differentiated platform that will deliver long-term sustainable growth for shareholders, while at the same time benefiting our patients and other stakeholders. 
Our results so far this year are a testament to our strategy, ability to execute it and exceed expectations, and our scale in leveraging assets that we brought together, whether it's returning EPD Business to growth, lowering our tax rate or continuing to invest in R&D. 
Given current market dynamics, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, trading on fundamentals has never been more important, which is why a Mylan-Perrigo combination is so compelling. On last week's call, we got another glimpse at Perrigo's operating performance, which is struggling. 
On sales, they reduced their guidance by $150 million to $250 million. On EPS, while they announced adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 that was above consensus, taking a closer look, the change is driven by employee reductions and other cost cuts as well as financial measures. 
Stripping all of that away, adjusted diluted EPS guidance on the core business was actually reduced by $0.24 below consensus. This ultimate reduction in guidance is not a result of onetime items but of continued degradation across their Consumer Health Care business. Furthermore, API has declined by 16% year-to-date. 
Looking at Tysabri, the longer-term hope has evaporated. Patient usage is down by approximately 4% annually since 2010. With the recent failure in the Phase III study of SPMS, there is potential for further decline as SPMS patients who used Tysabri off label turn to other alternatives. Tysabri, as we know, contributes almost 1/3 of Perrigo's adjusted diluted EPS. 
The complementary Mylan-Perrigo combination will not only derisk Perrigo's shareholders on a stand-alone basis, it will provide enhanced growth, scale and capability. As such, we strongly believe that Perrigo's shareholders will see past the company's latest round of one-off initiatives. They will appreciate that Perrigo's stand-alone strategy is simply not a viable alternative to Mylan's offer. They will grasp the compelling value of our offer, which provides immediate accretion in excess of 80% as well as greater growth potential for the long term and respond by tendering their shares. 
Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to thank all of our employees around the world for their continued dedication to our cause and for remaining focused on executing and delivering the outstanding performance our shareholders expect and deserve. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

I am very excited to review the performance of business, update you on our progress on some of our key growth drivers and provide some insight into our integration planning for Perrigo, including a high-leve",2250,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. I am very excited to review the performance of business, update you on our progress on some of our key growth drivers and provide some insight into our integration planning for Perrigo, including a high-level overview of our plans for our first 60 days of owning this business. 
As Heather mentioned, all of our regions contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the third quarter, with each delivering very impressive double-digit revenue growth. Our global Generics segment generated third-party net sales of more than $2.3 billion, a year-over-year increase of 48% on a constant currency basis. 
In North America, sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our legacy business grew by 24% as a result of continued strong performance of sales from new products as well as higher volumes on existing products, offset by lower net pricing. We continue to see an improved flow of approvals coming out of FDA, and we launched 14 new products in U.S. this quarter, including several first generics to market and complex products such as lidocaine transdermal, paliperidone and esomeprazole.   
In Europe, adjusted sales were approximately $630 million, a 95% constant currency increase as compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to the contribution of our acquired EPD Business. Our legacy business grew 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis as a result of sales of new products and higher volumes on existing ones, primarily in Italy and France. These increases were offset by government-imposed pricing reductions and competitive market conditions. 
In our Rest of World business, sales totaled just under $550 million, a year-over-year increase of 47% on constant currency basis. Sales from our legacy business grew 21% on constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes from our India operations, especially our [indiscernible] franchise and our promising business in Brazil.
We continue to be very pleased with the integration process of our Abbott EPD Business across our various businesses taking a country-by-country approach to maximizing the potential opportunities from this combination. We have put in place new operating structures in several countries and are beginning to realize the benefits of cross-selling and an enhanced focused on key products. 
We are extremely pleased to see a continuation of low single-digit growth in revenues across our EPD geographies in the third quarter, which historically declined in this business, and we see this continuing through the end of the year. As we noted last quarter, the improvement in this business has been quicker than expected, and we are currently tracking ahead on our execution plan. 
We also continue to make progress executing against a number of our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future. Let me start with our respiratory platform. Sirdupla continues to be a nice product for us in Europe. We are very pleased with how we executed on the launch of this product and now have more than 500 out of 1,160 clinics dispensing the product in the U.K. As we continue to build on our respiratory platform, our once-a-day LAMA revefenacin nebulized product for COPD, partnered with Theravance, entered into a Phase III clinical program in September. This program currently remains on track for an NDA submission in the later part of 2017. 
We are also making good progress on our generic Flovent program for U.S., which we have partnered with Prosonix. Generic Flixotide, which is the same product in Europe, is on track to be approved in Q1 2016. We are excited to update you on our significant progress in our generic Advair program. As you are aware, the FDA draft guidance requires several key elements to achieve an AB-rated generic product. We are very pleased to report to you today that we have successfully achieved the forming milestones for this product and are on track to submit our ANDA this December. 
Formulation design has been developed to be qualitatively and quantitatively the same as the reference product. We have completed our clinical endpoint study and have shown our product to meet all draft guidance criteria. Our device robustness and human factor studies have now been completed and demonstrate that our device can be used successfully with new patients as well as those trained on Advair Diskus. These studies met all predefined protocol criteria.
In-vitro equivalence studies against the reference products have met all acceptance criteria. We have also completed PK bioequivalence studies for the 2 of the 3 stems to meet all draft guidance bioequivalence criteria. The third and the final PK study is ongoing and will be available for our December submission. 
In addition, we have had excellent engagement with FDA throughout our development program and have recently completed a productive and collaborative pre-ANDA meeting with the agency. 
Moving on to our biologics and insulin analog program with our partner, Biocon. We are very excited about the progress these programs have made during the last year with 5 programs successfully completing Phase I clinical trials and 4 programs in active Phase III testing.
To this end, we plan on submitting in 2016 3 biosimilar applications and one Glargine application in the U.S. and Europe. As an update to our trastuzumab development program, we have now completed enrollment of 4 Phase III study, with the first study results expected to be available in the second half of 2016. We expect to submit our application in the first half of 2016. 
For pegfilgrastim, we have now completed the enrollment in our Phase III trials. We plan on filing this product application in the first half of 2016. 
The Phase III clinical program for our adalimumab is advancing well and is expected to complete for a second half of 2016 submission. 
Finally, we have now completed recruitment for both type 1 and type 2 case studies for our Glargine program, and we expect to have these studies completed by mid-2016. We continue to pursue our discussions with FDA regarding interchangeability. We also are very pleased with the completion and qualification of the state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia and with our activities to transfer the products into that facility. 
We plan to submit a European filing and our U.S. application in the second half of 2016. While we continue to execute on the current portfolio, we also continue to actively explore opportunities to further enhance Mylan's biologics portfolio around the globe. 
Regarding our Copaxone program, as we indicated last quarter, we have responded to all FDA request today. We remain confident that we are positioned to receive approval for our product. 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has instituted an inter partes review proceedings of all claims against 3 Copaxone 40-milligram patents, and a hearing has been scheduled for May 2016. We generally believe that the IP surrounding the 40-milligram franchise is weak. 
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are looking forward to close our acquisition of certain women health care businesses from Famy Care by the end of the year, although the close has been delayed a bit as we await final approval from FIPB in India, which we expect very soon. 
Turning now to Perrigo. Let me start off by being very clear. We are capable, confident and ready to run the Perrigo business as soon as we close and have been putting in place a comprehensive readiness plan to allow us to do so. Of course, the first step will be ensuring business continuity of the existing businesses and maintaining the operational and commercial excellence that Perrigo and Mylan are known for. 
As we discussed during the last call, I don't think anyone should doubt our ability to manage Perrigo's generics or API businesses. These capabilities are at Mylan's core, and our strong capabilities in these areas will only enhance the Perrigo assets. 
Also, we are very confident that we can do more with Omega within our combined commercial platform in Europe than what Perrigo has done or could do with this asset on a stand-alone basis, especially given our strong track record in the region with the Merck and Abbott EPD integration. 
Now let me talk about the private label manufacturing. One of the key factors which has been called out for success in this area is supply chain excellence. Mylan's supply chain, manufacturing and packaging capabilities are well recognized as being second to none. 
Our global supply chain operations are based in Dublin, and this hub has been operational since 2009. Our complex platform manages more than 1,400 products and 15,000 SKUs from around 40 internal manufacturing sites and more than 1,400 third-party suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations. With this platform, we serve approximately 145 markets around the world, have more than 35,000 customers, and we serve these customers and markets in 40 different languages with varying packaging and artwork. All of this makes adding Perrigo supply chain to our existing business very straightforward. 
I also want to address the comments made by Perrigo about the lack of realistic opportunities in the API business. First, I would like to note that API synergies are a relatively small part of our estimate. That said, the opportunity we see here is about having a broad and diverse platform and deploying that platform, including its capacity, capability and portfolios in an opportunistic way. 
For example, after the Merck Generics acquisition, we successfully integrated 50% of the pipeline and portfolio despite not having the relevant capabilities prior to the acquisition. 
Turning to the next slide. We manage a complex and diverse network of more than 30 finish process internal sites that are strategically located across the network and maintain a close proximity to key markets. Our ability to manage this complexity is a result of our continued focus on operational excellence, including quality and delivery of a broad range of portfolio to customers at the right time and in the right quantities. 
We can bring Perrigo into our network and even more effectively deploy their assets to the benefit of our business and customers. As you know, we have successfully executed a number of global and transformational integrations, and we have established a permanent integration office. 
As part of this process, we have identified interim leaders for key Perrigo functional areas to lead the integration in addition to Ranjan Chaudhuri, whom we announced today to be the global commercial leader of our OTC business. These leaders are prepared and fully capable of managing these functions in the event that Perrigo leaders in those areas choose to depart upon closing. We have also retained third-party consultants to support us in this process with significant experience in the OTC space. This will only further ensure that we are well prepared to manage the business. 
A critical priority for us will be to get to know the key talent at Perrigo and implement retention programs. We believe that as we communicate with leaders and their employees, they will see the significant opportunities for their future growth that this combination presents and they will be excited to engage with us on achieving a shared vision for the combined business. We very much hope to make this a collaborative effort, and we'll seek to retain as many of Perrigo leaders as possible. 
Within the first 60 days, we will have developed a clear road map for integration of our businesses, a plan for synergy realization as well as a defined operating model. With regards to synergy realization, I would like to reiterate our confidence in our estimate that the combined company will achieve at least $800 million in annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year or following the consummation of the offer. 
Perrigo's cost-cutting actions announced last week further validate the synergy potential from a much larger combined Mylan-Perrigo platform. For instance, Mylan's global supply chain operations are already located at our Center of Excellence in Ireland where Perrigo is looking to consolidate their supply chain operations, providing strategic and synergistic opportunities, and we are already advanced in the implementation of Mylan's global shared service structure, another area Perrigo identified for efficiencies, which could be implemented more effectively as part of Mylan. 
Working with the Perrigo team, we expect to identify additional opportunities from the combined assets. We are confident in achieving these synergies both in a controlled subsidiary or a 100% ownership situation, although we have stated we believe some different steps may be taken to achieve that synergy realization, depending on the ownership level achieved. 
 
Finally, I would like to remind everyone again that Mylan has successfully integrated several large and highly complex transactions, dealing with multiple geographies, new business areas and convoluted structures, including operating metrics as a majority-owned controlled public entity for several years. While this combination with Perrigo has its own unique dynamic and complicating factors, we are realistic about the challenges, confident in our planning and experience, and optimistic that once we get to day 1, our combined teams will put the bias of the last few months aside and get to work together to ensure our mutual success. 
In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to Mylan's employees who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission every day and are now energized about the Perrigo opportunity and looking forward to welcoming their new colleagues to Mylan. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated du",1619,"Thanks, Rajiv. As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated during the quarter. 
Our adjusted total revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were $2.7 billion, an increase of 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. Adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $122 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, yen, rupee and Australian dollar. 
When compared to exchange rates at the beginning of the quarter, our adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $23 million. 
Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $462 million, of which approximately $314 million was in Europe, $105 million was in our Rest of World region and the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
As stated during our second quarter conference call, foreign currency translation has been significantly impacted by reported revenues as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. As such, we expect that our actual reported full year 2015 adjusted revenues will be at the low end of our 2015 guidance range. On a constant currency basis, however, we expect to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for 2015 adjusted revenues. 
Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was a very strong 58%, up approximately 400 basis points over the prior year. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the EPD Business combined with new product introductions and increased margins on existing products within North America. We continue to expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be at the upper end of our 2015 guidance range. 
On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $174 million or 6% -- approximately 6% of total revenues for the quarter. Adjusted R&D expense has actually increased over the prior year quarter as a result of the impact of the EPD Business. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of adjusted total revenues to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year.
At the same time, and also on an adjusted basis, SG&A was $492 million or approximately 18% of total revenues for the quarter. The acquisition of the EPD Business accounted for the majority of the increase in adjusted SG&A for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be close to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. 
We continue to realize significant tax benefits from our inversion transaction and as a result of our ongoing efforts to optimize our tax structure, during the third quarter, we adjusted our full year 2015 estimated annual effective tax rate to 18% from our previous assumption of 19%. This resulted in an adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of approximately 17%. 
As we move towards the end of 2015, we continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our tax rate. Our third quarter adjusted net earnings were $734 million or $1.43 per share, a 23% increase from our Q3 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.16 per share. 
Excluding the gain that we recognized in the prior year period for the settlement of contingent consideration related to the Agila acquisition, adjusted diluted EPS increased an impressive 42%. The EPS growth in 2015 was achieved in spite of foreign currency headwinds, thanks to the strength of our global operating platform, including the recently acquired EPD Business combined with revenue growth across our legacy Generics business. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was a record $1.1 billion for the current quarter, representing an increase of approximately $655 million from the prior year period, which is the result of the growth in adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. 
Through diligent cash flow management, our free cash flow increased 158% to $1 billion. Over the first 9 months of 2015, free cash flow has risen 72% to $1.4 billion as compared to $818 million in the prior year period. Year-to-date capital spending was down slightly as compared to the prior year at $207 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. As a result of our strong operating cash flow, at the end of the quarter, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2:1. 
We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million receivables facility or $1.65 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, we further optimized our capital structure through the redemption of our $1 billion 2020 senior notes, the repayment of our cash convertible notes, which matured in September. We funded these transactions through a $1.6 billion term loan, which we entered into at the beginning of the quarter. 
We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after a successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo, and we continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. As a reminder, we have a fully committed financing facility to fund the acquisition of the Perrigo shares pursuant to our tender offer. 
For the full year, as Heather stated earlier, we expect to be at the high end of our 2015 guidance range at $4.35 per adjusted diluted share. I would note that we are not assuming the launch of generic Copaxone or EpiPen competition in 2015. 
Now turning back to our tender offer for Perrigo. I'd like to quickly review -- revisit the HUSP. As we showed a few weeks ago using Perrigo's own updated numbers and even using their proxy peer group, we believe that Perrigo would trade at $153 per share or a 15x EBITDA multiple, which is a discount to where they're trading today and is a significant discount to the value of our offer. 
Turning to Slide 21. On a stand-alone basis, Perrigo has told you that their plan would deliver $9.45 of EPS in 2016 based on their recently announced financial initiatives, or $9.83 if you give them credit for the run rate cost savings they hope to achieve within 3 years. Applying an illustrative 14 to 16x multiple to that EPS estimate, Perrigo would be worth between $132 and $151 per share next year assuming phased-in cost savings or up to $157 if you give them credit for run rate cost savings on a stand-alone basis. 
In comparison, Mylan's offer for Perrigo using Perrigo's own number -- numbers, would deliver $9.55 of earnings attributable to each Perrigo share assuming phased-in synergies, or $10.83 per Perrigo share assuming run rate synergies. This represents accretion of 3% to 16% to Perrigo shareholders. 
Even if you only apply an illustrative 12 to 14x multiple to this EPS and add $75 in cash, it implies a total value of $190 to $226 per share. It is important to note that these per share amounts are based upon Mylan analyst consensus estimates and do not include the $0.25 to $0.30 of the EpiPen Auto-Injector 2016 upside opportunity Heather referred to earlier. 
And if shareholders choose to reinvest their $75 of cash consideration in the combined company, they would receive $16.48 of EPS assuming phased-in synergies and $18.70 assuming run rate synergies. This represents 77% to 101% earnings accretion attributable to Perrigo's shareholders due to the premium embedded in our offer. 
Again, even if you only apply an illustrative 12 to 14x multiple to this EPS, it implies a total value of $198 to $262 per share, a substantial premium to what Perrigo could deliver on a stand-alone basis. So if shareholders choose Perrigo's stand-alone strategy, even if you assume a higher range of multiples of 14 to 16x, your shares would be, at best, be worth $151 per share. 
However, if you vote in favor of the transaction, your shares will be worth more, no matter what you choose to believe in terms of multiples. Again, let's return to the math. 
Assuming only an illustrative 12x multiple and phased-in synergies, based on Perrigo's numbers, your shares would be worth $190 with no reinvestment and $198 with reinvestment, a substantial premium to the best-case scenario of Perrigo stand-alone or a $37 to $45 premium to Perrigo's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. 
Giving credit for run rate synergies and a blended multiple 14x, the earnings attributed to the Perrigo shareholder would represent a value of $209 per share without reinvestment and $231 with reinvestment, a $56 to $78 premium to today's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. 
Remember, in order to reach this substantial value and for the transaction to be completed, greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shares will need to be tendered into the offer. We would, therefore, encourage Perrigo shareholders to tender their shares before the close on November 12. There is no risk to you of tendering early. If you tender before the 12th and the tender fails, you will receive your Perrigo shares back. If you do not tender, however, you risk losing the significant value we are offering. Wait and see is not the right choice if you want to benefit from the premium we are offering. Bottom line, the M-A-T-H is a clear and compelling value proposition relative to Perrigo's stand-alone plan. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Stephanie for questions."

As far as inventories are concerned, we have not seen -- I think I had mentioned actually on last quarter as well. We have not seen any irregular things happening or our customers selling down because they were anticipating a Teva launch. Now, I think that there had been -- there has not been any commentary about Teva coming into the market, and obviously, they've now clarified yesterday that it won't be at least till the second half of 2016. So our inventory levels were running due course. So there were no issues there, as I mentioned. There was a little softness in the overall epinephrine market in the third quarter, but as you know, we continue to see double-digit growth year-over-year, and so the comparables had been very high. With that being said, we have still see EpiPen grow in volume year-to-date. And as far as all of the recent events, I would say that our dynamic with the payers will stay just that, I think very dynamic. As I noted throughout this year, we have been very proactive and competitive to maintain our market share. Obviously, in light of some of the recent developments, I think that we'll continue to have opportunities to improve that situation because it's not as competitive as it was. So as happens in this space, the competition landscape can change very rapidly, and I think our ability to first and most importantly, be there for the patient and the safety issue, and we have been very closely monitoring and assisting to make sure patients can get the scripts of EpiPen so they're not going without product. So I would say all in all, as I mentioned in my commentary, the runway looks very bright, and I think the future of the EpiPen franchise is just going to be one that's got a lot of brand equity and a lot of sustainability to it."

We have a real possibility to get on a fast-track.

The Mylan shareholders have already spoken in terms of the Perrigo transaction and the opportunity. We've spent an exorbitant amount of time with the Mylan shareholder describing to them why this asset in our hands is the right next opportunity to bolt on to our existing platform with our existing assets, and we convinced them when they supported us in the August 28 vote. We convinced them because we pointed to other assets that we've acquired that we've said very consistently on a stand-alone basis, if you look at what we paid for the other assets, this is almost deja vu. We've never -- there are many assets that we bolted on to our platform that we do not really like on a stand-alone basis. But then bolted on to our platform, as you can see through the demonstration of our continued very strong execution and performance, we were able to deliver continual double-digit growth to our shareholders. So I think that Perrigo is going to be no different. In terms of -- and I'll let Heather explain that in more detail. In terms of the corporate governance, I've been very, very open, very, very direct and very transparent about, one, saying that the entire whole corporate governance discussion over this transaction has been nothing but a red herring. With that said, I do listen to shareholders and Perrigo's shareholders in particularly, I extended -- that's why I extended my offer to Joe Papa and their Board of Directors to sit down and have a dialogue. If this is really something that's all that's left out there, then let's sit down and talk about, for the combination of the Mylan-Perrigo combination, for that new structure, that new company profile, the new size and scale that the combined company will be, absolutely warrants an open discussion about not just what's on my mind, but I'd like them to participate. I would like them to have a say so. I've offered them Board of Directors seats to help oversee, not just participate, but actually help oversee on a going-forward basis. You can't get any more transparent than I have been about opening up or wanting to open up a dialogue and leave everything on the table because I think it's the appropriate thing to do. Heather?"

Our customers are becoming larger and global and to be able to have the scale and the ability to rapidly adapt to that we think happens on this combined basis better than them on a stand-alone. And as we've said many times to the Europe platform, Omega, they don't -- they didn't have any existing infrastructure there. So if you look at our critical mass now around the Rx channel and the Gx channel and our successful integration of EPD and how we see -- how we turned that business around, it really just shows and highlights that now adding Ox to that channel, again, our ability to really leverage this business and create, make 1 plus 1 equal more than 3 is what -- how we've always approached transactions, and that's why we've approached the Perrigo and trying to lay out the realities of Perrigo on a stand-alone basis versus combined with Mylan.

So the gross margins have been sustained. They have steadily increased over the last 5, 6 years. We've done that with, most importantly, from my perspective, a best-in-class operating platform, which has been driving annual cost reductions in our product portfolio. The vertical integration that we have in that operating platform, the very strong integration of API into -- our own API into our products. It also has been driven by the positive pricing environment that we've seen especially over the last couple of years in North America. And yes, I would agree that EPD has been a portion of the increase that we've seen this year in 2015.

I'd say as far as business development opportunities, yes, we've said we're focused on the OTC channel and continuing to build out and enhance that platform. Obviously, Perrigo accelerates that. But we're interested in building, and we believe there's great product opportunities and other assets out there that would let us continue to build the OTC, both in the U.S. as well as Rest of World. And as we've said before, we continue to believe there's dosage forms, therapeutic categories that we still don't have critical mass in.

So on the question of the EPD revenues without being on a constant currency basis, you certainly know that the euro has weakened substantially against the U.S. dollar over the last year, and you also know we didn't own the EPD Business last year, so that it wasn't included in our revenues. So I would just say that the EPD Business revenues on an actual value as expressed in U.S. dollars are down year-over-year. But again not -- it wasn't in our numbers. So it's not necessarily a relevant point. I guess I'll just also hit, Heather, the purchase accounting amortization that is when we make an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the allocation of the purchase price to the value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, so that -- and the intangible assets are then amortized. That's a noncash amortization charge, which is -- had been a consistent adjustment that we've made associated with our adjustment from GAAP to adjusted earnings. And lastly, the financing charges, those represent the costs associated with the refinancing of our capital, our balance sheet, including the committed bridge loan that we have in place associated with our Perrigo tender offer."

Welcome to Mylan's conference call to discuss our third quarter 2015 earnings and our offer to acquire Perrigo Company. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Executive Chairman, Robert Coury; Chief Executive, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and CFO, John Sheehan.
During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition of Perrigo by Mylan, which I will refer to as the Perrigo proposal; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the EPD transaction of Mylan Inc. and Abbott Laboratories non-U.S. developed end markets; specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the EPD Business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo proposal or EPD transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan's, Perrigo's or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition, Mylan having sufficient supply of EpiPen Auto-Injector to meet anticipated demand due to Sanofi's voluntary recall, and other expectations and targets for future periods.
Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the EPD transaction and the Perrigo proposal; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of Perrigo and the EPD Business being more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; operating costs, customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo proposal and the EPD transaction; the impact of competition situations where we manufacture, market and/or sell products, notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; any changes in our differences with our inventory of or ability to manufacture and distribute the EpiPen Auto-Injector; and those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V.'s quarterly results on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC.
These risks as well as other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the registration statement on Form S-4, which includes an offer to exchange prospectus and was declared effective on September 10, 2015, in connection with the Perrigo proposal. The offer to exchange prospectus filed with Mylan with the SEC on Schedule TO on September 14, 2015, constitutes the offer document for purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules.
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.
In addition, we will be referring to actual and certain projected financial metrics of Mylan and Perrigo on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.
Please refer to today's earnings release and the presentation used during today's call, both of which are available on our website, as they contain detailed reconciliations, where possible, of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material new information or significant new opinion which have not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares of Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult his or her professional advisers.
Before I turn the call over to Robert, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to welcome our employees around the world to the call and thank them for their unwavering dedication, hard work and focus, which is what makes our consistently strong results possible. I would also like to welcome any Perrigo and Omega employees listening in today. We certainly look forward to welcoming all of you to the Mylan family soon as we have never been more confident in completing what we believe will be a very successful tender offer. 
In addition, I would like to say a special hello to the Perrigo employees in Israel today. We are very excited to have now received approval to dual list on the Tel Aviv exchange and to finally have the opportunity to acquaint ourselves more closely with Israel, Israeli investors and Perrigo Israeli employees. 
Before I turn the call over to Heather, Rajiv and John, who have a lot to cover today, I would like to make a couple of points regarding our offer for Perrigo and to clear up some of the possible misinformation. 
First, the notion conveyed by Perrigo that the Mylan offer is a bad deal for Perrigo shareholders is simply preposterous and disingenuous. We will show once again today with math, using Perrigo's own updated numbers, that this is a substantial and compelling offer to Perrigo's shareholders. 
Let me also simply highlight that Perrigo themselves have left their own shareholders no other options except to rely on nonstrategic measures such as cost cuts as well as the hope that they will trade at a very high P/E multiple at a time when multiples have been completely reset throughout the industry in order to generate their stand-alone long-term shareholder value. This strategy is flawed and simply will not produce sustainable growth over the longer term and is in sharp contrast to Mylan's well-established long-term strategy and exceptional operational performance that you will hear more about today. 
With that said, as you will see later, it really doesn't matter which unrealistic multiple Perrigo wants to apply to itself because the immediate and significant earnings accretion to be realized by the Perrigo shareholder, which is potentially in excess of 80%, speaks for itself. If Perrigo is correct and the math doesn't lie, then you will see that the math will speak loudly in favor of the Mylan's offer. 
Here is just one clear example of how the math alone will demonstrate the compelling value of the Mylan offer. Perrigo has recently projected its maximum stand-alone earnings capability for 2016 to be at $9.45, including the completion of a $500 million share buyback by year-end. What they haven't told you and what we will demonstrate using Perrigo's own math is that Perrigo's shareholders have the opportunity to earn $16.48 in 2016 if they simply accept Mylan's offer and reinvest $75 in cash back into Mylan's stock at the current share price. 
Even if you accept the premise that Perrigo can achieve a forward 16x P/E multiple without our offer, their stock will still only be traded in the $150 range. In comparison, what we will show today is that our combined earnings after reinvesting the $75 in cash would be worth approximately $200 per share using only a 12x multiple, which I believe will only increase over time. 
This substantial value is also in sharp contrast when you also consider the potential downside in Perrigo's stock should Mylan not receive a greater of 50% of acceptances by 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 13. 
With this immediate and substantial accretion offered by our proposal to the Perrigo shareholders, this is anything but a bad deal for Perrigo. Therefore, in order to realize this immediate and significant value, you should tender your shares by the close of November 12 or risk losing this offer. 
Lastly, with the October 23 deadline, which is now past, for Perrigo to make material announcements, I did reach out to Joe Papa this past weekend and again offered to sit down with him so that we can plan with our management teams, as responsible leaders should, and bringing our 2 great companies together. We filed this communication this morning with the SEC. 
I also made clear that I would be open to discussing corporate governance as part of this conversation with the aim of coming to a negotiated transaction. Unfortunately, Joe once again rebuffed my offer and missed the opportunity to discuss his thoughts on this matter. As I've said in my meetings with shareholders, I am very open to a conversation about corporate governance for the Mylan-Perrigo combination and will continue to maintain an active dialogue with shareholders on this matter. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Heather."
290203,312848745,888571,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.

To say the least, the last few months and days have been eventful. We have had a great quarter. We have a great outlook for the remainder of the year and a tremendous growth trajectory, supported by many opportunities in front of us. 
In addition to reviewing our quarter, we will again discuss our compelling offer for Perrigo and give an update on our integration planning for once the transaction is complete. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter, where we've broken a number of records. On the top line, adjusted sales totaled $2.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year, with our Mylan legacy business delivering 14% growth on a constant currency basis, reflecting our diversification and scale. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS came in at $1.43, up 23% compared to third quarter of 2014. This performance was fueled by strong revenue growth across our Generics segment, with each of our regions experiencing year-over-year constant currency increases in adjusted sales. 
Turning to our Specialty segment. We continue to believe now more than ever in the underlying strength of the EpiPen franchise as well as the growth potential for the market overall going forward. We have continued to be proactive and competitive in maintaining our 85% market share. So while we saw a slight softening in the overall epinephrine market in Q3, total script volume remains positive for EpiPen on a year-over-year basis. 
Against this backdrop, we note Teva's statement that it will not be in a position to potentially launch a BX- or AB-rated alternative to EpiPen any earlier than the second half of 2016.
Additionally, Sanofi has instituted a nationwide recall of Auvi-Q, affecting hospitals, retailers and consumers. We have confirmed that we have sufficient supply of products to meet any anticipated demand. We're confident that the widespread familiarity with EpiPen established over more than 25 years, coupled with our robust training resources, will provide access and support for those impacted by the recall. 
We take our leadership position on the epinephrine auto-injector market very seriously, and we'd like to point out that there are approximately 28 million at-risk individuals in the United States. Of the approximately 14 million people who have been diagnosed, about 10% are carrying auto-injectors, leaving room for substantial upside. 
Additionally, anaphylactic events can occur in people with no known allergies. This was demonstrated by a recent survey of schools participating in our EpiPen4Schools program. The study indicated that more than 20% of the students or others on school grounds who had an anaphylactic episode and were treated had no idea they had any allergies. Obviously, this underscores the continued opportunity to build education and awareness about the need for access to our products, including public entities as well as the runway that still exists for our EpiPen franchise. 
As a result of these developments, we see additional opportunities this year. We therefore expect adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of our range for 2015. This represents, once again, greater than 20% EPS growth. Moreover, given the long-term landscape change for the EpiPen market, we see EpiPen contributing an additional range of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 to adjusted EPS next year, which will only enhance the already stated significant growth rates projected for Mylan-Perrigo on a combined basis. 
Before leaving EpiPen, I'd like to add that the recent developments in the news and the epinephrine market as a whole are particularly significant given the number of organic catalysts we see for Mylan in 2017 and beyond, which Rajiv will be discussing. That said, we have never had a strategy to building business based on one product or one-off event. Instead, we remain committed to building a differentiated platform that will deliver long-term sustainable growth for shareholders, while at the same time benefiting our patients and other stakeholders. 
Our results so far this year are a testament to our strategy, ability to execute it and exceed expectations, and our scale in leveraging assets that we brought together, whether it's returning EPD Business to growth, lowering our tax rate or continuing to invest in R&D. 
Given current market dynamics, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, trading on fundamentals has never been more important, which is why a Mylan-Perrigo combination is so compelling. On last week's call, we got another glimpse at Perrigo's operating performance, which is struggling. 
On sales, they reduced their guidance by $150 million to $250 million. On EPS, while they announced adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 that was above consensus, taking a closer look, the change is driven by employee reductions and other cost cuts as well as financial measures. 
Stripping all of that away, adjusted diluted EPS guidance on the core business was actually reduced by $0.24 below consensus. This ultimate reduction in guidance is not a result of onetime items but of continued degradation across their Consumer Health Care business. Furthermore, API has declined by 16% year-to-date. 
Looking at Tysabri, the longer-term hope has evaporated. Patient usage is down by approximately 4% annually since 2010. With the recent failure in the Phase III study of SPMS, there is potential for further decline as SPMS patients who used Tysabri off label turn to other alternatives. Tysabri, as we know, contributes almost 1/3 of Perrigo's adjusted diluted EPS. 
The complementary Mylan-Perrigo combination will not only derisk Perrigo's shareholders on a stand-alone basis, it will provide enhanced growth, scale and capability. As such, we strongly believe that Perrigo's shareholders will see past the company's latest round of one-off initiatives. They will appreciate that Perrigo's stand-alone strategy is simply not a viable alternative to Mylan's offer. They will grasp the compelling value of our offer, which provides immediate accretion in excess of 80% as well as greater growth potential for the long term and respond by tendering their shares. 
Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to thank all of our employees around the world for their continued dedication to our cause and for remaining focused on executing and delivering the outstanding performance our shareholders expect and deserve. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

I am very excited to review the performance of business, update you on our progress on some of our key growth drivers and provide some insight into our integration planning for Perrigo, including a high-level overview of our plans for our first 60 days of owning this business. 
As Heather mentioned, all of our regions contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the third quarter, with each delivering very impressive double-digit revenue growth. Our global Generics segment generated third-party net sales of more than $2.3 billion, a year-over-year increase of 48% on a constant currency basis. 
In North America, sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our legacy business grew by 24% as a result of continued strong performance of sales from new products as well as higher volumes on existing products, offset by lower net pricing. We continue to see an improved flow of approvals coming out of FDA, and we launched 14 new products in U.S. this quarter, including several first generics to market and complex products such as lidocaine transdermal, paliperidone and esomeprazole. 
In Europe, adjusted sales were approximately $630 million, a 95% constant currency increase as compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to the contribution of our acquired EPD Business. Our legacy business grew 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis as a result of sales of new products and higher volumes on existing ones, primarily in Italy and France. These increases were offset by government-imposed pricing reductions and competitive market conditions. 
In our Rest of World business, sales totaled just under $550 million, a year-over-year increase of 47% on constant currency basis. Sales from our legacy business grew 21% on constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes from our India operations, especially our [indiscernible] franchise and our promising business in Brazil.
We continue to be very pleased with the integration process of our Abbott EPD Business across our various businesses taking a country-by-country approach to maximizing the potential opportunities from this combination. We have put in place new operating structures in several countries and are beginning to realize the benefits of cross-selling and an enhanced focused on key products. 
We are extremely pleased to see a continuation of low single-digit growth in revenues across our EPD geographies in the third quarter, which historically declined in this business, and we see this continuing through the end of the year. As we noted last quarter, the improvement in this business has been quicker than expected, and we are currently tracking ahead on our execution plan. 
We also continue to make progress executing against a number of our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future. Let me start with our respiratory platform. Sirdupla continues to be a nice product for us in Europe. We are very pleased with how we executed on the launch of this product and now have more than 500 out of 1,160 clinics dispensing the product in the U.K. As we continue to build on our respiratory platform, our once-a-day LAMA revefenacin nebulized product for COPD, partnered with Theravance, entered into a Phase III clinical program in September. This program currently remains on track for an NDA submission in the later part of 2017. 
We are also making good progress on our generic Flovent program for U.S., which we have partnered with Prosonix. Generic Flixotide, which is the same product in Europe, is on track to be approved in Q1 2016. We are excited to update you on our significant progress in our generic Advair program. As you are aware, the FDA draft guidance requires several key elements to achieve an AB-rated generic product. We are very pleased to report to you today that we have successfully achieved the forming milestones for this product and are on track to submit our ANDA this December. 
Formulation design has been developed to be qualitatively and quantitatively the same as the reference product. We have completed our clinical endpoint study and have shown our product to meet all draft guidance criteria. Our device robustness and human factor studies have now been completed and demonstrate that our device can be used successfully with new patients as well as those trained on Advair Diskus. These studies met all predefined protocol criteria.
In-vitro equivalence studies against the reference products have met all acceptance criteria. We have also completed PK bioequivalence studies for the 2 of the 3 stems to meet all draft guidance bioequivalence criteria. The third and the final PK study is ongoing and will be available for our December submission. 
In addition, we have had excellent engagement with FDA throughout our development program and have recently completed a productive and collaborative pre-ANDA meeting with the agency. 
Moving on to our biologics and insulin analog program with our partner, Biocon. We are very excited about the progress these programs have made during the last year with 5 programs successfully completing Phase I clinical trials and 4 programs in active Phase III testing.
To this end, we plan on submitting in 2016 3 biosimilar applications and one Glargine application in the U.S. and Europe. As an update to our trastuzumab development program, we have now completed enrollment of 4 Phase III study, with the first study results expected to be available in the second half of 2016. We expect to submit our application in the first half of 2016. 
For pegfilgrastim, we have now completed the enrollment in our Phase III trials. We plan on filing this product application in the first half of 2016. 
The Phase III clinical program for our adalimumab is advancing well and is expected to complete for a second half of 2016 submission. 
Finally, we have now completed recruitment for both type 1 and type 2 case studies for our Glargine program, and we expect to have these studies completed by mid-2016. We continue to pursue our discussions with FDA regarding interchangeability. We also are very pleased with the completion and qualification of the state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia and with our activities to transfer the products into that facility. 
We plan to submit a European filing and our U.S. application in the second half of 2016. While we continue to execute on the current portfolio, we also continue to actively explore opportunities to further enhance Mylan's biologics portfolio around the globe. 
Regarding our Copaxone program, as we indicated last quarter, we have responded to all FDA request today. We remain confident that we are positioned to receive approval for our product. 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has instituted an inter partes review proceedings of all claims against 3 Copaxone 40-milligram patents, and a hearing has been scheduled for May 2016. We generally believe that the IP surrounding the 40-milligram franchise is weak. 
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are looking forward to close our acquisition of certain women health care businesses from Famy Care by the end of the year, although the close has been delayed a bit as we await final approval from FIPB in India, which we expect very soon. 
Turning now to Perrigo. Let me start off by being very clear. We are capable, confident and ready to run the Perrigo business as soon as we close and have been putting in place a comprehensive readiness plan to allow us to do so. Of course, the first step will be ensuring business continuity of the existing businesses and maintaining the operational and commercial excellence that Perrigo and Mylan are known for. 
As we discussed during the last call, I don't think anyone should doubt our ability to manage Perrigo's generics or API businesses. These capabilities are at Mylan's core, and our strong capabilities in these areas will only enhance the Perrigo assets. 
Also, we are very confident that we can do more with Omega within our combined commercial platform in Europe than what Perrigo has done or could do with this asset on a stand-alone basis, especially given our strong track record in the region with the Merck and Abbott EPD integration. 
Now let me talk about the private label manufacturing. One of the key factors which has been called out for success in this area is supply chain excellence. Mylan's supply chain, manufacturing and packaging capabilities are well recognized as being second to none. 
Our global supply chain operations are based in Dublin, and this hub has been operational since 2009. Our complex platform manages more than 1,400 products and 15,000 SKUs from around 40 internal manufacturing sites and more than 1,400 third-party suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations. With this platform, we serve approximately 145 markets around the world, have more than 35,000 customers, and we serve these customers and markets in 40 different languages with varying packaging and artwork. All of this makes adding Perrigo supply chain to our existing business very straightforward. 
I also want to address the comments made by Perrigo about the lack of realistic opportunities in the API business. First, I would like to note that API synergies are a relatively small part of our estimate. That said, the opportunity we see here is about having a broad and diverse platform and deploying that platform, including its capacity, capability and portfolios in an opportunistic way. 
For example, after the Merck Generics acquisition, we successfully integrated 50% of the pipeline and portfolio despite not having the relevant capabilities prior to the acquisition. 
Turning to the next slide. We manage a complex and diverse network of more than 30 finish process internal sites that are strategically located across the network and maintain a close proximity to key markets. Our ability to manage this complexity is a result of our continued focus on operational excellence, including quality and delivery of a broad range of portfolio to customers at the right time and in the right quantities. 
We can bring Perrigo into our network and even more effectively deploy their assets to the benefit of our business and customers. As you know, we have successfully executed a number of global and transformational integrations, and we have established a permanent integration office. 
As part of this process, we have identified interim leaders for key Perrigo functional areas to lead the integration in addition to Ranjan Chaudhuri, whom we announced today to be the global commercial leader of our OTC business. These leaders are prepared and fully capable of managing these functions in the event that Perrigo leaders in those areas choose to depart upon closing. We have also retained third-party consultants to support us in this process with significant experience in the OTC space. This will only further ensure that we are well prepared to manage the business. 
A critical priority for us will be to get to know the key talent at Perrigo and implement retention programs. We believe that as we communicate with leaders and their employees, they will see the significant opportunities for their future growth that this combination presents and they will be excited to engage with us on achieving a shared vision for the combined business. We very much hope to make this a collaborative effort, and we'll seek to retain as many of Perrigo leaders as possible. 
Within the first 60 days, we will have developed a clear road map for integration of our businesses, a plan for synergy realization as well as a defined operating model. With regards to synergy realization, I would like to reiterate our confidence in our estimate that the combined company will achieve at least $800 million in annual pretax operational synergies by the end of year or following the consummation of the offer. 
Perrigo's cost-cutting actions announced last week further validate the synergy potential from a much larger combined Mylan-Perrigo platform. For instance, Mylan's global supply chain operations are already located at our Center of Excellence in Ireland where Perrigo is looking to consolidate their supply chain operations, providing strategic and synergistic opportunities, and we are already advanced in the implementation of Mylan's global shared service structure, another area Perrigo identified for efficiencies, which could be implemented more effectively as part of Mylan. 
Working with the Perrigo team, we expect to identify additional opportunities from the combined assets. We are confident in achieving these synergies both in a controlled subsidiary or a 100% ownership situation, although we have stated we believe some different steps may be taken to achieve that synergy realization, depending on the ownership level achieved. 
 
Finally, I would like to remind everyone again that Mylan has successfully integrated several large and highly complex transactions, dealing with multiple geographies, new business areas and convoluted structures, including operating metrics as a majority-owned controlled public entity for several years. While this combination with Perrigo has its own unique dynamic and complicating factors, we are realistic about the challenges, confident in our planning and experience, and optimistic that once we get to day 1, our combined teams will put the bias of the last few months aside and get to work together to ensure our mutual success. 
In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to Mylan's employees who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission every day and are now energized about the Perrigo opportunity and looking forward to welcoming their new colleagues to Mylan. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated du",1619,"Thanks, Rajiv. As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated during the quarter. 
Our adjusted total revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were $2.7 billion, an increase of 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. Adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $122 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, yen, rupee and Australian dollar. 
When compared to exchange rates at the beginning of the quarter, our adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $23 million. 
Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $462 million, of which approximately $314 million was in Europe, $105 million was in our Rest of World region and the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
As stated during our second quarter conference call, foreign currency translation has been significantly impacted by reported revenues as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. As such, we expect that our actual reported full year 2015 adjusted revenues will be at the low end of our 2015 guidance range. On a constant currency basis, however, we expect to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for 2015 adjusted revenues. 
Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was a very strong 58%, up approximately 400 basis points over the prior year. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the EPD Business combined with new product introductions and increased margins on existing products within North America. We continue to expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be at the upper end of our 2015 guidance range. 
On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $174 million or 6% -- approximately 6% of total revenues for the quarter. Adjusted R&D expense has actually increased over the prior year quarter as a result of the impact of the EPD Business. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of adjusted total revenues to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year.
At the same time, and also on an adjusted basis, SG&A was $492 million or approximately 18% of total revenues for the quarter. The acquisition of the EPD Business accounted for the majority of the increase in adjusted SG&A for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be close to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. 
We continue to realize significant tax benefits from our inversion transaction and as a result of our ongoing efforts to optimize our tax structure, during the third quarter, we adjusted our full year 2015 estimated annual effective tax rate to 18% from our previous assumption of 19%. This resulted in an adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of approximately 17%. 
As we move towards the end of 2015, we continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our tax rate. Our third quarter adjusted net earnings were $734 million or $1.43 per share, a 23% increase from our Q3 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.16 per share. 
Excluding the gain that we recognized in the prior year period for the settlement of contingent consideration related to the Agila acquisition, adjusted diluted EPS increased an impressive 42%. The EPS growth in 2015 was achieved in spite of foreign currency headwinds, thanks to the strength of our global operating platform, including the recently acquired EPD Business combined with revenue growth across our legacy Generics business. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was a record $1.1 billion for the current quarter, representing an increase of approximately $655 million from the prior year period, which is the result of the growth in adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. 
Through diligent cash flow management, our free cash flow increased 158% to $1 billion. Over the first 9 months of 2015, free cash flow has risen 72% to $1.4 billion as compared to $818 million in the prior year period. Year-to-date capital spending was down slightly as compared to the prior year at $207 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. As a result of our strong operating cash flow, at the end of the quarter, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2:1. 
We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million receivables facility or $1.65 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, we further optimized our capital structure through the redemption of our $1 billion 2020 senior notes, the repayment of our cash convertible notes, which matured in September. We funded these transactions through a $1.6 billion term loan, which we entered into at the beginning of the quarter. 
We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after a successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo, and we continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. As a reminder, we have a fully committed financing facility to fund the acquisition of the Perrigo shares pursuant to our tender offer. 
For the full year, as Heather stated earlier, we expect to be at the high end of our 2015 guidance range at $4.35 per adjusted diluted share. I would note that we are not assuming the launch of generic Copaxone or EpiPen competition in 2015. 
Now turning back to our tender offer for Perrigo. I'd like to quickly review -- revisit the HUSP. As we showed a few weeks ago using Perrigo's own updated numbers and even using their proxy peer group, we believe that Perrigo would trade at $153 per share or a 15x EBITDA multiple, which is a discount to where they're trading today and is a significant discount to the value of our offer. 
Turning to Slide 21. On a stand-alone basis, Perrigo has told you that their plan would deliver $9.45 of EPS in 2016 based on their recently announced financial initiatives, or $9.83 if you give them credit for the run rate cost savings they hope to achieve within 3 years. Applying an illustrative 14 to 16x multiple to that EPS estimate, Perrigo would be worth between $132 and $151 per share next year assuming phased-in cost savings or up to $157 if you give them credit for run rate cost savings on a stand-alone basis. 
In comparison, Mylan's offer for Perrigo using Perrigo's own number -- numbers, would deliver $9.55 of earnings attributable to each Perrigo share assuming phased-in synergies, or $10.83 per Perrigo share assuming run rate synergies. This represents accretion of 3% to 16% to Perrigo shareholders. 
Even if you only apply an illustrative 12 to 14x multiple to this EPS and add $75 in cash, it implies a total value of $190 to $226 per share. It is important to note that these per share amounts are based upon Mylan analyst consensus estimates and do not include the $0.25 to $0.30 of the EpiPen Auto-Injector 2016 upside opportunity Heather referred to earlier. 
And if shareholders choose to reinvest their $75 of cash consideration in the combined company, they would receive $16.48 of EPS assuming phased-in synergies and $18.70 assuming run rate synergies. This represents 77% to 101% earnings accretion attributable to Perrigo's shareholders due to the premium embedded in our offer. 
Again, even if you only apply an illustrative 12 to 14x multiple to this EPS, it implies a total value of $198 to $262 per share, a substantial premium to what Perrigo could deliver on a stand-alone basis. So if shareholders choose Perrigo's stand-alone strategy, even if you assume a higher range of multiples of 14 to 16x, your shares would be, at best, be worth $151 per share. 
However, if you vote in favor of the transaction, your shares will be worth more, no matter what you choose to believe in terms of multiples. Again, let's return to the math. 
Assuming only an illustrative 12x multiple and phased-in synergies, based on Perrigo's numbers, your shares would be worth $190 with no reinvestment and $198 with reinvestment, a substantial premium to the best-case scenario of Perrigo stand-alone or a $37 to $45 premium to Perrigo's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. 
Giving credit for run rate synergies and a blended multiple 14x, the earnings attributed to the Perrigo shareholder would represent a value of $209 per share without reinvestment and $231 with reinvestment, a $56 to $78 premium to today's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. 
Remember, in order to reach this substantial value and for the transaction to be completed, greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shares will need to be tendered into the offer. We would, therefore, encourage Perrigo shareholders to tender their shares before the close on November 12. There is no risk to you of tendering early. If you tender before the 12th and the tender fails, you will receive your Perrigo shares back. If you do not tender, however, you risk losing the significant value we are offering. Wait and see is not the right choice if you want to benefit from the premium we are offering. Bottom line, the M-A-T-H is a clear and compelling value proposition relative to Perrigo's stand-alone plan. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Stephanie for questions."

As far as inventories are concerned, we have not seen -- I think I had mentioned actually on last quarter as well. We have not seen any irregular things happening or our customers selling down because they were anticipating a Teva launch. Now I think that there had been -- there has not been any commentary about Teva coming into the market, and obviously, they've now clarified yesterday that it won't be at least till the second half of 2016. So our inventory levels were running due course. So there were no issues there, as I mentioned. There was a little softness in the overall epinephrine market in the third quarter, but as you know, we continue to see double-digit growth year-over-year, and so the comparables had been very high. With that being said, we have still see EpiPen grow in volume year-to-date. And as far as all of the recent events, I would say that our dynamic with the payers will stay just that, I think very dynamic. As I noted throughout this year, we have been very proactive and competitive to maintain our market share. Obviously, in light of some of the recent developments, I think that we'll continue to have opportunities to improve that situation because it's not as competitive as it was. So as happens in this space, the competition landscape can change very rapidly, and I think our ability to first and most importantly, be there for the patient and the safety issue, and we have been very closely monitoring and assisting to make sure patients can get the scripts of EpiPen so they're not going without product. So I would say all in all, as I mentioned in my commentary, the runway looks very bright, and I think the future of the EpiPen franchise is just going to be one that's got a lot of brand equity and a lot of sustainability to it."

We have a real possibility to get on a fast-track.

The Mylan shareholders have already spoken in terms of the Perrigo transaction and the opportunity. We've spent an exorbitant amount of time with the Mylan shareholder describing to them why this asset in our hands is the right next opportunity to bolt on to our existing platform with our existing assets, and we convinced them when they supported us in the August 28 vote. We convinced them because we pointed to other assets that we've acquired that we've said very consistently on a stand-alone basis, if you look at what we paid for the other assets, this is almost deja vu. We've never -- there are many assets that we bolted on to our platform that we do not really like on a stand-alone basis. But then bolted on to our platform, as you can see through the demonstration of our continued very strong execution and performance, we were able to deliver continual double-digit growth to our shareholders. So I think that Perrigo is going to be no different. In terms of -- and I'll let Heather explain that in more detail. In terms of the corporate governance, I've been very, very open, very, very direct and very transparent about, one, saying that the entire whole corporate governance discussion over this transaction has been nothing but a red herring. With that said, I do listen to shareholders and Perrigo's shareholders in particularly, I extended -- that's why I extended my offer to Joe Papa and their Board of Directors to sit down and have a dialogue. If this is really something that's all that's left out there, then let's sit down and talk about, for the combination of the Mylan-Perrigo combination, for that new structure, that new company profile, the new size and scale that the combined company will be, absolutely warrants an open discussion about not just what's on my mind, but I'd like them to participate. I would like them to have a say so. I've offered them Board of Directors seats to help oversee, not just participate, but actually help oversee on a going-forward basis. You can't get any more transparent than I have been about opening up or wanting to open up a dialogue and leave everything on the table because I think it's the appropriate thing to do. Heather?"

Our customers are becoming larger and global and to be able to have the scale and the ability to rapidly adapt to that we think happens on this combined basis better than them on a stand-alone. And as we've said many times to the Europe platform, Omega, they don't -- they didn't have any existing infrastructure there. So if you look at our critical mass now around the Rx channel and the Gx channel and our successful integration of EPD and how we see -- how we turned that business around, it really just shows and highlights that now adding Ox to that channel, again, our ability to really leverage this business and create, make 1 plus 1 equal more than 3 is what -- how we've always approached transactions, and that's why we've approached the Perrigo and trying to lay out the realities of Perrigo on a stand-alone basis versus combined with Mylan.

So the gross margins have been sustained. They have steadily increased over the last 5, 6 years. We've done that with, most importantly, from my perspective, a best-in-class operating platform, which has been driving annual cost reductions in our product portfolio. The vertical integration that we have in that operating platform, the very strong integration of API into -- our own API into our products. It also has been driven by the positive pricing environment that we've seen especially over the last couple of years in North America. And yes, I would agree that EPD has been a portion of the increase that we've seen this year in 2015. But to your question of sustainability on a going-forward basis, I would say that what we've demonstrated over the last 5 years, I see that we continue to be sustainable especially as we continue to add complex new products like generic Advair and our biologics products."

So it's really just bringing the scale together and being able to leverage these complementary platforms that 1 plus 1 equals more than 3 or 4. And that's what, as we've said, our -- the history, our track record has shown that we continue to be able to do that with the transactions. I'd say as far as business development opportunities, yes, we've said we're focused on the OTC channel and continuing to build out and enhance that platform. Obviously, Perrigo accelerates that. But we're interested in building, and we believe there's great product opportunities and other assets out there that would let us continue to build the OTC, both in the U.S. as well as Rest of World. And as we've said before, we continue to believe there's dosage forms, therapeutic categories that we still don't have critical mass in. As we added the injectable platform as an important bolus and opportunity for us to gain critical mass in that area, we believe that we've got other areas such as ophthalmics that we can continue to bolt on and really leverage our global commercial platform."

But what I would tell you is, as we noted, I believe, in our commentary, that our, we've seen our volume up more than our increases. So when you look at our broad portfolio and hundreds of products, it's not grow -- it's not dependent on any one product or any massive pricing, price increases across the board. So I would say what we continue to see is because of the shortages and some of the issues with the FDA that our ability to have that reliable supply has really been a differentiator for Mylan and has allowed us to continue to do more and optimize the assets we have. As far as the Perrigo businesses and their commentary on their price cuts or what businesses they're selling. Look, I think it would be premature for us to comment on those assets or their assessments.

Can you just give us an idea about how much -- what is the step function in R&D to cover those? And last, to come back to you guys on this issue of governance. I understand that you want to talk to the board of Perrigo on this issue, but for your own shareholders, I mean, the question is, are you willing to undo the stichting requirements to keep Mylan independent? Are you willing to change the board election to allow shareholders to propose new members for your own shareholders looking long term? Is this in the plans? Will you commit to that?

Look, Ronny, I don't want to be discussing corporate governance in a vacuum. I think it's appropriate when you look at this new combined entity, its profile, its size and scale, what the -- this new profile will be on a going-forward basis. I think it's very important, rather than do this in a vacuum or on our own, I think it's very important that 2 boards come together and discuss this matter openly. I think it should be discussed with shareholders. Certainly, I would seek the Mylan shareholders. Let me remind you that this corporate governance has been voted in by the Mylan shareholders, and I will always be open -- with that said, this is really about the Perrigo transaction right now, but I will always be open with the -- about the Mylan and Perrigo shareholders on an ongoing basis and all the type of governance changes that you've outlined, I will absolutely be open to all of those things with a good discussion. I believe first, we need to deal with the Perrigo -- in the Perrigo potential transaction because I think again, Ronny, a lot of this is a big red herring. I truly believe it's much more of an excuse that's being used right now than the realities. We are a public company. A company as a public company is for sale every single day. That's what a public company is. We, as a board, we've made our position abundantly clear that we will not hold this company back. There's been several types of transactions I have mentioned that we would be open for, both in value and in structure. And especially transactions that would accelerate the mission and strategy of the company while delivering value for shareholders. So I want you to understand because I know this is something that you wrote about, something that you've -- and I'm certain we're going to have a lot more discussions about, but I can't be any more transparent. Let's not use this as [indiscernible]. So in a way to take it off the table, why I mentioned this morning, why I reached out to Joe after I saw that he left the shareholders no other alternative than to rely on some high P/E multiple. I'm giving him and the Board of Directors an opportunity to have dialogue. I will invite their board members to participate in any questions or considerations on a going-forward basis. And I will also invite their board members to come on the board and represent the Perrigo side, the Perrigo shareholders. So let's not use corporate governance in the place of the real value proposition that 80% plus accretion that we're giving to the Perrigo shareholders.

So I would just say that the EPD Business revenues on an actual value as expressed in U.S. dollars are down year-over-year. But again not -- it wasn't in our numbers. So it's not necessarily a relevant point. I guess I'll just also hit, Heather, the purchase accounting amortization that is when we make an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the allocation of the purchase price to the value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, so that -- and the intangible assets are then amortized. That's a noncash amortization charge, which is -- had been a consistent adjustment that we've made associated with our adjustment from GAAP to adjusted earnings. And lastly, the financing charges, those represent the costs associated with the refinancing of our capital, our balance sheet, including the committed bridge loan that we have in place associated with our Perrigo tender offer."
