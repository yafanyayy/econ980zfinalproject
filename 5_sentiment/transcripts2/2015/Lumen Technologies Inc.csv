And thank you for joining us today. Starting on Slide 5, our fourth quarter results was slightly weaker than our expectations, but we are pleased with our full year 2014 performance and the progress we made",1607,"Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. 
Starting on Slide 5, our fourth quarter results was slightly weaker than our expectations, but we are pleased with our full year 2014 performance and the progress we made towards reaching revenue stability. 
The weakness in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower hosting revenue growth, resulting from lower installs and nonrecurring revenues, along with higher churn and credits. 
Also, we experienced accelerated declines in low bandwidth data revenue, and we had a onetime true-up in employee health care costs that impacted the quarter. 
We are taking a number of actions to drive stronger strategic revenue growth in 2015, and we'll discuss some of those with you today. 
Our recent organizational realignment is expected to result in some initial negative impact on our sales momentum the first half of 2015, but we are confident this refined operating structure positions us well to drive stronger revenue results, strategic revenue growth and operating efficiency over the long-term. 
Global sales and revenue is now led by Karen Puckett, and we expect to accelerate our future revenue growth through more unified sales and marketing approach and improved customer experience. 
Additionally, the alignment of our shared global network and data center infrastructure operations under a single senior leader, Maxine Morrow, is expected to drive increased efficiency and consistency. 
We also completed 2 strategic acquisitions in December. We acquired Data Gardens and Cognilytics, which we believe significantly enhanced our product and solutions portfolio. 
The Data Gardens acquisition gives us a leading disaster recovery as a service cloud solution, which once fully integrated with our current IT solutions should provide an improved end-to-end customer experience. 
Acquisition of Cognilytics positions CenturyLink as a leading provider of advanced predictive analytics and big data solutions that help midsize and large enterprise convert data to decisions. 
We accomplish this through deep expertise and big data deployment, advance decision sciences and predictive analytics. 
CenturyLink have now delivered advanced big data analytics solutions across multiple industries, including financial services, retail, consumer products, health care, oil and gas, among others. 
Also, we have an outstanding portfolio of network hosting, cloud IT and managed services capabilities. We have integrated this broad portfolio into solutions for a diverse set of customers from the largest companies in the world to small locally focused companies. 
In addition, we have expanded our distribution capabilities and made additional investments in our product enhancements that we believe will be effective in helping drive growth in the coming year. 
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to recap by performance for 2014. During the year, we continue to effectively execute against our objectives and make investments, believe, will lead to revenue stability. 
For the full year 2014, we generated total operating revenue of $18.03 billion, a 0.4% decline compared to 2013. It's an improvement from the 1.5% year-over-year decline in 2013 compared to 2012. 
In 2014, the core revenue and strategic revenues trend also continue to improve at 1.3% annual decline in 2013 to 0.6% annual decline in 2014. 
This continued revenue improvement was driven by a nearly $380 million increase in strategic revenues, primarily due to growth in high-bandwidth data services, high-speed Internet, Prism TV and hosting and cloud revenues. 
Revenue growth from high-bandwidth data services MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength was a strong 16% year-over-year. 
Additionally, the decline of legacy revenue slowed from 7.4% in 2013 to 6.3% in 2014. We achieved solid growth in both high-speed Internet and Prism TV subscribers throughout the year, adding 91,000 and 67,000, respectively. 
We've been pleased with the continued growth of Prism TV subscribers in the existing markets where we further expanded Prism TV services in 2014. 
Throughout the year, we invested to enhance our networks, improve speed availability across our footprint. One direct result of this investment is we grew the number of enabled access live receiving 20 megabits and 40 megabits each by more than 45% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we generated solid free cash flow of $2.7 billion and returned approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. 
Now turning to Slide 7. During 2014, we continue to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communication to an integrated provider of network, cloud hosting and IT services, and we're focused on executing on several strategic priorities. 
We believe these priorities are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company and in driving long-term profitable growth. 
The first of these is to grow business solutions. We continue to drive strong strategic revenue growth for meeting the businesses and government demand for our MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength Network Services during the year. 
Additionally, our Managed and Managed Enterprise solutions continue to gain traction and are beginning to drive meaningful revenue growth due to increasing customer interest from both small and large business customers. 
These managed services helped free them from day-to-day management of their Network Services and equipment, as well as maintenance. 
We are seeing strong demand for GPON service and businesses and expect to drive additional revenue growth from our continued expansion of GPON availability in the months ahead. 
Wholesale revenues remained under pressure due to lower bandwidth, data service disconnects, along with reductions in inter compensation and declining voice usage. 
We've had success mitigating our losses by expanding our copper-based wireless backhaul services, and we now serve over 21,000 towers. 
A key focus in 2015 will be helping our wholesale customers with their total location and cloud requirements. 
Growth in our hosting services, including co-location managed hosting and cloud solutions was below our expectations. However, we believe the hosting opportunities remain strong as we improve the capability of our highly automated next-generation CenturyLink Cloud platform. 
Price compression of co-location renewals and technology refreshes, along with some increased churn, driven by small group of large customers continue to pressure overall hosting revenue growth. 
Now in addition, with our focus on leaving IT capacity issues due to production workloads, we have seen a measured adoption of multi-tenant cloud-based services based on how ready the customer application architecture is for cloud conversion. 
However, interest in and demand for cloud-based services continues to grow. Also, our sale of whole co-location services reached record levels in the second half of 2014. 
From a standpoint of cloud, we're focused on opportunities that leverage our key strength in cloud, one of example of which is the availability of IT department to set spending thresholds at the individual or department level and monitor cloud spend on a realtime basis. 
Although our managed hosting sales are not where we want them to be, we are seeing success in selling our cloud and managed hosting solutions. 
And during the fourth quarter, we added 8 Fortune 500 companies at CenturyLink Cloud and managed hosting customers. 
And finally, on direct channel partners are beginning to sell our managed hosting solutions. We expect to add additional partners in 2015. 
Going on to Slide 8. In the Consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets we have deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. 
For example, in Omaha, the results continue to be strong in the consumer market and we have seen good results in small, medium business space as well. 
Along with our gigabit service expansion of businesses, we also announced the availability of gigabit service to residential customers in select locations in 10 cities, including some of our larger markets like Minneapolis-St. Paul, Denver, Seattle, Las Vegas and Portland. 
We expanded the gigabit footprint of these markets in 2014, expected further expandability of this service in the months ahead. 
We also plan to continue to invest in our Prism TV capabilities, adding approximately 385,000 addressable homes during 2014 which exceeded our full year 2014 target of 300,000 households. 
As of year-end, we had more than 240,000 Prism TV customers across addressable homes of nearly 2.4 million. We anticipate expanding Prism TV services to additional households and markets during the second half of 2015. However, we're not ready to announce a specific markets at this time. 
Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiencies to a number of methods, including networks of litigation and rationalization that should improve our MDM provisioning time and how to drive standardization. We continue to modernize our networks of replacing ATM with IP technology that enables higher broadband speeds, while also adding network capacity to serve our growing customer base. 
For full year 2014, we added over 4 terabytes to our IP backbone, bringing total capacity now to 20 terabytes per second on that backbone. 
Also, we continue to manage expenses related to our declining legacy revenues and lastly, we have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. 
In recent years, we have consolidated our internal IT operations from more than 10 data centers to 4 data centers, and we are using a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same unabated platform, infrastructure and software to service solutions across our internal IT operations that we're selling direct cloud and IT hosting customers. This is effort is expected to reduce our IT costs and improve security and other efficiencies for CenturyLink. 
In summary, I believe we're well positioned in markets with a strong portfolio of strategic assets. We've also invested in and unify distribution capabilities, and we have a laser-focused and continue to improve our revenue trend in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and full year and first quarter 2015 guidance. Stewart?"

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the full year and first quarter 2015 guidance we've included in our earnings release issued earlie",1621,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the full year and first quarter 2015 guidance we've included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Beginning on Slide 10, I'd like to review some highlights from our fourth quarter results. I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 2.3% decline from fourth quarter 2013 operating revenues. Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.05 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of 1.5% from the year-ago period. 
Our strategic revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year and now represents 52% of our total revenues compared to about 50% a year ago. 
Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV continue to drive this growth. 
We added approximately 12,900 Prism TV customers and 18,600 high-speed internet customers during the fourth quarter. We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.71 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. 
The year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin was primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy and product line revenues and accounted adjustment of about $40 million related to employee health care costs, offset by onetime reductions in facility costs and operating taxes totaling $30 million recorded in the current quarter. 
Additionally, we generated $373 million in free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paper taxes, interest in capital expenditures, along with other income. 
Our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter was $0.60. 
As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedule. 
These special items included 2 larger items worth calling out in the fourth quarter, a $60 million favorable income tax adjustment and an approximate $60 million pension settlement charge as a result in a partial termination of a plan. 
Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for an investment of $91 million during fourth quarter. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues declined $104 million or 2.3% compared to fourth quarter a year ago as the growth in strategic revenues was more than offset by the decline in legacy revenues due to access on losses and lower minutes of views and lower data integration revenues. 
The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength in high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth business data services and Prism TV. 
Although legacy revenues continue to decline, the revenue decline in fourth quarter 2014 was 16% lower than the fourth quarter revenue decline a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 12. As outlined in our earnings release beginning with the fourth quarter reporting, we've changed our segment reporting to align with our new organizational structure. We will now report 2 segments: Business and Consumer. 
The Business segment consists primarily of providing network, IT services, co-location, managed hosting and cloud services to enterprise, wholesale and governmental customers across the U.S. and select international locations. 
The Consumer segment consists primarily of providing products and services to residential consumers across our 37 state footprint and remains relatively unchanged from prior reporting. 
Schedules providing 8 quarter trended detail of these new segments are provided in the earnings supplement, which is available on our Investor Relations website. 
Now turning to our Business segment. In fourth quarter, the Business segment generated $2.7 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $102 million or 3.6% from the same period a year ago. 
Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 0.4% to $1.6 billion from fourth quarter  a year ago, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength, which was largely offset by the continued decline of low bandwidth data services and a onetime true-up related to strategic revenues of approximately $10 million in the quarter. 
We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise, customer growth market, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small and medium-sized businesses space to provide improved market share and drive further growth. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.4% from fourth quarter 2013 due primarily to continue to decline in exit lines. 
Total Business segment expenses increased slightly from the year-ago period, driven primarily by higher sales related expenses. 
Our segment margin was 43.6%, a decline from 46% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the higher cost I just mentioned above, along with the continued decline in Business segment legacy and low bandwidth data services revenue. 
On Slide 13, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. High-bandwidth data services revenue grew 13% year-over-year compared to fourth quarter 2013, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. 
Low bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in fourth quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of 13% was primarily due to continued disconnects of TDM circuits by enterprise and wireless customers as they migrate to fiber-based services. 
In the fourth quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $40 million or 23% compared to fourth quarter 2013, driven by lower CPE sales. If you remember fourth quarter in 2013, we actually have 1 sale to a large customer that makes up most of that difference. 
Now turning to Slide 14. Consumer generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, which was basically flat from fourth quarter 2013. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.4% year-over-year to $727 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers, price increases, improved churn and certain favorable revenue settlements in the current quarter. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 5.7% for fourth quarter 2013 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases.  The comparable year-over-year decline in fourth quarter 2013 was 8.5%. 
Operating expenses increased slightly compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by higher Prism TV content cost. 
Now turning to Slide 15 and our full year and first quarter 2015 guidance. For full year 2015, we anticipate total operating revenues of $17.9 billion to $18.1 billion and core revenues of $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion, both stable when compared to full year 2014 due to the expected continued increases in the level of strategic revenue growth offsetting the anticipated legacy revenue declines. 
Operating cash flow is expected to range from $6.8 billion to $7 billion and free cash flow is expected to range from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow are expected to decline for full year 2014, primarily driven by the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenues, the impact of higher expenses associated with the increased growth in strategic revenues and an increase in pension expense of approximately $90 million due to changes in assumptions, which really relate to our adoption of new mortality tables. 
We anticipate a decline in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $250 million for full year 2015 compared to full year 2014 primarily driven by the impact of declining amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the annual review and update of depreciation rates, which were expected to more than offset increases in depreciation expense, associated with continued capital investment. 
Included in the full year free cash flow estimate, our cash taxes of $25 million to $50 million as a result of bonus depreciation being approved our cash taxes will now be less than we anticipated earlier. 
We also expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $3 billion in 2015 and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $2.50 to $2.70. 
Currently, we have not yet decided whether to accept or reject the specific build-out opportunities related to support payments available under CAF II. We plan to provide an update later this year when it is determined the extent to which the implementation of CAF II will impact our future revenues and cash flows. 
For first quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion, an increase compared to fourth quarter 2014, primarily due to projected growth in strategic revenue, offsetting the anticipated decline in legacy revenue resulting in higher core revenue and also higher data integration revenues in first quarter 2015. 
Core revenues are expected to range from $4.04 billion to $4.09 billion. Operating cash flow is projected to be between $1.64 billion to $1.69 billion, a decreased compared to fourth quarter 2014 primarily due to higher pension cost, payroll taxes and operating taxes, along with the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenue. 
We also anticipate an approximate $90 million decline in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter 2015 compared to fourth quarter 2014, driven by the reasons previously described. 
The anticipated lower level of depreciation and amortization expense is expected mostly offset the decrease in operating cash flow and the impact of favorable income tax adjustments in fourth quarter 2014, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS expected to range from $0.56 to $0.61 per share in first quarter 2015 compared to the $0.60 in fourth quarter 2014. 
That concludes our prepared remarks or today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

There's, I think you said there was positive revenue Consumer segment in the quarter. If you could kind of walk us through that so we can kind of get a sense for what is kind of earnings power the company was in the fourth quarter. And then the second part on the guidance, I guess, Glen, you kind of foreshadowed that the shape of 2015 would be a little stronger in revenue in the second half than the first half as a result of some of the reorganization issues. But looking at the first quarter revenue guidance, it's up sequentially, it's actually flat year-over-year at the midpoint. So I was wondering, could you kind of give us a sense as to how much of the expectation for revenue stability do you kind of have in hand right now that you see in your books, in your funnels? And then what increment is coming from the hope for benefits that will be in the back-end of this re-org?"

So David, in terms of the fourth quarter items that are more or less onetime items, we did have a $40 million true-up related to group insurance that was an increase in expense. That was basically offset by $30 million of favorable adjustments that we had. We had about $15 million favorable adjustments related to operating taxes, which are primarily property taxes and then $15 million related to facilities cost that was a favorable adjustment that's a onetime adjustment. So really, net-net, about $10 million negative expense in the fourth quarter that would be onetime adjustments. On the revenue side, basically, they're just a couple of offsetting items there. In business revenue, in the strategic side, we had a $10 million negative adjustment that I mentioned. That was related to a large customer that we have that we needed to book the revenue differently than the way. Basically, it needed to be accounted for differently based on the contracts, so we had a $10 million negative adjustment there on the Business segment for strategic revenue. We also had a positive settlement that I mentioned as well of about $10 million that impacted consumer revenue on the strategic side, and that was basically related to a couple settlements that we had with parties that we sell products for."

We think we'll have some mild disruption due to this re-organization, we're changing sales plan, we're changing really sales leadership, and we're starting to count across the country. So there'll be some disruption there. Our funnel is gold right now, we have a really good funnel. And then also, we're seeing a lot of demand for our combined solutions that we're selling. As I mentioned we saw big deals, Fortune 500 companies, we're selling a small and mid-sized space, we're seeing a lot of our demand for our managed office products. So we're confident that we're going to see increasing demand second half of the year. And yes, we are up in the first quarter, but we expect we need more acceleration to hit that revenue stability that we expect into the second half of the year, so that's what we believe going to happen. And we believe we have plans in place to make that happen, including the expanded distribution, along with the unified approach, combining our cloud and hosting and network sales teams and leadership."

Our pension assets earned about 12% or so, 12% to 14%, in that range. But basically our liability went up a little over about $1.2 billion basically due to $1 billion of it related to the change in the mortality tables, about $1.2 billion related to a lower discount rate, we used a discount rate of 3.9% versus about 4.9% a year ago.

Maybe if you could quantify the churn and what you expect for churn to be in that segment for 2015. And you had mentioned before that cost selling is a big opportunity. Do we still have that as an upside for that segment? And second question I had is sort of a lot of M&A activity in the space. And maybe if you could remind us your thoughts on further asset purchases. Is data centers at space that you want to get bigger in? And what are some of the criteria that you would consider?"

Basically, in terms of the churn, the slowdown in hosting, I mean, we continue to have bankruptcies hit us from a standpoint of some of the customers that are in our facilities and some customer credits, really, related to some services issues that we have. So basically, I think we can really get that work through and from a co-location standpoint, we really had a good quarter from a standpoint of new sales, and we have a lot of optimism in terms of our ability to be able to sell the co-lo space and with the developments that we're baking to our cloud product that was part of the Tier 3 acquisition, we're confident in our ability to be able to get that product to where we can. As Glen mentioned, we picked up 5 Fortune 100, Fortune 500 companies. And so we have a lot of confidence in our ability to be able to add to that. It certainly is not up to our expectation, it's not up to where we want it to be, but we think with the changes that we've made in selling organization, where there's more sellers selling those products and services now over time will see improvement in the revenue associated with those businesses."

And it really is working through customer portfolio. We've been very thoughtful about how we build customer modules, very thoughtful about, as Glen said, the product specialists that are important behind these sales executives. And from there, build the module. So there is modular change, there's compensation changes. We really want sellers hunting more, and we're incenting them to do that. So it's just a transition to a new structure and some we changes and customer portfolio.

Starting on Slide 5. Our fourth quarter results were slightly weaker than our expectations, but we are pleased with our full year 2014 performance and the progress we mad",1624,"Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Starting on Slide 5. Our fourth quarter results were slightly weaker than our expectations, but we are pleased with our full year 2014 performance and the progress we made toward reaching revenue stability. 
The weakness in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower hosting revenue growth, resulting from lower installs and nonrecurring revenues, along with higher churn and credits. Also, we experienced accelerated declines in the low-bandwidth data revenue and we had a onetime true-up in employee health care costs that impacted the quarter. 
We are taking a number of actions to drive stronger strategic revenue growth in 2015, and we'll discuss some of those with you today. 
Our recent organizational realignment is expected to result in some initial negative impact on our sales momentum in the first half of 2015, but we are confident this refined operating structure positions us well to drive stronger revenue results, strategic revenue growth and operating efficiency over the long-term. Global Sales and Revenue is now led by Karen Puckett, and we expect to accelerate our future revenue growth through a more unified sales and marketing approach and improved customer experience. Additionally, the alignment of our shared global network and data center infrastructure operations under a single senior leader, Maxine Moreau, is expected to drive increased efficiency and consistency. 
We also completed 2 strategic acquisitions in December. We acquired Data Gardens and Cognilytics, which we believe significantly enhance our product and solutions portfolio. The DataGardens acquisition gives us a leading Disaster Recovery as a Service cloud solution, which, once fully integrated with our current IT solutions, should provide an improved end-to-end customer experience. 
Acquisition of Cognilytics positions CenturyLink as a leading provider of advanced predictive analytics and big data solutions that help midsized and large enterprises convert data to decisions. We accomplished this through deep expertise and big data deployment, advance decision sciences and predictive analytics. 
CenturyLink have now delivered advanced big data analytics solutions across multiple industries, including financial services, retail, consumer products, health care, oil and gas, among others. 
Also, we have an outstanding portfolio of network hosting, cloud IT and managed services capabilities. We have integrated this broad portfolio into solutions for a diverse set of customers from the largest companies in the world to small, locally focused companies. 
In addition, we have expanded our distribution capabilities and made additional investments in our product enhancements -- in product enhancements that we believe will be effective in helping drive growth in the coming year. 
Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to recap our performance for 2014. During the year, we continue to effectively execute against our objectives and make investments that we believe will lead to revenue stability. 
For the full year 2014, we generated total operating revenue of $18.03 billion, a 0.4% decline compared to 2013. It's an improvement from the 1.5% year-over-year decline in 2013 compared to 2012. 
In 2014, the core revenue and strategic and legacy revenues trend also continue to improve from 1.3% annual decline in 2013 to 0.6% annual decline in 2014. This continued revenue improvement was driven by a nearly $380 million increase in strategic revenues, primarily due to growth in high-bandwidth data services, high-speed Internet, Prism TV and hosting and cloud revenues. 
Revenue growth from high-bandwidth data services, MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength was a strong 16% year-over-year. 
Additionally, the decline of legacy revenue showed -- slowed from 7.4% in 2013 to 6.3% in 2014. We achieved solid growth in both high-speed Internet and Prism TV subscribers throughout the year, adding 91,000 and 67,000, respectively. 
We've been pleased with the continued growth of Prism TV subscribers in the existing markets where we further expanded Prism TV service in 2014. 
Throughout the year, we invested to enhance our networks, improved speed availability across our footprint. One direct result of this investment is that we grew the number of enabled access line, receiving 20 megabits and 40 megabits each by more than 45% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we generated solid free cash flow of $2.7 billion and returned approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. 
Now turning to Slide 7. During 2014, we continued to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications to an integrated provider of network, cloud hosting and IT services, and we're focused on executing on several strategic priorities. 
We believe these priorities are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company in driving long-term, profitable growth. 
The first of these is to grow business solutions. We continue to drive strong strategic growth -- revenue growth for meeting the businesses and government demand for our MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength network services during the year. 
Additionally, our Managed Office and Managed Enterprise solutions continue to gain traction and are beginning to drive meaningful revenue growth due to increasing customer interest from both small and large business customers. These managed services help free them from day-to-day management of their network services and equipment as well as maintenance. 
We are seeing strong demand for GPON service from businesses and expect to drive additional revenue growth from our continued expansion of GPON availability in the months ahead. 
Wholesale revenues remained under pressure due to lower bandwidth, data service disconnects, along with reductions in intercarrier compensation and declining voice usage. We've had success mitigating our losses by expanding our fiber-based wireless backhaul services and we now serve over 21,000 towers. 
A key focus in 2015 will be helping our Wholesale customers with their colocation and cloud requirements. 
Growth in our Hosting services, including colocation, managed hosting and cloud solutions was below our expectations. However, we believe the hosting opportunities remain strong as we improve the capability of our highly automated next-generation CenturyLink Cloud platform. 
Price compression on colocation renewals and technology refreshes, along with some increased churn driven by small group of large customers continue to pressure overall hosting revenue growth. 
In addition, with our focus on leaving IT capacity issues due to production workloads, we have seen a measured adoption of multi-tenant, cloud-based services based on how ready the customer application architecture is for cloud conversion. However, interest in and demand for cloud-based services continues to grow. Also, our sale of colocation services reached record levels in the second half of 2014. 
From the standpoint of cloud, we are focused on opportunities that leverage our key strength in cloud, one example of which is the ability of IT department to set spending thresholds at the individual or department level and monitor cloud spend on a real-time basis. 
Although our managed hosting sales are not where we want them to be, we are seeing success in selling our cloud and managed hosting solutions. 
And during the fourth quarter, we added 8 Fortune 500 companies as CenturyLink Cloud and managed hosting customers. 
And finally, our direct channel partners are beginning to sell our managed hosting solutions. We expect to add additional partners in 2015. 
Going on to Slide 8. In the Consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets we have deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. 
For example, in Omaha, the results continue to be strong in the consumer market and we are seeing good results in small and medium business space as well. 
Along with our gigabit service expansion of our businesses, we also announced the availability of gigabit service to residential customers in select locations in 10 cities, including some of our larger markets like Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Denver, Seattle, Las Vegas and Portland. We expanded the gigabit footprint in these markets in 2014. Expect a further expandability of this service in the months ahead. 
We also plan to continue to invest in our Prism TV capabilities, having added approximately 385,000 addressable homes during 2014, which exceeded our full year 2014 target of 300,000 households. 
As of year-end, we had more than 240,000 Prism TV customers across addressable homes of nearly 2.4 million. We anticipate expanding Prism TV service to additional households and markets during the second half of 2015. However, we're not ready to announce specific markets at this time. 
Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiencies to a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization, that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help to drive standardization. We continue to modernize our networks with replacing ATM with IP technology that enables higher broadband speeds while also adding network capacity to serve our growing customer base. 
For full year 2014, we added over 4 terabytes to our IP backbone, bringing total capacity now to 20 terabytes per second on that backbone. 
Also, we continue to manage expenses related to our declining legacy revenues. And lastly, we have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. 
In recent years, we have consolidated our internal IT operations from more than 10 data centers to 4 data centers and we are using a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform, infrastructure and software to service solutions across our internal IT operations that we're selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT costs and improve security and other efficiencies for CenturyLink. 
In summary, I believe we are well positioned in markets with a strong portfolio of strategic assets. We've also invested in and expanded our unified distribution capabilities and we have a laser focus in continuing to improve our revenues trend in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and full year and first quarter 2015 guidance. Stewart?"

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the full year and first quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier t",1623,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the full year and first quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Beginning on Slide 10, I'd like to review some highlights from our fourth quarter results. I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 2.3% decline from fourth quarter 2013 operating revenues. Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.05 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of 1.5% from the year ago period. 
Our strategic revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year and now represent 52% of our total revenues compared to about 50% a year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV continue to drive this growth. 
We added approximately 12,900 Prism TV customers and 18,600 high-speed internet customers during the fourth quarter. 
We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.71 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. 
The year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin was primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy and product line revenues and an accounting adjustment of about $40 million related to employee health care costs offset by onetime reductions in facility costs and operating taxes totaling $30 million recorded in the current quarter. 
Additionally, we generated $373 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter was $0.60. 
As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedule. These special items included 2 larger items worth calling out in the fourth quarter: a $60 million favorable income tax adjustment and an approximate $60 million pension settlement charge as a result in a partial termination of a plan. 
Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for an investment of $91 million during fourth quarter. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues declined $104 million or 2.3% compared to fourth quarter a year ago as the growth in strategic revenues was more than offset by the decline in legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use and lower data integration revenues. 
The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength in high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth business data services and Prism TV. 
Although legacy revenues continue to decline, the revenue decline in fourth quarter 2014 was 16% lower than the fourth quarter revenue decline a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 12. As outlined in our earnings release beginning with the fourth quarter reporting, we've changed our segment reporting to align with our new organizational structure. We will now report 2 segments: Business and Consumer. 
The Business segment consists primarily of providing network, IT services, colocation, managed hosting and cloud services to enterprise, wholesale and governmental customers across the U.S. and select international locations. 
The Consumer segment consists primarily of providing products and services to residential consumers across our 37-state footprint and remains relatively unchanged from prior reporting. 
Schedules providing 8-quarter trended detail of these new segments are provided in the earnings supplement, which is available on our Investor Relations website. 
Now turning to our Business segment. In fourth quarter, the Business segment generated $2.7 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $102 million or 3.6% from the same period a year ago. 
Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 0.4% to $1.6 billion from fourth quarter  a year ago, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength, which was largely offset by the continued decline of low-bandwidth data services and a onetime true-up related to strategic revenues of approximately $10 million in the quarter. 
We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer growth market and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small- and medium-sized businesses space to provide improved market share and drive further growth. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.4% from fourth quarter 2013 due primarily to continued decline in access lines. 
Total Business segment expenses increased slightly from the year ago period, driven primarily by higher sales-related expenses. Our segment margin was 43.6%, a decline from 46% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the higher costs I just mentioned above, along with the continued decline in Business segment legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue. 
On Slide 13, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. High-bandwidth data services revenue grew 13% year-over-year compared to fourth quarter 2013, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. 
Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in fourth quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of 13% was primarily due to continued disconnects of TDM circuits by enterprise and wireless customers as they migrate to fiber-based services. 
In the fourth quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $40 million or 23% compared to fourth quarter 2013, driven by lower CPE sales. If you remember fourth quarter in 2013, we had -- actually had one sale to a large customer that makes up most of that difference. 
Now turning to Slide 14. Consumer generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, which was basically flat from fourth quarter 2013. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.4% year-over-year to $727 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers, price increases, improved churn and certain favorable revenue settlements in the current quarter. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 5.7% for fourth quarter 2013 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. The comparable year-over-year decline in fourth quarter 2013 was 8.5%. 
Operating expenses increased slightly compared to the same period a year ago, primarily driven by higher Prism TV content costs. 
Now turning to Slide 15 and our full year and first quarter 2015 guidance. For full year 2015, we anticipate total operating revenues of $17.9 billion to $18.1 billion and core revenues of $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion, both stable when compared to full year 2014 due to expected continued increases in the level of strategic revenue growth offsetting the anticipated legacy revenue declines. 
Operating cash flow is expected to range from $6.8 billion to $7 billion and free cash flow is expected to range from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow are expected to decline for full year 2014, primarily driven by the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenues, the impact of higher expenses associated with the increased growth in strategic revenues and an increase in pension expense of approximately $90 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions, which really relate to the -- our adoption of new mortality tables. 
We anticipate a decline in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $250 million for full year 2015 compared to full year 2014, primarily driven by the impact of declining amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the annual review and update of depreciation rates, which were expected to more than offset increases in depreciation expense associated with continued capital investment. 
Included in the full year free cash flow estimate are cash taxes of $25 million to $50 million. As a result of bonus depreciation being approved, our cash taxes will now be less than we anticipated earlier. 
We also expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $3 billion in 2015, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $2.50 to $2.70. 
Currently, we have not yet decided whether to accept or reject the specific build-out opportunities related to support payments available under CAF II. We plan to provide an update later this year when it is determined the extent to which the implementation of CAF II will impact our future revenues and cash flows. 
For first quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion, an increase compared to fourth quarter 2014, primarily due to projected growth in strategic revenue offsetting the anticipated decline in legacy revenue resulting in higher core revenue and also higher data integration revenues in first quarter 2015. 
Core revenues are expected to range from $4.04 billion to $4.09 billion. 
Operating cash flow is projected to be between $1.64 billion to $1.69 billion, a decrease compared to fourth quarter 2014, primarily due to higher pension costs, payroll taxes and operating taxes, along with the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenue. 
We also anticipate an approximate $90 million decline in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter 2015 compared to fourth quarter 2014, driven by the reasons previously described. The anticipated lower level of depreciation and amortization expense is expected mostly to offset the decrease in operating cash flow and the impact of favorable income tax adjustments in fourth quarter 2014, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS expected to range from $0.56 to $0.61 per share in first quarter 2015 compared to the $0.60 in fourth quarter 2014. 
That concludes our prepared remarks or today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

There was -- I think you said there was some positive revenue settlement in the Consumer segment in the quarter. If you could kind of walk us through that so we could kind of get a sense as to what the kind of earnings power the company was in the fourth quarter. And then the second part on the guidance, I guess, Glen, you kind of foreshadowed that the shape of 2015 would be a little stronger in revenue in the second half than the first half as a result of some of the reorganization issues. But looking at the first quarter revenue guidance, it's up sequentially, it's actually flat year-over-year at the midpoint. So I was wondering, could you kind of give us a sense as to how much of the expectation for revenue stability do you kind of have in hand right now that you see in your books, in your funnels? And then what increment is coming from the hoped-for benefits that will be in the back end of this reorg?"

So David, in terms of the fourth quarter items that were more or less onetime items, we did have a $40 million true-up related to group insurance that was an increase in expense. That was basically offset by $30 million of favorable adjustments that we had. We had about $15 million favorable adjustments related to operating taxes, which were primarily property taxes and then $15 million related to facilities costs that was a favorable adjustment, that's a onetime adjustment. So really, net-net, about $10 million negative expense in the fourth quarter that would be onetime adjustments. On the revenue side, basically there were just a couple of offsetting items there. In Business revenue, on the strategic side, we had a $10 million negative adjustment that I mentioned. That was related to a large customer that we have that we needed to book the revenue differently than the way -- basically, it needed to be accounted for differently based on the contracts, so we had a $10 million negative adjustment there on the Business segment for strategic revenue. We also had a positive settlement that I mentioned as well of about $10 million that impacted Consumer revenue on the strategic side and that was basically related to a couple settlements that we had with parties that we sell products for."

As I mentioned, we've some big deals to some Fortune 500 companies. We're selling in the small and midsized space. We're seeing a lot of demand for our managed office products. So we're confident that we're going to see increasing demand in the second half of the year.

Our pension assets earned about 12% or so, 12% to 14%, in that range. But basically, our liability went up a little over about $1.2 billion basically due to $1 billion of it related to the change in the mortality tables, about $1.2 billion related to a lower discount rate, we're using a discount rate of 3.9% versus about 4.9% a year ago. And then we had a little over $1 billion of earnings. So we feel good about where we are with respect to the plans, but that $90 million incremental pension pressure is really a noncash expense."

Our preference, as I said before, is for inorganic growth or opportunity that really fit well with our strategic priorities that create unique value for our customers through differentiation, and that's what we've done with the last 2 acquisitions we bought, which give us some capabilities that others don't have, and the opportunities that can enhance our revenue and cash flow trajectory.

We've been very thoughtful about how we build customer modules, very thoughtful about, as Glen said, the product specialists that are important behind these sales executives, and from there, built the module. So there is modular changes, there's compensation changes. We really want sellers hunting more and we're incenting them to do that. So it's just a transition to new comp structure and some new changes in customer portfolio. The sales, we're hoping will be flat, but we're saying that we could be down a bit on first quarter, which will impact us further quarters out.

Starting on Slide 5. Our fourth quarter results were slightly weaker than our expectations, but we are pleased with our full year 2014 performance and the progress we mad",1627,"Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Starting on Slide 5. Our fourth quarter results were slightly weaker than our expectations, but we are pleased with our full year 2014 performance and the progress we made toward reaching revenue stability. 
The weakness in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower hosting revenue growth, resulting from lower installs and nonrecurring revenues, along with higher churn and credits. Also, we experienced accelerated declines in the low-bandwidth data revenue and we had a onetime true-up in employee health care costs that impacted the quarter. 
We are taking a number of actions to drive stronger strategic revenue growth in 2015, and we'll discuss some of those with you today. 
Our recent organizational realignment is expected to result in some initial negative impact on our sales momentum in the first half of 2015, but we are confident this refined operating structure positions us well to drive stronger revenue results, strategic revenue growth and operating efficiency over the long-term. Global Sales and Revenue is now led by Karen Puckett, and we expect to accelerate our future revenue growth through a more unified sales and marketing approach and improved customer experience. Additionally, the alignment of our shared global network and data center infrastructure operations under a single senior leader, Maxine Moreau, is expected to drive increased efficiency and consistency. 
We also completed 2 strategic acquisitions in December. We acquired Data Gardens and Cognilytics, which we believe significantly enhance our product and solutions portfolio. The DataGardens acquisition gives us a leading Disaster Recovery as a Service cloud solution, which, once fully integrated with our current IT solutions, should provide an improved end-to-end customer experience. 
Acquisition of Cognilytics positions CenturyLink as a leading provider of advanced predictive analytics and Big Data solutions that help midsized and large enterprises convert data to decisions. We accomplished this through deep expertise and Big Data deployment, advanced decision sciences and predictive analytics. 
CenturyLink can now deliver advanced big data analytics solutions across multiple industries, including financial services, retail, consumer products, health care, oil and gas, among others. 
Also, we have an outstanding portfolio of network hosting, cloud IT and managed services capabilities. We have integrated this broad portfolio into solutions for a diverse set of customers from the largest companies in the world to small, locally focused companies. 
In addition, we have expanded our distribution capabilities and made additional investments in our product enhancements -- in product enhancements that we believe will be effective in helping drive growth in the coming year. 
Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to recap our performance for 2014. During the year, we continue to effectively execute against our objectives and make investments that we believe will lead to revenue stability. 
For the full year 2014, we generated total operating revenue of $18.03 billion, a 0.4% decline compared to 2013. It's an improvement from the 1.5% year-over-year decline in 2013 compared to 2012. 
In 2014, the core revenue and strategic and legacy revenues trend also continue to improve from 1.3% annual decline in 2013 to a 0.6% annual decline in 2014. This continued revenue improvement was driven by a nearly $380 million increase in strategic revenues, primarily due to growth in high-bandwidth data services, high-speed Internet, Prism TV and hosting and cloud revenues. 
Revenue growth from high-bandwidth data services, MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength was a strong 16% year-over-year. 
Additionally, the decline of legacy revenue showed -- slowed from 7.4% in 2013 to 6.3% in 2014. We achieved solid growth in both high-speed Internet and Prism TV subscribers throughout the year, adding 91,000 and 67,000, respectively. 
We've been pleased with the continued growth of Prism TV subscribers in the existing markets where we further expanded Prism TV service in 2014. 
Throughout the year, we invested to enhance our networks, improved speed availability across our footprint. One direct result of this investment is that we grew the number of enabled access lines, receiving 20 megabits and 40 megabits each by more than 45% over the prior year. 
Additionally, we generated solid free cash flow of $2.7 billion and returned approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. 
Now turning to Slide 7. During 2014, we continued to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications to an integrated provider of network, cloud hosting and IT services, and we're focused on executing on several strategic priorities. 
We believe these priorities are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company in driving long-term, profitable growth. 
The first of these is to grow business solutions. We continue to drive strong strategic growth -- revenue growth from meeting the businesses and government demand for our MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength network services during the year. 
Additionally, our Managed Office and Managed Enterprise solutions continue to gain traction and are beginning to drive meaningful revenue growth due to increasing customer interest from both small and large business customers. These managed services help free them from day-to-day management of their network services and equipment as well as maintenance. 
We are seeing strong demand for GPON service from businesses and expect to drive additional revenue growth from our continued expansion of GPON availability in the months ahead. 
Wholesale revenues have remained under pressure due to lower bandwidth, data service disconnects, along with reductions in intercarrier compensation and declining voice usage. We've had success mitigating our losses by expanding our fiber-based wireless backhaul services and we now serve over 21,000 towers. 
A key focus in 2015 will be helping our Wholesale customers with their colocation and cloud requirements. 
Growth in our Hosting services, including colocation, managed hosting and cloud solutions, was below our expectations. However, we believe the hosting opportunities remain strong as we improve the capability of our highly automated next-generation CenturyLink Cloud platform. 
Price compression on colocation renewals and technology refreshes, along with some increased churn driven by small group of large customers, continue to pressure overall hosting revenue growth. 
In addition, with our focus on leaving IT capacity issues due to production workloads, we have seen a measured adoption of multi-tenant, cloud-based services based on how ready the customer application architecture is for cloud conversion. However, interest in and demand for cloud-based services continues to grow. Also, our sale of colocation services reached record levels in the second half of 2014. 
From the standpoint of cloud, we are focused on opportunities that leverage our key strengths in cloud, one example of which is the ability of IT departments to set spending thresholds at the individual or department level and monitor cloud spend on a real-time basis. 
Although our managed hosting sales are not where we want them to be, we are seeing success in selling our cloud and managed hosting solutions. 
And during the fourth quarter, we added 8 Fortune 500 companies as CenturyLink Cloud and managed hosting customers. 
And finally, our direct channel partners are beginning to sell our managed hosting solutions. We expect to add additional partners in 2015. 
Going on to Slide 8. In the Consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets we have deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. 
For example, in Omaha, the results continue to be strong in the consumer market and we are seeing good results in small and medium business space as well. 
Along with our gigabit service expansion of our businesses, we also announced the availability of gigabit service to residential customers in select locations in 10 cities, including some of our larger markets like Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Denver, Seattle, Las Vegas and Portland. We expanded the gigabit footprint in these markets in 2014. Expect a further expandability of this service in the months ahead. 
We also plan to continue to invest in our Prism TV capabilities, having added approximately 385,000 addressable homes during 2014, which exceeded our full year 2014 target of 300,000 households. 
As of year-end, we had more than 240,000 Prism TV customers across addressable homes of nearly 2.4 million. We anticipate expanding Prism TV service to additional households and markets during the second half of 2015. However, we're not ready to announce specific markets at this time. 
Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiencies to a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization, that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help to drive standardization. We continue to modernize our networks with replacing ATM with IP technology that enables higher broadband speeds while also adding network capacity to serve our growing customer base. 
For full year 2014, we added over 4 terabytes to our IP backbone, bringing total capacity now to 20 terabytes per second on that backbone. 
Also, we continue to manage expenses related to our declining legacy revenues. And lastly, we have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. 
In recent years, we have consolidated our internal IT operations from more than 10 data centers to 4 data centers and we are using a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform, infrastructure and software to service solutions across our internal IT operations that we're selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT costs and improve security and other efficiencies for CenturyLink. 
In summary, I believe we are well positioned in our markets with a strong portfolio of strategic assets. We've also invested in and expanded our unified distribution capabilities and we have a laser focus in continuing to improve our revenues trend in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and full year and first quarter 2015 guidance. Stewart?"

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the full year and first quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Beginning on Slide 10, I'd like to review some highlights from our fourth quarter results. I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 2.3% decline from fourth quarter 2013 operating revenues. Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.05 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of 1.5% from the year ago period. 
Our strategic revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year and now represent 52% of our total revenues compared to about 50% a year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV continue to drive this growth. 
We added approximately 12,900 Prism TV customers and 18,600 high-speed Internet customers during the fourth quarter. 
We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.71 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. 
The year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin was primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy and Private Line revenues and an accounting adjustment of about $40 million related to employee health care costs offset by onetime reductions in facility costs and operating taxes totaling $30 million recorded in the current quarter. 
Additionally, we generated $373 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter was $0.60. 
As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedule. These special items included 2 larger items worth calling out in the fourth quarter: a $60 million favorable income tax adjustment and an approximate $60 million pension settlement charge as a result in a partial termination of a plan. 
Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for an investment of $91 million during fourth quarter. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues declined $104 million or 2.3% compared to fourth quarter a year ago as the growth in strategic revenues was more than offset by the decline in legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use and lower data integration revenues. 
The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength in high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth business data services and Prism TV. 
Although legacy revenues continue to decline, the revenue decline in fourth quarter 2014 was 16% lower than the fourth quarter revenue decline a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 12. As outlined in our earnings release beginning with the fourth quarter reporting, we've changed our segment reporting to align with our new organizational structure. We will now report 2 segments: Business and Consumer. 
The Business segment consists primarily of providing network, IT services, colocation, managed hosting and cloud services to enterprise, wholesale and governmental customers across the U.S. and select international locations. 
The Consumer segment consists primarily of providing products and services to residential consumers across our 37-state footprint and remains relatively unchanged from prior reporting. 
Schedules providing 8-quarter trended detail of these new segments are provided in the earnings supplement, which is available on our Investor Relations website. 
Now turning to our Business segment. In fourth quarter, the Business segment generated $2.7 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $102 million or 3.6% from the same period a year ago. 
Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 0.4% to $1.6 billion from fourth quarter  a year ago, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength, which was largely offset by the continued decline of low-bandwidth data services and a onetime true-up related to strategic revenues of approximately $10 million in the quarter. 
We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer growth market and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small- and medium-sized businesses space to provide improved market share and drive further growth. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.4% from fourth quarter 2013 due primarily to continued decline in access lines. 
Total Business segment expenses increased slightly from the year ago period, driven primarily by higher sales-related expenses. Our segment margin was 43.6%, a decline from 46% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the higher costs I just mentioned above, along with the continued decline in Business segment legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue. 
On Slide 13, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. High-bandwidth data services revenue grew 13% year-over-year compared to fourth quarter 2013, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. 
Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in fourth quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of 13% was primarily due to continued disconnects of TDM circuits by enterprise and wireless customers as they migrate to fiber-based services. 
In the fourth quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $40 million or 23% compared to fourth quarter 2013, driven by lower CPE sales. If you remember fourth quarter in 2013, we had -- actually had one sale to a large customer that makes up most of that difference. 
Now turning to Slide 14. Consumer generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, which was basically flat from fourth quarter 2013. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.4% year-over-year to $727 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers, price increases, improved churn and certain favorable revenue settlements in the current quarter. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 5.7% from fourth quarter 2013 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. The comparable year-over-year decline in fourth quarter 2013 was 8.5%. 
Operating expenses increased slightly compared to the same period a year ago, primarily driven by higher Prism TV content costs. 
Now turning to Slide 15 and our full year and first quarter 2015 guidance. For full year 2015, we anticipate total operating revenues of $17.9 billion to $18.1 billion and core revenues of $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion, both stable when compared to full year 2014 due to expected continued increases in the level of strategic revenue growth offsetting the anticipated legacy revenue declines. 
Operating cash flow is expected to range from $6.8 billion to $7 billion and free cash flow is expected to range from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow are expected to decline for full year 2014, primarily driven by the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenues, the impact of higher expenses associated with the increased growth in strategic revenues and an increase in pension expense of approximately $90 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions, which really relate to the -- our adoption of new mortality tables. 
We anticipate a decline in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $250 million for full year 2015 compared to full year 2014, primarily driven by the impact of declining amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the annual review and update of depreciation rates, which were expected to more than offset increases in depreciation expense associated with continued capital investment. 
Included in the full year free cash flow estimate are cash taxes of $25 million to $50 million. As a result of bonus depreciation being approved, our cash taxes will now be less than we anticipated earlier. 
We also expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $3 billion in 2015, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $2.50 to $2.70. 
Currently, we have not yet decided whether to accept or reject the specific build-out opportunities related to support payments available under CAF II. We plan to provide an update later this year when it is determined the extent to which the implementation of CAF II will impact our future revenues and cash flows. 
For first quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion, an increase compared to fourth quarter 2014, primarily due to projected growth in strategic revenue offsetting the anticipated decline in legacy revenue resulting in higher core revenue and also higher data integration revenues in first quarter 2015. 
Core revenues are expected to range from $4.04 billion to $4.09 billion. 
Operating cash flow is projected to be between $1.64 billion to $1.69 billion, a decrease compared to fourth quarter 2014, primarily due to higher pension costs, payroll taxes and operating taxes, along with the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenue. 
We also anticipate an approximate $90 million decline in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter 2015 compared to fourth quarter 2014, driven by the reasons previously described. The anticipated lower level of depreciation and amortization expense is expected mostly to offset the decrease in operating cash flow and the impact of favorable income tax adjustments in fourth quarter 2014, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS expected to range from $0.56 to $0.61 per share in first quarter 2015 compared to the $0.60 in fourth quarter 2014. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

I think you normalized some out in your EBITDA number, but you didn't normalize some other ones out, which I guess were a $40 million onetime expense offset by $30 million in onetime benefits. There was -- I think you said there was some positive revenue settlement in the Consumer segment in the quarter. If you could kind of walk us through that so we could kind of get a sense as to what the kind of earnings power the company was in the fourth quarter. And then the second part on the guidance, I guess, Glen, you kind of foreshadowed that the shape of 2015 would be a little stronger in revenue in the second half than the first half as a result of some of the reorganization issues. But looking at the first quarter revenue guidance, it's up sequentially, it's actually flat year-over-year at the midpoint. So I was wondering, could you kind of give us a sense as to how much of the expectation for revenue stability do you kind of have in hand right now that you see in your books, in your funnels? And then what increment is coming from the hoped-for benefits that will be in the back end of this reorg?"

We had about a $15 million favorable adjustment related to operating taxes, which were primarily property taxes, and then $15 million related to facilities costs that was a favorable adjustment, that's a onetime adjustment. So really, net-net, about $10 million negative expense in the fourth quarter that would be onetime adjustments. On the revenue side, basically there were just a couple of offsetting items there. In Business revenue, on the strategic side, we had a $10 million negative adjustment that I mentioned. That was related to a large customer that we have that we needed to book the revenue differently than the way -- basically, it needed to be accounted for differently based on the contracts, so we had a $10 million negative adjustment there on the Business segment for strategic revenue. We also had a positive settlement that I mentioned as well of about $10 million that impacted Consumer revenue on the strategic side and that was basically related to a couple settlements that we had with parties that we sell products for."

So there will be some disruption there. Our funnel is good right now. We have a really good funnel. And then also, we're seeing a lot of demand for our combined solutions that we're selling. As I mentioned, we've sold some big deals to some Fortune 500 companies. We're selling in the small and midsized space. We're seeing a lot of demand for our managed office products. So we're confident that we're going to see increasing demand in the second half of the year. And yes, we are up in the first quarter, but we expect -- we need more acceleration to hit that revenue stability that we expect into the second half of the year, so that's what we believe is going to happen. And we believe we have plans in place to help make that happen, including the expanded distribution, along with the unified approach, combining our cloud and hosting and network sales teams and leadership."

And with the developments that we're making to our cloud product that was part of the Tier 3 acquisition, we're confident in our ability to be able to get that product to where we can.

And we're closing data centers, we're reducing headcount in those areas. We are able to -- all of them do a lot of automation there. And it is -- we think the opportunities are significant to, as I said, not just reduce its current costs, but control costs going forward with virtualization. So we're very confident in it and we are -- we believe we -- we're going to drink our own bathwater here. We're going to do it ourselves. We think it's an opportunity that's really significant here."

We continue to make progress on a number of fronts during the first quarter, a few of which are our recent organizational realignment, the recent enhancement of broadband speeds across our network, also we made progress at the integration of DataGardens and the Cognilytics acquisitions, further automation of integrated network and hosting services, solutions as well. 
So turn we me to to Slide 5. Overall, we generated solid results for the first quarter. We continue to strengthen our ability to complete more -- or compete more effectively. We're beginning to see the benefits of our organizational realignment implemented in late 2014, and we're confident that this streamline operating structure positions us well to drive a stronger results -- stronger sales results, strategic revenue growth and operating efficiency over the long term. For the first quarter, operating cash flow exceeded our guidance, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and favorable onetime items. I'm pleased with our overall leverage to control costs as we remain focused on reducing spend in legacy areas while we are continuing to invest in our growth areas. Operating revenue is below the midpoint of our guidance range primarily due to lower data integration revenues related to customer premise equipment sales, and core revenue was just below the midpoint of guidance as hosting revenue came in lower than expected, partially due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact and customer credits. As anticipated, we did experience weaker large business sales in the first quarter, primarily due to our organizational realignment that resulted in our customer cat assignments to various individual sellers and as well as the restructuring of our sales force. However, we are pleased with improving sales funnel and sales momentum we saw coming out of the quarter. Now turning to Slide 6.
We're continuing to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications to an integrated provider of IP-enabled network, cloud hosting and IT services and to provide solutions for our customers. Also, we are focused on executing on several strategic priorities that we believe are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company. The first of these is to grow our business solutions as part of our organization -- reorganization. We further integrated and restructured our go-to-market models in the first quarter as we consolidated network and hosting sales and marketing organizations. We are confident that this approach will drive long-term sales efficiency across our full portfolio capabilities by focusing on solution selling and customer acquisition. We continue to drive strategic revenue growth of meeting business and government demand for our MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength network services during the quarter. Additionally, our Managed Office and Managed Enterprise solutions continue to gain traction, and we're seeing increasing customer interest for both small and large business customers. These managed services help free customers from the day-to-day management of their network and related services as well as freedom from equipment issues. We're seeing strong demand for GPON service from businesses and expect to drive additional revenue growth from our continued expansion of our GPON footprint in the months ahead. For example, the GPON deployment along with the Managed Office product offerings and enhanced sales effort were key drivers of our solid improvement in SMB sales year-over-year. We had GPON available to approximately 390,000 business locations as of March 31, and we expect to continue to see upside in this segment with our plans to expand our business GPON footprint of more than 100,000 businesses by year-end 2015. 
We continue to deploy a faster broadband speeds through a combination of fiber deployment and speed enhancements on our existing network to help us more broadly compete in the marketplace. We've also made solid progress with our development of software defined networks and network functions virtualization and the associated automated programming interfaces or APIs to related support systems. We have commercially deployed virtualized network-based security services, content delivery network and cloud fiber services across a portion of our data center footprint with plans for further deployment in the months ahead, which we believe positions CenturyLink as one of the leaders in both SDN and NFV enablement. We also continue to roll out announcements of our core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and tracking services. In addition, we plan to continue to add new capabilities to Managed Office that we believe will provide unparalleled simplicity for our SMB customers looking for a full outsourced solution for their network hosting and cloud applications as well as associated equipment and maintenance. 
Turning to wholesale services, revenues remained under pressure due to continued low-bandwidth data service disconnect and network grooming along with reductions in intercarrier compensation and declining voice usage. As you are aware, secular trends in wholesale have resulted in revenue pressure from increased network grooming and the migration from low-speed private line services to fiber-enabled Ethernet services at our wireless customers and wireline customers. Unfortunately, we have had success in mitigating some of this revenue pressure by expanding our fiber-based wireless backhaul services. 
At the end of the first quarter, we enabled fiber to over 21,800 towers within our operating footprint, and we're expanding our focus in Ethernet services and leveraging our hosting product, including colocation having recently won a 2-plus megawatt data center contract with a major international telecom carrier. 
Before I move into the consumer discussion, I would like to give you a little more detail about how we view our cloud and hosting results and have a look at that part of our business. We're beginning to see improved results in our colocation business with a good year-over-year increase in colocation and sales results. We remain focused on improving those results and expect to continue to see good performance in our colocation business as we have nearly 40% of our salable sport space currently available across our total data in our footprint. We're also seeing an increased utilization of our new generation CenturyLink Cloud platform, almost doubling the revenues driven for that platform over the last 12 months, and we expect that to continue. I want to be clear though that while we are seeing better results in some parts of our cloud and hosting business, overall, our results are not what we expect them to be. CenturyLink Cloud, which is the platform we acquired in the Tier 3 transaction just over a year ago, enabled a wide range of service and is growing, but it is not yet providing the full range of services required to serve all of our large enterprise customer needs. And we'll continue to invest in CenturyLink Cloud both from internal development and service-enhancing acquisitions such as DataGardens and the most recently announced orchestrated transaction, but consistent enhancement of the platform has received good reviews from our customers, which is reflected in both revenue growth and in positive customer surveys. We plan to make the CenturyLink Cloud platform the long-term focus of our cloud and hosting strategy. That said, we have not performed as well as we should have with respect to the services that are supported by legacy cloud and hosting platforms. We're near completion of some basic tool enhancements and automation development for these platforms, which we believe will help drive increased sales across all these legacy platforms. Although we did experience churn from some large colocation customers and had an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates during the quarter, we believe the primary issue here is really one of focus and execution rather than product capabilities. As we move into the remainder of 2015, we're renewing our focus on driving better results into the legacy cloud and managed services platforms, and we expect to see improvement as we move into the second quarter and beyond. As you all know, the demand for cloud and managed service offerings is expected to continue to rapidly expand. We believe in these growth projections, and while we have not consistently generated results we expected this year, we continue to very strongly believe in the opportunity in the assets we have to take advantage of it. We believe our recent acquisitions and investments positions us well over the long-term to capture our share of this significant growth market in the months ahead. To summarize, we are in the process of establishing what we believe is a unique position in the market to offer enterprise customers highly scalable, secure and differentiated offerings that bring together a set of highly automated network, hybrid cloud, secured and value-creating IP and Analytic Services that our enterprise customers really need. We believe we'll be able to demonstrate the power of our network in every cloud offerings in the months ahead. 
Turning on to Slide 7. In the Consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets we have deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. In our early GPON markets like Omaha, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. We continue to expand our gigabit footprint through residential customers in select locations in 10 cities including some of our larger markets, and we expect to have gigabit service available to approximately 700,000 residential consumers by the year-end 2015 and followed by further expansion in 2016 and beyond. During the first quarter, we also expanded Prism TV service to additional 73,000 homes within the existing markets and in the quarter with over 2.4 million addressable homes. We also added approximately 8,000 Prism customers in the quarter, but these adds were negatively impacted by price increases were implemented in January through cover content cost increases. As of quarter end, we had more than 249,000 Prism TV customers representing a penetration rate of 10.2%. And we anticipate expanding Prism TV service to approximately 425,000 additional households through the remainder of 2015, and we expect to reach more than 2.8 million total addressable households by year end. 
Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiency through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our production time and help drive standardization. Also, we continue to manage expenses related to our declining legacy revenues while we continue to invest in areas that are driving growth. We have laid the foundation to migrate our internal operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. We're using a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform, infrastructure and Software as a Service solutions across our internal IT operations that we are selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is to go to reduce our IT costs and improve security and other efficiencies for our company. 
Lastly, we continue to make progress on simplifying our process and streamlining our workflow. Our network inventory consolidation effort, which we have mentioned before, continues to progress well. Additionally, we have implemented an automated sales tool that increase our seller efficiency with anywhere, anytime access to our back-office -- all back-office systems. In summary, I believe we are well positioned in our markets with a strong portfolio of strategic assets. We are also investing in an expanded and unified distribution structure, and we have a laser focus and continue improve our revenue trends in the months ahead. Now let's turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results in the second quarter 2014 -- 2015 guidance. Stewart?"

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights on the first quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. B",1094,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights on the first quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Beginning on Slide 9, I will review some highlights from our first quarter results. I will be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. Operating revenues were $4.45 billion on a consolidated basis, a 1.9% decline from first quarter 2014 operating revenues. Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.06 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 1.3% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year and represent 52% of our total revenues compared to 50% year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV continue to drive this growth. We added more than 35,000 high-speed Internet customers and approximately 8,000 Prism TV customers during the quarter. Additionally, we generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.74 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39%. As Glen mentioned, we exceeded our operating cash flow guidance as we had lower cash expenses than anticipated. The expenses were below expectations due primarily to lower employee-related cost along with lower CPE costs related to our data integration revenues and approximately $30 million of favorable onetime items during the quarter. Free cash flow of $849 million for the quarter was very strong. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures along with other income. Our solid cash flow is continuing to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.67, coming in $0.06 above our guidance range. As we have discussed the prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 4.5 million shares during the quarter for an investment of $170 million. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period outlined earlier. 
Now turning to Slide 10. First quarter 2015 operating revenues declined $87 million or 1.9% compared to first quarter 2014 as the growth in strategic revenues was more than offset by the decline in legacy revenues due primarily to access line losses and lower data integration revenues. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by the strength again in high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth business data services and Prism TV. Although legacy revenues continued to decline, the decline in the first quarter 2015 was 16% lower than the first quarter revenue decline a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 11 in our Business segment. In the first quarter, the Business segment generated $2.7 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $78 million or 2.8% from the same period a year ago. First quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 0.8% to $1.6 billion from first quarter 2014, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength, which is largely offset by the continued decline of low-bandwidth data services and lower hosting revenues. 
We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer market, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small- and medium-sized businesses space to improve market space and drive further growth. Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 5.4% from first quarter '14 due to primarily decline in access lines. Total Business segment expenses decreased slightly from the year-ago period driven by lower CPE costs. Our segment margin of 45% declined from 45.8% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue. On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue grew $70 million or 11% year-over-year compared to first quarter 2014 driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in first quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of $88 million or 14% was primarily due to wholesale customers, network grooming efforts and migration of fiber-based services to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarter  as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects and grooming. 
Hosting revenues declined $10 million or 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5 million and lower nonrecurring revenue compared to the year-ago period. In the first quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $35 million or 20% compared to first quarter 2014 driven by lower CPE sales. 
Now turning to Slide 13, in our consumer segment. Consumer generated $1.5 billion of operating revenues on 0.8% decline from first quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.1% year-over-year to $738 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and select price adjustments. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined 6% from first quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price adjustments. 
Operating expenses were flat compared to the same period a year ago as lower employee-related cost offset the higher Prism TV cost. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For second quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.41 billion to $4.46 billion and core revenues of $4.02 billion to $4.07 billion, both of which are expected to be flat to slightly down from first quarter 2015. Our operating cash flow is projected to be between $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion, a decrease compared to first quarter 2015, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, the impact of the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenue and the $30 million of favorable onetime expense items I mentioned earlier that occurred during the first quarter. 
Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.64 in the second quarter 2015 compared to the $0.67 in first quarter of '15. Our full year guidance that we provided in February for full year 2015 remains unchanged. That concludes our prepared remarks for today so at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

And really, there are 3 areas that we think that we'll see improvements on, really starting somewhat in the second quarter but then more so in the last half of the year. One is, as Glen mentioned, we expect the reorganization that we did and the sales results from that reorganization to improve during the year as we saw some improvement in the month of March.
over January and February. So we expect to see continued improvement there and that to be one of the items that hopefully will push our revenue in the second half of the year. Secondly, I mentioned some price adjustments. So we'll have price adjustments that we put in that will basically help continue to improve revenue during the year. And then also, we think the latter half of the year we will really get through most of the grooming that we're seeing through some of the other carriers in terms of wholesale, particularly on the private line side. And we're seeing fewer tower bills, which means that basically, we're not seeing migration from the copper circuits to the Ethernet that we experienced last year to, so we expect to see a little bit of that. In terms of 2016 [ph] we're hopeful that the momentum that we have from a sales standpoint going into 2016 will help us overcome the -- to the extent we don't have price adjustments in '16 that equal '15, which we don't know yet, w3 not sure what sort of pricing adjustments we'll have next year, but to the extent that we don't have those pricing adjustments equal to this year, we're hopeful that the sales momentum will continue to carry us through the tougher comps that we would have in the first part of this year related to the price adjustments that we made."

Also, addition of product rollout, we expect -- as we mentioned, we're expanding our GPON footprint during this year, so we'll have that really rolled out. We're expanding our Prism TV to close to 500,000 additional households as of this year. And then the cloud hosting product advancement we're working on we think are really significant, can drive a lot potential sales growth there. And then putting in our Big Data advanced analytics. The Cognilytics acquisition is driving a lot activity for us, a lot of interest for the business community for those services. And along with IT services, we're not just providing services, we're providing convergence to the cloud and software support applications support, in just the overall increase for all been speak that we expect to roll out over the next 12 months."

Although as you pointed out, we will see an increase, a significant increase in cash taxes or expect to see a significant increase in cash taxes in 2016, which will use quite a bit of the free cash flow that we've had. In terms of the CAF II proposal, of course, we just got that, I guess, the SEC just released that a week or so ago and started 120-day clock running basically, so we have until August 27 to make the SEC aware of the -- which of the 37 states that we have the option or the right of first refusal in to take up to 400 -- $514 million is what was allocated to us.

We continue to make progress on a number of fronts during the first quarter, a few of which are our recent organizational realignment, the enhancement of broadband speeds across our network. Also, we made progress on the integration of DataGardens and the Cognilytics acquisitions, further automation of integrated network and hosting services solutions as well. 
If you turn with me to Slide 5, overall, we generated solid results for the first quarter. We continued to strengthen our ability to complete more -- or compete more effectively. We're beginning to see the benefits of our organizational realignment implemented in late 2014, and we're confident that this streamlined operating structure positions us well to drive a stronger results -- stronger sales results, strategic revenue growth and operating efficiency over the long term. 
For the first quarter, operating cash flow exceeded our guidance, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and favorable onetime items. I'm pleased with our overall leverage to control cost as we remain focused on reducing spend in legacy areas while continuing to invest in our growth areas. Total operating revenue was below the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to lower data integration revenues related to customer premise equipment sales, and core revenue was just below the midpoint of guidance as hosting revenue came in lower than expected, partially due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact and customer credits. 
As anticipated, we did experience weaker large business sales in the first quarter, primarily due to our organizational realignment that resulted in our customer account assignments to various individual sellers and as well as the restructuring of our sales force. However, we are pleased with improving sales funnel and sales momentum we saw coming out of the quarter. 
Now turning to Slide 6. We're continuing to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications to an integrated provider of IP-enabled network, cloud hosting and IT services to provide solutions for our customers. Also, we are focused on executing on several strategic priorities that we believe are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company. The first of these is to grow our business solutions. As part of our organization -- reorganization, we further integrated and restructured our go-to-market model in the first quarter as we consolidated network and hosting sales and marketing organizations. 
We are confident that this approach will drive long-term sales efficiency across our full portfolio capabilities by focusing on solution selling and customer acquisition. We continue to drive strategic revenue growth of meeting business and government demand for MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength network services during the quarter. Additionally, our Managed Office and Managed Enterprise solutions continue to gain traction, and we are seeing increasing customer interest for both small and large business customers. 
These managed services help free customers from the day-to-day management of their network and related services as well as freedom from equipment issues. We are seeing strong demand for GPON service from businesses and expect to drive additional revenue growth from our continued expansion of our GPON footprint in the months ahead. 
For example, the GPON deployment, along with the Managed Office product offering and enhanced sales effort were key drivers of our solid improvement in SMB sales year-over-year. We had GPON available to approximately 390,000 business locations as of March 31, and we expect to continue to see upside in this segment with our plans to expand our business GPON footprint of more than 100,000 businesses by year-end 2015. 
We continue to deploy faster broadband speeds through a combination of fiber deployment and speed enhancements on our existing network to help us more broadly compete in the marketplace. We've also made solid progress with our development of software-defined networks and network functions virtualization and the associated automated programming interfaces or APIs to related support systems. 
We have commercially deployed virtualized network-based security services, content delivery network and cloud firewall services across a portion of our data center footprint with plans for further deployment in the months ahead, which we believe positions CenturyLink as one of the leaders in both SDN and NFV enablement. We also continue to roll out enhancements to our core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP Trunking services. In addition, we plan to continue to add new capabilities to Managed Office that we believe will provide unparalleled simplicity for SMB customers looking for a full outsourced solution for the network hosting in cloud applications as well as associated equipment and maintenance. 
Turning to wholesale services, revenues remained under pressure due to continued low-bandwidth data service disconnects and network grooming, along with reductions in intercarrier compensation and declining voice usage. As you are aware, secular trends in wholesale have resulted in revenue pressure from increased network grooming and the migration from low private -- low-speed private line services to fiber-enabled Ethernet services by wireless carriers and wireline customers. 
Fortunately, we have had success in mitigating some of this revenue pressure by expanding our fiber-based wireless backhaul services. 
At the end of the first quarter, we enabled fiber to over 21,800 towers within our operating footprint, and we're expanding our focus in Ethernet services and leveraging our hosting product, including colocation having recently won a 2-plus megawatt data center contract with a major international telecom carrier. 
Before I move into the consumer discussion, I would like to give you a little more detail about how we view our cloud and hosting results and how we look at that part of our business. We're beginning to see improved results in our colocation business with a good year-over-year increase in colocation-location sales results. We remain focused on improving those results and expect to continue to see good performance in our colocation business as we have nearly 40% of our sellable floor space currently available across our total data and our footprint. We are also seeing increased utilization of our new-generation CenturyLink Cloud platform, almost doubling the revenues driven from that platform over the last 12 months, and we expect that velocity to continue. 
I want to be clear, though, that while we are seeing better results in some parts of our cloud and hosting business, overall, our results are not what we expect them to be. CenturyLink Cloud, which is the platform we acquired in the Tier 3 transaction just over a year ago, enables a wide range of service and is growing, but it does not yet provide the full range of services required to serve all of our large enterprise customer needs. 
And we'll continue to invest in CenturyLink Cloud both through internal development and through service-enhancing acquisitions such as DataGardens and the most recently announced Orchestrate transaction. The consistent enhancement of the platform has received good reviews from our customers, which is reflected in both revenue growth and in positive customer surveys. We plan to make the CenturyLink Cloud platform the long-term focus of our cloud and hosting strategy. 
That said, we have not performed as well as we should have with respect to the services that are supported by legacy cloud and hosting platforms. We are near completion of some basic tool enhancements and automation development for these platforms, which we believe will help drive increased sales across all these legacy platforms. Although we did experience churn from some large colocation-location customers and had an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates during the quarter, we believe the primary issue here is really one of focus and execution, rather than product capabilities. As we move into the remainder of 2015, we're renewing our focus on driving better results into the legacy cloud and managed services platforms, and we expect to see improvement as we move into the second quarter and beyond. 
As you all know, the demand for cloud and managed service offerings is expected to continue to rapidly expand. We believe in these growth projections, and while we have not consistently generated results we've expected in this area, we continue to very strongly believe in the opportunity in the assets we have to take advantage of it. 
We believe our recent acquisitions and investments position us well over the long-term to capture our share of this significant growth market in the months ahead. To summarize, we are in the process of establishing what we believe is a unique position in the market to offer enterprise customers highly scalable, secure and differentiated offerings that bring together a set of highly automated network, hybrid cloud, security and value-creating IT and data analytic services that enterprise customers really need. We believe we'll be able to demonstrate the power of our network and hybrid cloud offerings in the months ahead. 
Continue on to Slide 7. In the Consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets where we have deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. In our early GPON markets like Omaha, we take -- the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. We continue to expand our gigabit footprint through residential customers in select locations in 10 cities including some of our larger markets, and we expect to have gigabit service available to approximately 700,000 residential consumers by the year-end 2015 and followed by further expansion in 2016 and beyond. 
During the first quarter, we also expanded Prism TV service to an additional 73,000 homes within the existing markets and in the quarter with over 2.4 million addressable homes. We also added approximately 8,000 Prism customers during the quarter, but these adds were negatively impacted by price increase we implemented in January to cover content cost increases. 
As of quarter end, we had more than 249,000 Prism TV customers representing a penetration rate of 10.2%. And we anticipate expanding Prism TV service to approximately 425,000 additional households through the remainder of 2015, and we expect to reach more than 2.8 million total addressable households by year-end. 
Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiency through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help drive standardization. Also, we continue to manage expenses related to our declining legacy revenues while we continue to invest in areas that are driving growth. We have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our Cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. We're using a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform, infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions across our internal IT operations that we are selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT cost and improve security and other efficiencies for our company. 
Lastly, we continue to make progress in simplifying our process and streamlining our workflow. Our network inventory consolidation effort, which we have mentioned before, continues to progress well. Additionally, we have implemented an automated sales tool that increased our seller efficiency with anywhere, anytime access to our back office -- all back-office systems. 
In summary, I believe we are well-positioned in our markets with a strong portfolio of strategic assets. We are also investing in an expanded and unified distribution structure, and we have a laser focus on continuing to improve our revenue trends in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and second quarter 2014 -- 2015 guidance. Stewart?"
260149,289283922,804548,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the first quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.",1094,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the first quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Beginning on Slide 9, I will review some highlights from our first quarter results. I will be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.45 billion on a consolidated basis, a 1.9% decline from first quarter 2014 operating revenues. Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.06 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 1.3% from the year-ago period. 
Strategic revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year and represent 52% of our total revenues compared to 50% a year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV continue to drive this growth. We added more than 35,000 high-speed Internet customers and approximately 8,000 Prism TV customers during the quarter. Additionally, we generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.74 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39%. 
As Glen mentioned, we exceeded our operating cash flow guidance as we had lower cash expenses than anticipated. Expenses were below expectations due primarily to lower employee-related costs, along with lower CPE cost related to our data integration revenues and approximately $30 million of favorable onetime items during the quarter. 
Free cash flow of $849 million for the quarter was very strong. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.67, coming in $0.06 above our guidance range. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 4.5 million shares during the quarter for an investment of $170 million. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period outlined earlier. 
Now turning to Slide 10. First quarter 2015 operating revenues declined $87 million or 1.9% compared to first quarter 2014 as the growth in strategic revenues was more than offset by the decline in legacy revenues due primarily to access line losses and lower data integration revenues. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength, again, in high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth business data services and Prism TV. Although legacy revenues continue to decline, the decline in the first quarter 2015 was 16% lower than the first quarter revenue decline a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 11 in our Business segment. In the first quarter, the Business segment generated $2.7 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $78 million or 2.8% from the same period a year ago. First quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 0.8% to $1.6 billion from first quarter 2014, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength, which is largely offset by the continued decline of low-bandwidth data services and lower hosting revenues. 
We continue to generate solid growth across the Enterprise customer market, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small- and medium-sized business space to improve market space and drive further growth. Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 5.4% for first quarter '14 due to primarily decline in access lines. Total Business segment expenses decreased slightly from the year-ago period driven by lower CPE cost. Our segment margin of 45% declined from 45.8% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue. 
On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue grew $70 million or 11% year-over-year compared to first quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in first quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of $88 million or 14% was primarily due to wholesale customers, network grooming efforts and migration of fiber-based services -- to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. 
We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects and grooming. 
Hosting revenues declined $10 million or 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5 million and lower nonrecurring revenue compared to the year-ago period. In the first quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $35 million or 20% compared to first quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales. 
Now turning to Slide 13, in our consumer segment. Consumer generated $1.5 billion in operating revenues on 0.8% decline from first quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.1% year-over-year to $738 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and select price adjustments. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined 6% from first quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price adjustments. Operating expenses were flat compared to the same period a year ago as lower employee-related costs offset the higher Prism TV costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For second quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.41 billion to $4.46 billion and core revenues of $4.02 billion to $4.07 billion, both of which are expected to be flat to slightly down from first quarter 2015. Our operating cash flow is projected to be between $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion, a decrease compared to first quarter 2015, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, the impact of the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenue and the $30 million of favorable onetime expense items I mentioned earlier that occurred during the first quarter. 
Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.64 in the second quarter 2015 compared to the $0.67 in first quarter of '15. Our full year guidance that we provided in February for full year 2015 remains unchanged. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the day. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

There is somewhat of a hockey stick in the second half of the year, which was really implied more or less in the first quarter guidance that we gave as well. And really, there are 3 areas that we think that we'll see improvements on, really starting somewhat in the second quarter but then more so in the last half of the year. One is, we -- as Glen mentioned, we expect the reorganization that we did and the sales results from that reorganization to improve during the year as we saw some improvement in the month of March.
over January and February. So we expect to see continued improvement there and that to be one of the items that hopefully will push our revenue in the second half of the year. Secondly, I mentioned some price adjustments so we'll have price adjustments that we put in that will basically help continue to improve revenue during the year. And then also, we think the latter half of the year, we will really get through most of the grooming that we're seeing from some of the other carriers in terms of wholesale, particularly on the private line side. And we're seeing fewer tower bills, which means that basically, we're not seeing migration from the copper circuits to Ethernet that we experienced last year, too. So we expect to see a little bit of that. In terms of 2016, we're hopeful that the momentum that we have from a sales standpoint going into 2016 will help us overcome the -- to the extent we don't have price adjustments in '16 that equal '15, which we don't know yet, we're not sure what sort of pricing adjustments we'll have next year, but to the extent we don't have those pricing adjustments equal to this year, we're hopeful that the sales momentum will continue to carry us through the tougher comps that we would have in the first part of this year related to the price adjustments that we made."

So Simon, the -- first, on the share buyback. Basically, through -- a couple of days ago, I guess, through the shares that we've settled as of really yesterday, we had repurchased about 11.6 million shares under the existing program and spent about $439 million. So there's $561 million remaining of the $1 billion program that we had. And we continue to expect to opportunistically buy shares back, and we'd expect still to complete the program within the 24-month period from which we started at which we started it in February or so, February or March -- May actually, May of 2014. So by May of 2016, we would expect to complete that. Beyond that, we haven't really talked with the board about the next step from the standpoint of returning cash to shareholders. Although as you pointed out, we will see an increase -- a significant increase in cash taxes or expect to see a significant increase in cash taxes in 2016, which will use quite a bit of the free cash flow that we've had. In terms of the CAF II proposal, of course, we just got that -- I guess, the FCC just released that a week or so ago and started the 120-day clock running basically. So we have until August 27 to make the SEC aware of the -- which of the 37 states that we have the option of the right of first refusal and to take up to 400 -- $514 million is what was allocated to us. So we have started the process now that we know the census blocks that are included. We started the process of reviewing the capital expenditures that would be required to get the 10-down, 1-up service. And I would imagine we will take most of the time allotted to some conclusion as to how much of the CAF II monies that we want to accept."

We continue to make progress on a number of fronts during the first quarter, a few of which are our recent organizational realignment, the enhancement of broadband speeds across our network. Also, we made progress on the integration of DataGardens and the Cognilytics acquisitions, further automation of our integrated network and hosting services solutions as well. 
If you turn with me to Slide 5, overall, we generated solid results for the first quarter. We continued to strengthen our ability to complete more -- or compete more effectively. We're beginning to see the benefits of our organizational realignment implemented in late 2014, and we're confident that this streamlined operating structure positions us well to drive a stronger results -- stronger sales results, strategic revenue growth and operating efficiency over the long term. 
For the first quarter, operating cash flow exceeded our guidance, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and favorable onetime items. I'm pleased with our overall leverage to control cost as we remain focused on reducing spend in legacy areas while continuing to invest in our growth areas. Total operating revenue was below the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to lower data integration revenues related to customer premise equipment sales, and core revenue was just below the midpoint of guidance as hosting revenue came in lower than expected, partially due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact and customer credits. 
As anticipated, we did experience weaker large business sales in the first quarter, primarily due to our organizational realignment that resulted in customer account reassignments to various individual sellers and as well as the restructuring of our sales force. However, we are pleased with improving sales funnel and sales momentum we saw coming out of the quarter. 
Now turning to Slide 6. We're continuing to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications to an integrated provider of IP-enabled network, cloud hosting and IT services to provide solutions for our customers. Also, we are focused on executing on several strategic priorities that we believe are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company. The first of these is to grow our business solutions. As part of our organization -- reorganization, we further integrated and restructured our go-to-market model in the first quarter as we consolidated network and hosting sales and marketing organizations. 
We are confident that this approach will drive long-term sales efficiency across our full portfolio of capabilities by focusing on solution selling and customer acquisition. We continue to drive strategic revenue growth of meeting business and government demand for MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength network services during the quarter. Additionally, our Managed Office and Managed Enterprise solutions continue to gain traction, and we are seeing increasing customer interest for both small and large business customers. 
These managed services help free customers from the day-to-day management of their network and related services as well as freedom from equipment issues. We are seeing strong demand for GPON service from businesses and expect to drive additional revenue growth from our continued expansion of our GPON footprint in the months ahead. 
For example, the GPON deployment, along with the Managed Office product offering and enhanced sales effort were key drivers of our solid improvement in SMB sales year-over-year. We had GPON available to approximately 390,000 business locations as of March 31, and we expect to continue to see upside in this segment with our plans to expand our business GPON footprint of more than 100,000 businesses by year-end 2015. 
We continue to deploy faster broadband speeds through a combination of fiber deployment and speed enhancements on our existing network to help us more broadly compete in the marketplace. We've also made solid progress with our development of software-defined networks and network functions virtualization and the associated automated programming interfaces or APIs to related support systems. 
We have commercially deployed virtualized network-based security services, content delivery network and cloud firewall services across a portion of our data center footprint with plans for further deployment in the months ahead, which we believe positions CenturyLink as one of the leaders in both SDN and NFV enablement. We also continue to roll out enhancements to our core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP Trunking services. In addition, we plan to continue to add new capabilities to Managed Office that we believe will provide unparalleled simplicity for SMB customers looking for a full outsourced solution for the network hosting in cloud applications as well as associated equipment and maintenance. 
Turning to wholesale services, revenues remained under pressure due to continued low-bandwidth data service disconnects and network grooming, along with reductions in intercarrier compensation and declining voice usage. As you are aware, secular trends in wholesale have resulted in revenue pressure from increased network grooming and the migration from low private -- low-speed private line services to fiber-enabled Ethernet services by wireless carriers and wireline customers. 
Fortunately, we have had success in mitigating some of this revenue pressure by expanding our fiber-based wireless backhaul services. 
At the end of the first quarter, we enabled fiber to over 21,800 towers within our operating footprint, and we're expanding our focus in Ethernet services and leveraging our hosting products, including colocation having recently won a 2-plus megawatt data center contract with a major international telecom carrier. 
Before I move into the consumer discussion, I would like to give you a little more detail about how we view our cloud and hosting results and how we look at that part of our business. We're beginning to see improved results in our colocation business with a good year-over-year increase in colocation-location sales results. We remain focused on improving those results and expect to continue to see good performance in our colocation business as we have nearly 40% of our sellable floor space currently available across our total data and our footprint. We are also seeing increased utilization of our new-generation CenturyLink Cloud platform, almost doubling the revenues driven from that platform over the last 12 months, and we expect that velocity to continue. 
I want to be clear, though, that while we are seeing better results in some parts of our cloud and hosting business, overall, our results are not what we expect them to be. CenturyLink Cloud, which is the platform we acquired in the Tier 3 transaction just over a year ago, enables a wide range of service and is growing, but it does not yet provide the full range of services required to serve all of our large enterprise customer needs. 
And we'll continue to invest in CenturyLink Cloud both through internal development and through service-enhancing acquisitions such as DataGardens and the most recently announced Orchestrate transaction. The consistent enhancement of the platform has received good reviews from our customers, which is reflected in both revenue growth and in positive customer surveys. We plan to make the CenturyLink Cloud platform the long-term focus of our cloud and hosting strategy. 
That said, we have not performed as well as we should have with respect to the services that are supported by our legacy cloud and hosting platforms. We're near completion of some basic tool enhancements and automation development for these platforms, which we believe will help drive increased sales across all these legacy platforms. Although we did experience churn from some large colocation customers and had an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates during the quarter, we believe the primary issue here is really one of focus and execution, rather than product capabilities. As we move into the remainder of 2015, we're renewing our focus on driving better results into the legacy cloud and managed services platforms, and we expect to see improvement as we move into the second quarter and beyond. 
As you all know, the demand for cloud and managed service offerings is expected to continue to rapidly expand. We believe in these growth projections, and while we have not consistently generated results we've expected in this area, we continue to very strongly believe in the opportunity in the assets we have to take advantage of it. 
We believe our recent acquisitions and investments position us well over the long-term to capture our share of this significant growth market in the months ahead. To summarize, we are in the process of establishing what we believe is a unique position in the market to offer enterprise customers highly scalable, secure and differentiated offerings that bring together a set of highly automated network, hybrid cloud, security and value-creating IT and data analytic services that enterprise customers really need. We believe we'll be able to demonstrate the power of our network and hybrid cloud offerings in the months ahead. 
Continue on to Slide 7. In the Consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets where we have deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. In our early GPON markets like Omaha, we take -- the take rates continue to be strong or exceeding our expectations. We continue to expand our gigabit footprint through residential customers in select locations in 10 cities including some of our larger markets, and we expect to have gigabit service available to approximately 700,000 residential consumers by the year-end 2015 and followed by further expansion in 2016 and beyond. 
During the first quarter, we also expanded Prism TV service to an additional 73,000 homes within the existing markets and in the quarter with over 2.4 million addressable homes. We also added approximately 8,000 Prism customers during the quarter, but these adds were negatively impacted by price increase we implemented in January to cover content cost increases. 
As of quarter end, we had more than 249,000 Prism TV customers representing a penetration rate of 10.2%. And we anticipate expanding Prism TV service to approximately 425,000 additional households through the remainder of 2015, and we expect to reach more than 2.8 million total addressable households by year-end. 
Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiency through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help drive standardization. Also, we continue to manage expenses related to our declining legacy revenues while we continue to invest in areas that are driving growth. We have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our Cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. We're using a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform, infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions across our internal IT operations that we are selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT cost and improve security and other efficiencies for our company. 
Lastly, we continue to make progress in simplifying our process and streamlining our workflow. Our network inventory consolidation effort, which we have mentioned before, continues to progress well. Additionally, we have implemented an automated sales tool that increased our seller efficiency with anywhere, anytime access to our back office -- all back-office systems. 
In summary, I believe we are well-positioned in our markets with a strong portfolio of strategic assets. We are also investing in an expanded and unified distribution structure, and we have a laser focus on continuing to improve our revenue trends in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and second quarter 2014 -- 2015 guidance. Stewart?"
260149,289283922,804650,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the first quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.",1092,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the first quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Beginning on Slide 9, I will review some highlights from our first quarter results. I will be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.45 billion on a consolidated basis, a 1.9% decline from first quarter 2014 operating revenues. Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.06 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 1.3% from the year-ago period. 
Strategic revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year and represent 52% of our total revenues compared to 50% a year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV continue to drive this growth. We added more than 35,000 high-speed Internet customers and approximately 8,000 Prism TV customers during the quarter. Additionally, we generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.74 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39%. 
As Glen mentioned, we exceeded our operating cash flow guidance as we had lower cash expenses than anticipated. Expenses were below expectations due primarily to lower employee-related costs, along with lower CPE cost related to our data integration revenues and approximately $30 million of favorable onetime items during the quarter. 
Free cash flow of $849 million for the quarter was very strong. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.67, coming in $0.06 above our guidance range. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 4.5 million shares during the quarter for an investment of $170 million. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period outlined earlier. 
Now turning to Slide 10. First quarter 2015 operating revenues declined $87 million or 1.9% compared to first quarter 2014 as the growth in strategic revenues was more than offset by the decline in legacy revenues due primarily to access line losses and lower data integration revenues. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength, again, in high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth business data services and Prism TV. Although legacy revenues continue to decline, the decline in first quarter 2015 was 16% lower than the first quarter revenue decline a year ago. 
Moving to Slide 11 in our Business segment. In the first quarter, the Business segment generated $2.7 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $78 million or 2.8% from the same period a year ago. First quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 0.8% to $1.6 billion from first quarter 2014, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength, which was largely offset by the continued decline of low-bandwidth data services and lower hosting revenues. 
We continue to generate solid growth across the Enterprise customer market, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small- and medium-sized business space to improve market share and drive further growth. Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 5.4% for first quarter '14 due to primarily decline in access lines. Total Business segment expenses decreased slightly from the year-ago period driven by lower CPE cost. Our segment margin of 45% declined from 45.8% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue. 
On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue grew $70 million or 11% year-over-year compared to first quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in first quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of $88 million or 14% was primarily due to wholesale customers, network grooming efforts and migration of fiber-based services -- to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. 
We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects and grooming. 
Hosting revenues declined $10 million or 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5 million and lower nonrecurring revenue compared to the year-ago period. In the first quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $35 million or 20% compared to first quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales. 
Now turning to Slide 13, in our consumer segment. Consumer generated $1.5 billion in operating revenues on 0.8% decline from first quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.1% year-over-year to $738 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and select price adjustments. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined 6% from first quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price adjustments. Operating expenses were flat compared to the same period a year ago as lower employee-related costs offset the higher Prism TV costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For second quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.41 billion to $4.46 billion and core revenues of $4.02 billion to $4.07 billion, both of which are expected to be flat to slightly down from first quarter 2015. Our operating cash flow is projected to be between $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion, a decrease compared to first quarter 2015, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, the impact of the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenue and the $30 million of favorable onetime expense items I mentioned earlier that occurred during the first quarter. 
Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.64 in second quarter 2015 compared to the $0.67 in first quarter of '15. Our full year guidance that we provided in February for full year 2015 remains unchanged. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the day. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

Could you talk about the moving parts that are going to get us from that $4.435 billion to that $4.5 billion number that seems to be embedded in the full year guidance to be -- the second part of that question would be, if we are looking at an upward swing in revenue growth sequentially through the back part of the year, could you talk about what the drivers for 2016 would be to kind of keep that going?"

There is somewhat of a hockey stick in the second half of the year, which was really implied more or less in the first quarter guidance that we gave as well. And really, there are 3 areas that we think that we'll see improvements on, really starting somewhat in the second quarter but then more so in the last half of the year. One is, we -- as Glen mentioned, we expect the reorganization that we did and the sales results from that reorganization to improve during the year as we saw some improvement in the month of March, over January and February. So we expect to see continued improvement there and that to be one of the items that hopefully will push our revenue in the second half of the year. Secondly, I mentioned some price adjustments, so we'll have price adjustments that we put in that will basically help continue to improve revenue during the year. And then also, we think the latter half of the year, we will really get through most of the grooming that we're seeing from some of the other carriers in terms of wholesale, particularly on the private line side. And we're seeing fewer tower bills, which means that basically, we're not seeing migration from the copper circuits to Ethernet that we experienced last year, too. So we expect to see a little bit of that. In terms of 2016, we're hopeful that the momentum that we have from a sales standpoint going into 2016 will help us overcome the -- to the extent we don't have price adjustments in '16 that equal '15, which we don't know yet, we're not sure what sort of pricing adjustments we'll have next year, but to the extent we don't have those pricing adjustments equal to this year, we're hopeful that the sales momentum will continue to carry us through the tougher comps that we would have in the first part of this year related to the price adjustments that we made."

Going to the -- talking about '16, we'll have -- we expect greater sales force efficiency as we get through the next few months and really transform our sales force to a little different go-to-market strategy with solution selling that we're working toward with all of our IP products and cloud hosting off the regular network products. Also, additional product rollout, we expand -- as I mentioned, we're expanding our GPON footprint during this year, so we'll have that really rolled out. We're expanding our Prism to close to 500,000 additional households past this year. And then this -- the cloud hosting product advancement we're working on, we think are really significant that can drive a lot of potential sales growth there. And then bringing in our big data, advanced analytics, the Cognilytics acquisition is driving a lot of activity for us, a lot of interest in -- throughout the business community for those services. And along with IT services, we're not just providing the cloud services, we're providing convergence to the cloud and software support, application support. And just -- and overall increased broadband speeds that we expect to roll out over the next 12 months."

Basically, through -- a couple of days ago, I guess, through the shares that we've settled as of really yesterday, we had repurchased about 11.6 million shares under the existing program and spent about $439 million. So there's $561 million remaining of the $1 billion program that we had. And we continue to expect to opportunistically buy shares back, and we'd expect still to complete the program within the 24-month period from which we started at which we started it in February or so, February or March -- May actually, May of 2014. So by May of 2016, we would expect to complete that. Beyond that, we haven't really talked with the board about the next step from the standpoint of returning cash to shareholders. Although as you pointed out, we will see an increase -- a significant increase in cash taxes or expect to see a significant increase in cash taxes in 2016, which will use quite a bit of the free cash flow that we've had. In terms of the CAF II proposal, of course, we just got that -- I guess the FCC just released that a week or so ago and started the 120-day clock running basically. So we have until August 27 to make the SEC aware of the -- which of the 37 states that we have the option of the right of first refusal and to take up to 400 -- $514 million is what was allocated to us. So we have started the process now that we know the census blocks that are included. We started the process of reviewing the capital expenditures that would be required to get the 10-down, 1-up service. And I would imagine we will take most of the time allotted to come to some conclusion as to how much of the CAF II monies that we want to accept."

260149,304863191,850042,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our second quarter 2015 results of operations, provide guidance and outlook for the second half 2015. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to highlight a few items th",2064,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our second quarter 2015 results of operations, provide guidance and outlook for the second half 2015. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to highlight a few items that I think are important to keep in mind as we go through our results. First, on the revenue side, our second quarter results were negatively impacted by renegotiation of a long-term wholesale agreement to reduce strategic revenue by about $13 million for the quarter and is driving an approximately $40 million reduction on our revenue outlook for full year 2015. This renegotiated agreement locks into those agreements at market rates for several years, giving us greater ability to grow that business and provide reciprocal access to our wholesale partners network at more attractive rates. We're revising our full year revenue midpoint to $17.8 billion, [ph] reflecting the impact of this wholesale issue and the full year effect of softer-than-expected for first-half results. Our revised guidance is approximately $45 million below the current consensus Street estimate of $17.85 billion, and $40 million of that is associated with a wholesale issue we're just talking about. 
However, the bigger issue in the second quarter was really expense. We had a number of noncore items that drove our expenses higher in the quarter, including $20 million in group insurance and pension true-up adjustments, and $20 million due to higher-than-expected CPE sales. The balance of our average is primarily due to not hitting the operating budgets we established for business units for the quarter, principally due to higher than anticipated employee-related costs. We do not believe this mess reflects anything fundamental in the cost structure of our business. Basically, we just didn't get the job done here. We have made a number of key changes, and as we will discuss later, we have put plans in place to address this issue in the second half of the year. 
Beyond 2015, we believe we have further opportunity to continue to align the cost in our business without revenue performance, and we will discuss some of this with you later in the call. I wanted to share with you -- this with you at the outset of the call, because I want to be clear that although our second quarter results did not  meet our expectation, I am as confident as I've ever been that we have the assets, products, the services and the opportunities required to grow our business. 
Now if you will turn to Slide 6, we believe several key priorities will drive future growth and profitability of our business. The first is to grow business revenues, driven principally by increased market penetration of our network and hosting, cloud and IP solution service offerings. With respect to our business network services, we continue to see strong demand from business, wholesale and government customers for high-bandwidth data services such as Ethernet, MPLS and Business GPON, and we're investing in aligning our operations to take greater advantage of this opportunity. 
Let me give you a few examples of what we're doing. As of June 30, we have made fiber-based GPON available to approximately 475,000 business locations, and we expect to add GPON service to another 25,000 businesses by year-end. There's good demand to this product, and given our relatively low penetration, we believe we have strong upside with those investments. 
We also continue to enhance our core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP trunking services as well as plans to enable software-defined networking and network functions virtualization capabilities into 43 data centers by the end of this year. 
During the first half of the year, we expanded our global data center footprint through expansion in the 6 markets, adding -- we added 10.8 megawatts of capacity -- critical capacity, and that brings CenturyLink's global data center capacity to more than 185 total megawatts across our 59 data centers. We still have upside in our existing data center investment as we had over 35% of sellable floor space available as of June 30. 
Our revenues from our CenturyLink Cloud platform is growing rapidly, more than doubling the last 12 months. Actually, 138% growth in the second quarter of last year. A primary focus in the cloud and hosting space is to strengthen our private and dedicated hosting capabilities. These private platforms required much of the automation and management tools as you see in major public cloud platforms. But our focus is on leveraging the CenturyLink cloud platform to enhance our enterprise customers the ability to turn up and manage both network and hosted workloads in private, dedicated environments, including the enablement of environmental services later this year. However, overall, we have not met our expectations in our managed hosting business. I believe our sales force drill organization contributed to this issue, but I believe the principal driver is in the latter part of 2014 and early 2015. We defocused our delivery of services on our existing managed platform to focus instead on putting workloads in the CenturyLink Cloud platform. The CenturyLink Cloud platform is a powerful and dynamic platform, but does not yet support all the functionality our managed hosting customers require. That defocus away from legacy platform was a misstep and has affected our hosting results, and we believe we can improve these results by refocusing on delivering services at increasing capabilities of our legacy platform, while we continue to enhance the depths of CenturyLink Cloud capabilities. 
Finally, we are also see good interest in our IT services, data analytics and service offerings. Our focus in this area is to provide targeted service to business customers who are underserved by the traditional larger system integrators. Although it's growing rapidly, this business is small in scale today, but the service offerings give us a good low capital-intensive opportunity to engage at the sea level and generate leads in the other parts of our business. This capability provides differentiating NDN solutions, including IT consulting, has led to a number of recent wins for CenturyLink to provide a large portion, or in some cases, all communications, data and IT services for those customers. 
Overall, in our Business segment, we have to improve our execution, but we are seeing strength in our sales momentum. For example, second quarter 2015 sales to our enterprise customers were up 10% from first quarter 2015 and up 16% from second quarter 2014, while our commercial sales increased 27% from second quarter of 2014. 
Continuing now on to Slide 7 and turning to the Consumer segment. We continue to see good results from those markets. We have deployed higher broadband speeds in Prism TV services. Specifically, in our GPON markets, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. And because GPON is such a great driver of demand and penetration, we continue to expand our gigabit footprint and ended the quarter with more than 600,000 households and 16 markets having access to gigabit speeds. We expect to have gigabit service available to approximately 700,000 households by year-end 2015, with plans for further expansion thereafter. We're also trending technologies that enable us to 200 megabits over our legacy copper networks. This is an early stage -- in the early stages, but it is showing good promise. 
We're also expanding our Prism TV service in the second quarter, turning services in Portland, Salt Lake and many outlets. We had a total of 175,000 addressable homes in the second quarter, ending the quarter with over 2.6 million Prism TV addressable households. We anticipate expanding Prism TV services to another -- approximately 250,000 additional households due the remainder of 2015, and to reach more than 2.8 million total Prism TV addressable homes by year-end. 
Now in addition, we're developing an over-the-top offering that we'll be able to provide a robust, competitive video offering for customers both within and outside our Prism TV market footprint. 
And finally, we're tightening our credit policies for Internet-only customers to reduce sales to customers who tend to change Internet providers frequently, leaving unpaid balances when they exit. While we expect this change to negative impact consumer broadband net subscriber additions to the remainder of 2015, we anticipate this adjustment will actually help improve our broadband growth in 2016 due to lower churn. This move is unrelated to and have no impact in our marketing initiative for lower-income consumers in the CenturyLink Internet Basics program. We remain totally committed to offering affordable broadband access to lower-income households across our broadband service areas. 
Now on to discuss our thoughts around expense control. As I noted above, the principal issue for us this quarter was that our expenses were about $80 million more than we anticipated. About half of that amount is attributable to not managing cost through established budget. We can, we will do on this front. For starters, we're implementing plans to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $125 million in the second half of 2015, including lowering contract labor, professional services cost, a reduction in the number of employees and other expense reductions. This is not simply to get target. We already have plans in place to address most of that number. 
Also independent of any news around second quarter expense, earlier this year, we established a dedicated team, whose sole purpose is to identify and drive ongoing efficiencies under our business. This team is reviewing every major process and every significant system to validate its business purpose, and whether there is a faster, better way to achieve that objective. An example of their work is the recent access in improving service intervals by more than 40% by streamlining processes. This relates to a better customer experience, the need for pure employees to perform that work and better margins on that business. We believe there are other opportunities similar to this as well as the opportunity to improve efficiencies by driving additional automation and simplification into business. 
Continuing on to Slide 8 now. Lastly, I'd like to take a minute to discuss our philosophy about our dividend. Given that our past revenue EBITDA growth is taking longer than we originally anticipated, and that our cash taxes are expected to increase significantly in 2016, we understand the market's focus on the sustainability of our dividend. So I want to be clear here. While no company can credibly say they will never cut their dividend, we see the dividend as a fundamental part of our overall value proposition to shareholders. We believe the most financially prudent way to manage our business is to balance our investment philosophy with our EBITDA performance, so that we can sustain a reasonable return of cash to shareholders, while positioning the company for long-term growth. We believe we have a number of opportunities to manage our business in a way that supports the dividend as we work to capitalize on our growth prospects. 
First, we have made significant investments in our network and data center infrastructure over the last several years, and believe we have the flexibility to lower our planned capital budget by about $200 million to approximately $2.8 billion [ph] for full year 2015, without significantly affecting our past growth. Also, I noted above, we have instituted plans to reduce our expense outlook by $125 million in 2015, and we have ongoing opportunities to increase efficiencies for automation, simplification and increased focus. However, we believe the most important thing we can do to sustain the dividend over the long term is to continue our path to revenue and EBITDA stability and growth. As I discussed above, we believe we have good opportunities to grow our business by driving greater penetration of products and services we have enabled over the last several years as well as implementing new services and capabilities we're in the process of rolling out. 
So the point I would like to leave you with is despite the wholesale issues in 2015 and lower than expected growth in certain of our strategic products, we believe we have the ability to grow our business and to balance our pursuit of growth with our ability to sustain our dividend. And our view is that managing our business to do this is a fundamental element of our value proposition to shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart. Stewart?"

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights for the second quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter and full year 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier th",1863,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights for the second quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter and full year 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Beginning on Slide 10, I'll review some highlights from our second quarter results. I'll be reviewing these results, excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release, and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.42 billion on a consolidated basis, a 2.7% decline from second quarter 2015 operating revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.02 billion for the second quarter, a decline of 2% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 1.9% year-over-year and represent 53% of total revenues compared to 50% a year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV, continue to drive this growth as we added approximately 8,400 Prism TV customers during the second quarter. Based on our revised go-to-market strategy for consumer broadband that Glen discussed earlier, we would expect HSI net adds to be negative for the second half of the year. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.62 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 36.8%. 
Year-over-year cash expenses were up primarily due to higher employee benefits, Prism TV and other costs, which were partially offset by lower customer premise equipment costs related to lower data integration revenues. 
Free cash flow was $562 million for the quarter. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest, capital expenditures, along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.55. As we discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for an investment of $90 million during the second quarter. Under the current program started in second quarter 2014, we have repurchased over 12 militants shares for approximately $460 million. Our level of share repurchases during the second quarter was lower than prior quarters due to strategic opportunities that prevented us from being in the market for several weeks and our being in a close window period since late in the quarter. Having moved past those strategic opportunities, we expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period given the plan to set up a 10 B 5 1 program over the next few [ph] days to facilitate the purchase of shares through our third quarter earnings release day. 
Moving to Slide 11, in our Business segment. In second quarter, the Business segment generated $2.66 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $129 million or 4.6% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment declined 0.4% to $1.6 billion from second quarter 2014, driven by the decline the low-bandwidth data services and wholesale repricing, partially offset by the continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength. We continue to generate solid growth across enterprise customer market, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small and medium-sized business space to improve market share and drive further growth. 
Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.7% from second quarter 2014 due primarily to a continuing decline in access lines. Total Business segment expenses increased from the year ago period, driven primarily by higher employee-related expenses. The segment margin of 42.6% decline from 45.6% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue along with higher operating expenses described. 
On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. High-bandwidth data services revenue grew $65 million or 10% year-over-year compared to second quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and government customers. While growth -- the growth rate remains solid for high-bandwidth services, it is somewhat dampened by slightly slower growth due to wholesale-renegotiated pricing for Ethernet backhaul services with a large carrier customer. Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in the second quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of $81 million or 14% was primarily due to wholesale customers, network grooming efforts and migration of fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects. 
Hosting revenues declined $10 million or 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $6 million, customer credits and lower nonrecurring revenue compared to the year-ago period. 
In the second quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $44 million or 24% compared to second quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.5 billion in total operating revenues, which was flat with the second quarter year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.9% year-over-year to $758 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and select price increases. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined to 5.8% from second quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. 
Operating expenses increased $16 million or 2.7% compared to the same period a year ago to due to higher Prism TV costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For third quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.42 billion to $4.47 billion and core revenues of $4.02 billion to $4.07 billion and operating cash flow between $1.62 billion to $1.67 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.58. 
Our anticipated sequential increase in third quarter operating revenues, core revenues and operating cash flow over to the second quarter results is primarily driven by growth in strategic services and select price increases. 
As outlined in our press release, we've revised our full year 2015 guidance to reflect year-to-date results as well as our stated expectations for the remainder of the year. For full year 2015, we expect operating revenues of $17.7 billion to $17.9 billion and core revenues of $16.1 billion to $16.25 billion. Both have been lowered, reflecting first half 2015 actual results along with continued pressure in wholesale private line, hosting and CPE revenues, along with the wholesale repricing previously mentioned. 
Operating cash flow is projected to be $6.7 billion to $6.85 billion and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $2.8 billion or $200 million lower than our previous guidance of approximately $3 billion. 
As you know, on April 29, the FCC offered potential support payments to price cap carriers under Phase 2 of the Connect America Fund program, and carriers have until August 27 of this year to notify the SEC of their intention to accept or forgo the support in some or all of the eligible states. CenturyLink was offered up to $514 million in support across 35 states, and at this time, we expect to accept at least $300 million of the available support. We continue to evaluate the remaining support payments and expect the notify the SEC on or before the August 27 deadlines. We expect the FCC to begin distributions under the CAF II program in September or October of this year time frame, and expect the initial receipts to include incremental support that trues up the full year CAF II support we ultimately decide to accept to the full year frozen federal USF support that we received today. We expect minimal capital investments in 2015 related to CAF II due to timing of the program, but we do expect the full year of CAF II-related capital expenditures for 2016. We currently expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $3 billion, inclusive of CAF II requirements, because of the significant investments we've made over the last several years that support our business plans for growth and position us to reallocate capital to CAF II. 
While any receipts from CAF II are not included in the updated guidance I discussed earlier, we did provide estimated ranges the potential impact on third quarter and full year 2015 guidance from the CAF Phase 2 support we ultimately accept and receive. We expect to recognize the full amount of CAF II support payments as other revenue in the year received. 
While we understand the scenario for focus for investors has been whether CenturyLink might implement some type of REIT structure, we've elect not to pursue that structure at this time for several reasons. These reasons include the competitive disruption of the transaction structure, the variety of opinions from investors and our lack of confidence that implementing such a structure would create real long-term shareholder value. 
Let me talk a little bit about cash taxes. In terms of cash taxes, we expect 2015 cash taxes to be $25 million to $125 million after considering approximately $150 million to $250 million of 2015 taxes that we expect to pay in March of next year. For 2016, we expect cash taxes to increase to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range, including the deferral of the 2015 cash taxes in 2016 that I just mentioned. 
Recently, the finance committee passed a bill, Out Committee, that would extend the provisions that expire at the end of 2014, including bonus depreciation, retroactively for 2015 and through 2016. This 2-year bill was meant to push the issue beyond next year's elections. The Finance Committee Bill has not yet been considered by the full Senate. The Full House has currently extended some selective extenders, similar to what they did last year. Bonus depreciation has traditionally been one of these favorites of selective provisions. Congress went into their August recess last week, and the House and the Senate this week, so we don't expect any action on the extenders, at least until the fall. In the fall, we currently expect there to be negotiations and on the extenders, but given the support for bonus depreciation, we believe there's a very good chance that, again, is extended for at least 2 years through 2016. Should bonus depreciation that implemented only for 2015, we would expect our 2015 cash taxes to be approximately $25 million to $125 million and 2016 cash taxes between $550 million and $650 million after considering approximately $225 million to $300 million of 2015 taxes that we would expect to pay up in March of 2017 of. If bonus depreciation is extended through 2016, we expect our cash taxes would decrease by an additional $50 million to $150 million for 2016. So bonus depreciation can have a tremendous impact in our free cash flow. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

Basically, the minimum that we outlined in the release today really applies to about 24 states or so, or a couple of dozen states. And there are 11 other states that we're having to study a little bit harder in terms of where we are in terms with respect to the network and knowledge to build out with cost associated with those.

Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to highlight a few item",2076,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our second quarter 2015 results from operations, provide guidance and outlook for the second half 2015. 
Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to highlight a few items that I think are important to keep in mind as we go through our results. First, on the revenue side, our second quarter results were negatively impacted by renegotiation of a long-term wholesale agreement to reduce strategic revenue by about $13 million for the quarter and is driving an approximately $40 million reduction on our revenue outlook for full year 2015. 
This renegotiated agreement locks us into those agreements at market rates for several years, giving us great ability to grow that business and provide reciprocal access to our wholesale partners network at more attractive rates. We're revising our full year revenue midpoint to $17.8 billion, reflecting the impact of this wholesale issue and the full year effect of softer-than-expected for first-half results. 
Our revised guidance is approximately $45 million below the current consensus Street estimate of $17.85 billion. $40 million of that is associated with the wholesale issue I was just talking about. 
However, the bigger issue in the second quarter was really expense. We had a number of noncore items that drove our expenses higher in the quarter, including $20 million in group insurance and pension true-up adjustments, and $20 million due to higher-than-expected CPE sales. 
The balance of our overage is primarily due to not hitting the operating budgets we established for business units for the quarter, principally due to higher-than-anticipated employee-related costs. We do not believe this miss reflects anything fundamental in the cost structure of our business. Basically, we just didn't get the job done here. We have made a number of key changes, and as we will discuss later, we have put plans in place to address this issue in the second half of the year. 
Beyond 2015, we believe we have further opportunity to continue to align the costs in our business to our revenue performance, and we will discuss some of this with you later in the call. I wanted to share with you -- this with you at the outset of the call as I want to be clear that although our second quarter results did not meet our expectation, I am as confident as I've ever been that we have the assets, the products, the services and the opportunities required to grow our business. 
Now if you will turn to Slide 6, we believe several key priorities would drive the future growth and profitability of our business. The first is to grow business revenues, driven principally by increased market penetration of our network, hosting, cloud and IT solution service offerings. With respect to our business network services, we continue to see strong demand from business, wholesale and government customers for high-bandwidth data services such as Ethernet, MPLS and business GPON, and we're investing in and aligning our operations to take greater advantage of this opportunity. 
Now let me give you a few examples of what we're doing. As of June 30, we have made fiber-based GPON available to approximately 475,000 business locations, and we expect to add GPON service to another 25,000 businesses by year end. There is good demand to this product, and given our relatively low penetration, we believe we have strong upside with those investments. 
We also continue to enhance our core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP trunking services as well as plans to enable software-defined networking and network function virtualization capabilities into 43 data centers by the end of this year. 
During the first half of the year, we expanded our global data center footprint through expansion in 6 markets, adding -- we added 10.8 megawatts of capacity -- critical capacity, and that brings CenturyLink's global data center capacity to more than 185 total megawatts across our 59 data centers. We still have upside in our existing data center investment as we had over 35% of sellable floor space available as of June 30. 
Our revenues from our CenturyLink Cloud platform is growing rapidly, more than doubling the last 12 months, actually 138% growth in the second quarter of last year. A primary focus in the cloud and hosting space is to strengthen our private and dedicated hosting capabilities. These private platforms require much of the automation and management tools you see in major public cloud platforms. 
But our focus is on leveraging the CenturyLink cloud platform to enhance our enterprise customer's abilities to turn up and manage both network and hosted workloads in private, dedicated environments, including the enablement of environmental services later this year. 
However; overall, we have not met our expectations in our managed hosting business. I believe our sales force reorganization contributed to this issue, but I believe the principal driver is in the latter part of 2014 and early 2015. We defocused our delivery of services on our existing managed platform to focus instead on putting workloads in the CenturyLink Cloud platform. The CenturyLink Cloud platform is a powerful and dynamic platform, but is not -- does not yet support all the functionality our managed hosting customers required.
The defocus away from legacy platform was a misstep and has affected our hosting results, and we believe we can improve these results by refocusing on delivering services at increasing capabilities on our legacy platform, while we continue to enhance the depth of CenturyLink Cloud capabilities. 
Finally, we are also seeing good interest in our IT services and data analytics service offerings. Our focus in this area is to provide targeted services to business customers who are underserved by the traditional larger system integrators. Although growing rapidly, this business is small in scale today, but the service offerings give us a good low capital-intensive opportunity to engage into Sealevel and generate leads in the other parts of our business. 
Now this capability to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions, including IT consulting, has led to a number of recent wins for CenturyLink to provide a large portion, or in some cases, all communications, data and IT services for those customers. 
Overall, in our Business segment, we helped improve our execution, but we are seeing strength in our sales momentum. For example, second quarter 2015 sales to our enterprise customers were up 10% from first quarter 2015 and up 16% from second quarter 2014, while our commercial sales increased 27% in second quarter of 2014. 
Continuing on now on to Slide 7 and turning to the Consumer segment. We continue to see good results from those markets. We have deployed higher broadband speeds in Prism TV services. Specifically, in our GPON markets, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. And because GPON is such a great driver of demand and penetration, we continue to expand our gigabit footprint ending the quarter with more than 600,000 households and 16 markets having access to gigabit speeds. 
We expect to have gigabit service available to approximately 700,000 households by year end 2015, with plans for further expansion thereafter. We're also trialing technologies that enable up to 200 megabits over our legacy copper networks. This is in early stage -- in the early stages, but it is showing good promise. 
We also expanded our Prism TV service in the second quarter, turning up service in Portland, Salt Lake and Minneapolis. We added a total of 175,000 addressable homes in the second quarter, ending the quarter with over 2.6 million Prism TV addressable households. 
We anticipate expanding Prism TV services to another -- to approximately 250,000 additional households during the remainder of 2015, and to reach more than 2.8 million total Prism TV addressable homes by year end. 
In addition, we're developing an over-the-top offering that we -- we'll be able to provide a robust, competitive video offering for customers both within and outside our Prism TV market footprint. And finally, we're tightening our credit policies for Internet-only customers to reduce sales to customers who tend to change Internet providers frequently, leaving unpaid balances when they exit. 
Now while we expect this change to negative impact consumer broadband net subscriber additions to the remainder of 2015, we anticipate this adjustment will actually help improve our broadband growth in 2016 due to lower churn. Now this move is unrelated to and have no impact on our marketing initiative for lower-income consumers on our CenturyLink's Internet Basics program. We remain totally committed to offering affordable broadband access to lower-income households across our broadband service areas. 
Now I want to discuss our thoughts around expense control. As I noted above, the principal issue for us this quarter was that our expenses were about $80 million more than we anticipated. About half of that amount is attributable to not managing costs through our established budget. We can and we will do on this front. For starters, we're implementing plans to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $125 million in the second half of 2015, including lowering contract labor, professional services cost, a reduction in the number of employees and other expense reductions. Now this is not simply a target. We already have plans in place to address most of that number. 
Also independent of any issue around second quarter expense, earlier this year, we established a dedicated team, whose sole purpose is to identify and drive ongoing efficiencies into our business. This team is reviewing every major process and every significant system to validate its business purpose, and whether there is a faster, better way to achieve that objective. 
An early example of their work is a recent access in improving service intervals by more than 40% by streamlining processes. This relates to a better customer experience, the need for fewer employees to perform that work and better margins on that business. We believe there are other opportunities similar to this as well as the opportunity to improve efficiencies by driving additional automation and simplification into our business. 
Continuing on to Slide 8 now. Lastly, I'd like to take a minute to discuss our philosophy around our dividend. Given that our path to revenue and EBITDA growth is taking longer than we originally anticipated, and that our cash taxes are expected to increase significantly in 2016, we understand the market's focus on the sustainability of our dividend. So I want to be clear here. While no company can credibly say they will never cut their dividend, we see the dividend as a fundamental part of our overall value proposition to shareholders. 
We believe the most financially prudent way to manage our business is to balance our investment velocity with our EBITDA performance, so that we can sustain a reasonable return of cash to shareholders, while positioning the company for long-term growth. We believe we have a number of opportunities to manage our business in a way that supports the dividends as we work to capitalize on our growth prospects. 
First, we have made significant investments in our network and data center infrastructure over the last several years, and believe we have the flexibility to lower our planned capital budget by about $200 million to approximately $2.8 billion for full year 2015, without significantly affecting our path to growth. 
Also, as I noted above, we have instituted plans to reduce our expense outlook by $125 million in 2015, and we have ongoing opportunities to increase efficiencies through automation, simplification and increased focus. However, we believe the most important thing we can do to sustain the dividend over the long term is to continue our path to revenue and EBITDA stability and growth. 
As I discussed above, we believe we have very good opportunities to grow our business through driving greater penetration of products and services we enabled over the last several years as well as implementing new services and capabilities we're in the process of rolling out. 
So the point I would like to leave you with is despite the wholesale issues in 2015 and lower-than-expected growth in certain of our strategic products, we believe we have the ability to grow our business and to balance our pursuit of growth with our ability to sustain our dividend. And our view is that managing our business to do this is a fundamental element of our value proposition to shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart."

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the second quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter and full year 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier t",1864,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the second quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter and full year 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Beginning on Slide 10, I'll review some highlights from our second quarter results. I'll be reviewing these results, excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release, and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.42 billion on a consolidated basis, a 2.7% decline from second quarter 2015 operating revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.02 billion for the second quarter, a decline of 2% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 1.9% year-over-year and represent 53% of total revenues compared to 50% a year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV, continue to drive this growth as we added approximately 8,400 Prism TV customers during the second quarter. 
Based on our revised go-to-market strategy for consumer broadband that Glen discussed earlier, we will expect HSI net adds to be negative for the second half of the year. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.62 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 36.8%. 
Year-over-year cash expenses were up primarily due to higher employee benefits, Prism TV and other costs, which were partially offset by lower customer premise equipment costs related to lower data integration revenues. 
Free cash flow was $562 million for the quarter. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest, capital expenditures, along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.55. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. 
Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for an investment of $90 million during the second quarter. Under the current program started in second quarter 2014, we have repurchased over 12 million shares for approximately $460 million. Our level of share repurchases during the second quarter was lower than prior quarters due to strategic opportunities that prevented us from being in the market for several weeks and our being in a closed window period since late in the quarter. 
Having moved past those strategic opportunities, we expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period and we the plan to set up a 10b5-1 program in the next few days to facilitate the purchase of shares through our third quarter earnings release date.
Moving to Slide 11 and our Business segment. In second quarter, the Business segment generated $2.66 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $129 million or 4.6% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment declined 0.4% to $1.6 billion from second quarter 2014, driven by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and wholesale repricing, partially offset by the continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength. We continue to generate solid growth across enterprise customer market, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small- and medium-sized business space to improve market share and drive further growth. 
Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.7% from second quarter 2014 due primarily to a continuing decline in access lines. Total Business segment expenses increased from the year ago period, driven primarily by higher employee-related expenses. The segment margin of 42.6% declined from 45.6% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue, along with the higher operating expenses described. 
On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. High-bandwidth data services revenue grew $65 million or 10% year-over-year compared to second quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and government customers. While growth -- the growth rate remains solid for high-bandwidth services, it is somewhat dampened by slightly slower growth due to wholesale-renegotiated pricing for Ethernet backhaul services with a large carrier customer. 
Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in the second quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of $81 million or 14% was primarily due to wholesale customers, network grooming efforts and migration to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects. 
Hosting revenues declined $10 million or 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $6 million, customer credits and lower nonrecurring revenue compared to the year-ago period. 
In the second quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $44 million or 24% compared to second quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.5 billion in total operating revenues, which was flat with the second quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.9% year-over-year to $758 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and select price increases. 
Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined to 5.8% from second quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. 
Operating expenses increased $16 million or 2.7% compared to the same period a year ago to due to higher Prism TV costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For third quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.42 billion to $4.47 billion and core revenues of $4.02 billion to $4.07 billion and operating cash flow between $1.62 billion to $1.67 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.58. 
Our anticipated sequential increase in third quarter operating revenues, core revenues and operating cash flow over to the second quarter results is primarily driven by growth in strategic services and select price increases. 
As outlined in our press release, we've revised our full year 2015 guidance to reflect year-to-date results as well as updated stated expectations for the remainder of the year. For full year 2015, we expect operating revenues of $17.7 billion to $17.9 billion and core revenues of $16.1 billion to $16.25 billion. Both have been lowered, reflecting first half 2015 actual results, along with continued pressure in wholesale private line, hosting and CPE revenues, along with the wholesale repricing previously mentioned. 
Operating cash flow is projected to be $6.7 billion to $6.85 billion and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $2.8 billion or $200 million lower than our previous guidance of approximately $3 billion. 
As you know, on April 29, the FCC offered potential support payments to price cap carriers under Phase 2 of the Connect America Fund program, and carriers have until August 27 of this year to notify the FCC of their intention to accept or forgo the support in some or all of the eligible states. CenturyLink was offered up to $514 million in support across 35 states, and at this time, we expect to accept at least $300 million of the available support. 
We continue to evaluate the remaining support payments and expect to notify the FCC on or before the August 27 deadline. We expect the FCC to begin distributions under the CAF II program in September or October of this year time frame, and expect the initial receipts to include incremental support that trues up the full year CAF II support we ultimately decide to accept to the full year frozen federal USF support that we received today. 
We expect minimal capital investments in 2015 related to CAF II due to timing of the program, but we do expect the full year of CAF II-related capital expenditures for 2016. We currently expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $3 billion, inclusive of CAF II requirements, because of the significant investments we've made over the last several years that support our business plans for growth and position us to reallocate capital to CAF II. 
While any receipts from CAF II are not included in the updated guidance I discussed earlier, we do provide estimated ranges of the potential impact on third quarter and full year 2015 guidance from the CAF Phase 2 support we ultimately accept and receive. We expect to recognize the full amount of CAF II support payments as other revenue in the year received. 
While we understand the recent area of focus for investors has been whether CenturyLink might implement some type of REIT structure, we've elected not to pursue that structure at this time for several reasons. These reasons include the complexity and disruption of the transaction structure, the variety of opinions from investors and our lack of confidence that implementing such a structure would create real long-term shareholder value. 
Let me talk a little bit about cash taxes. In terms of cash taxes, we expect 2015 cash taxes to be $25 million to $125 million after considering approximately $150 million to $250 million of 2015 taxes that we expect to pay in March of next year. For 2016, we expect cash taxes to increase to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range, including the deferral of the 2015 cash taxes into '16 that I just mentioned. 
Recently, the Senate finance committee passed a bill out of committee that would extend the provisions that expired at the end of 2014, including bonus depreciation, retroactively for 2015 and through 2016. This 2-year bill was meant to push the issue beyond next year's elections. The finance committee bill has not yet been considered by the full Senate. 
The Full House has currently extended some selective extenders, similar to what they did last year. Bonus depreciation has traditionally been one of these favored selected provisions. Congress went into their August recess last week, and the House and the Senate this week, so we don't expect any action on extenders at least until the fall. 
In the fall, we currently expect there to be negotiations on all the extenders, but given the support for bonus depreciation, we believe there's a very good chance that it gets extended for at least 2 years through 2016. Should bonus depreciation get implemented only for 2015, we would expect our 2015 cash taxes to be approximately $25 million to $125 million and 2016 cash taxes between $550 million and $650 million after considering approximately $225 million to $300 million of 2016 taxes that we would expect to pay up in March of 2017. If bonus depreciation is extended through 2016, we expect our cash taxes would decrease by an additional $50 million to $150 million for 2016. So bonus depreciation can have a tremendous effect on our free cash flow. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

And there are 11 other states that we're having to study a little bit harder in terms of where we are with respect to the network and how much the build-out would cost associated with those. So we could be slightly cash flow dilutive, but I mean, that is what we're trying to solve for."

But we probably, for that 1 year 2016, would be in the 90% range or so, but that includes the tax payments of a couple $150 million or so, $100 million, $150 million that we said we would be deferring to 2016 that really relate to '15. So -- and also, we have $100 million pension payment scheduled in there as well that's not actually required. So we feel like we have some leverage that we can pull to -- and of course, our dividend payout ratio this year is only about 45% or so, so we have plenty of room to pay the cash taxes early if we want to get that out of '16.

Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to highlight a few items",2081,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our second quarter 2015 results and operations, provide guidance and outlook for the second half 2015. 
Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to highlight a few items that I think are important to keep in mind as we go through our results. First, on the revenue side, our second quarter results were negatively impacted by renegotiation of a long-term wholesale agreement that reduced strategic revenue by about $13 million for the quarter and is driving an approximately $40 million reduction on our revenue outlook for full year 2015. 
This renegotiated agreement locks us into those agreements at market rates for several years, giving us great ability to grow that business and provide reciprocal access to our wholesale partner's network at more attractive rates. We're revising our full year revenue midpoint to $17.8 billion, reflecting the impact of this wholesale issue and the full year effect of softer-than-expected first-half results. 
Our revised guidance is approximately $45 million below the current consensus Street estimate of $17.85 billion. $40 million of that is associated with the wholesale issue I was just talking about. 
However, the bigger issue in the second quarter was really expense. We had a number of noncore items that drove our expenses higher in the quarter, including $20 million in group insurance and pension true-up adjustments, and $20 million due to higher-than-expected CPE sales. 
The balance of our overage is primarily due to not hitting the operating budgets we established for business units for the quarter, principally due to higher-than-anticipated employee-related costs. We do not believe this miss reflects anything fundamental in the cost structure of our business. Basically, we just didn't get the job done here. We have made a number of key changes, and as we will discuss later, we have put plans in place to address this issue in the second half of the year. 
Beyond 2015, we believe we have further opportunity to continue to align the costs in our business to our revenue performance, and we will discuss some of this with you later in the call. I wanted to share with you -- this with you at the outset of the call as I want to be clear that although our second quarter results did not meet our expectation, I am as confident as I've ever been that we have the assets, the products, the services and the opportunities required to grow our business. 
Now if you will turn to Slide 6, we believe several key priorities will drive the future growth and profitability of our business. The first is to grow business revenues, driven principally by increased market penetration of our network, hosting, cloud and IT solution service offerings. With respect to our business network services, we continue to see strong demand from business, wholesale and government customers for high-bandwidth data services such as Ethernet, MPLS and business GPON, and we're investing in and aligning our operations to take greater advantage of this opportunity. 
Now let me give you a few examples of what we're doing. As of June 30, we have made fiber-based GPON available to approximately 475,000 business locations, and we expect to add GPON service to another 25,000 businesses by year end. There is good demand for this product, and given our relatively low penetration, we believe we have strong upside with those investments. 
We also continue to enhance our core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP trunking services as well as plans to enable software-defined networking and network function virtualization capabilities into 43 data centers by the end of this year. 
During the first half of the year, we expanded our global data center footprint through expansions in 6 markets, adding -- we added 10.8 megawatts of capacity -- critical capacity, and that brings CenturyLink's global data center capacity to more than 185 total megawatts across our 59 data centers. We still have upside in our existing data center investment as we had over 35% of sellable floor space available as of June 30. 
Our revenues from our CenturyLink Cloud platform is growing rapidly, more than doubling in the last 12 months, actually 138% growth in the second quarter of last year. A primary focus in the cloud and hosting space is to strengthen our private and dedicated hosting capabilities. These private platforms require much of the automation and management tools you see in major public cloud platforms. 
But our focus is on leveraging the CenturyLink cloud platform to enhance our enterprise customers' abilities to turn up and manage both network and hosted workloads in private, dedicated environments, including the enablement of environmental services later this year. 
However, overall, we have not met our expectations in our managed hosting business. I believe our sales force reorganization contributed to this issue, but I believe the principal driver is that in the latter part of 2014 and early 2015. We defocused our delivery of services on our existing managed platform to focus instead on putting workloads in the CenturyLink Cloud platform. The CenturyLink Cloud platform is a powerful and dynamic platform, but is not -- does not yet support all the functionality our managed hosting customers require.
The defocus away from legacy platform was a misstep that has affected our hosting results, and we believe we can improve these results by refocusing on delivering services and increasing capabilities on our legacy platform, while we continue to enhance the depth of CenturyLink Cloud capabilities. 
Finally, we are also seeing good interest in our IT services and data analytics service offerings. Our focus in this area is to provide targeted services to business customers who are underserved by the traditional larger system integrators. Although growing rapidly, this business is small in scale today, but the service offerings give us a good low capital-intensive opportunity to engage at the C-level and generate leads in the other parts of our business. 
Now this capability to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions, including IT consulting, has led to a number of recent wins for CenturyLink to provide a large portion, or in some cases, all communications, data and IT services for those customers. 
Overall, in our Business segment, we have to improve our execution, but we are seeing strength in our sales momentum. For example, second quarter 2015 sales to our enterprise customers were up 10% from first quarter 2015 and up 16% from second quarter 2014, while our commercial sales increased 27% in second quarter of 2014. 
Continuing on now on to Slide 7 and turning to the Consumer segment. We continue to see good results from those markets where we have deployed higher broadband speeds and Prism TV services. Specifically, in our GPON markets, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. And because GPON is such a great driver of demand and penetration, we continue to expand our gigabit footprint, ending the quarter with more than 600,000 households in 16 markets having access to gigabit speeds. 
We expect to have gigabit service available to approximately 700,000 households by year end 2015, with plans for further expansion thereafter. We're also trialing technologies that enable up to 200 megabits over our legacy copper networks. This is in early stage -- in the early stages, but it is showing good promise. 
We also expanded our Prism TV service in the second quarter, turning up service in Portland, Salt Lake and Minneapolis. We added a total of 175,000 addressable homes in the second quarter, ending the quarter with over 2.6 million Prism TV addressable households. 
We anticipate expanding Prism TV services to another -- to approximately 250,000 additional households during the remainder of 2015, and to reach more than 2.8 million total Prism TV addressable homes by year end. 
In addition, we're developing an over-the-top offering that we -- that will provide a robust, competitive video offering for customers both within and outside our Prism TV market footprint. And finally, we're tightening our credit policies for Internet-only customers to reduce sales to customers who tend to change Internet providers frequently, leaving unpaid balances when they exit. 
Now while we expect this change to negatively impact consumer broadband net subscriber additions through the remainder of 2015, we anticipate this adjustment will actually help improve our broadband growth in 2016 due to lower churn. Now this move is unrelated to and will have no impact on our marketing initiative for lower-income consumers under CenturyLink's Internet Basics program. We remain totally committed to offering affordable broadband access to lower-income households across our broadband service areas. 
Now I want to discuss our thoughts around expense control. As I noted above, the principal issue for us this quarter was that our expenses were about $80 million more than we anticipated. About half of that amount is attributable to not managing costs to our established budget. We can and we will do better on this front. For starters, we're implementing plans to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $125 million in the second half of 2015, including lowering contract labor, professional services cost, a reduction in the number of employees and other expense reductions. Now this is not simply a target. We already have plans in place to address most of that number. 
Also independent of any issue around second quarter expense, earlier this year, we established a dedicated team, whose sole purpose is to identify and drive ongoing efficiencies into our business. This team is reviewing every major process and every significant system to validate its business purpose, and whether there is a faster, better way to achieve that objective. 
An early example of their work is a recent success in improving certain service intervals by more than 40% by streamlining processes. This will lead to a better customer experience, the need for fewer employees to perform that work and better margins on that business. We believe there are other opportunities similar to this as well as the opportunity to improve efficiencies by driving additional automation and simplification into our business. 
Continuing on to Slide 8 now. Lastly, I'd like to take a minute to discuss our philosophy around our dividend. Given that our path to revenue and EBITDA growth is taking longer than we originally anticipated, and that our cash taxes are expected to increase significantly in 2016, we understand the market's focus on the sustainability of our dividend. So I want to be clear here. While no company can credibly say they will never cut their dividend, we see the dividend as a fundamental part of our overall value proposition to shareholders. 
We believe the most financially prudent way to manage our business is to balance our investment velocity with our EBITDA performance, so that we can sustain a reasonable return of cash to shareholders, while positioning the company for long-term growth. We believe we have a number of opportunities to manage our business in a way that supports the dividends as we work to capitalize on our growth prospects. 
First, we have made significant investments in our network and data center infrastructure over the last several years, and believe we have the flexibility to lower our planned capital budget by about $200 million to approximately $2.8 billion for full year 2015, without significantly affecting our path to growth. 
Also, as I noted above, we have instituted plans to reduce our expense outlook by $125 million in 2015, and we have ongoing opportunities to increase efficiencies through automation, simplification and increased focus. However, we believe the most important thing we can do to sustain the dividend over the long term is to continue our path to revenue and EBITDA stability and growth. 
As I discussed above, we believe we have very good opportunities to grow our business through driving greater penetration of products and services we enabled over the last several years as well as implementing new services and capabilities we're in the process of rolling out. 
So the point I would like to leave you with is despite the wholesale issues in 2015 and lower-than-expected growth in certain of our strategic products, we believe we have the ability to grow our business and to balance our pursuit of growth with our ability to sustain our dividend. And our view is that managing our business to do this is a fundamental element of our value proposition to shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart."

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the second quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter and full year 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier t",1862,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the second quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter and full year 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Beginning on Slide 10, I'll review some highlights from our second quarter results. I'll be reviewing these results, excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release, and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.42 billion on a consolidated basis, a 2.7% decline from second quarter 2015 operating revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.02 billion for the second quarter, a decline of 2% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 1.9% year-over-year and represent 53% of total revenues compared to 50% a year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV, continue to drive this growth as we added approximately 8,400 Prism TV customers during the second quarter. 
Based on our revised go-to-market strategy for consumer broadband that Glen discussed earlier, we would expect HSI net adds to be negative for the second half of the year. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.62 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 36.8%. 
Year-over-year cash expenses were up primarily due to higher employee benefits, Prism TV and other costs, which were partially offset by lower customer premise equipment costs related to lower data integration revenues. 
Free cash flow was $562 million for the quarter. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest, capital expenditures, along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.55. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. 
Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for an investment of $90 million during the second quarter. Under the current program started in second quarter 2014, we have repurchased over 12 million shares for approximately $460 million. Our level of share repurchases during the second quarter was lower than prior quarters due to strategic opportunities that prevented us from being in the market for several weeks and our being in a closed window period since late in the quarter. 
Having moved past those strategic opportunities, we expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period and we the plan to set up a 10b5-1 program in the next few days to facilitate the purchase of shares through our third quarter earnings release date.
Moving to Slide 11 and our Business segment. In second quarter, the Business segment generated $2.66 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $129 million or 4.6% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment declined 0.4% to $1.6 billion from second quarter 2014, driven by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and wholesale repricing, partially offset by the continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength. We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer market, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small- and medium-sized business space to improve market share and drive further growth. 
Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.7% from second quarter 2014 due primarily to a continuing decline in access lines. Total Business segment expenses increased from the year ago period, driven primarily by higher employee-related expenses. The segment margin of 42.6% declined from 45.6% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue, along with the higher operating expenses described. 
On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. High-bandwidth data services revenue grew $65 million or 10% year-over-year compared to second quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and government customers. While growth -- the growth rate remains solid for high-bandwidth services, it is somewhat dampened by slightly slower growth due to wholesale-renegotiated pricing for Ethernet backhaul services with a large carrier customer. 
Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in the second quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of $81 million or 14% was primarily due to wholesale customers, network grooming efforts and migration to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects. 
Hosting revenues declined $10 million or 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $6 million, customer credits and lower nonrecurring revenue compared to the year-ago period. 
In the second quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $44 million or 24% compared to second quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.5 billion in total operating revenues, which was flat with the second quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.9% year-over-year to $758 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and select price increases. 
Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined 5.8% from second quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. 
Operating expenses increased $16 million or 2.7% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For third quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.42 billion to $4.47 billion and core revenues of $4.02 billion to $4.07 billion and operating cash flow between $1.62 billion to $1.67 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.58. 
Our anticipated sequential increase in third quarter operating revenues, core revenues and operating cash flow compared to the second quarter results is primarily driven by growth in strategic services and select price increases. 
As outlined in our press release, we've revised our full year 2015 guidance to reflect year-to-date results as well as updated expectations for the remainder of the year. For full year 2015, we expect operating revenues of $17.7 billion to $17.9 billion and core revenues of $16.1 billion to $16.25 billion. Both have been lowered, reflecting first half 2015 actual results, along with continued pressure in wholesale private line, hosting and CPE revenues, along with the wholesale repricing previously mentioned. 
Operating cash flow is projected to be $6.7 billion to $6.85 billion and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $2.8 billion or $200 million lower than our previous guidance of approximately $3 billion. 
As you know, on April 29, the FCC offered potential support payments to price cap carriers under Phase 2 of the Connect America Fund program, and carriers have until August 27 of this year to notify the FCC of their intention to accept or forgo the support in some or all of the eligible states. CenturyLink was offered up to $514 million in support across 35 states, and at this time, we expect to accept at least $300 million of the available support. 
We continue to evaluate the remaining support payments and expect to notify the FCC on or before the August 27 deadline. We expect the FCC to begin distributions under the CAF II program in September or October of this year time frame, and expect the initial receipts to include incremental support that trues up the full year CAF II support we ultimately decide to accept to the full year frozen federal USF support that we receive today. 
We expect minimal capital investments in 2015 related to CAF II due to the timing of the program, but we do expect a full year of CAF II-related capital expenditures for 2016. We currently expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $3 billion, inclusive of CAF II requirements, because of the significant investments we've made over the last several years that support our business plans for growth and position us to reallocate capital to CAF II. 
While any receipts from CAF II are not included in the updated guidance I discussed earlier, we do provide estimated ranges of the potential impact on third quarter and full year 2015 guidance from the CAF Phase 2 support we ultimately accept and receive. We expect to recognize the full amount of CAF II support payments as other revenue in the year received. 
While we understand a recent area of focus for investors has been whether CenturyLink might implement some type of REIT structure, we've elected not to pursue that structure at this time for several reasons. These reasons include the complexity and disruption of the transaction structure, the variety of opinions from investors and our lack of confidence that implementing such a structure would create real long-term shareholder value. 
Let me talk a little bit about cash taxes. In terms of cash taxes, we expect 2015 cash taxes to be $25 million to $125 million after considering approximately $150 million to $250 million of 2015 taxes that we expect to pay in March of next year. For 2016, we expect cash taxes to increase to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range, including the deferral of the 2015 cash taxes into '16 that I just mentioned. 
Recently, the Senate finance committee passed a bill out of committee that would extend the provisions that expired at the end of 2014, including bonus depreciation, retroactively, for 2015 and through 2016. This 2-year bill was meant to push the issue beyond next year's elections. The finance committee bill has not yet been considered by the full Senate. 
The full House has partly extended some selective extenders, similar to what they did last year. Bonus depreciation has traditionally been one of these favored selected provisions. Congress went into their August recess last week, and the House and the Senate this week, so we don't expect any action on extenders at least until the fall. 
In the fall, we currently expect there to be negotiations on all the extenders, but given the support for bonus depreciation, we believe there's a very good chance that it gets extended for at least 2 years through 2016. Should bonus depreciation get implemented only for 2015, we would expect our 2015 cash taxes to be approximately $25 million to $125 million and 2016 cash taxes between $550 million and $650 million after considering approximately $225 million to $300 million of 2016 taxes that we would expect to pay in March of 2017. If bonus depreciation is extended through 2016, we expect our cash taxes would decrease by an additional $50 million to $150 million for 2016. So bonus depreciation can have a tremendous effect on our free cash flow. 
That concludes the prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

And I guess that that's going to be the big focus for kind of Glen's point about execution and such. So if we go to that Page 12, which is, really, I think on the business services side, and we look at that chart, can you kind of walk us through the pieces parts that are going to drive what you seem to think at this stage can still be strong revenue growth kind of heading into the back part of the year and into next?"

And we really are studying very hard the cost associated with building the network. And we think if we're able to make some progress there, we can accept more of the CAF II monies. Basically, the minimum that we outlined in the release today really applies to about 24 states or so or a couple of dozen states. And there are 11 other states that we're having to study a little bit harder in terms of where we are with respect to the network and how much the build-out would cost associated with those. So we could be slightly cash flow dilutive, but I mean, that is what we're trying to solve for."

But we probably, for that 1 year, 2016, would be in the 90% range or so, but that includes the tax payments of a couple -- $150 million or so, $100 million, $150 million that we said we would be deferring to 2016 that really relate to '15. So -- and also, we have $100 million pension payment scheduled in there as well that's not actually required. So we feel like we have some leverage that we can pull to -- and of course, our dividend payout ratio this year is only about 45% or so, so we have plenty of room to pay the cash taxes early if we want to get that out of '16. So I mean, we really feel pretty comfortable that there are levers that we can pull to get our dividend payout ratio where it needs to be to where there's not a problem with it in '16.

And while there certainly will be some quarterly ups and downs with some bumps in the road along the way, CenturyLink's long-term trajectory, in my view is as positive and bright as it's ever been. So thank you for joining our call today, and we'll look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead."

Beginning on Slide 5, as you know, CenturyLink continues our transition to becoming a leading provider of integrated IP-enabled network, hosting and IT services. This transition brings both opportunities and challenges as we work to find ways to provide our customers with product and services that they need in today's environment. Faster broadband speeds and hosting solutions are at the top of many of our customers' list of needs. We're deploying GPON to consumer and business customers. We're expanding Prism TV availability and providing competitive enhancements to our network, hosting and cloud services to meet these demands. 
In the third quarter, we saw several positive signs that we are making progress in this transition. First, the consumer segment had a solid quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 1.2% as we continue to deploy GPON and Prism TV to more locations throughout our footprint. We're attracting more high-value customers, and we have increased our ARPU through the continued launch of the GPON higher-value bundle sales and select pricing increases. 
Second, the business sales organization realignment implemented earlier this year is now proving effective as new sales-to-business customers for the third quarter increased year-over-year and sequentially. The third quarter marks the second straight quarter of accelerating sales with particular strength in global and enterprise. Additionally, in our business sector, we exited third quarter with a strong business sales bundle, including an increased number of large deal opportunities. 
You will recall last quarter, we stated that our operating expenses got ahead of our budget that you were committed to addressing that during the last half of the year. We're delivering on that commitment as we have taken steps to reduce planned operating expenses about [ph] approximately $125 million in the second half of 2015. We achieved a portion of this expense reduction relative to plan in the third quarter, but the majority of the benefit will be realized in the fourth quarter of this year. Also we're well on track to lower our full year 2015 planned capital budget by about $200 million, which will result in full-year capital expenditures of about $2.8 billion. We're encouraged by these areas, where we're seeing positive momentum. 
However, the overall revenue for our third quarter were below our expectations, primarily due to softness in hosting and long-distance service revenues along with higher credits and other onetime items in the quarter. If you normalize for the onetime items, the total about $20 million to $25 million, operating in core revenue for both at the low end our quarterly guidance range. Although our third quarter revenues results did not beat our expectation, I'm very confident that we have the assets and the products and the opportunities required to grow our business in the months ahead. 
Now turning to Slide 6. We believe several key priorities will drive future growth and profitability of our business. The first is to grow business revenues, driven principally by increased market penetration of our network, hosting, cloud and IT solution service offerings. With respect to our business network service offerings, we continue to see strong demand for business wholesale and government customers for high-bandwidth data services such as Ethernet, MPLS and business GPON. And we're investing and aligning our business to take advantage of this opportunity. This quarter, we saw continued strength in our sales momentum. Third quarter 2015 retail network sales were up approximately 15% from the second quarter of 2015, and up approximately 25% from the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, we exited the quarter with a strong business sales funnel. The sales funnel has continued to strengthen during fourth quarter, and October sales results were the highest of the year. 
I want to give you a few examples of what we're doing to drive higher sales over time. As of September 30, we have fiber-to-the-prem, including GPON, available to about 490,000 business locations. There is good demand for this product, and given our relatively low penetration, we believe we have strong upside for those investments. We also continue to enhance other core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and sip trunking services and to add new capabilities to our Managed Office products suite to provide differentiated simplicity for smaller to medium businesses customers looking for fully outsourced network, customer premise equipment, cloud and business application solutions. We're also seeing increased interest in our managed network service offerings, that is, customers who look to us, not only to provide their connectivity, but also to manage their MD and network environment to include monitoring, security and CPE. Additionally, we have a major focus on leveraging our cloud capabilities to enhance our enterprise customers' abilities to turn up and manage both network and hosted workloads in private and dedicated environments. 
Over the last few months, we have refocused on our legacy cloud and managed hosting products as part of our hybrid IT strategy. We recently rolled out an enhancement of our legacy cloud products that seamlessly supports SAP workloads, and we have seen strong customer -- consumer -- customer interest, rather, in this product. 
We're seeing growing interest in managed hosting, legacy, cloud products, as our managed hosting funnel is up almost 60% since August. This funnel of growth is being driven by cross selling across our customer base, including state, government, education and a broad range of Fortune 500 and midsized companies. Finally, we're also seeing good interest in our IT services and data analytics service offerings. Our focus in this area is to provide targeted services to business customers, who are underserved by the traditional larger systems integrators. Although growing rapidly, this business is small in scale today, generating only about $15 [ph] million in revenue this year. But these services -- service offerings give us a good, low capital-intensive opportunities to engage at the CFO level and generate leads in the other parts of our business. This capability to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions, including IT consulting, has led to a number of recent wins for CenturyLink to provide a large portion on pontifications data and IT services for those customers. 
Now continuing on to Slide 7. Turning to the consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets where we have deployed higher broadband speeds and Prism TV services, specifically in our markets with fiber-to-the-prem, and including GPON, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. And because GPON is such a great driver of demand and penetration, we continue to expand our gigabit footprint into the quarter more than 780,000 households and 16 markets that are now fiber-to-the-prem capable. We're also trialing technologies that enable up to 200 megabits over legacy copper networks. This is in the early stages, but it is showing good promise. 
We also expanded our Prism TV service to new and existing markets, adding a total of 360,000 addressable homes in the third quarter. We now have nearly 3 million Prism TV addressable homes, which exceed our expected target for the year as we pull forward some 2016 expansion plans into this year. In addition, we're developing an over-the-top platform and finalizing content agreements to enable our robust and competitive video offering for customers, both within and outside our Prism TV market footprint. And finally, we are focusing on driving improved operating efficiencies through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help drive standardization. We continue our focus on improving back-office process at the systems in an effort to enhance customer experience and realize expenses efficiencies in running the business. 
We mentioned last quarter that we have reduced the provisioning time for one of our major by that approximately 40%, and since that time, we have implemented process and system changes to improve the provisioning time for another major product by 30% to 40%. We'll continue to enhance our efforts in this area as we evolve our back office systems to a more automated approach in the delivery of CenturyLink's products and services. 
In addition, we continue to drive network virtualization through our software-defined networks or SDN product and network function virtualization NFP capabilities. These enhancements allow customers to remotely establish and manage key network services such as virtual firewall, CDN and virtual network services. Our goal is to enable this capacity -- or this capability to 43 data centers and approximately 3.1 million businesses by year-end. 
We've also laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. We're continuing to use a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions across our internal IT operations that we're selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT cost and improve security and drive other efficiencies for us. 
Lastly, we continue to make progress in simplifying our process and streamlining our workflow. Our network inventory consolidation effort, which we have mentioned before, continues to progress well. Additionally, we have implemented an automated sales tool that increased our seller efficiency with anywhere, anytime access to our back office systems. This initiative has also improved our real-time tracking of opportunities associated results. 
Continuing on to Slide 8, I'd also like to briefly comment on the strategic alternative process from our data centers in colocation business operations that are announced today, CenturyLink's Board of Directors and management team regularly review the company's strategy and consider a wide range of opportunities regarding our business and operations to create value for shareholders. We believe we have the right strategy in combining our network service offerings with the delivery of managed IT and cloud-based services, and our enterprise customers are responding well to our managed service offerings. We expect colocation services will continue to be a service our customers will look to us for, but we do not necessarily believe we have to own the data center assets to be effective in the delivery of those services. Therefore, we have engaged financial advisers and we've initiated the process to explore those strategic options for our data center assets and operations, which includes 59 data centers in U.S., Asia and Europe, with more than 185 megawatts of power across 2.6 million square feet of raised four [ph] capacity. The review process will involve a full range of options, including but not limited to, a partnership or joint venture, a sale of all or a portion of the data centers as well as potentially keeping these assets and operations as part of CenturyLink's portfolio. This announcement continues our strategy of proactive portfolio management to drive focus on strategic businesses so we can achieve profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder value. 
Now the process has just commenced, and we will not set a specific -- we have not set a specific timetable for a decision, but we will be updating you on this process as appropriate in the weeks and months ahead. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?"

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter in the conclude my remarks with an overview of fourth quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.  Begi",1069,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter in the conclude my remarks with an overview of fourth quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.  Beginning on Slide 10, I'll review some highlights from our third quarter hose results. I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.55 billion on a consolidated basis, a 9/10 of 1% increase from the third quarter 2014 operating revenues. The increase is primarily due to the incremental $158 million revenue impact from the acceptance and recognition of CAF Phase II funds in the quarter. Our core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.99 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 2.1% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 7/10 of 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength of the digital products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV. In the third quarter, we added approximately 11,300 Prism TV customers. High-speed Internet customers declined about 37,000, partially as the result of tightening our credit and collection processes. As a result of these actions, high-speed Internet and Prism TV that subscriber growth was negatively impacted. However, these adjustments had little impact on revenue and should actually help improve our broadband growth in 2016 due to lower churn. 
We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.78 billion [ph] for the third quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39.1%. Cash expenses were nearly flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower customer premise equipment costs related to lower data integration revenues, which were partially offset by higher employee benefit expenses, Prism TV and other costs. Cash expenses declined $23 million from the second quarter 2015 as we took measures to reduce planned expenses in the second half of the year. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income, was $747 million for the quarter. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.70. As we've discussed on prior and each calls, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. 
Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 9.8 million shares for an investment of $263 million during the quarter. Onto the current program, starting in the second quarter of 2014, we have repurchased 27.5 million shares through November 3 and have approximately $133 million remaining under the repurchase program. 
Moving to Slide 11 and our Business segment. In third quarter, Business segment generated $2.64 billion [ph] in operating revenues, which decreased $137 million or 4.9% from the same period a year ago. Third quarter strategic revenues for the segment decreased 2.1% to $1.6 billion from third quarter a year ago driven by the declines in low-bandwidth data services, wholesale repricing and onetime items, partially offset by continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.1% from third quarter 2014, due primarily to a continuing decline in access lines and lower long-distance revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased from a year-ago period, driven primarily by lower CPE cost, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses. The segment margin of 41.5% declined from 44.1% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue. 
On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue grew $44 million or 6.7% year-over-year compared to third quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. While the growth rate remains solid for high-bandwidth services, it was somewhat dampened by renegotiated pricing for Ethernet backhaul services with a large wholesale data customer, as we discussed with you last quarter. High-bandwidth data services revenue for retail network customers, excluding wholesale, grew approximately 8.6% year-over-year. Our low bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline of $68 million or 11.8% was primarily due to wholesale customers' continued network grooming efforts and the migration to fiber-based services that we have experienced over the past year. We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects. 
Hosting revenues declined $7 million or 2.1% from the prior year, driven by the by higher credit reserves, including those related to service outages and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $6 million, which were partially offset by higher nonrecurring revenue. In the third quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $32 million or 17% compared to third quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales and maintenance revenues. And again, these revenues are fairly low margin. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.51 billion in total operating revenues, an increase of $18 million or 1.2% from third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 7.2% year-over-year to $763 million, driven by a year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and higher average revenue for customer through select price increases and higher-value bundles. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined only 4.2% from third quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $10 million or 1.6% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For the fourth quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.45 billion, core revenues of $3.97 billion to $4.02 billion and operating cash flow between $1.72 billion and $1.77 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.62 to $0.67. Our anticipated sequential decrease in fourth quarter operating revenues and operating cash flow compared to the third quarter results is primarily driven by the retroactive recognition of CAF II funds in the third quarter. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the day, so at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

But even tougher has been kind of trying to line up the margins with these different businesses to figure out what's important?

And part of that is seasonal, just related to the seasonality of the business and the rest of it really relates to CPE and some of the measures that we took to reduce our staff. So again, probably about another $100 million decline from third quarter sequentially in terms of cash operating expenses. In terms of the revenue trends and forecasting of the margins, based on an increase in sales funnel and improving sales trends over the last couple of quarters and our improving sales to revenue or order to cash, we hope to reach -- we expect to reach that revenue stability during the last half of '16. So we believe the pressure we're seeing in the last half of this year in hosting and wholesale will carry forward into the first half of '16, which will make the year-over-year revenue comps during that period somewhat challenging. Again, remember, we have the wholesale renegotiation of our contract to a large customer that will cycle through that after second quarter of next year. But unlike previous years, we don't think next year will be dependent on significant revenue growth for new initiatives to hit the revenue target in the second half of next year. In terms of margins, the margins in the consumer business have been relatively flat and we would hope to keep the margins there relatively flat to slightly down because we'll still see the cycling through of legacy revenue as we drop legacy revenue and replace it with a more strategic revenue such as our Prism TV product. And on the business side, basically, the margins there would expect to see some continued deterioration there due to really the same reasons associated with the loss of legacy revenue and replacing it with the strategic revenues at a lower margin. But we've also done a good shop there of controlling our expenses as well, which hopefully will mitigate some of the margin decline that we otherwise see."

As always, they can always change, but we think the market is good. But that's just one factor. For us to really grow the business, the colo business, is required with the more CapEx that we've been willing to put in the business. We set it up front. But the word invest heavily in the data centers, so we took a synergistic asset that we could grow with the rest of our business. However, with the valuations, with the -- we don't -- we think our cash flow could be used for investments that can drive higher returns, basically, and drive shareholder value. So that's why you we're looking at it. And we' don't think, as I mentioned earlier, that it's crucial for us to own these assets in order to provide a fall solution package for our customers. So that's why we're looking at it now. And as far as of the portfolio, we believe we have a strong portfolio of assets that we can leverage to drive future growth. We don't feel like we are compelled to go out and acquire additional assets or companies, however. We do believe there are some potential acquisitions and organic opportunities there that could drive growth. Whatever we do, continue to utilize our very disciplined approach to acquisitions and be sure that we believe their investments can really drive long-term shareholder value. So either in fiber assets, as it's perhaps drive top line growth that point be synergistic our other offerings such as our managed cloud offerings, our other Network Services that we believe we can grow with them on the head.

260149,312030885,892824,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our third quarter 2015 results and operations, and provide guidance and outlook for the remainder of 2015. Beginning on Slide 5, as you know, CenturyLink continues our transition to b",1886,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our third quarter 2015 results and operations, and provide guidance and outlook for the remainder of 2015. Beginning on Slide 5, as you know, CenturyLink continues our transition to becoming a leading provider of integrated IP-enabled network, hosting and IT services. This transition brings both opportunities and challenges as we work to find ways to provide our customers with product and services they need in today's environment. Faster broadband speeds and hosting solutions are at the top of many of our customers' list of needs. We're deploying GPON to consumer and business customers. We're expanding Prism TV availability and providing competitive enhancements to our network, hosting and cloud services to meet these demands. 
In the third quarter, we saw several positive signs that we are making progress in this transition. First, the consumer segment had a solid quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 1.2% as we continued to deploy the GPON and Prism TV to more locations throughout our footprint. We're attracting more high-valued customers, and we have increased our ARPU through the continued launch of GPON for higher-value bundle sales and select pricing increases. 
Second, the business sales organization realignment, implemented earlier this year, is now proving effective as new sales to business customers for the third quarter increased year-over-year and sequentially. The third quarter marks the second straight quarter of accelerating sales, with particular strength in global and enterprise. Additionally, in our business sector, we exited third quarter with a strong business sales bundle, including an increased number of large deal opportunities. 
You will recall last quarter, we stated that our operating expenses got ahead of our budgets and that we were committed to addressing that during the last half of the year. We're delivering on that commitment as we have taken steps to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $125 million in the second half of 2015. We achieved a portion of this expense reduction relative to plan in the third quarter, but the majority of the benefit will be realized in the fourth quarter of this year. Also we are well on track to lower our full year 2015 planned capital budget by about $200 million, which will result in full year capital expenditures of about $2.8 billion. We're encouraged by these areas, where we're seeing positive momentum. 
However, the overall revenue for our third quarter were below our expectations, primarily due to softness in hosting and long-distance service revenues along with higher credits and other onetime items in the quarter. If you normalize for the onetime items, they total about $20 million to $25 million, operating in core revenues were both at the low end of our quarterly guidance range. Although our third quarter revenue results did not beat our expectations, I'm very confident that we have the assets and the products and the opportunities required to grow our business in the months ahead. 
Now turning to Slide 6. We believe several key priorities will drive the future growth and profitability of our business. The first is to grow business revenues, driven principally by increased market penetration of our network, hosting, cloud and IT solution service offerings. With respect to our business network service offerings, we continue to see strong demand for business wholesale and government customers for high-bandwidth data services such as Ethernet, MPLS and business GPON, and we're investing and aligning our business to take advantage of this opportunity. This quarter, we saw continued strength in our sales momentum. Third quarter 2015 retail network sales were up approximately 15% from the second quarter 2015, and up approximately 25% from the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, we exited the quarter with a strong business sales funnel. The sales funnel has continued to strengthen during the fourth quarter, and October sales results were the highest of the year. 
I want to give you a few examples of what we're doing to drive higher sales over time. As of September 30, we had fiber-to-the-prem, including GPON, available to about 490,000 business locations. There is good demand for this product, and given our relatively low penetration, we believe we have strong upside with those investments. We also continued to enhance other core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP Trunking services, and to add new capabilities to our Managed Office product suite to provide differentiated simplicity for smaller to medium businesses customers looking for fully outsourced network, customer prem equipment, cloud and business application solutions. We're also seeing increased interest in our managed network service offerings, that is, customers who look to us, not only to provide their connectivity, but also to manage their MDN network environment to include monitoring, security and CPE. Additionally, we have a major focus on leveraging our cloud capabilities to enhance our enterprise customers' abilities to turn up and manage both network and hosted workloads in private and dedicated environments. 
Over the last few months, we have refocused on our legacy cloud and managed hosting products as part of our hybrid IT strategy. We recently rolled out an enhancement of our legacy cloud products that seamlessly supports SAP workloads, and we have seen strong customer -- consumer -- customer interest, rather, in this product. 
We're seeing growing interest in managed hosting, legacy, cloud products, as our managed hosting funnel is up almost 60% since August. This funnel growth is being driven by cross selling across our customer base, including state, government, education and a broad range of Fortune 500 and midsized companies. Finally, we're also seeing good interest in our IT services and data analytics service offerings. Our focus in this area is to provide targeted services to business customers, who are underserved by the traditional larger systems integrators. Although growing rapidly, this business is small in scale today, generating only about $50 million in revenue this year. But these services -- service offerings give us a good, low capital-intensive opportunity to engage at the CxO level and generate leads in the other parts of our business. This capability to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions, including IT consulting, has led to a number of recent wins for CenturyLink to provide a large portion on all communications data and IT services for those customers. 
Now continuing on to Slide 7. Turning to the consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets, where we have deployed higher broadband speeds and Prism TV services, specifically in our markets with fiber-to-the-prem and including GPON, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. And because GPON is such a great driver of demand and penetration, we continue to expand our gigabit footprint into the quarter, more than 780,000 households in 16 markets that are now fiber-to-the-prem capable. We're also trialing technologies that enable up to 200 megabits over legacy copper networks. This is in the early stages, but it is showing good promise. 
We also expanded our Prism TV service to new and existing markets, adding a total of 360,000 addressable homes in the third quarter. We now have nearly 3 million Prism TV addressable homes, which exceeds our expected target for the year as we pull forward some 2016 expansion plans into this year. In addition, we're developing an over-the-top platform and finalizing content agreements to enable our robust and competitive video offering for customers, both within and outside our Prism TV market footprint. And finally, we are focusing on driving improved operating efficiencies through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help drive standardization. We continue our focus on improving back-office process and systems in an effort to enhance the customer experience and realize expenses efficiencies in running the business. 
We mentioned last quarter that we had reduced the provisioning time for one of our major products by approximately 40%, and since that time, we've implemented process and system changes to improve the provisioning time for another major product by 30% to 40%. We'll continue to enhance our efforts in this area as we evolve our back-office systems to a more automated approach and the delivery of CenturyLink's products and services. 
In addition, we continue to drive network virtualization through the expansion of our software-defined network or SDN product and network function virtualization, NFV capabilities. These enhancements allow customers to remotely establish and manage key network services such as virtual firewall, CDN and virtual wide area network services. Our goal is to enable this capacity -- or this capability to 43 data centers and approximately 3.1 million businesses by year-end. 
We've also laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. We're continuing to use a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions across our internal IT operations that we're selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT cost and improve security and drive other efficiencies for us. 
Lastly, we continue to make progress in simplifying our process and streamlining our workflow. Our network inventory consolidation effort, which we have mentioned before, continues to progress well. Additionally, we have implemented an automated sales tool that increased our seller efficiency with anywhere, anytime access to our back-office systems. Now, this initiative has also improved our real-time tracking of opportunities and associated results. 
Continuing on to Slide 8, I'd also like to briefly comment on the strategic alternative process for our data centers and co-location business operations that we announced today. CenturyLink's Board of Directors and management team regularly review the company's strategy and consider a wide range of opportunities, regarding our business and operations to create value for shareholders. We believe, we have the right strategy in combining our network service offerings with the delivery of managed IT and cloud-based services, and our enterprise customers are responding well to our managed services offering. We expect co-location services will continue to be a service our customers will look to us for, but we do not necessarily believe we have to own the data center assets to be effective in delivery of those services. Therefore, we have engaged financial advisers, and we've initiated a process to explore the strategic options for our data center assets and operations, which includes 59 data centers in the U.S., Asia and Europe, with more than 185 megawatts of power across 2.6 million square feet of raised for capacity. The review process will involve a full range of options, including but not limited to, a partnership or a joint venture, a sale of all or a portion of the data centers as well as potentially keeping these assets and operations as part of CenturyLink's portfolio. This announcement continues our strategy of proactive portfolio management to drive focus on strategic businesses so that we can achieve profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder value. 
Now the process has just commenced, and we will not set a specific -- we have not set a specific timetable for a decision, but we will be updating you on this process as appropriate in the weeks and months ahead. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?"

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of fourth quarter 2015 guidance, we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Be",1054,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of fourth quarter 2015 guidance, we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Beginning on Slide 10, I'll review some highlights from our third quarter results. I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.55 billion on a consolidated basis, 0.9% increase from third quarter 2014 operating revenues. The increase is primarily due to the incremental $158 million revenue impact from the acceptance and recognition of CAF Phase II funds in the quarter. Our core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.99 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 2.1% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 0.7% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV. In the third quarter, we added approximately 11,300 Prism TV customers. High-speed Internet customers declined about 37,000, partially the result of tightening our credit and collection processes. As a result of these actions, high-speed Internet and Prism TV net subscriber growth was negatively impacted. However, these adjustments had little impact on revenue and should actually help improve our broadband growth in 2016 due to lower churn. 
We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.78 billion for the third quarter, and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39.1%. Cash expenses were nearly flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower customer premise equipment costs related to lower data integration revenues, which were partially offset by higher employee benefit expenses, Prism TV and other costs. Cash expenses declined $23 million from the second quarter 2015 as we took measures to reduce planned expenses in the second half of the year. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income, was $747 million for the quarter. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.70. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. 
Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 9.8 million shares for an investment of $263 million during the quarter. Under the current program, started in the second quarter of 2014, we have repurchased 27.5 million shares through November 3, and have approximately $133 million remaining under the repurchase program. 
Moving to Slide 11 and our Business segment. In third quarter, Business segment generated $2.64 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $137 million or 4.9% from the same period a year ago. Third quarter strategic revenues for the segment decreased 2.1% to $1.6 billion from third quarter a year ago, driven by the declines in low-bandwidth data services, wholesale repricing and onetime items, partially offset by continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.1% from third quarter 2014, due primarily to a continuing decline in access lines and lower long-distance revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower CPE cost, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses. The segment margin of 41.5% declined from 44.1% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue. 
On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue grew $44 million or 6.7% year-over-year compared to third quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. While the growth rate remains solid for high-bandwidth services, it was somewhat dampened by renegotiated pricing for Ethernet backhaul services, with a large wholesale data customer, as we discussed with you last quarter. High-bandwidth data services revenue for retail network customers, excluding wholesale, grew approximately 8.6% year-over-year. Our low bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline of $68 million or 11.8% was primarily due to wholesale customers' continued network grooming efforts and the migration to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects. 
Hosting revenues declined $7 million or 2.1% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher credit reserves, including those related to service outages and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $6 million, which were partially offset by higher nonrecurring revenue. In the third quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $32 million or 17% compared to third quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales and maintenance revenues. And again, these revenues are fairly low margin. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.51 billion in total operating revenues, an increase of $18 million or 1.2% from third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 7.2% year-over-year to $763 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and higher average revenue per customer through select price increases and higher-value bundles. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined only 4.2% from third quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $10 million or 1.6% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For fourth quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.45 billion, core revenues of $3.97 billion to $4.02 billion and operating cash flow between $1.72 billion and $1.77 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.62 to $0.67. Our anticipated sequential decrease in fourth quarter operating revenues and operating cash flow compared to the third quarter results is primarily driven by the retroactive recognition of CAF II funds in the third quarter. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the day, so at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

But even tougher has been kind of trying to line up the margins with these different businesses trying to figure out what's important?

And part of that is seasonal, just related to the seasonality of the business and the rest of it really relates to CPE and some of the measures that we took to reduce our staff. So again, probably about another $100 million decline from third quarter, sequentially in terms of cash operating expenses. In terms of the revenue trends and forecasting of the margins, the -- based on a increasing sales funnel and improving sales trend over the last couple of quarters and our improving sales to revenue or order to cash, we hope to reach -- we expect to reach that revenue stability during the last half of '16. So we believe the pressure we're seeing in the last half of this year in hosting and wholesale will carry forward into the first half of '16, which will make the year-over-year revenue comps during that period somewhat challenging. Again, remember, we have the wholesale renegotiation of a contract to with a large customer that will cycle through after second quarter of next year. But unlike previous years, we don't think next year will be dependent on significant revenue growth for new initiatives to hit the revenue target in the second half of the next year. In terms of margins, the margins in the consumer business have been relatively flat, and we would hope to keep the margins there relatively flat to slightly down as we'll still see the cycling through of legacy revenue as we drop legacy revenue and replace it with a more strategic revenue, such as our Prism TV product. And on the business side, basically, the margins there would expect to see some continued deterioration there due to really the same reasons associated with the loss of legacy revenue and replacing it with the strategic revenues at a lower margin. But we've also done a good job there of controlling our expenses as well, which hopefully will mitigate some of the margin decline that we would otherwise see."

As always, they can always change, but we can feel that the market is good, but that's just one factor. For us to really grow the business, the colo business, it requires really more CapEx and we've been willing to put in the business. We set that up front, that we were going to invest heavily in the data centers, so we felt that were a synergistic asset that we could grow with the rest of our business. However, with the valuations, with the -- we don't -- we think our cash flow maybe could be used for investments that can drive higher returns, basically, and drive better shareholder value, so that's what we're looking at it. And we' don't think, as I mentioned earlier, that it's crucial for us to own these assets in order to provide a full solution package for our customers, so that's why we're looking at it now. And as far as the portfolio, we believe we have a strong portfolio of assets we can leverage to drive future growth. We don't feel like we are compelled to go out and acquire additional assets or companies, however. We do believe there are some potential acquisitions and organic opportunities there that could drive growth. Whatever we do, we'll continue to utilize our very disciplined approach to acquisitions, and be sure that we believe their investments can really drive long-term shareholder value. So then -- there are fiber assets could perhaps drive top line growth that would be synergistic to our other offerings such as our managed cloud offerings, our other Network Services that we believe, we can grow in the months ahead, so those are types of opportunities for acquiring assets we'd be looking at."

260149,312030885,892942,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our third quarter 2015 results and operations, and provide guidance and outlook for the remainder of 2015. Beginning on Slide 5, as you know, CenturyLink continues our transition to b",1883,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our third quarter 2015 results and operations, and provide guidance and outlook for the remainder of 2015. Beginning on Slide 5, as you know, CenturyLink continues our transition to becoming a leading provider of integrated IP-enabled network, hosting and IT services. This transition brings both opportunities and challenges as we work to find ways to provide our customers with product and services they need in today's environment. Faster broadband speeds and hosting solutions are at the top of many of our customers' list of needs. We're deploying GPON to consumer and business customers. We're expanding Prism TV availability and providing competitive enhancements to our network, hosting and cloud services to meet these demands. 
In the third quarter, we saw several positive signs that we are making progress in this transition. First, the consumer segment had a solid quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 1.2% as we continued to deploy the GPON and Prism TV to more locations throughout our footprint. We're attracting more high-valued customers, and we have increased our ARPU through the continued launch of GPON for higher-value bundle sales and select pricing increases.  Second, the business sales organization realignment, implemented earlier this year, is now proving effective as new sales to business customers for the third quarter increased year-over-year and sequentially. The third quarter marks the second straight quarter of accelerating sales, with particular strength in global and enterprise. Additionally, in our business sector, we exited third quarter with a strong business sales funnel, including an increased number of large deal opportunities. 
You will recall last quarter, we stated that our operating expenses got ahead of our budgets and that we were committed to addressing that during the last half of the year. We're delivering on that commitment as we have taken steps to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $125 million in the second half of 2015. We achieved a portion of this expense reduction relative to plan in the third quarter, but the majority of the benefit will be realized in the fourth quarter of this year. Also we are well on track to lower our full year 2015 planned capital budget by about $200 million, which will result in full year capital expenditures of about $2.8 billion. We're encouraged by these areas, where we're seeing positive momentum. 
However, the overall revenue for our third quarter were below our expectations, primarily due to softness in hosting and long-distance service revenues along with higher credits and other onetime items in the quarter. If you normalize for the onetime items, they total about $20 million to $25 million. Operating and core revenues were both at the low end of our quarterly guidance range. Although our third quarter revenue results did not beat our expectations, I'm very confident that we have the assets and the products and the opportunities required to grow our business in the months ahead. 
Now turning to Slide 6. We believe several key priorities will drive the future growth and profitability of our business. The first is to grow business revenues, driven principally by increased market penetration of our network, hosting, cloud and IT solution service offerings. With respect to our business network service offerings, we continue to see strong demand for business wholesale and government customers for high-bandwidth data services such as Ethernet, MPLS and business GPON, and we're investing and aligning our business to take advantage of this opportunity. This quarter, we saw continued strength in our sales momentum. Third quarter 2015 retail network sales were up approximately 15% from second quarter 2015, and up approximately 25% from the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, we exited the quarter with a strong business sales funnel. The sales funnel has continued to strengthen during the fourth quarter, and October sales results were the highest of the year. 
I want to give you a few examples of what we're doing to drive higher sales over time. As of September 30, we had fiber-to-the-prem, including GPON, available to about 490,000 business locations. There is good demand for this product, and given our relatively low penetration, we believe we have strong upside with those investments. We also continued to enhance other core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP Trunking services, and to add new capabilities to our Managed Office product suite to provide differentiated simplicity for small to medium businesses customers looking for fully outsourced network, customer prem equipment, cloud and business application solutions. We're also seeing increased interest in our managed network service offerings, that is, customers who look to us, not only to provide their connectivity, but also to manage their MDN network environment to include monitoring, security and CPE. Additionally, we have a major focus on leveraging our cloud capabilities to enhance our enterprise customers' abilities to turn up and manage both network and hosted workloads in private and dedicated environments. 
Over the last few months, we have refocused on our legacy cloud and managed hosting products as part of our hybrid IT strategy. We recently rolled out an enhancement of our legacy cloud products that seamlessly supports SAP workloads, and we have seen strong customer -- consumer -- customer interest, rather, in this product. 
We're seeing growing interest in managed hosting, legacy, cloud products, as our managed hosting funnel is up almost 60% since August. This funnel growth is being driven by cross selling across our customer base, including state, government, education and a broad range of Fortune 500 and midsized companies. Finally, we're also seeing good interest in our IT services and data analytics service offerings. Our focus in this area is to provide targeted services to business customers, who are underserved by the traditional larger systems integrators. Although growing rapidly, this business is small in scale today, generating only about $50 million in revenue this year. But these service offerings give us a good, low capital-intensive opportunity to engage at the CxO level and generate leads in the other parts of our business. This capability to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions, including IT consulting, has led to a number of recent wins for CenturyLink to provide a large portion or all communications data and IT services for those customers. 
Now continuing on to Slide 7. Turning to the consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets, where we have deployed higher broadband speeds and Prism TV services. Specifically in our markets with fiber-to-the-prem and including GPON, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. And because GPON is such a great driver of demand and penetration, we continue to expand our gigabit footprint into the quarter, more than 780,000 households in 16 markets that are now fiber-to-the-prem capable. We're also trialing technologies that enable up to 200 megabits over legacy copper networks. Now this is in the early stages, but it is showing good promise. 
We also expanded our Prism TV service to new and existing markets, adding a total of 360,000 addressable homes in the third quarter. We now have nearly 3 million Prism TV addressable homes, which exceeds our expected target for the year as we pull forward some 2016 expansion plans into this year. In addition, we're developing an over-the-top platform and finalizing content agreements to enable our robust and competitive video offering for customers, both within and outside our Prism TV market footprint. And finally, we are focusing on driving improved operating efficiencies through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help drive standardization. We continue our focus on improving back-office process and systems in an effort to enhance the customer experience and realize expense efficiencies in running the business. 
We mentioned last quarter that we had reduced the provisioning time for one of our major products by approximately 40%, and since that time, we've implemented process and system changes to improve the provisioning time for another major product by 30% to 40%. We'll continue to enhance our efforts in this area as we evolve our back-office systems to a more automated approach in the delivery of CenturyLink's products and services.  In addition, we continue to drive network virtualization through the expansion of our software-defined network or SDN product and network function virtualization, NFV capabilities. These enhancements allow customers to remotely establish and manage key network services such as virtual firewall, CDN and virtual wide area network services. Our goal is to enable this capacity -- or this capability to 43 data centers and approximately 3.1 million businesses by year-end. 
We've also laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. We're continuing to use a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solution across our internal IT operations that we're selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT cost and improve security and drive other efficiencies for us.  Lastly, we continue to make progress in simplifying our processes and streamlining our workflow. Our network inventory consolidation effort, which we have mentioned before, continues to progress well. Additionally, we have implemented an automated sales tool that increased our seller efficiency with anywhere, anytime access to our back-office systems. This initiative has also improved our real-time tracking of opportunities and associated results. 
Continuing on to Slide 8, I'd also like to briefly comment on the strategic alternative process for our data centers and co-location business operations that we announced today. CenturyLink's Board of Directors and management team regularly review the company's strategy and consider a wide range of opportunities, regarding our business and operations to create value for shareholders. We believe, we have the right strategy in combining our network service offerings with the delivery of managed IT and cloud-based services, and our enterprise customers are responding well to our managed services offering. 
We expect co-location services will continue to be a service our customers will look to us for, but we do not necessarily believe we have to own the data center assets to be effective in delivery of those services. Therefore, we have engaged financial advisers, and we've initiated a process to explore the strategic options for our data center assets and operations, which includes 59 data centers in the U.S., Asia and Europe, with more than 185 megawatts of power across 2.6 million square feet of raised for capacity. The review process will involve a full range of options, including but not limited to, a partnership or a joint venture, a sale of all or a portion of the data centers as well as potentially keeping these assets and operations as part of CenturyLink's portfolio. This announcement continues our strategy of proactive portfolio management to drive focus on strategic businesses so that we can achieve profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder value.  Now the process has just commenced, and we will not set a specific -- we have not set a specific timetable for a decision, but we will be updating you on this process as appropriate in the weeks and months ahead. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?"

I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of fourth quarter 2015 guidance, we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Be",1054,"Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of fourth quarter 2015 guidance, we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Beginning on Slide 10, I'll review some highlights from our third quarter results. I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Operating revenues were $4.55 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.9% increase from third quarter 2014 operating revenues. The increase is primarily due to the incremental $158 million revenue impact from the acceptance and recognition of CAF Phase II funds in the quarter. Our core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.99 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 2.1% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 0.7% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV. In the third quarter, we added approximately 11,300 Prism TV customers. High-speed Internet customers declined about 37,000, partially the result of tightening our credit and collection processes. As a result of these actions, high-speed Internet and Prism TV net subscriber growth was negatively impacted. However, these adjustments had little impact on revenue and should actually help improve our broadband growth in 2016 due to lower churn. 
We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.78 billion for the third quarter, and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39.1%. Cash expenses were nearly flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower customer premise equipment costs related to lower data integration revenues, which were partially offset by higher employee benefit expenses, Prism TV and other costs. Cash expenses declined $23 million from the second quarter 2015 as we took measures to reduce planned expenses in the second half of the year. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income, was $747 million for the quarter. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.70. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules.  Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 9.8 million shares for an investment of $263 million during the quarter. Under the current program, started in the second quarter of 2014, we have repurchased 27.5 million shares through November 3, and have approximately $133 million remaining under the repurchase program. 
Moving to Slide 11 and our Business segment. In third quarter, Business segment generated $2.64 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $137 million or 4.9% from the same period a year ago. Third quarter strategic revenues for the segment decreased 2.1% to $1.6 billion from third quarter a year ago, driven by the declines in low-bandwidth data services, wholesale repricing and onetime items, partially offset by continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.1% from third quarter 2014, due primarily to a continuing decline in access lines and lower long-distance revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower CPE cost, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses. The segment margin of 41.5% declined from 44.1% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment, legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue. 
On Slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue grew $44 million or 6.7% year-over-year compared to third quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. While the growth rate remains solid for high-bandwidth services, it was somewhat dampened by renegotiated pricing for Ethernet backhaul services, with a large wholesale data customer, as we discussed with you last quarter. High-bandwidth data services revenue for retail network customers, excluding wholesale, grew approximately 8.6% year-over-year. Our low bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline of $68 million or 11.8% was primarily due to wholesale customers' continued network grooming efforts and the migration to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects. 
Hosting revenues declined $7 million or 2.1% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher credit reserves, including those related to service outages and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $6 million, which were partially offset by higher nonrecurring revenue. In the third quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $32 million or 17% compared to third quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales and maintenance revenues. And again, these revenues are fairly low margin. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.51 billion in total operating revenues, an increase of $18 million or 1.2% from third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 7.2% year-over-year to $763 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and higher average revenue per customer through select price increases and higher-value bundles. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined only 4.2% from third quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $10 million or 1.6% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For fourth quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.45 billion, core revenues of $3.97 billion to $4.02 billion and operating cash flow between $1.72 billion and $1.77 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.62 to $0.67. Our anticipated sequential decrease in fourth quarter operating revenues and operating cash flow compared to third quarter results is primarily driven by the retroactive recognition of CAF II funds in the third quarter. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the day, so at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

But even tougher has been kind of trying to line up the margins with these different businesses trying to figure out what's important.

And part of that is seasonal, just related to the seasonality of the business and the rest of it really relates to CPE and some of the measures that we took to reduce our staff. So again, probably about another $100 million decline from third quarter, sequentially in terms of cash operating expenses. In terms of the revenue trends and forecasting of the margins, the -- based on an increasing sales funnel and improving sales trend over the last couple of quarters and our improving sales to revenue or order to cash, we hope to reach -- we expect to reach revenue stability during the last half of '16. So we believe the pressure we're seeing in the last half of this year in hosting and wholesale will carry forward into the first half of '16, which will make the year-over-year revenue comps during that period somewhat challenging. Again, remember, we had the wholesale renegotiation of a contract too with a large customer that will cycle through after second quarter of next year. But unlike previous years, we don't think next year will be dependent on significant revenue growth from new initiatives to hit the revenue target in the second half of the next year. In terms of margins, the margins in the consumer business have been relatively flat, and we would hope to keep the margins there relatively flat to slightly down as we'll still see the cycling through of legacy revenue as we drop legacy revenue and replace it with more strategic revenue, such as our Prism TV product. And on the business side, basically, the margins there, we'd expect to see some continued deterioration there due to really the same reasons associated with the loss of legacy revenue and replacing it with the strategic revenues at a lower margin.

Can you provide us with a bit more color in terms of why do you believe this is the opportune time right now to monetize sort of the co-location services business? I would suspect that given the demand environment, there is healthy demand for those types of services, so would love to hear sort of your thought process on why this is the opportune time. And I recognize that thinking about sort of specifics around what you could do with that capital building, on David's prior question, it's probably a bit early stage right now. But as you look at your portfolio of assets today, how do you feel about the portfolio asset in terms of the growth opportunities? Because clearly, within the portfolio, there are some key growth opportunities, and how we should think about whether or not there's a potential opportunity to bolt-on additional assets, or anything along those lines in order to accelerate growth towards your strategic services?"

That's -- they can always change, but we can know that the market is good, but that's just one factor. For us to really grow the business, the colo business, it requires really more CapEx than we've been willing to put in the business. We said that up front, that we weren't going to invest heavily in the data centers, that we felt they were a synergistic asset that we could grow with the rest of our business. However, with the valuations, with the -- we don't -- we think our free -- cash float maybe could be used for investments that can drive higher returns, basically, and drive better shareholder value, so that's why we're looking at it. And we don't think, as I mentioned earlier, that it's crucial for us to own these assets in order to provide a full solution package for our customers, so that's why we're looking at it now. And as far as the asset portfolio, we believe we have a strong portfolio of assets we can leverage to drive future growth. We don't feel like we are compelled to go out and acquire additional assets or companies, however. We do believe there are some potential acquisitions and organic opportunities there that could drive growth. Whatever we do, we'll continue to utilize our very disciplined approach to acquisitions, and be sure that we believe their investments can really drive long-term shareholder value. So these -- they're fiber assets, assets could perhaps drive top line growth that would be synergistic to our other offerings such as our managed cloud offerings, our other Network Services that we believe, we can grow in the months ahead, so those are types of opportunities for acquiring assets we'd be looking at."
