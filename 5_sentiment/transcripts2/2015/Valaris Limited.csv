269488,283133384,771130,"Ensco plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further towards the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most of announced s",1244,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further towards the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most of announced significant CapEx cut and the severe falloff in customer demand is unprecedented compared to what we've seen in prior cycles. These market developments drove the goodwill and asset impairments we recorded in fourth quarter 2014, and will, also, affect our decision to reduce our quarterly dividend. Reducing our quarterly dividend will give us greater capital management flexibility to navigate a more challenging market environment. In addition, we have already began a process of implementing plans that will structurally reduce contract drilling and general and administrative expenses. Jay will discuss in greater detail, but let me give you the high points. First, as part of our continuous fleet hydrating, we placed 4 additional rigs into discontinued operations. Cold stacking rigs, no longer in our go-forward fleet, will reduce cost associated with these rigs. Similarly, several of our rigs in our go-forward fleet are currently being cold stacked to rapidly reduce expenses, such as 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, noted in our last Fleet Status Report. In addition to these rigs, we've decided to cold stack ENSCO 8502, with the possibility that we stack an additional 8500 Series rig if we do not see sufficient market opportunities. We expect ENSCO 8502 will be cold stacked by the middle of this year. This decision is not related to the capability of these rigs, which have an excellent track record, rather it is a reflection of having 6 out of 7 these rigs rolling off contract by year end and having to compete with more than 40 of the 6 Gen that are idle, rolling off contract in 2015 are being delivered this year from a shipyard. There will be upfront cost of property place rigs into cold stacked status, but we believe the savings will outweigh the upfront stacking costs for these rigs that have limited near-term contracting opportunities. We will return these rigs to the active fleet when we are able to sign term contract at a favorable day rate.
In terms of compensation expense, we have reevaluated premiums that we put in place for offshore employees joining the market up cycle. Based on this review, we've decided to reduce discretionary compensation for offshore personnel. This will result in a meaningful decline in unit labor cost for offshore personnel in 2015 compared to 2014. As the size of our actively marketed rig fleet has decreased, we have decided that it is also the appropriate to streamline onshore support, including corporate staff, to better align the size of the current marketed feet.
Last week, we implemented a reduction in force of onshore personnel that will achieve approximately $27 million of annualized savings, beginning in the second quarter of this year. Finally, we are negotiating with our vendors and suppliers to reduce costs, while maintaining service quality. As we've said in the past, there is much happening in the market that we cannot control, but we will be aggressive about actions we can control, and not include freight structure and cost. As we have described, we are proactively addressing the cost side of our business though that we are well situated to capitalize on the eventual upturn in the market.
We do not anticipate an improvement in the market in the near term, and as such, our approach will be to stack rigs, which come up contract and no follow-on work, thereby reducing the size of our actively marketed fleet in the near term. As we look at the risk reward dynamics, we believe the steps we are taking to streamline cost and preserve are the most prudent, will eventually prove to be the best option.
Now, I will provide a brief review of fourth quarter results and recap some full year 2014 highlights. Excluding impairment charges and discrete and other nonrecurring tax items during the fourth quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.68. Our marketing teams did an excellent job contracting rigs during the fourth quarter, especially in light of visible marketing conditions, signing contracts for several jackups and a multiyear term for one of our floaters.
During 2014, we continued our fleet hydrating strategy by adding 3 ENSCO 120 series newbuild jackups. Each of these newbuild jackups has had exceptional uptime performance since commencing their initial contracts over the past year. The other component of our hydrating strategy is to sell less capable assets. And during 2014, we sold 7 jackups and 1 floater. The sale of these rigs coupled with our decision to sell additional floaters and jackups, now classified as discontinued operations, reimposes our strategy of staying ahead of the curve in terms of fleet management.
By doing so, we ensure high levels of safety and operational uptime performance. During 2014, our offshore crews and onshore personnel achieved a new safety record in terms of our total recordable incident rate and improved fleet uptime performance. These results contributed to Ensco recently earning the number 1 rating in total customer satisfaction. Our fifth consecutive year to earn this distinction. In addition, to our number 1 rating in total customer satisfaction, ENSCO 19 and other categories, including safety and environment, technology, deepwater drilling and shelf wells. These exceptional results, such a challenging market, reflect the quality of our systems, our fleet and our offshore cruise around the world, and our real differentiator and a challenging contracting environment. In terms of capital management, we've raised $1.25 billion of new capital through a debt offering and increased the amount of our revolver to $2.25 billion in September of last year.
We believe that debt raise was an appropriate step given our upcoming usage of capital, including capital commitments and debt maturities over the next 2 years. By increasing our liquidity, reducing our quarterly dividend and decreasing expenses, we will enhance our capital management flexibility during the market downturn. The market conditions to bottom and start to recover, we need to see some key actions. We cannot simply rely on our price recovery. The cost need to be driven out of the whole system and rig supply need to be reduced. We are encouraged to see that the rates of rig retirements has increased significantly, and there's some moderation in the marketed rig supply as additional assets are being stacked and newbuild are being deferred. What needs to happen, and we will continue to be provide to.
Before I hand the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Ensco's founding CEO, Karl Stone, earlier this year. Many of you knew Karl from watch and grew Ensco from a small regional company into a major global offshore company. We are indicted to Karl for his entrepreneurial courage, taking on the challenge of starting a new drilling company in the debts of the market downturn, not like that the one we're experiencing today. When I joined Ensco, one of the factors that attracted me to the company is the strength of the culture and the commitment to upload the series of core values that will forged in the Karl's leadership and our essential to Ensco to this day. As we face this period of uncertainty, we'll increasingly rely on those core values.
Now I'll turn the call over to David."

First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call, before I provide additional color on the markets.

First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call, before I provide additional color on the markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we signed ENSCO 8503 to a multiyear contract with the repeat customer to drill in both DP and lower capacity. Addressing the customer needs to drill in both deep and mid wter debts. The rig has scheduled to commence this new contract in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this rig has the record for the deepest well ever drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. On the jackup upside, we signed a 9-month contract for ENSCO 68, earning additional work based on the rig's strong operating and safety track record.
In West Africa, we contracted ENSCO 109 for a 3-year terms. The rig has commenced operations ahead of schedule after mobilizing from Singapore with excellent uptime performance.
Moving to the Middle East. We secured extensions for 4 of our existing jackups. While market conditions have become more challenging, these contract awards show that we've earned more than our fair share of new business recently. Contracting has, certainly, become more difficult. But I believe Ensco's strength give us a competitive advantage as new contracting opportunities arise, even though they may be few and far between in the current environment.
Customers recently ranked us number 1 in customer satisfaction for the fifth consecutive year, including a number 1 ranking in safety. We are honored by this recognition and know that this competitive advantage is most important during the downturn. The challenges of the current market environment are well known, and some customers have shorter terms where contracts allow it, while others are attempting to negotiate concessions.
As we have in the past, Ensco will act to protect its contract backlog and only entertain negotiations with customers where new terms are mutually beneficial. Since we have a lot to cover on this earnings call, rather than go market-by-market around the world in terms of customer demand, let me just say that we are actively pursuing virtually every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jackups. In terms of the supply decide, looking at the worldwide order book for floaters, approximately 30 new rigs will be delivered before the end of 2015 of which roughly half are contracted.
Ensco's next 2 drillship delivers ENSCO DS-8 and ENSCO DS-9 are among these contracted rigs and we expect to commence their initial contracts in the second half of this year. For competitive jackups, the newbuild order book shows approximately 60 to be delivered by year end 2015. The vast majority of which are uncontracted. More than half of the uncontacted newbuild jackup deliveries scheduled for 2015 are with companies that do not currently operate a rig. So it remains to be seen how many of these units will end up entering the global drilling supply. Many offshore drillers with uncontracted newbuild rigs likely will continue to postpone deliveries in an effort to delay final milestone CapEx payments, thereby pushing out new supply.
We have already seen deferrals and delays of new floaters and jackups, originally scheduled to be delivered during 2015. while we may choose to delay future rig deliveries, we are in active discussions with customers for ENSCO 110, jackup and ENSCO DS-10, and ultra deepwater drill ship scheduled for delivery later this year.
Overall, supply and demand dynamics will be aided by the retirement and stacking of both floaters and jackups. We expect that offshore drillers will continue to retire uncontracted rigs to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn. Since September, offshore drillers have announced the retirement of 23 floaters. Over the same time period, an additional 12 floaters have been cold stacked, and we believe that the majority will end up being retired from the global supply due to the costly nature to reactivate these older rigs. These 35 rigs represent approximately 12% of competitive global supply.
In 2015, 40 floaters that are 30 years of age or older, will see their current contracts expire. All of the likely candidates for stacking and/or scrapping. And as a group, they are greater in number than the new supply of roughly 30 floaters scheduled to enter the market by year end. We anticipate the stacking and our scrapping trend will continue into 2016, with these reductions to global supply helping to better balance floater supply and demand.
Similarly, on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Approximately 80 competitive jackups that are 30 years of age or older have contracts that expire in 2015. At this time, another 40 jackups that are older than 30 years of age or idle and do not have any future contracted work. Major regulatory surveys to recertify older rigs, which must take place every fifth year can be very expensive and involve tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. In a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller undercapitalized drillers, these rigs may be stacked and/or retired. Over the next year, our marketing teams are focused on winning as many as contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging and score differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record and our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel.
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."
269488,283133384,771130,"Ensco plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, David. Today, I will start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then, I would wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, sev",1640,"Thanks, David. Today, I will start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then, I would wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, several items impacted fourth quarter results including a non-cash goodwill impairment of $3 billion, non-cash asset impairments totaling $925 million, $56 million of favorable discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, primarily, related to foreign tax credits, and the reclassification of the 4 rigs in the discontinued operations.
Let me quickly remind everyone about how discontinued operations and held-for-sale status works. In order to put a rig into held-for-sale status they must have a clear plan to sell the rig that has been approved by management and/or board. Once the held-for-sale criteria are met, the rig's current period and historical operating results are reclassified into discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. All future operating results are, also, presented in discontinued operations, so that all period-to-period comparisons are on an equivalent basis.
In general, we focus our conference call comments on continuing operations. We are appropriate and we may adjust prior guidance to reflect this continued operations accounting treatment. Having offered all of that explanation, I should mention that discontinued operations accounting rules change in 2015. So any rigs that we decide to sell in the future will remain in continuing operations.
Excluding noncash goodwill and asset impairments as well as discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations were $1.68 per share. Cash flow from operations were $546 million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. Total fourth quarter revenue increased 2% to $1.16 billion from a year ago. Adjusted for rigs that were reclassified into discontinued operations, revenue was 2% lower than our prior guidance of $1.19 billion due to unplanned floater downtime. Floater segment revenue declined 5% to $663 million versus prior year due to lower reported utilization and average day rate, which more than offset a full quarter of operations for DS-7 compared to a partial quarter last year. The average day rate for our floaters decreased 6% to $429,000, and reported floater utilization declined to 81% versus 82% a year ago. Jackup segment revenue grew 6% to $454 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and 122 to the active fleet. These rigs contributed to a $17,000 increase in the average jackup day rate to $147,000. Reported utilization for the jackup fleet was 88% for the fourth quarter 2014 compared to 94% a year ago, primarily, due to fewer contracted days in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Fourth quarter total contract drilling expense increased to $514 million from $500 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including overcompensation and insurance cost, partially offset $33 million of operating cost for 4 newbuilds.
Depreciation expense for continuing operations increased $11 million to $139 million in line with our expectations due to our growing active fleet. General and administrative expenses for the quarter was $28 million, also, in line with our outlook, and $7 million less than a year ago, primarily, due to lower discretionary compensation. Interest expense increased to $52 million as expected due to our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014.
So now let's turn to outlook for the first quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline slightly from fourth quarter levels of $1.16 billion due to more contracted rig days. This is partially offset by the commencement of ENSCO 5006 following a major upgrade and a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 109 and ENSCO 122. We anticipate first quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 6% from $514 million in the fourth quarter, primarily, due to more operating days for ENSCO 50006, 109 and 122, and approximately $8 million of expenses to cold stacked rigs. Savings from onshore headcount reductions affected in mid-February will largely offset $4 million of severance and related cost in the first quarter.
We expect first quarter G&A expenses to be relatively in line with fourth quarter, as the benefit of our reduction in force offsets $1 million in severance cost for corporate staff. Depreciation expense should be approximately in line with fourth quarter levels of $139 million. Other expense is estimated to be $48 million in the first quarter, comprised of $51 million of interest expense and about $3 million of interest income.
Now let's move to our outlook for full year 2015. Approximately 75% of our floater with days and 55% of our jackup rig days are contracted for 2015. This translates into contracted revenue backlog of $3.9 billion for 2015, excluding bonuses. This amount does not reflect several factors that could add or subtract to the final result. Such as, signing new contracts and extending current contracts, bonuses for operational performance above certain levels, unplanned downtime, contract amendments that may extend terms into future periods, but reduce day rates in the near term, and early termination of contracts. Given the current lack of visibility in terms of customer demand in our sector and the number of contract rollovers we have in 2015, we won't be giving a specific outlook for full year revenues. For the same reason, we, also, won't be giving a detail outlook for total contract drilling expense, because we intend to manage expenses in line with our revenues to the maximum extent possible. We will, however, provide some of the factors include influencing 2015 contract drilling expenses. First, additions to the fleet are expected to increase contract drilling expense by approximately $155 million year-to-year and this breaks down as follows. $85 million as several rigs have returned to the active fleet following shipyard upgrades during 2014, $35 million for the full year impact of the 3 ENSCO 120 Series that commenced their initial contract in 2014, and $35 million for newbuilds commencing initial contracts in 2015.
As noted in our press release, we are taking aggressive steps to reduce our expense base. First, we have continued to high grade our fleet. Second, we are currently expediting the cold stacked of 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to reduce expenses. Daily cash savings achieved by cold stacking these rigs on average will be approximately $40,000 beginning in May. As Karl mentioned, we plan to stack ENSCO 8502. We estimate the upfront cost to cold stack an 8500 Series rig will be approximately $12 million, and we expect to incur approximately $7 million of this amount in the first quarter of 2015, and the remaining $5 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Cash cost for a cold stack 8500 Series rig will be less than $10,000 per day. So cash savings achieved by cold stacking this rig will be approximately $120,000 per day beginning midyear when cold stacking is completed. We've implemented a number of discretionary compensation reductions and expect offshore unit labor cost to decline by approximately 9% on average from 2014 levels, beginning in the second quarter of 2015.
This will translate into meaningful cost saving since 48% of Ensco's 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 billion was offshore compensation. Last week, we, also, reduced our onshore personnel by 15%. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is estimated to be $27 million beginning in second quarter of 2015. $22 million of this amount will be in contract drilling expense and $5 million will be in G&A. For full year 2015, G&A expense is anticipated to decrease approximately 10% from $132 million in 2014.
Depreciation is expected to increase to approximately $575 million, primarily, due to the addition of newbuild rigs, partially, offset by lower depreciation for rigs impaired during 2014 that now had over carrying values. As a result of our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014, interest expense is estimated to be approximately $180 million compared to $161 million last year. We expect interest income for the year of approximately $7 million due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade cost. The 2015 effective tax rate should be approximately 18% based on our current fleet composition and geographic positioning. 2015 capital spending is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion. This includes $1.6 billion and newbuild CapEx plus $250 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than half of our 2015 guidance.
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. As of December 31, we had $9.7 billion in revenue backlog based on existing contracts in place, $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, and a total debt-to-capital ratio of 42%.
In conclusion, I'd like to reinforce some of Karl's comments with respect to cost control. We are clearly in an uncertain environment and demands immediate action in terms of expense reduction and cash management. We began taking proactive steps in the second quarter of last year, and I hope everyone takes away from the call today that we have, significantly, ramped up an already aggressive expense and cash management program. We have had a very short period of time taking considerable cost out of the system both onshore and offshore. We will continue to drive cost out of the system over the course of the coming year, by attacking every element of cost and managing cash outflows wherever possible. We see expense control and cash management as an ongoing imperative for the foreseeable future. We do not see our actions as early as bidding us to recovery. We are focused on sustainable cost reduction that will allow us to be even more competitive when the inevitable up cycle arrives.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Sean."

There's the whole series of issues come up in this decision and reasons why we've done it. If I go back to the prepared comments, one of the first things that really came into our decision-making process was the rapid deterioration we saw in the market conditions as we went through the end of Q4. But even at that time, we had a relatively a pay-per-view model that clients were going to do, what our customers are going to do in 2015, and a little bit into '16. And as we came to the end of the quarter, and really, over the last 4 to 8 weeks, we had a chance to be able to now see some of those announcements, and actually, sit with most of our customers and really see what the demand outlook was in that drilling plans were going to be. We're very much focused on not just '15, but going through into '16. And so we've really tried to look at the company in terms of where we want to be 1 to 2 years down the line, not just today. We looked at several things. The first was the risk and opportunities involved in an extended market downturn. And from that, we decided that increase liquidity and the flexibility for our capital management was something we wanted to do earlier rather than later. One to manage the risk, but also, to be able to be in a position take opportunities as they came, and we felt they were appropriate. The second is that we wish to maintain our credit rating. And thirdly, we still wish to maintain to pay a meaningful dividends that was comparable to other SMP companies, but to give us more flexibility and what is quite clearly going to be a multiyear down cycle."

We very much, clearly, see these rigs as part of our go-forward rate. And there's a very clear distinction on our mind about the fleet structure that we wish to have in the long term. So there are some rigs that when we stack them out and we clearly identify some of those already and held-for-sale, have no place in our go-forward plan. But there are rigs, such as 8500, which -- and 8502, which we may decide to stack, but we intend ot bring back. Now on the 8502, the decision has been taken largely take because we just find ourselves with 6 of those 7 rigs coming off contract. And certainly, in the Gulf of Mexico we're competing against ourselves as well as other sixth generation rigs. But particularly, 8500 is competing against themselves for the same type and class of work. So we've just been very pragmatic about that. When we look at the overall utilization, we expect on all of those rigs over the next year or so, and decided that we will take action. Now with respect to the hybrid upgrades that we planned, we still, certainly, going to go ahead on 1 and, probably, 2 of those rigs. We were considering a third one and that's still an option for us. And we will review that as we see the second half of the year materialize. We will likely take the opportunity once the rigs are stacked to do some additional work and to look our whether there's modifications we want to do once that stack. But it is our intention to bring them back when we fill the market to support them."

It will, partially, depend on how long it's been stacked. And exactly, how we do it. And the reason I say that, is we're looking at very detailed plan, but actually, removing some key equipment off the rig to put it in firmly in controlled environment to be able to ease the return of the rate you can exactly how much we give it, governorates it's cause the return.

We do have a few customers who are looking at whether they are going to really terminate are not. And so there are to some great or lesser degree various conversations happening like that. Now specifically, we have only received 2 formal notifications termination, which are included in our last fleet status report, which is 2 jackups in Asia. And we, also, had 1 rig in the North Sea, which didn't move to next contract, because it was outside the window to stop, because the previous contract run on drilling operations longer than the window to start.

And very much on, also, considerations on the stacking cost. So there isn't a hard and fast recontracting rate. I think, what we have made clear is our view on this market, isn't 1 way you just sit back and hope everything is going to be fine. And rely on just a bounce back in the oil price in the near term in hedge 2 to bring everything back to balance. We, clearly, will take our client's time even in a higher oil price environment, just budgets and react to a better oil price that they can be make sure of. And secondly, we have a structural overhanging in the rig capacity that has to clear out. So our review is that we'll make a cold, hard rational decision when we see rigs that don't have enough utility ongoing to justify the cost, because what we don't want to get into is, basically, cost lead, cash lead, by just we're thinking. Because when we reduce stack out the rigs, which we've already done, allows us to very drastically bring down cost and expenses."

So it's, certainly, from, I think, the rest of the management team, certainly, my experience this has been a much more rapid and aggressive falloff to the recession is happened in the down cycles in the 2000, which actually, didn't fall off as fast and came back relatively quarter. So that's one, and that really is not only taken us by surprise, it's taken a large part of the second -- the industry by surprise. And the other one, of course, the offshore drilling sector is facing, is the affect of the increase in supply over the past few years, which is, again, different from 2007, 2008, '09, and also, from condo in 2010. So we have the very marked downturn in capital expenditure happening just exactly the time all the newbuilds are arriving and those 2 compounding each other. And that's why, we believe that this is  down cycle, it's going to take a couple of years to play out. And that's why, we believe, that taking strong and early action is required."

Most of announced s",1258,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further towards the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most of announced significant CapEx cuts and the severe fall-off in customer demand is unprecedented compared to what we've seen in prior cycles. These market developments drove the goodwill and asset impairments we recorded in fourth quarter 2014 and were also a factor in our decision to reduce our quarterly dividend. Reducing our quarterly dividend would give us greater capital management flexibility to navigate a more challenging market environment. In addition, we have already began a process of implementing plans that will structurally reduce contract drilling and general and administrative expenses. Jay will discuss this in greater detail, but let me give you the high points. 
First, as part of our continuous fleet hydrating, we placed 4 additional rigs into discontinued operations. Cold stacking rigs, no longer in our go-forward fleet, will reduce cost associated with these rigs. Similarly, several of our rigs in our go-forward fleet are currently being cold stacked to rapidly reduce expenses, such as 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico noted in our last Fleet Status Report. In addition to these rigs, we've decided to cold stack ENSCO 8502, with the possibility that we stack an additional 8500 Series rig if we do not see sufficient market opportunities. We expect ENSCO 8502 will be fully cold stacked by the middle of this year. This decision is not related to the capability of these rigs, which have an excellent track record, rather it is a reflection of having 6 out of 7 these rigs rolling off contract by year end and having to compete with more than 40 of the 6 Gen floaters that are either idle, rolling off contract in 2015 or being delivered this year from a shipyard. There will be upfront costs to properly place rigs into cold stacked status, but we believe the savings will outweigh the upfront stacking costs for these rigs that have limited near-term contracting opportunities. We will return these rigs to the active fleet when we are able to sign termed contract at a favorable day rate.
In terms of compensation expense, we have reevaluated premiums that we put in place for offshore employees joining the market up cycle. Based on this review, we've decided to reduce discretionary compensation for offshore personnel. This will result in a meaningful decline in unit labor cost for offshore personnel in 2015 compared to 2014. As the size of our actively marketed rig fleet has decreased, we have decided that it is also appropriate to streamline onshore support functions, including corporate staff, to better align with the size of our current marketed feet.
Last week, we implemented a reduction in force for onshore personnel that will achieve approximately $27 million of annualized savings, beginning in the second quarter of this year. Finally, we are negotiating with our vendors and suppliers to reduce costs while maintaining service quality. As we've said in the past, there is much happening in the market that we cannot control, but we will be aggressive about actions we can control and that include split structure and costs. As we have described, we are proactively addressing the cost side of our business though that we are well situated to capitalize on the eventual upturn in the market.
We do not anticipate an improvement in the market in the near term, and as such, our approach will be to stack rigs, which come up contract and have no follow-on work, thereby reducing the size of our actively marketed fleet in the near term. As we look at the risk reward dynamics, we believe the steps we are taking to streamline cost and preserve capital are the most prudent and will eventually prove to be the best option.
Now I will provide a brief review of fourth quarter results and recap some full year 2014 highlights. Excluding impairment charges and discrete and other nonrecurring tax items during the fourth quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.68. Our marketing teams did an excellent job contracting rigs during the fourth quarter, especially in light of difficult marketing conditions, signing contracts for several jackups and a multiyear term for one of our floaters.
During 2014, we continued our fleet high-grading strategy by adding 3 ENSCO 120 Series newbuild jackups. Each of these newbuild jackups has had exceptional uptime performance since commencing their initial contracts over the past year. The other component of our high-grading strategy is to sell less capable assets. And during 2014, we sold 7 jackups and 1 floater. The sale of these rigs, coupled with our decision to sell additional floaters and jackups now classified as discontinued operations, reimposes our strategy of staying ahead of the curve in terms of fleet management.
By doing so, we ensure high levels of safety and operational uptime performance. During 2014, our offshore crews and onshore personnel achieved a new safety record in terms of our total recordable incident rate and improved up -- fleet uptime performance. These results contributed to Ensco recently earning the #1 rating in total customer satisfaction, our fifth consecutive year to earn this distinction. 
In addition, to our #1 rating in total customer satisfaction, ENSCO won 9 other categories, including safety and environment, technology, deepwater drilling and shelf wells. These exceptional results in such a challenging market reflect the quality of our systems, our fleet and our offshore cruise around the world and are a real differentiator in a challenging contracting environment. In terms of capital management, we've raised $1.25 billion of new capital through a debt offering and increased the amount of our revolver to $2.25 billion in September of last year.
We believe the debt raise was an appropriate step given our upcoming usage of capital, including capital commitments and debt maturities over the next 2 years. By increasing our liquidity, reducing our quarterly dividend and decreasing expenses, we will enhance our capital management flexibility during the market downturn. 
For market conditions to bottom and start to recover, we need to see some key actions. We cannot simply rely on an oil price recovery. Costs need to be driven out of the whole system and rig supply need to be reduced. We are encouraged to see that the rate of rig retirements has increased significantly, and there is some moderation in the marketed rig supply as additional assets are being stacked and newbuilds are being deferred. More needs to happen and we will continue to be proactive.
Before I hand the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Ensco's founding CEO, Carl Thorne, earlier this year. Many of you knew Carl and watched him grow Ensco from a small regional company into a major global offshore drilling company. We are indebted to Carl for his entrepreneurial courage, taking on the challenge of starting a new drilling company in the depths of a market downturn, not unlike the one we are experiencing today. 
When I joined Ensco, one of the factors that attracted me to the company was the strength of the culture and the commitment to upload the series of core values that will forged them to Carl's leadership and are essential to Ensco to this day. As we face this period of uncertainty, we'll increasingly rely on those core values.
Now I will turn the call over to David."
269488,283133384,771580,"Ensco plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Carl. First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call before I provide additional color on the markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we signed ENSCO 8503 to a multiyear contract, with the repeat customer to d",879,"Thanks, Carl. First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call before I provide additional color on the markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we signed ENSCO 8503 to a multiyear contract, with the repeat customer to drill in both DP and moored capacity. Addressing the customers' need to drill in both deep and mid-water depths. The rig is scheduled to commence this new contract in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this rig has the record for the deepest well ever drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. On the jackup side, we signed a 9-month contract for ENSCO 68, earning additional work based on the rig's strong operating and safety track record.
In West Africa, we contracted ENSCO 109 for a 3-year term. The rig has commenced operations ahead of schedule after mobilizing from Singapore with excellent uptime performance.
Moving to the Middle East. We secured extensions for 4 of our existing jackups. While market conditions have become more challenging, these contract awards show that we've earned more than our fair share of new business recently. Contracting has certainly become more difficult, but I believe Ensco's strength give us a competitive advantage as new contracting opportunities arise, even though they may be few and far between in the current environment.
Customers recently ranked us #1 in customer satisfaction for the fifth consecutive year, including a #1 ranking in safety. We are honored by this recognition and know that this competitive advantage is most important during a downturn. The challenges of the current market environment are well known. And some customers have shortened terms where contracts allow it while others are attempting to negotiate concessions.
As we have in the past, Ensco will act to protect its contract backlog and only entertain negotiations with customers where new terms are mutually beneficial. Since we have a lot to cover on this earnings call, rather than go market-by-market around the globe in terms of customer demand, let me just say that we are actively pursuing virtually every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jackups. In terms of the supply decide, looking at the worldwide order book for floaters, approximately 30 new rigs will be delivered before the end of 2015, of which roughly half are contracted.
Ensco's next 2 drillship deliveries, ENSCO DS-8 and ENSCO DS-9, are among these contracted rigs, and we expect to commence their initial contracts in the second half of this year. For competitive jackups, the newbuild order book shows approximately 60 to be delivered by year end 2015. The vast majority of which are uncontracted. More than half of the uncontracted newbuild jackup deliveries scheduled for 2015 are with companies that do not currently operate a rig. So it remains to be seen how many of these units will end up entering the global drilling supply. Many offshore drillers with uncontracted newbuild rigs likely will continue to postpone deliveries in an effort to delay final milestone CapEx payments, thereby pushing out new supply.
We have already seen deferrals and delays of new floaters and jackups originally scheduled to be delivered during 2015. While we may choose to delay future rig deliveries, we are in active discussions with customers for ENSCO 110, a high-spec jackup and ENSCO DS-10, and ultra-deepwater drillship scheduled for delivery later this year.
Overall, supply and demand dynamics will be aided by the retirement and stacking of both floaters and jackups. We expect that offshore drillers will continue to retire uncontracted rigs to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn. Since September, offshore drillers have announced the retirement of 23 floaters. Over the same time period, an additional 12 floaters have been cold stacked, and we believe that the majority will end up being retired from the global supply due to the costly nature to reactivate these older rigs. These 35 rigs represent approximately 12% of competitive global supply.
In 2015, 40 floaters that are 30 years of age or older will see their current contracts expire. All will be likely candidates for stacking and/or scrapping. And as a group, they are greater in number than the new supply of roughly 30 floaters scheduled to enter the market by year end. We anticipate the stacking and/or scrapping trend will continue into 2016 with these reductions to global supply helping to better balance floater supply and demand.
Similarly on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Approximately 80 competitive jackups that are 30 years of age or older have contracts that expire in 2015. At this time, another 40 jackups that are older than 30 years of age are idle and do not have any future contracted work. Major regulatory surveys to recertify older rigs which must take place every fifth year, can be very expensive and involve tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. 
In a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller, undercapitalized drillers, these rigs may be stacked and/or retired. Over the next year, our marketing teams are focused on winning as many contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging Ensco's differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record and our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."
269488,283133384,771580,"Ensco plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, several",1633,"Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. 
As noted in our press release, several items impacted fourth quarter results, including a noncash goodwill impairment of $3 billion, noncash asset impairments totaling $925 million, $56 million of favorable discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, primarily related to foreign tax credits, and the reclassification of 4 rigs in the discontinued operations.
Let me quickly remind everyone about how discontinued operations and held-for-sale status works. In order to put a rig into held-for-sale status, we must have a clear plan to sell the rig that has been approved by management and/or board. Once the held-for-sale criteria are met, the rig's current period and historical operating results are reclassified into discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. All future operating results are also presented in discontinued operations so that all period-to-period comparisons are on an equivalent basis.
In general, we focus our conference call comments on continuing operations. Where appropriate, we may adjust prior guidance to reflect discontinued operations accounting treatment. Having offered all of that explanation, I should mention that discontinued operations accounting rules changed in 2015. So any rigs that we decide to sell in the future will remain in continuing operations.
Excluding noncash goodwill and asset impairments as well as discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations were $1.68 per share. Cash flow from operations were $546 million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. Total fourth quarter revenue increased 2% to $1.16 billion from a year ago. Adjusted for rigs that were reclassified into discontinued operations, revenue was 2% lower than our prior guidance of $1.19 billion due to unplanned floater downtime.  
Floater segment revenue declined 5% to $663 million versus prior year due to lower reported utilization and average day rate, which more than offset a full quarter of operations for DS-7 compared to a partial quarter last year. Average day rate for our floaters decreased 6% to $429,000, and reported floater utilization declined to 81% versus 82% a year ago. 
Jackup segment revenue grew 6% to $454 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and 122 to the active fleet. These rigs contributed to a $17,000 increase in the average jackup day rate to $147,000. Reported utilization for the jackup fleet was 88% for the fourth quarter 2014 compared to 94% a year ago, primarily due to fewer contracted days in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Fourth quarter total contract drilling expense increased to $514 million from $500 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and insurance costs, partially offset $33 million of operating costs for 4 newbuilds.
Depreciation expense for continuing operations increased $11 million to $139 million in line with our expectations due to a growing active fleet. General and administrative expenses for the quarter was $28 million, also in line with our outlook, and $7 million less than a year ago, primarily due to lower discretionary compensation. Interest expense increased to $52 million as expected due to our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014.
So now let's turn to outlook for the first quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline slightly from fourth quarter levels of $1.16 billion due to more contracted rig days. This is partially offset by the commencement of ENSCO 5006 contract following a major upgrade and a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 109 and ENSCO 122. We anticipate first quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 6% from $514 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to more operating days for ENSCO 5006, 109 and 122, and approximately $8 million of expenses to cold stack rigs. Savings from onshore headcount reductions effective mid-February will largely offset $4 million of severance and related costs in the first quarter.
We expect first quarter G&A expenses to be relatively in line with fourth quarter as the benefit of our reduction in force offsets $1 million in severance costs for corporate staff. Depreciation expense should be approximately in line with fourth quarter levels of $139 million. Other expense is estimated to be $48 million in the first quarter, comprised of $51 million of interest expense and about $3 million of interest income.
Now let's move to our outlook for full year 2015. Approximately 75% of our floater rig days and 65% of our jackup rig days are contracted for 2015. This translates into contracted revenue backlog of $3.9 billion for 2015, excluding bonuses. This amount does not reflect several factors that could add or subtract to the final result such as signing new contracts and extending current contracts, bonuses for operational performance above certain levels, unplanned downtime, contract amendments that may extend terms into future periods but reduce day rates in the near term and early termination of contracts. 
Given the current lack of visibility in terms of customer demand in our sector and the number of contract rollovers we have in 2015, we won't be giving a specific outlook for full year revenues. For the same reason, we also won't be giving a detailed outlook for total contract drilling expense because we intend to manage expenses in line with our revenues to the maximum extent possible. 
We will, however, provide some of the factors influencing 2015 contract drilling expenses. 
First, additions to the fleet are expected to increase contract drilling expense by approximately $155 million year-to-year and this breaks down as follows: $85 million as several rigs have returned to the active fleet following shipyard upgrades during 2014; $35 million for the full year impact of the 3 ENSCO 120 Series that commenced their initial contracts in 2014; and $35 million for newbuilds commencing initial contracts in 2015.
As noted in our press release, we're taking aggressive steps to reduce our expense base. First, we have continued to high grade our fleet. Second, we are currently expediting the cold stacking of 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to reduce expenses. Daily cash savings achieved by cold stacking these rigs on average will be approximately $40,000 beginning in May. 
As Carl mentioned, we plan to stack ENSCO 8502. We estimate the upfront cost to cold stack an 8500 Series rig will be approximately $12 million, and we expect to incur approximately $7 million of this amount in the first quarter of 2015 and the remaining $5 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Cash cost for a cold stacked 8500 Series rig will be less than $10,000 per day. So cash savings achieved by cold stacking this rig will be approximately $120,000 per day beginning midyear when cold stacking is completed. We've implemented a number of discretionary compensation reductions and expect offshore unit labor cost to decline by approximately 9% on average from 2014 levels beginning in second quarter of 2015.
This will translate into meaningful cost saving since 48% of Ensco's 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 billion was offshore compensation. Last week, we, also, reduced our onshore personnel by 15%. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is estimated to be $27 million beginning in second quarter of 2015. $22 million of this amount will be in contract drilling expense and $5 million will be in G&A. For full year 2015, G&A expense is anticipated to decrease approximately 10% from $132 million in 2014.
Depreciation is expected to increase to approximately $575 million, primarily due to the addition of newbuild rigs, partially offset by lower depreciation for rigs impaired during 2014 that now have lower carrying values. As a result of our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014, interest expense is estimated to be approximately $180 million compared to $161 million last year. We expect interest income for the year of approximately $7 million due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade cost. 
The 2015 effective tax rate should be approximately 18% based on our current fleet composition and geographic positioning. 2015 capital spending is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion. This includes $1.6 billion in newbuild CapEx plus $250 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than half of our 2015 guidance.
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. As of December 31, we had $9.7 billion in revenue backlog based on existing contracts in place, $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and a total debt-to-capital ratio of 42%.
In conclusion, I'd like to reinforce some of Carl's comments with respect to cost control. We are clearly in an uncertain environment and it demands immediate action in terms of expense reduction and cash management. We began taking proactive steps in the second quarter of last year. And I hope everyone takes away from the call today that we have significantly ramped up an already aggressive expense and cash management program. We have in a very short period of time taken considerable cost out of the system, both onshore and offshore. 
We will continue to drive cost out of the system over the course of the coming year by attacking every element of cost and managing cash outflows wherever possible. We see expense control and cash management as an ongoing imperative for the foreseeable future. We do not see our actions solely as bridging us to a recovery. We are focused on sustainable cost reduction that will allow us to be even more competitive when the inevitable up cycle arrives.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

The -- If I go back to the prepared comments, one of the first things that really came into our decision-making process was the rapid deterioration we saw in the market conditions as we went through the end of Q4. But even at that time, we had a relatively -- a pay-per-view on what our clients were going to do and what our customers were going to do in 2015 and a little bit into '16. And as we came to the end of the quarter, and really, over the last 4 to 8 weeks, we've had chance to be able to now see some of those announcements and actually sit with most of our customers and really see what the demand outlook was and they're drilling plans were going to be. We're very much focused on not just '15 but going through into '16. And so we've really tried to look at the company in terms of where we want to be 1 to 2 years down the line, not just today. We looked at several things. The first was the risk and opportunities involved in a extended market downturn. And from that, we decided that increased liquidity and the flexibility for our capital management was something we wanted to do earlier rather than later. One, to manage the risk, but also to be able to be in a position to take opportunities if they came and we felt they were appropriate. The second is that we wish to maintain our credit rating. And thirdly, we still wish to maintain to pay a meaningful dividend that was comparable to other SMP companies, but to give us more flexibility in what is, we think, quite clearly going to be a multiyear down cycle."

We very much, clearly, see these rigs as part of our go-forward fleet. And there is a very clear distinction on mind about the fleet structure that we wish to have in the long term. So there are some rigs that when we stack them out, and we've clearly identified some of those already in held-for-sale, have no place in our go-forward plan. But there are rigs such as the 8500 which -- and the 8502, which we may decide to stack, but we intend to bring back. Now on the 8502, the decision has been taken largely take because we just find ourselves with 6 of those 7 rigs coming off contract. And certainly, in the Gulf of Mexico, we're competing against ourselves as well as other sixth generation rigs. But particularly, 8500 is competing against themselves for the same type and class of work. So we've just been very pragmatic about it. When we've looked at the overall utilization, we expect on all of those rigs over the next year or so and decided that we will take the action. Now with respect to the hybrid upgrades that we planned, we're still certainly going to go ahead on 1 and probably 2 of those rigs. We were considering a third one, and that's still an option for us. And we will review that as we see the second half of the year materialize. We will likely take the opportunity whilst the rigs are stacked to do some additional work and to look whether there's modifications we want to do whilst they're stack. But it is our intention to bring them back when we fill the market can support them."

It will partially depend on how long it's been stacked. And exactly, how we do it and the reason I say that is we are looking at a very detailed plan about actually removing some key equipment off the rig to put it in -- firmly in controlled environment to be able to ease the return of the rate and exactly how much we do of that will govern its cost to return. And it will also of course depend on how much it will cost this to mobilize it to where it has another contract.

Now specifically, we have only received 2 formal notifications termination, which we included in our last fleet status report, which is 2 jackups in Asia. And we also had 1 rig in the North Sea, which didn't move to next contract, because it was outside the window to stop, because the previous contract run on drilling operations longer than the window to start.

Because as I've said, we do have some rigs, which we -- which, if they came up contract, we would probably make a decision that we would not keep them alive on the go-forward fleet, because we have pre-prepared plan of basically the fleet structure we would like as we go out 2 to 3 years. So it would very much depend on whether it was a rig that fell into the status that we didn't necessarily want in 2 to 3 years, or whether it was one of the go-forward fleet, and very much on, also, considerations on the stacking cost. So there isn't a hard and fast recontracting rate. I think, what we've made clear is our view on this market. Is there -- There isn't one way you just sit back and hope everything's going to be fine, so -- and rely on just a bounce back in the oil price in the near term H2 to bring everything back to balance. We, clearly, will take our client's time even in a higher oil price environment to adjust budgets and react to a better oil price that they can be make sure of. And secondly, we will have a structural overhang in rig capacity that has to clear out. So our review is that we'll make a cold, hard rational decision when we see rigs that don't have enough utility ongoing to justify the cost, because what we don't want to get into is basically a cost bleed, cash bleed by just wishful thinking. Because when we do stack out the rigs as we've already done, it allows us to very drastically bring down cost and expenses."

And I think a large part of that is because the people -- our customers don't or didn't have a clear view on where oil price was going and how some of the fundamentals were driving it, and it's caused a very rapid pulled back. So it's certainly from, I think, the rest of the management team. Certainly, my experience before, this has been a much more rapid and aggressive falloff than the recession that happened. The downside was in the 2000, which actually, didn't fall off as fast and came back relatively quicker. So that's one, and that really, I think, has not only taken us by surprise, it's taken a large part of the second -- the industry by surprise. And the other one, of course, the offshore drilling sector is facing is the effect of the increase in supply over the past few years, which is, again, different from 2007, 2008, '09, and also from Macondo in 2010. So we have this very marked downturn in capital expenditure happening just exactly the time that all the newbuilds are arriving. And those 2 are compounding each other. And that's why, we believe that this is a mark --  a down cycle is going to take a couple of years to play out, and that's why, we believe, that taking strong and early action is required."

The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further towards the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most have announced",1256,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further towards the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most have announced significant CapEx cuts and the severe fall-off in customer demand is unprecedented compared to what we've seen in prior cycles. These market developments drove the goodwill and asset impairments we recorded in fourth quarter 2014 and were also a factor in our decision to reduce our quarterly dividend. Reducing our quarterly dividend would give us greater capital management flexibility to navigate a more challenging market environment. In addition, we have already begun a process of implementing plans that will structurally reduce contract drilling and general and administrative expenses. Jay will discuss this in greater detail, but let me give you the high points. 
First, as part of our continuous fleet hydrating, we placed 4 additional rigs into discontinued operations. Cold stacking rigs, no longer in our go-forward fleet, will reduce cost associated with these rigs. Similarly, several of our rigs in our go-forward fleet are currently being cold stacked to rapidly reduce expenses, such as 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico noted in our last Fleet Status Report. In addition to these rigs, we've decided to cold stack ENSCO 8502, with the possibility that we stack an additional 8500 Series rig if we do not see sufficient market opportunities. We expect ENSCO 8502 will be fully cold stacked by the middle of this year. This decision is not related to the capability of these rigs, which have an excellent track record, rather it is a reflection of having 6 out of 7 these rigs rolling off contract by year end and having to compete with more than 40 of the 6 Gen floaters that are either idle, rolling off contract in 2015 or being delivered this year from a shipyard. There will be upfront costs to properly place rigs into cold stacked status, but we believe the savings will outweigh the upfront stacking costs for these rigs that have limited near-term contracting opportunities. We will return these rigs to the active fleet when we are able to sign termed contract at a favorable day rate.
In terms of compensation expense, we have reevaluated premiums that we put in place for offshore employees joining the market up cycle. Based on this review, we've decided to reduce discretionary compensation for offshore personnel. This will result in a meaningful decline in unit labor cost for offshore personnel in 2015 compared to 2014. As the size of our actively marketed rig fleet has decreased, we have decided that it is also appropriate to streamline onshore support functions, including corporate staff, to better align with the size of our current marketed feet.
Last week, we implemented a reduction in force for onshore personnel that will achieve approximately $27 million of annualized savings, beginning in the second quarter of this year. Finally, we are negotiating with our vendors and suppliers to reduce costs while maintaining service quality. As we've said in the past, there is much happening in the market that we cannot control, but we will be aggressive about actions we can control and that includes fleet structure and costs. As we have described, we are proactively addressing the cost side of our business so that we are well situated to capitalize on the eventual upturn in the market.
We do not anticipate an improvement in the market in the near term, and as such, our approach will be to stack rigs, which come up contract and have no follow-on work, thereby reducing the size of our actively marketed fleet in the near term. As we look at the risk reward dynamics, we believe the steps we are taking to streamline cost and preserve capital are the most prudent and will eventually prove to be the best option.
Now I will provide a brief review of fourth quarter results and recap some full year 2014 highlights. Excluding impairment charges and discrete and other nonrecurring tax items during the fourth quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.68. Our marketing teams did an excellent job contracting rigs during the fourth quarter, especially in light of difficult market conditions, signing contracts for several jackups and a multiyear term for one of our floaters.
During 2014, we continued our fleet high-grading strategy by adding 3 ENSCO 120 Series newbuild jackups. Each of these newbuild jackups has had exceptional uptime performance since commencing their initial contracts over the past year. The other component of our high-grading strategy is to sell less capable assets. And during 2014, we sold 7 jackups and 1 floater. The sale of these rigs, coupled with our decision to sell additional floaters and jackups now classified as discontinued operations, reinforces our strategy of staying ahead of the curve in terms of fleet management.
By doing so, we ensure high levels of safety and operational uptime performance. During 2014, our offshore crews and onshore personnel achieved a new safety record in terms of our total recordable incident rate and improved our fleet uptime performance. These results contributed to Ensco recently earning the #1 rating in total customer satisfaction, our fifth consecutive year to earn this distinction. 
In addition, to our #1 rating in total customer satisfaction, ENSCO won 9 other categories, including safety and environment, technology, deepwater drilling and shelf wells. These exceptional results in such a challenging market reflect the quality of our systems, our fleet and our offshore cruise around the world and are a real differentiator in a challenging contracting environment. In terms of capital management, we've raised $1.25 billion of new capital through a debt offering and increased the amount of our revolver to $2.25 billion in September of last year.
We believe the debt raise was an appropriate step given our upcoming usage of capital, including capital commitments and debt maturities over the next 2 years. By increasing our liquidity, reducing our quarterly dividend and decreasing expenses, we will enhance our capital management flexibility during the market downturn. 
For market conditions to bottom and start to recover, we need to see some key actions. We cannot simply rely on an oil price recovery. Costs need to be driven out of the whole system and rig supply need to be reduced. We are encouraged to see that the rate of rig retirements has increased significantly, and there is some moderation in the marketed rig supply as additional assets are being stacked and newbuilds are being deferred. More needs to happen and we will continue to be proactive.
Before I hand the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Ensco's founding CEO, Carl Thorne, earlier this year. Many of you knew Carl and watched him grow Ensco from a small regional company into a major global offshore drilling company. We are indebted to Carl for his entrepreneurial courage, taking on the challenge of starting a new drilling company in the depths of a market downturn, not unlike the one we are experiencing today. 
When I joined Ensco, one of the factors that attracted me to the company was the strength of the culture and the commitment to uphold the series of core values that were forged under Carl's leadership and are essential to Ensco to this day. As we face this period of uncertainty, we'll increasingly rely on those core values.
Now I will turn the call over to David."

First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call before I provide additional color on the markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we signed ENSCO 8503 to a multiyear contract, with the repeat customer to d",879,"Thanks, Carl. First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call before I provide additional color on the markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we signed ENSCO 8503 to a multiyear contract, with the repeat customer to drill in both DP and moored capacity. Addressing the customers' need to drill in both deep and mid-water depths. The rig is scheduled to commence this new contract in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this rig has the record for the deepest well ever drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. On the jackup side, we signed a 9-month contract for ENSCO 68, earning additional work based on the rig's strong operating and safety track record.
In West Africa, we contracted ENSCO 109 for a 3-year term. The rig has commenced operations ahead of schedule after mobilizing from Singapore with excellent uptime performance.
Moving to the Middle East. We secured extensions for 4 of our existing jackups. While market conditions have become more challenging, these contract awards show that we've earned more than our fair share of new business recently. Contracting has certainly become more difficult, but I believe Ensco's strength give us a competitive edge as new contracting opportunities arise, even though they may be few and far between in the current environment.
Customers recently ranked us #1 in customer satisfaction for the fifth consecutive year, including a #1 ranking in safety. We are honored by this recognition and know that this competitive advantage is most important during a downturn. The challenges of the current market environment are well known. And some customers have shortened terms where contracts allow it while others are attempting to negotiate concessions.
As we have in the past, Ensco will act to protect its contract backlog and only entertain negotiations with customers where new terms are mutually beneficial. Since we have a lot to cover on this earnings call, rather than go market-by-market around the globe in terms of customer demand, let me just say that we are actively pursuing virtually every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jackups. In terms of the supply side, looking at the worldwide order book for floaters, approximately 30 new rigs will be delivered before the end of 2015, of which roughly half are contracted.
Ensco's next 2 drillship deliveries, ENSCO DS-8 and ENSCO DS-9, are among these contracted rigs, and we expect to commence their initial contracts in the second half of this year. For competitive jackups, the newbuild order book shows approximately 60 to be delivered by year end 2015. The vast majority of which are uncontracted. More than half of the uncontracted newbuild jackup deliveries scheduled for 2015 are with companies that do not currently operate a rig. So it remains to be seen how many of these units will end up entering the global drilling supply. Many offshore drillers with uncontracted newbuild rigs likely will continue to postpone deliveries in an effort to delay final milestone CapEx payments, thereby pushing out new supply.
We have already seen deferrals and delays of new floaters and jackups originally scheduled to be delivered during 2015. While we may choose to delay future rig deliveries, we are in active discussions with customers for ENSCO 110, a high-spec jackup and ENSCO DS-10, an ultra-deepwater drillship scheduled for delivery later this year.
Overall, supply and demand dynamics will be aided by the retirement and stacking of both floaters and jackups. We expect that offshore drillers will continue to retire uncontracted rigs to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn. Since September, offshore drillers have announced the retirement of 23 floaters. Over the same time period, an additional 12 floaters have been cold stacked, and we believe that the majority will end up being retired from the global supply due to the costly nature to reactivate these older rigs. These 35 rigs represent approximately 12% of competitive global supply.
In 2015, 40 floaters that are 30 years of age or older will see their current contracts expire. All will be likely candidates for stacking and/or scrapping. And as a group, they are greater in number than the new supply of roughly 30 floaters scheduled to enter the market by year end. We anticipate the stacking and/or scrapping trend will continue into 2016 with these reductions to global supply helping to better balance floater supply and demand.
Similarly on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Approximately 80 competitive jackups that are 30 years of age or older have contracts that expire in 2015. At this time, another 40 jackups that are older than 30 years of age are idle and do not have any future contracted work. Major regulatory surveys to recertify older rigs which must take place every fifth year, can be very expensive and involve tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. 
In a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller, undercapitalized drillers, these rigs may be stacked and/or retired. Over the next year, our marketing teams are focused on winning as many contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging Ensco's differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record and our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."
269488,283133384,771892,"Ensco plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, several",1633,"Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. 
As noted in our press release, several items impacted fourth quarter results, including a noncash goodwill impairment of $3 billion, noncash asset impairments totaling $925 million, $56 million of favorable discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, primarily related to foreign tax credits, and the reclassification of 4 rigs into discontinued operations.
Let me quickly remind everyone about how discontinued operations and held-for-sale status works. In order to put a rig into held-for-sale status, we must have a clear plan to sell the rig that has been approved by management and our board. Once the held-for-sale criteria are met, the rig's current period and historical operating results are reclassified into discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. All future operating results are also presented in discontinued operations so that all period-to-period comparisons are on an equivalent basis.
In general, we focus our conference call comments on continuing operations. Where appropriate, we may adjust prior guidance to reflect discontinued operations accounting treatment. Having offered all of that explanation, I should mention that discontinued operations accounting rules changed in 2015. So any rigs that we decide to sell in the future will remain in continuing operations.
Excluding noncash goodwill and asset impairments as well as discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations were $1.68 per share. Cash flow from operations were $546 million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. Total fourth quarter revenue increased 2% to $1.16 billion from a year ago. Adjusted for rigs that were reclassified into discontinued operations, revenue was 2% lower than our prior guidance of $1.19 billion due to unplanned floater downtime.  
Floater segment revenue declined 5% to $663 million versus prior year due to lower reported utilization and average day rate, which more than offset a full quarter of operations for DS-7 compared to a partial quarter last year. Average day rate for our floaters decreased 6% to $429,000, and reported floater utilization declined to 81% versus 82% a year ago. 
Jackup segment revenue grew 6% to $454 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and 122 to the active fleet. These rigs contributed to a $17,000 increase in the average jackup day rate to $147,000. Reported utilization for the jackup fleet was 88% for the fourth quarter 2014 compared to 94% a year ago, primarily due to fewer contracted days in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Fourth quarter total contract drilling expense increased to $514 million from $500 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and insurance costs, partially offset $33 million of operating costs for 4 newbuilds.
Depreciation expense for continuing operations increased $11 million to $139 million in line with our expectations due to a growing active fleet. General and administrative expenses for the quarter was $28 million, also in line with our outlook, and $7 million less than a year ago, primarily due to lower discretionary compensation. Interest expense increased to $52 million as expected due to our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014.
So now let's turn to outlook for the first quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline slightly from fourth quarter levels of $1.16 billion due to more contracted rig days. This is partially offset by the commencement of ENSCO 5006 contract following a major upgrade and a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 109 and ENSCO 122. We anticipate first quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 6% from $514 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to more operating days for ENSCO 5006, 109 and 122, and approximately $8 million of expenses to cold stack rigs. Savings from onshore headcount reductions effective mid-February will largely offset $4 million of severance and related costs in the first quarter.
We expect first quarter G&A expenses to be relatively in line with fourth quarter as the benefit of our reduction in force offsets $1 million in severance costs for corporate staff. Depreciation expense should be approximately in line with fourth quarter levels of $139 million. Other expense is estimated to be $48 million in the first quarter, comprised of $51 million of interest expense and about $3 million of interest income.
Now let's move to our outlook for full year 2015. Approximately 75% of our floater rig days and 65% of our jackup rig days are contracted for 2015. This translates into contracted revenue backlog of $3.9 billion for 2015, excluding bonuses. This amount does not reflect several factors that could add or subtract to the final result such as signing new contracts and extending current contracts, bonuses for operational performance above certain levels, unplanned downtime, contract amendments that may extend terms into future periods but reduce day rates in the near term and early termination of contracts. 
Given the current lack of visibility in terms of customer demand in our sector and the number of contract rollovers we have in 2015, we won't be giving a specific outlook for full year revenues. For the same reason, we also won't be giving a detailed outlook for total contract drilling expense because we intend to manage expenses in line with our revenues to the maximum extent possible. 
We will, however, provide some of the factors influencing 2015 contract drilling expenses. 
First, additions to the fleet are expected to increase contract drilling expense by approximately $155 million year-to-year and this breaks down as follows: $85 million as several rigs have returned to the active fleet following shipyard upgrades during 2014; $35 million for the full year impact of the 3 ENSCO 120 Series that commenced their initial contracts in 2014; and $35 million for newbuilds commencing initial contracts in 2015.
As noted in our press release, we're taking aggressive steps to reduce our expense base. First, we have continued to high grade our fleet. Second, we are currently expediting the cold stacking of 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to reduce expenses. Daily cash savings achieved by cold stacking these rigs on average will be approximately $40,000 beginning in May. 
As Carl mentioned, we plan to stack ENSCO 8502. We estimate the upfront cost to cold stack an 8500 Series rig will be approximately $12 million, and we expect to incur approximately $7 million of this amount in the first quarter of 2015 and the remaining $5 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Cash cost for a cold stacked 8500 Series rig will be less than $10,000 per day. So cash savings achieved by cold stacking this rig will be approximately $120,000 per day beginning midyear when cold stacking is completed. We've implemented a number of discretionary compensation reductions and expect offshore unit labor cost to decline by approximately 9% on average from 2014 levels beginning in second quarter of 2015.
This will translate into meaningful cost saving since 48% of Ensco's 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 billion was offshore compensation. Last week, we also reduced our onshore personnel by 15%. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is estimated to be $27 million beginning in second quarter of 2015. $22 million of this amount will be in contract drilling expense and $5 million will be in G&A. For full year 2015, G&A expense is anticipated to decrease approximately 10% from $132 million in 2014.
Depreciation is expected to increase to approximately $575 million, primarily due to the addition of newbuild rigs, partially offset by lower depreciation for rigs impaired during 2014 that now have lower carrying values. As a result of our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014, interest expense is estimated to be approximately $180 million compared to $161 million last year. We expect interest income for the year of approximately $7 million due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade cost. 
The 2015 effective tax rate should be approximately 18% based on our current fleet composition and geographic positioning. 2015 capital spending is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion. This includes $1.6 billion in newbuild CapEx plus $250 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than half of our 2015 guidance.
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. As of December 31, we had $9.7 billion in revenue backlog based on existing contracts in place, $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and a total debt-to-capital ratio of 42%.
In conclusion, I'd like to reinforce some of Carl's comments with respect to cost control. We are clearly in an uncertain environment and it demands immediate action in terms of expense reduction and cash management. We began taking proactive steps in the second quarter of last year. And I hope everyone takes away from the call today that we have significantly ramped up an already aggressive expense and cash management program. We have in a very short period of time taken considerable cost out of the system, both onshore and offshore. 
We will continue to drive cost out of the system over the course of the coming year by attacking every element of cost and managing cash outflows wherever possible. We see expense control and cash management as an ongoing imperative for the foreseeable future. We do not see our actions solely as bridging us to a recovery. We are focused on sustainable cost reduction that will allow us to be even more competitive when the inevitable up cycle arrives.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

There are a whole series of issues that have come up in this decision and reasons why we've done it. The -- if I go back to the prepared comments, one of the first things that really came into our decision-making process was the rapid deterioration we saw in the market conditions as we went through the end of Q4. But even at that time, we had a relatively -- a pay-per-view on what our clients were going to do and what our customers were going to do in 2015 and a little bit into '16. And as we came to the end of the quarter, and really, over the last 4 to 8 weeks, we've had chance to be able to now see some of those announcements and actually sit with most of our customers and really see what the demand outlook was and their drilling plans were going to be. We're very much focused on not just '15 but going through into '16. And so we've really tried to look at the company in terms of where we want to be 1 to 2 years down the line, not just today. We looked at several things. The first was the risk and opportunities involved in a extended market downturn. And from that, we decided that increased liquidity and the flexibility for our capital management was something we wanted to do earlier rather than later. One, to manage the risk, but also to be able to be in a position to take opportunities if they came and we felt they were appropriate. The second is that we wish to maintain our credit rating. And thirdly, we still wish to maintain to pay a meaningful dividend that was comparable to other S&P companies, but to give us more flexibility in what is, we think, quite clearly going to be a multiyear down cycle."

We very much, clearly, see these rigs as part of our go-forward fleet. And there is a very clear distinction on mind about the fleet structure that we wish to have in the long term. So there are some rigs that when we stack them out, and we've clearly identified some of those already in held-for-sale, have no place in our go-forward plan. But there are rigs such as the 8500 which -- and the 8502, which we may decide to stack, but we intend to bring back. Now on the 8502, the decision has been taken largely take because we just find ourselves with 6 of those 7 rigs coming off contract. And certainly, in the Gulf of Mexico, we're competing against ourselves as well as other sixth generation rigs. But particularly, 8500 is competing against themselves for the same type and class of work. So we've just been very pragmatic about it. When we've looked at the overall utilization we expect on all of those rigs over the next year or so and decided that we will take the action. Now with respect to the hybrid upgrades that we planned, we're still certainly going to go ahead on 1 and probably 2 of those rigs. We were considering a third one, and that's still an option for us. And we will review that as we see the second half of the year materialize. We will likely take the opportunity whilst the rigs are stacked to do some additional work and to look whether there's modifications we want to do whilst they're stacked. But it is our intention to bring them back when we feel the market can support them."

It will partially depend on how long it's been stacked. And exactly, how we do it and the reason I say that is we are looking at a very detailed plan about actually removing some key equipment off the rig to put it in -- firmly in controlled environment to be able to ease the return of the rate and exactly how much we do of that will govern its cost to return. And it will also of course depend on how much it will cost us to mobilize it to where it has another contract.

Because as I've said, we do have some rigs, which we -- which, if they came up contract, we would probably make a decision that we would not keep them alive on the go-forward fleet, because we have pre-prepared plan of basically the fleet structure we would like as we go out 2 to 3 years. So it would very much depend on whether it was a rig that fell into the status that we didn't necessarily want in 2 to 3 years, or whether it was one of the go-forward fleet, and very much on, also, considerations on the stacking cost. So there isn't a hard and fast recontracting rate. I think, what we've made clear is our view on this market. Is there -- there isn't one where you just sit back and hope everything's going to be fine, so -- and rely on just a bounce back in the oil price in the near term H2 to bring everything back to balance. We, clearly, will take our client's time even in a higher oil price environment to adjust budgets and react to a better oil price that they can be make sure of. And secondly, we will have a structural overhang in rig capacity that has to clear out. So our review is that we'll make a cold, hard rational decision when we see rigs that don't have enough utility ongoing to justify the cost, because what we don't want to get into is basically a cost bleed, cash bleed by just wishful thinking. Because when we do stack out the rigs as we've already done, it allows us to very drastically bring down cost and expenses."

And I think a large part of that is because the people -- our customers don't or didn't have a clear view on where oil price was going and how some of the fundamentals were driving it, and it's caused a very rapid pullback. So it's certainly from, I think, the rest of the management team. Certainly, my experience before, this has been a much more rapid and aggressive falloff than the recession that happened. The downside was in the 2000, which actually, didn't fall off as fast and came back relatively quicker. So that's one, and that really, I think, has not only taken us by surprise, it's taken a large part of the second -- the industry by surprise. And the other one, of course, the offshore drilling sector is facing is the effect of the increase in supply over the past few years, which is, again, different from 2007, 2008, '09, and also from Macondo in 2010. So we have this very marked downturn in capital expenditure happening just exactly the time that all the newbuilds are arriving. And those 2 are compounding each other. And that's why, we believe that this is a mark --  a down cycle is going to take a couple of years to play out, and that's why, we believe, that taking strong and early action is required."

The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further towards the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most have announced",1256,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further towards the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most have announced significant CapEx cuts and the severe fall-off in customer demand is unprecedented compared to what we've seen in prior cycles. These market developments drove the goodwill and asset impairments we recorded in fourth quarter 2014 and were also a factor in our decision to reduce our quarterly dividend. Reducing our quarterly dividend would give us greater capital management flexibility to navigate a more challenging market environment. In addition, we have already begun a process of implementing plans that will structurally reduce contract drilling and general and administrative expenses. Jay will discuss this in greater detail, but let me give you the high points. 
First, as part of our continuous fleet hydrating, we placed 4 additional rigs into discontinued operations. Cold stacking rigs, no longer in our go-forward fleet, will reduce cost associated with these rigs. Similarly, several of our rigs in our go-forward fleet are currently being cold stacked to rapidly reduce expenses, such as 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico noted in our last Fleet Status Report. In addition to these rigs, we've decided to cold stack ENSCO 8502, with the possibility that we stack an additional 8500 Series rig if we do not see sufficient market opportunities. We expect ENSCO 8502 will be fully cold stacked by the middle of this year. This decision is not related to the capability of these rigs, which have an excellent track record, rather it is a reflection of having 6 out of 7 these rigs rolling off contract by year end and having to compete with more than 40 of the 6 Gen floaters that are either idle, rolling off contract in 2015 or being delivered this year from a shipyard. There will be upfront costs to properly place rigs into cold stacked status, but we believe the savings will outweigh the upfront stacking costs for these rigs that have limited near-term contracting opportunities. We will return these rigs to the active fleet when we are able to sign termed contract at a favorable day rate.
In terms of compensation expense, we have reevaluated premiums that we put in place for offshore employees joining the market up cycle. Based on this review, we've decided to reduce discretionary compensation for offshore personnel. This will result in a meaningful decline in unit labor cost for offshore personnel in 2015 compared to 2014. As the size of our actively marketed rig fleet has decreased, we have decided that it is also appropriate to streamline onshore support functions, including corporate staff, to better align with the size of our current marketed feet.
Last week, we implemented a reduction in force for onshore personnel that will achieve approximately $27 million of annualized savings, beginning in the second quarter of this year. Finally, we are negotiating with our vendors and suppliers to reduce costs while maintaining service quality. As we've said in the past, there is much happening in the market that we cannot control, but we will be aggressive about actions we can control and that includes fleet structure and costs. As we have described, we are proactively addressing the cost side of our business so that we are well situated to capitalize on the eventual upturn in the market.
We do not anticipate an improvement in the market in the near term, and as such, our approach will be to stack rigs, which come up contract and have no follow-on work, thereby reducing the size of our actively marketed fleet in the near term. As we look at the risk reward dynamics, we believe the steps we are taking to streamline cost and preserve capital are the most prudent and will eventually prove to be the best option.
Now I will provide a brief review of fourth quarter results and recap some full year 2014 highlights. Excluding impairment charges and discrete and other nonrecurring tax items during the fourth quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.68. Our marketing teams did an excellent job contracting rigs during the fourth quarter, especially in light of difficult market conditions, signing contracts for several jackups and a multiyear term for one of our floaters.
During 2014, we continued our fleet high-grading strategy by adding 3 ENSCO 120 Series newbuild jackups. Each of these newbuild jackups has had exceptional uptime performance since commencing their initial contracts over the past year. The other component of our high-grading strategy is to sell less capable assets. And during 2014, we sold 7 jackups and 1 floater. The sale of these rigs, coupled with our decision to sell additional floaters and jackups now classified as discontinued operations, reinforces our strategy of staying ahead of the curve in terms of fleet management.
By doing so, we ensure high levels of safety and operational uptime performance. During 2014, our offshore crews and onshore personnel achieved a new safety record in terms of our total recordable incident rate and improved our fleet uptime performance. These results contributed to Ensco recently earning the #1 rating in total customer satisfaction, our fifth consecutive year to earn this distinction. 
In addition, to our #1 rating in total customer satisfaction, ENSCO won 9 other categories, including safety and environment, technology, deepwater drilling and shelf wells. These exceptional results in such a challenging market reflect the quality of our systems, our fleet and our offshore cruise around the world and are a real differentiator in a challenging contracting environment. In terms of capital management, we've raised $1.25 billion of new capital through a debt offering and increased the amount of our revolver to $2.25 billion in September of last year.
We believe the debt raise was an appropriate step given our upcoming usage of capital, including capital commitments and debt maturities over the next 2 years. By increasing our liquidity, reducing our quarterly dividend and decreasing expenses, we will enhance our capital management flexibility during the market downturn. 
For market conditions to bottom and start to recover, we need to see some key actions. We cannot simply rely on an oil price recovery. Costs need to be driven out of the whole system and rig supply need to be reduced. We are encouraged to see that the rate of rig retirements has increased significantly, and there is some moderation in the marketed rig supply as additional assets are being stacked and newbuilds are being deferred. More needs to happen and we will continue to be proactive.
Before I hand the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Ensco's founding CEO, Carl Thorne, earlier this year. Many of you knew Carl and watched him grow Ensco from a small regional company into a major global offshore drilling company. We are indebted to Carl for his entrepreneurial courage, taking on the challenge of starting a new drilling company in the depths of a market downturn, not unlike the one we are experiencing today. 
When I joined Ensco, one of the factors that attracted me to the company was the strength of the culture and the commitment to uphold the series of core values that were forged under Carl's leadership and are essential to Ensco to this day. As we face this period of uncertainty, we'll increasingly rely on those core values.
Now I will turn the call over to David."

First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call before I provide additional color on the markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we signed ENSCO 8503 to a multiyear contract, with the repeat customer to d",879,"Thanks, Carl. First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call before I provide additional color on the markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we signed ENSCO 8503 to a multiyear contract, with the repeat customer to drill in both DP and moored capacity. Addressing the customers' need to drill in both deep and mid-water depths. The rig is scheduled to commence this new contract in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this rig has the record for the deepest well ever drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. On the jackup side, we signed a 9-month contract for ENSCO 68, earning additional work based on the rig's strong operating and safety track record.
In West Africa, we contracted ENSCO 109 for a 3-year term. The rig has commenced operations ahead of schedule after mobilizing from Singapore with excellent uptime performance.
Moving to the Middle East. We secured extensions for 4 of our existing jackups. While market conditions have become more challenging, these contract awards show that we've earned more than our fair share of new business recently. Contracting has certainly become more difficult, but I believe Ensco's strength give us a competitive edge as new contracting opportunities arise, even though they may be few and far between in the current environment.
Customers recently ranked us #1 in customer satisfaction for the fifth consecutive year, including a #1 ranking in safety. We are honored by this recognition and know that this competitive advantage is most important during a downturn. The challenges of the current market environment are well known. And some customers have shortened terms where contracts allow it while others are attempting to negotiate concessions.
As we have in the past, Ensco will act to protect its contract backlog and only entertain negotiations with customers where new terms are mutually beneficial. Since we have a lot to cover on this earnings call, rather than go market-by-market around the globe in terms of customer demand, let me just say that we are actively pursuing virtually every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jackups. In terms of the supply side, looking at the worldwide order book for floaters, approximately 30 new rigs will be delivered before the end of 2015, of which roughly half are contracted.
Ensco's next 2 drillship deliveries, ENSCO DS-8 and ENSCO DS-9, are among these contracted rigs, and we expect to commence their initial contracts in the second half of this year. For competitive jackups, the newbuild order book shows approximately 60 to be delivered by year end 2015. The vast majority of which are uncontracted. More than half of the uncontracted newbuild jackup deliveries scheduled for 2015 are with companies that do not currently operate a rig. So it remains to be seen how many of these units will end up entering the global drilling supply. Many offshore drillers with uncontracted newbuild rigs likely will continue to postpone deliveries in an effort to delay final milestone CapEx payments, thereby pushing out new supply.
We have already seen deferrals and delays of new floaters and jackups originally scheduled to be delivered during 2015. While we may choose to delay future rig deliveries, we are in active discussions with customers for ENSCO 110, a high-spec jackup and ENSCO DS-10, an ultra-deepwater drillship scheduled for delivery later this year.
Overall, supply and demand dynamics will be aided by the retirement and stacking of both floaters and jackups. We expect that offshore drillers will continue to retire uncontracted rigs to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn. Since September, offshore drillers have announced the retirement of 23 floaters. Over the same time period, an additional 12 floaters have been cold stacked, and we believe that the majority will end up being retired from the global supply due to the costly nature to reactivate these older rigs. These 35 rigs represent approximately 12% of competitive global supply.
In 2015, 40 floaters that are 30 years of age or older will see their current contracts expire. All will be likely candidates for stacking and/or scrapping. And as a group, they are greater in number than the new supply of roughly 30 floaters scheduled to enter the market by year end. We anticipate the stacking and/or scrapping trend will continue into 2016 with these reductions to global supply helping to better balance floater supply and demand.
Similarly on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Approximately 80 competitive jackups that are 30 years of age or older have contracts that expire in 2015. At this time, another 40 jackups that are older than 30 years of age are idle and do not have any future contracted work. Major regulatory surveys to recertify older rigs which must take place every fifth year, can be very expensive and involve tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. 
In a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller, undercapitalized drillers, these rigs may be stacked and/or retired. Over the next year, our marketing teams are focused on winning as many contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging Ensco's differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record and our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."
269488,283133384,773407,"Ensco plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, several",1633,"Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. 
As noted in our press release, several items impacted fourth quarter results, including a noncash goodwill impairment of $3 billion, noncash asset impairments totaling $925 million, $56 million of favorable discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, primarily related to foreign tax credits, and the reclassification of 4 rigs into discontinued operations.
Let me quickly remind everyone about how discontinued operations and held-for-sale status works. In order to put a rig into held-for-sale status, we must have a clear plan to sell the rig that has been approved by management and our board. Once the held-for-sale criteria are met, the rig's current period and historical operating results are reclassified into discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. All future operating results are also presented in discontinued operations so that all period-to-period comparisons are on an equivalent basis.
In general, we focus our conference call comments on continuing operations. Where appropriate, we may adjust prior guidance to reflect discontinued operations accounting treatment. Having offered all of that explanation, I should mention that discontinued operations accounting rules changed in 2015. So any rigs that we decide to sell in the future will remain in continuing operations.
Excluding noncash goodwill and asset impairments as well as discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations were $1.68 per share. Cash flow from operations were $546 million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. Total fourth quarter revenue increased 2% to $1.16 billion from a year ago. Adjusted for rigs that were reclassified into discontinued operations, revenue was 2% lower than our prior guidance of $1.19 billion due to unplanned floater downtime. 
Floater segment revenue declined 5% to $663 million versus prior year due to lower reported utilization and average day rate, which more than offset a full quarter of operations for DS-7 compared to a partial quarter last year. Average day rate for our floaters decreased 6% to $429,000, and reported floater utilization declined to 81% versus 82% a year ago. 
Jackup segment revenue grew 6% to $454 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and 122 to the active fleet. These rigs contributed to a $17,000 increase in the average jackup day rate to $147,000. Reported utilization for the jackup fleet was 88% for the fourth quarter 2014 compared to 94% a year ago, primarily due to fewer contracted days in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Fourth quarter total contract drilling expense increased to $514 million from $500 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and insurance costs, partially offset $33 million of operating costs for 4 newbuilds.
Depreciation expense for continuing operations increased $11 million to $139 million in line with our expectations due to a growing active fleet. General and administrative expenses for the quarter was $28 million, also in line with our outlook, and $7 million less than a year ago, primarily due to lower discretionary compensation. Interest expense increased to $52 million as expected due to our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014.
So now let's turn to outlook for the first quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline slightly from fourth quarter levels of $1.16 billion due to more contracted rig days. This is partially offset by the commencement of ENSCO 5006 contract following a major upgrade and a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 109 and ENSCO 122. We anticipate first quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 6% from $514 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to more operating days for ENSCO 5006, 109 and 122, and approximately $8 million of expenses to cold stack rigs. Savings from onshore headcount reductions effective mid-February will largely offset $4 million of severance and related costs in the first quarter.
We expect first quarter G&A expenses to be relatively in line with fourth quarter as the benefit of our reduction in force offsets $1 million in severance costs for corporate staff. Depreciation expense should be approximately in line with fourth quarter levels of $139 million. Other expense is estimated to be $48 million in the first quarter, comprised of $51 million of interest expense and about $3 million of interest income.
Now let's move to our outlook for full year 2015. Approximately 75% of our floater rig days and 65% of our jackup rig days are contracted for 2015. This translates into contracted revenue backlog of $3.9 billion for 2015, excluding bonuses. This amount does not reflect several factors that could add or subtract to the final result such as signing new contracts and extending current contracts, bonuses for operational performance above certain levels, unplanned downtime, contract amendments that may extend terms into future periods but reduce day rates in the near term and early termination of contracts. 
Given the current lack of visibility in terms of customer demand in our sector and the number of contract rollovers we have in 2015, we won't be giving a specific outlook for full year revenues. For the same reason, we also won't be giving a detailed outlook for total contract drilling expense because we intend to manage expenses in line with our revenues to the maximum extent possible. 
We will, however, provide some of the factors influencing 2015 contract drilling expenses. 
First, additions to the fleet are expected to increase contract drilling expense by approximately $155 million year-to-year and this breaks down as follows: $85 million as several rigs have returned to the active fleet following shipyard upgrades during 2014; $35 million for the full year impact of the 3 ENSCO 120 Series that commenced their initial contracts in 2014; and $35 million for newbuilds commencing initial contracts in 2015.
As noted in our press release, we're taking aggressive steps to reduce our expense base. First, we have continued to high grade our fleet. Second, we are currently expediting the cold stacking of 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to reduce expenses. Daily cash savings achieved by cold stacking these rigs on average will be approximately $40,000 beginning in May. 
As Carl mentioned, we plan to stack ENSCO 8502. We estimate the upfront cost to cold stack an 8500 Series rig will be approximately $12 million, and we expect to incur approximately $7 million of this amount in the first quarter of 2015 and the remaining $5 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Cash cost for a cold stacked 8500 Series rig will be less than $10,000 per day. So cash savings achieved by cold stacking this rig will be approximately $120,000 per day beginning midyear when cold stacking is completed. We've implemented a number of discretionary compensation reductions and expect offshore unit labor cost to decline by approximately 9% on average from 2014 levels beginning in second quarter of 2015.
This will translate into meaningful cost saving since 48% of Ensco's 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 billion was offshore compensation. Last week, we also reduced our onshore personnel by 15%. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is estimated to be $27 million beginning in second quarter of 2015. $22 million of this amount will be in contract drilling expense and $5 million will be in G&A. For full year 2015, G&A expense is anticipated to decrease approximately 10% from $132 million in 2014.
Depreciation is expected to increase to approximately $575 million, primarily due to the addition of newbuild rigs, partially offset by lower depreciation for rigs impaired during 2014 that now have lower carrying values. As a result of our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014, interest expense is estimated to be approximately $180 million compared to $161 million last year. We expect interest income for the year of approximately $7 million due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade cost. 
The 2015 effective tax rate should be approximately 18% based on our current fleet composition and geographic positioning. 2015 capital spending is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion. This includes $1.6 billion in newbuild CapEx plus $250 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than half of our 2015 guidance.
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. As of December 31, we had $9.7 billion in revenue backlog based on existing contracts in place, $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and a total debt-to-capital ratio of 42%.
In conclusion, I'd like to reinforce some of Carl's comments with respect to cost control. We are clearly in an uncertain environment and it demands immediate action in terms of expense reduction and cash management. We began taking proactive steps in the second quarter of last year. And I hope everyone takes away from the call today that we have significantly ramped up an already aggressive expense and cash management program. We have in a very short period of time taken considerable cost out of the system, both onshore and offshore. 
We will continue to drive cost out of the system over the course of the coming year by attacking every element of cost and managing cash outflows wherever possible. We see expense control and cash management as an ongoing imperative for the foreseeable future. We do not see our actions solely as bridging us to a recovery. We are focused on sustainable cost reduction that will allow us to be even more competitive when the inevitable up cycle arrives.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

There are a whole series of issues that have come up in this decision and reasons why we've done it. The -- if I go back to the prepared comments, one of the first things that really came into our decision-making process was the rapid deterioration we saw in the market conditions as we went through the end of Q4. But even at that time, we had a relatively -- a pay-per-view on what our clients were going to do and what our customers were going to do in 2015 and a little bit into '16. And as we came to the end of the quarter, and really, over the last 4 to 8 weeks, we've had chance to be able to now see some of those announcements and actually sit with most of our customers and really see what the demand outlook was and their drilling plans were going to be. We're very much focused on not just '15 but going through into '16. And so we've really tried to look at the company in terms of where we want to be 1 to 2 years down the line, not just today. We looked at several things. The first was the risk and opportunities involved in an extended market downturn. And from that, we decided that increased liquidity and the flexibility for our capital management was something we wanted to do earlier rather than later. One, to manage the risk, but also to be able to be in a position to take opportunities if they came and we felt they were appropriate. The second is that we wish to maintain our credit rating. And thirdly, we still wish to maintain to pay a meaningful dividend that was comparable to other S&P companies, but to give us more flexibility in what is, we think, quite clearly going to be a multiyear down cycle."

We very much, clearly, see these rigs as part of our go-forward fleet. And there is a very clear distinction on mind about the fleet structure that we wish to have in the long term. So there are some rigs that when we stack them out, and we've clearly identified some of those already in held-for-sale, have no place in our go-forward plan. But there are rigs such as the 8500 which -- and the 8502, which we may decide to stack, but we intend to bring back. Now on the 8502, the decision has been taken largely take because we just find ourselves with 6 of those 7 rigs coming off contract. And certainly, in the Gulf of Mexico, we're competing against ourselves as well as other sixth generation rigs. But particularly, 8500 is competing against themselves for the same type and class of work. So we've just been very pragmatic about it. When we've looked at the overall utilization we expect on all of those rigs over the next year or so and decided that we will take the action. Now with respect to the hybrid upgrades that we planned, we're still certainly going to go ahead on 1 and probably 2 of those rigs. We were considering a third one, and that's still an option for us. And we will review that as we see the second half of the year materialize. We will likely take the opportunity whilst the rigs are stacked to do some additional work and to look whether there's modifications we want to do whilst they're stacked. But it is our intention to bring them back when we feel the market can support them."

It will partially depend on how long it's been stacked. And exactly, how we do it and the reason I say that is we are looking at a very detailed plan about actually removing some key equipment off the rig to put it in -- firmly in controlled environment to be able to ease the return of the rate and exactly how much we do of that will govern its cost to return. And it will also of course depend on how much it will cost us to mobilize it to where it has another contract.

Because as I've said, we do have some rigs, which we -- which, if they came up contract, we would probably make a decision that we would not keep them alive on the go-forward fleet, because we have pre-prepared plan of basically the fleet structure we would like as we go out 2 to 3 years. So it would very much depend on whether it was a rig that fell into the status that we didn't necessarily want in 2 to 3 years, or whether it was one of the go-forward fleet, and very much on, also, considerations on the stacking cost. So there isn't a hard and fast recontracting rate. I think, what we've made clear is our view on this market. Is there -- there isn't one where you just sit back and hope everything's going to be fine, so -- and rely on just a bounce back in the oil price in the near term H2 to bring everything back to balance. We, clearly, will take our client's time even in a higher oil price environment to adjust budgets and react to a better oil price that they can be make sure of. And secondly, we will have a structural overhang in rig capacity that has to clear out. So our review is that we'll make a cold, hard rational decision when we see rigs that don't have enough utility ongoing to justify the cost, because what we don't want to get into is basically a cost bleed, cash bleed by just wishful thinking. Because when we do stack out the rigs as we've already done, it allows us to very drastically bring down cost and expenses."

And I think a large part of that is because the people -- our customers don't or didn't have a clear view on where oil price was going and how some of the fundamentals were driving it, and it's caused a very rapid pullback. So it's certainly from, I think, the rest of the management team. Certainly, my experience before, this has been a much more rapid and aggressive falloff than the recession that happened. The downside was in the 2000, which actually, didn't fall off as fast and came back relatively quicker. So that's one, and that really, I think, has not only taken us by surprise, it's taken a large part of the second -- the industry by surprise. And the other one, of course, the offshore drilling sector is facing is the effect of the increase in supply over the past few years, which is, again, different from 2007, 2008, '09, and also from Macondo in 2010. So we have this very marked downturn in capital expenditure happening just exactly the time that all the newbuilds are arriving. And those 2 are compounding each other. And that's why, we believe that this is a mark -- a down cycle is going to take a couple of years to play out, and that's why, we believe, that taking strong and early action is required."

269488,290567129,802025,"Ensco plc, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were highlighted by strong operational safety and financial performance.

First quarter results were highlighted by strong operational safety and financial performance. As noted in our press release, we had 99.6% operational utilization for jack-ups, record safety results and an 18% increase in earnings per share adjusted for expenses to refinance debt. 
Our offshore crews and onshore personnel are to be commended for this performance, which is consistent with our #1 ranking in customer satisfaction. Strong rig utilization drove our topline results, along with fleet high-grading since last year, with the addition of 3 new ENSCO 120 Series jack-ups and 3 upgraded floaters that rejoined the operating fleet. Disciplined expense management also contributed to our bottom line results in the first quarter, as Jay will describe in great detail. Looking ahead, we believe there are opportunities for significant incremental cost savings as we described on our last call. I'm pleased to report that we are on track to achieve a 9% reduction in unit labor costs for offshore workers, plus $27 million in annual savings from streamlining our onshore workforce beginning in the second quarter of this year. We're also reducing cost through expediting stacking of rigs. As previously reported, we are completing the preservation process for ENSCO 8501  and ENSCO 8502. And we expect the rigs will be cold-stacked by the end of the second quarter. 
These steps will reduce operating costs until market conditions improve, at which time we will reactivate the rigs. As a reminder, we believe this is a prudent approach since 6 out of 7 of these rigs have uncontracted time this year, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where there is a significant supply demand imbalance. 
ENSCO 8501  and ENSCO 8502 just happened to be among the first 6 gen floaters  in the U.S. Gulf rolling off contract this year and we expect other drillers  will be making similar stacking decisions. Finally, in terms of our expense management plans, we also been working with vendors and suppliers to lower cost and improve equipment reliability. 
Turning now to capital management. We further improve our financial position by refinancing near-term debt maturities with 10- and 30-year notes that we issued during the first quarter. As a result, we now have no significant debt maturities until the second quarter of 2019. Both S&P and Moody's recently reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating and we continue to have significant liquidity and capital management flexibility with a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet and revenue backlog of about $8.4 billion. Now in terms of the market, as we noted on our last call, most customers are reevaluating their portfolios in light of lower commodity prices. Drilling demand deepwater remains very low and that have only been a handful of new floater pictures announced so far this year. For shallow water, average commodity price hurdles to support drilling are generally lower than deepwater. As such, we're seeing some customer activity in shallow water, although competition for these opportunities will be intense. 
While we continue to believe the current market conditions and excess rig supply will extend into the next year, we've seen some positive development that will ultimately help to rebalance the market. First, as we had predicted in second quarter last year, we've seen several announcements regarding floater scrapping that is taking rigs out of the system, plus cold-stacking of older floaters  and jack-ups that will likely lead to future scrapping. 
David will cover this, an other aspects of rig supply in great detail, including potential new build orders cancellations in Brazil. Second, we continue to see signs that the offshore sector across the supply chain is taking major strides to become more efficient and cost-effective, which will make offshore programs more competitive and lower the commodity price hurdles necessary to support additional drilling. And third, we believe there are meaningful opportunities to improve the quality management process across the supply chain in offshore drilling, which should ultimately lead to better equipment and workforce reliability. 
During the last upturn as all aspects of the supply chain were rushing to meet increasing demand, including hiring to fill new positions, inefficiencies crept into the system, quality suffered, average experience levels of offshore crews declined and the result was unacceptable levels of downtime. Now we're in an environment, where more attention can be placed on enhancing quality and crew competency, which should lead to meaningful efficiency gains that will also support our sector. 
The recent M&A announcement by 2 EMP companies highlighted that they believe deepwater  will continue to be a strategic high growth and profitable piece of their business. One that is projected to see significant future investment, particularly in Brazil, which has the largest offshore reserves of any country in the world. While the near-term focus by most market participants has been on pressures from current commodity prices, it's positive to see this endorsement and investment by some of the largest EMP companies in the deepwater sector. 
In closing, I'd like to say thank you to our Chairman, Dan Rabun, for his dedicated service to Ensco. Dan served as Ensco's CEO for more than 8 years, saw the company grow it's fleet and geographic presence significantly under his leadership. Dan is retiring as Chairman at our Annual Shareholders Meeting next month and we wish Dan and his family all of us. Paul Rowsey, our, our Lead director, who has been proposed for reelection to the board, is expected to be appointed Nonexecutive Chairman following the shareholders meeting. 
Now I'll will turn the call over to David."

In terms of customer demand, we've seen a limited number of incremental contracting opportunity since our last conference call. During this phase of the cyclical downturn, however, it is not uncommon to see low levels tenders and inquiries.",1025,"Thanks, Carl. In terms of customer demand, we've seen a limited number of incremental contracting opportunity since our last conference call. During this phase of the cyclical downturn, however, it is not uncommon to see low levels tenders and inquiries. We believe most well programs continue to be delayed rather than canceled and we expect that declining production will prompt future drilling demand. 
Given our global presence, we are actively pursuing nearly every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jack-ups. Looking out longer term, it is encouraging to see recently sales drawing interest from several major customers. This includes international frontier plays, such as Uruguay and established basins like the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the most recent lease sale saw successful bidders invest more than $0.5 billion on new acreage. I believe Ensco's strengths, including our #1 ranking in overall customer satisfaction and safety, give us a competitive edge as new contracting opportunities arise. In terms of global supply, we recently took delivery of ENSCO DS-9 and the rig is now undergoing customer specific enhancements for its initial contract. 
Since our last earnings call, more postponements have been announced for newbuild floaters  scheduled for delivery in 2015. As a result, approximately 20 new rigs are now scheduled for delivery by the end of 2015. More than half are contracted. Ensco's next drillship delivery, ENSCO DS-8, is among these contracted rigs and we expect the rig to commence its initial contract in the fourth quarter of this year. It remains to be seen if the other uncontracted delivers will be delayed in anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future. Recently, there has been many new stories regarding the build in Brazil program. In total, this program was initially expected to add 29 floaters  to the global supply by 2020, with all, but one of these rigs working for Petrobras on their presold development. 
Recent reports suggest more than half of these rigs may not be delivered and the remaining rigs are likely to be delayed. 2 of the newbuild floaters  currently scheduled for delivery in 2015 are built in Brazil rigs. An additional 8 are scheduled for delivery in 2016, but maybe delayed due to financial, shipyard and other issues. If these units were to be delayed or canceled, this could result in demand for rigs from the international market as Petrobras looks to meet production targets. 
Carl mentioned recent merger and acquisition activity by some of our customers, which is not only a strong indication of their commitment to deepwater, but also to Brazil in particular, where Ensco has extensive experience. I should add that upcoming lease rounds in Brazil and planned divestitures by Petrobras may lead to more customers entering this market. 
Moving to the order book for competitive jack-ups. There are approximately 50 newbuilds with expected deliveries by year-end 2015, all of which are uncontracted. More than 60% of these uncontracted deliveries are with companies that do not currently operate a rig, so remains to be seen whether these 30 plus units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation and delays of many new build jack-ups. This will likely continue as companies who ordered these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments given limited contracting opportunities. This in turn would put more pressure on shipyards that will have to assess continued investment in the construction of partially completed rigs. 
Turning now to scrapping and cold-stacking of floaters and jack-ups. It's reasonable to assume that offshore drillers will continue to rationalize their fleets to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn by scrapping older rigs with limited contracting opportunities that require CapEx to meet -- keep them certified to work, and cold-stacking other rig that did not have a recontracting opportunities. 
Since September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 33 floaters. Over the same time period, an additional 20 floaters have been cold stacked. We believe that the majority of these will also be scrapped. In total, these 53 rigs represent approximately 17% of competitive global supply. Additionally, more than 40 floaters with similar age and technical characteristics to the 33 scrapped  rigs, I just mentioned, are currently idle or will see their contracts expire in 2015, all will be likely candidates per scrapping and/or cold-stacking and, as a group, they're doubly approximately 20 floaters currently scheduled to enter the market by year end. 
We anticipate the scrapping and stacking trend will continue, which will help to improve the supply and demand balance. Similarly, on the jack-ups side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jack-ups, defined as independent leg cantilever rigs; 46 are stacked and older than 30 years of age; another 66 working rigs that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring in 2015. Major regular surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years, can be very expensive and involved tens of millions of dollars in upgrades In a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller undercapitalized drillers, these rigs maybe scrapped, cold-stacked or converted to non-drilling units. Additional information on the global supply of rigs, including details on new builds, scrapping and stacking, is provided in our investor presentation on our website. As previously reported, we received an early termination notice for convenience for ENSCO DS-4 that requires the customer to make an estimated cash payment of $160 million, thereby accelerating most of the rigs remaining contract backlog into the third quarter of 2015. 
We are now marketing this rig for new opportunities following the expected July termination date. We negotiated reduced day rates for several jack-ups with customers in the Middle East and the North Sea, as disclosed in our recent fleet status report, in order to continue the contracts. 
In closing, we remain focused on winning as many contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging Ensco's  differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record, our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel and the repetition among customers as the best offshore driller. 
Now, let me turn the call over to Jay."

Today, I'll start with our first quarter financial results, our second quarter 2015 outlook and then, I will wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press lease, earnings from continuin",1229,"Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our first quarter financial results, our second quarter 2015 outlook and then, I will wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press lease, earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for other expense of $0.11 per share to refinance debt, increased 18% from last year to $1.49. Total first quarter revenue increased 9% to $1.16 billion from a year ago, primarily due to more operating days as we added 3 new jack-ups and reinstated 3 upgraded floaters. These results reflect the strong operational and safety performance and expense management that our offshore crews and onshore personnel delivered during the quarter. 
Floaters segment revenue grew 7% to $695 million versus prior year as the ENSCO 5004, 5005 and 5006 returned to the operating fleet after completing shipyard upgrades. As a result, reported floater utilization increased to 86% from 75% a year ago, which more than offset a 9% decline in the average day rate $421,000 per day. Operational utilization for the Floater segment, which adjusts for uncontracted days and planned downtime, was 93% compared to 95% a year ago. Jack-ups segment revenue grew 7% to $428 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and ENSCO 122 to the active fleet. These jack-ups had exceptionally high uptime performance of nearly 100% in the first quarter. Reported utilization for the jack-up fleet was 87% compared to 86% a year ago, and the average day rate increased 7% to $144,000. The addition of 3 ENSCO 120 Series rigs to the fleet contributed to the increase in average day rates. 
Operational utilization for the total jack-up fleet was an impressive 99.6%, the highest level that we've achieved in the past 3 years. 
First quarter total contract drilling expense decreased to $518 million from $520 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and repair and maintenance costs, more than offset $45 million of additional contract drilling expense related to growth in our operating fleet. Depreciation expense increased $6 million to $137 million, in line with our expectations due to adding rigs to the active fleet. 
General and administrative expense for the quarter was $30 million, also in line with our outlook and $8 million less than a year ago, primarily due to lower discretionary compensation and disciplined expense management. As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $73 million from $29 million a year ago for reasons. Costs related to refinancing our 2016 debt maturities increased other net by $27 million, as shown in our earnings release; and interest expense was $18 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt raise during third quarter 2014. 
Now, let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline from first quarter results of $1.16 billion as lower reported utilization and average day rates across the fleet are expected to more than offset a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 5006. For our entire fleet in continuing operations, we expect reported utilization to be in the high 70% range, compared to the 86% in the first quarter. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 5% from first quarter levels of $244,000. We anticipate second quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 2% from $518 million in the first quarter, primarily due to more operating days from ENSCO 5006; and approximately $18 million off of upfront expenses to cold-stacked rigs, which will reduce operating cost on these rigs in future periods until they are reactivated. 
Here is a breakdown of cost to complete the preservation process for cold-stacking. Approximately $2 million in total for 4 jack-ups, plus approximately $8 million each for ENSCO 8501 and 8502. These stacking costs are significant because our stacking process for these floaters involves careful preservation, including key equipment and preventing corrosion of the hole. 
We expect second quarter G&A expenses to be in line with the first quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $141 million as ENSCO 5006 operates for a full quarter. In total, other expenses estimated to be $54 million in the second quarter. This breaks down as follows: interest expense of $51 million, interest income of $3 million and other expense of $7 million due to the retirement of the remaining 2016 maturities that were not fully tendered during the first quarter, plus retirement of some smaller debt maturities. 
Now, I'll provide an update on the cost reduction plans announced on our last call. The cold-stacking process for ENSCO 8501 and 8502 is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter, at which time cash costs for these 8500 Series rigs will be less than $10,000 per day. Cash savings will be approximately $120,000 per day. The cold-stacking process for 4 jack-ups, 3 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and 1 in the Middle East, is also expected to be completed by midyear. 
Once cold-stacked, cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day with cash savings of approximately $40,000 per day. We remain on target for a 9% reduction in average offshore unit labor costs from 2014 level beginning in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this will translate into meaningful cost savings since about half of 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 million was offshore compensation. 
Earlier this year, we reduced onshore personnel by 15% company wide. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is expected to be $27 million beginning in second quarter 2015. We are also negotiating cost reductions with vendors and suppliers that are expected to reduce expense and capital expenditures going forward. 
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have the highest credit-rating among the major offshore drillers, with investment grade ratings from both S&P and Moody's: $8.4 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place. $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments, a net debt to cap ratio of 31%, and by virtue of our recent debt financing no significant debt maturities until 2019, plus a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us a sufficient liquidity and capital management flexibility. We expect capital expenditures for the remainder of 2015 to be approximately $1.7 billion, including $1.35 billion in newbuild CapEx, $175 million for rig enhancement projects and $175 million for sustaining projects. 
As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than $1 billion. In conclusion, I want to emphasize our focus on the controllable aspects of our business during the current downturn. We remain committed to proactive cost control, including an aggressive expense and cash management program that will drive sustainable cost reductions. For example, we'll continue to stack rigs rolling off contracts that do not have near-term contracting opportunities with customers. Our recent actions on the capital markets have further strengthened our liquidity and capital position, giving us more flexibility to navigate the downturn. We have maintained our strong investment grade credit ratings, something that Ensco has always believed is tragically important, especially during the downcycle, and we are the highest rated company in our sector. 
This will allow us to focus on further improving operational, safety and financial performance, better positioning Ensco in the near-term and for the inevitable up cycle. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

I mean, it's absolutely clear that we're in the midst of a really significant downturn for the sector, which is hitting whole of the sector, but is exasperate for the offshore drillers because of the new capacity that's coming to the market. And the pace and aggressiveness with which client customers have backed off programs and cut CapEx is quite unprecedented. So -- but that said, we find ourselves at the moment in the marketplace exactly where we thought we would be, not better, not worst than we saw at the quarter or 2 quarters ago, when we took some of the decisions that you saw and you've seen strengthening the balance sheet and the decision we took on the dividend. Now as we said in the prepared statements, what we have seen in the market is, we've seen little bits of activity, some activity in the shallow water jack-up market, some early indication of inquiries in -- tender inquiries for later in '15 and going into '16, but these are -- I do want to overplay that, they are -- it's small and spread around the world and competition for those will be peers. In the market, we've seen almost nothing new. The number of placements and the opportunities that are out there, that everyone knows about, have been around for quite a while. So there is nothing materially new developed. And I think in this -- and we believe that these market conditions are certainly going to last through '15 and as we go into and then to '16. Now I think as we move into this second half of the year and we hopefully if we see oil prices stabilized a bit or even up a little bit from where they are, we will see clients begin to do a little bits of work. And proposals that we might see shorter-term one-off to 3 well extensions, things like that, I think is a reasonable assumption for the activity you might see in '15."

Now if we jump out further on, as we said -- as I said earlier on, I think that a lot of those market conditions will go over into '16. When we start to see a turnaround, when we start to see enough incremental pick up inclined activity to start to absorb some of the additional capacity is an open question, but I think it will be driven by 2 key drivers. The first one and that reason be obvious, but the first one is oil price insomuch as it pertains to free cash flow for our customers -- increasing free cash flow for our customers and also sentiment. And the second one is the degree and the speed with which we see rig and stacking, and to some extent, company failure or consolidation.  and  I think the rate with which those 2 things happened will very much depend on when we see a pickup. And in our view, we don't foresee that before mid '16, but it could happen earlier, if we see more rapid action. Now as we've said, if you start to look a little bit longer term, we do see some positive actions in the sense that the rates of retirement for rigs has really started to pick up in the last quarter or 2 and we think that will continue. There is a significant number of older rigs, both in the Floater segment and the jack-up segments, rolling off contract during '15, I mean these are very old rigs and we would expect most of these to be retired and probably ultimately never returned to the marketplace. As we said in the prepared statement, what -- it's 1 event, but I think it's significant in that the first piece of M&A activity, we've seen in the space has been basically driven by a view of the profitability of deepwater in particularly Brazil. So I think the data points that are out there are still positive. And we've taken along hard look at this and we truly believe that the offshore production is going to play a major part in the world's energy supply going forward. It currently makes up 7% of global supply. I don't believe that, that can be and will be replaced by something else. It is the potential to grow and that the major reserves that have been developed -- discovered over the last decade or so will be developed. So we will see eventually an upturn in activity and we will see a return to offshore and deepwater drilling."

269488,290567129,802113,"Ensco plc, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were highlighted by strong operational safety and financial performance.

First quarter results were highlighted by strong operational safety and financial performance. As noted in our press release, we had 99.6% operational utilization for jackups, record safety results and an 18% increase in earnings per share adjusted for expenses to refinance debt. Our offshore crews and onshore personnel are to be commended for this performance, which is consistent with our #1 ranking in customer satisfaction. 
Strong rig utilization drove our topline results, along with fleet high-grading since last year, with the addition of 3 new ENSCO 120 Series jackups and 3 upgraded floaters that rejoined the operating fleet. Disciplined expense management also contributed to our bottom line results in the first quarter, as Jay will describe in great detail. 
Looking ahead, we believe there are opportunities for significant incremental cost savings as we described on our last call. I'm pleased to report that we are on track to achieve a 9% reduction in unit labor costs for offshore workers, plus $27 million in annual savings from streamlining our onshore workforce beginning in the second quarter of this year. We are also reducing cost through expedited stacking of rigs. As previously reported, we are completing the preservation process for ENSCO 8501  and ENSCO 8502, and we expect the rigs will be cold stacked by the end of the second quarter. These steps will reduce operating costs until market conditions improve, at which time we will reactivate the rigs. 
As a reminder, we believe this is a prudent approach since 6 out of 7 of these rigs have uncontracted time this year, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where there is a significant supply/demand imbalance. 
ENSCO 8501  and ENSCO 8502 just happened to be among the first 6-gen floaters in the U.S. Gulf rolling off contract this year, and we expect other drillers will be making similar stacking decisions. 
Finally, in terms of our expense management plans, we have also been working with vendors and suppliers to lower cost and improve equipment reliability. 
Turning now to capital management. We further improve our financial position by refinancing near-term debt maturities with 10- and 30-year notes that we issued during the first quarter. As a result, we now have no significant debt maturities until the second quarter of 2019. 
Both S&P and Moody's recently reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating, and we continue to have significant liquidity and capital management flexibility with a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet and revenue backlog of about $8.4 billion. 
Now in terms of the market, as we noted on our last call, most customers are reevaluating their portfolios in light of lower commodity prices. Drilling demand in deepwater remains very low, and there have only been a handful of new floater fixtures announced so far this year. For shallow water, average commodity price hurdles that support drilling are generally lower than deepwater. As such, we are seeing some customer activity in shallow water, although competition for these opportunities will be intense. 
While we continue to believe the current market conditions and excess rig supply will extend into next year, we have seen some positive development that will ultimately help to rebalance the market. First, as we had predicted in second quarter last year, we have seen several announcements regarding floater scrapping that is taking rigs out of the system, plus cold stacking of older floaters and jackups that will likely lead to future scrapping. David will cover this and other aspects of rig supply in great detail, including potential new build orders cancellations in Brazil. 
Second, we continue to see signs that the offshore sector across the supply chain is taking major strides to become more efficient and cost-effective, which will make offshore programs more competitive and lower the commodity price hurdles necessary to support additional drilling. 
And third, we believe there are meaningful opportunities to improve the quality management process across the supply chain in offshore drilling, which should ultimately lead to better equipment and workforce reliability. 
During the last upturn as all aspects of the supply chain were rushing to meet increasing demand, including hiring to fill new positions, inefficiencies crept into the system. Quality suffered. Average experience levels of offshore crews declined, and the result was unacceptable levels of downtime. Now we are in an environment where more attention can be placed on enhancing quality and crew competency, which should lead to meaningful efficiency gains that will also support our sector. 
A recent M&A announcement by 2 E&P companies highlighted that they believe deepwater will continue to be a strategic high growth and profitable piece of their business, one that is projected to see significant future investment, particularly in Brazil, which has the largest offshore reserves of any country in the world. While the near-term focus by most market participants has been on pressures from current commodity prices. It's positive to see this endorsement and investment by some of the largest E&P companies in the deepwater sector. 
In closing, I'd like to say thank you to our Chairman, Dan Rabun, for his dedicated service to Ensco. Dan served as Ensco's CEO for more than 8 years, saw the company grow its fleet and geographic presence significantly under his leadership. Dan is retiring as Chairman at our Annual Shareholders Meeting next month, and we wish Dan and his family all the best. 
Paul Rowsey, our lead director, who has been proposed for reelection to the board, is expected to be appointed Nonexecutive Chairman following the Shareholders Meeting. 
Now I will turn the call over to David."

In terms of customer demand, we have seen a limited number of incremental contracting opportunities since our last conference call. During this phase of the cyclical downturn, however, it is not uncommon to see low levels of tenders and inquiries. We believe most well programs continue to be delayed rather than canceled, and we expect that declining production will prompt future drilling demand. Given our global presence, we are actively pursuing nearly every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jackups. 
Looking out longer term, it is encouraging to see recent lease sales drawing interest from several major customers. This includes international frontier plays, such as Uruguay and established basins like the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the most recent lease sale saw successful bidders invest more than $0.5 billion on new acreage. 
I believe Ensco's strengths, including our #1 ranking in overall customer satisfaction and safety, give us a competitive edge as new contracting opportunities arise. 
In terms of global supply, we recently took delivery of ENSCO DS-9, and the rig is now undergoing customer specific enhancements for its initial contract. 
Since our last earnings call, more postponements have been announced for newbuild floaters  scheduled for delivery in 2015. As a result, approximately 20 new rigs are now scheduled for delivery by the end of 2015. More than half are contracted. Ensco's next drillship delivery, ENSCO DS-8, is among these contracted rigs. And we expect the rig to commence its initial contract in the fourth quarter of this year. It remains to be seen if the other uncontracted deliveries will be delayed in anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future. 
Recently, there had been many new stories regarding the build in Brazil program. In total, this program was initially expected to add 29 floaters to the global supply by 2020, with all but one of these rigs working for Petrobras on their presalt development. 
Recent reports suggest more than half of these rigs may not be delivered and the remaining rigs are likely to be delayed. Two of the newbuild floaters  currently scheduled for delivery in 2015 are built in Brazil rigs. An additional 8 are scheduled for delivery in 2016, but may be delayed due to financial, shipyard and other issues. If these units were to be delayed or canceled, this could result in demand for rigs from the international market as Petrobras looks to meet production targets. 
Carl mentioned recent merger and acquisition activity by some of our customers, which is not only a strong indication of their commitment to deepwater, but also to Brazil in particular, where Ensco has extensive experience. I should add that upcoming lease rounds in Brazil and planned divestitures by Petrobras may lead to more customers entering this market. 
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups. There are approximately 50 newbuilds with expected deliveries by year-end 2015, all of which are uncontracted. More than 60% of these uncontracted deliveries are with companies that do not currently operate a rig, so it remains to be seen whether these 30-plus units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation and delays of many newbuild jackups. This will likely continue as companies who ordered these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments given limited contracting opportunities. This in turn would put more pressure on shipyards that will have to assess continued investment in the construction of partially completed rigs. 
Turning now to scrapping and cold-stacking of floaters and jackups. It's reasonable to assume that offshore drillers will continue to rationalize their fleets to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn by scrapping older rigs with limited contracting opportunities that require CapEx to meet -- keep them certified to work and cold stacking other rig that did not have recontracting opportunities. 
Since September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 33 floaters. Over the same time period, an additional 20 floaters have been cold stacked. We believe that the majority of these will also be scrapped. In total, these 53 rigs represent approximately 17% of competitive global supply. Additionally, more than 40 floaters with similar age and technical characteristics to the 33 scrapped rigs I just mentioned are currently idle or will see their contracts expire in 2015. All will be likely candidates per scrapping and/or cold stacking, and as a group, they are double the approximately 20 floaters currently scheduled to enter the market by year-end. We anticipate the scrapping and stacking trend will continue, which will help to improve the supply and demand balance. 
Similarly, on the jackups side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jackups, defined as independent leg cantilever rigs. 46 are stacked and older than 30 years of age. Another 66 working rigs that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring in 2015. 
Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years, can be very expensive and involve tens of millions of dollars in upgrades In a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller undercapitalized drillers, these rigs may be scrapped, cold stacked or converted to nondrilling units. Additional information on the global supply of rigs, including details on newbuilds, scrapping and stacking, is provided in our investor presentation on our website. 
As previously reported, we received an early termination notice for convenience for ENSCO DS-4 that requires the customer to make an estimated cash payment of $160 million, thereby accelerating most of the rigs remaining contract backlog into the third quarter of 2015. We are now marketing this rig for new opportunities following the expected July termination date. We negotiated reduced day rates for several jackups with customers in the Middle East and the North Sea, as disclosed in our recent fleet status report, in order to continue the contracts. 
In closing, we remain focused on winning as many contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging Ensco's differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record, our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel and the reputation among customers as the best offshore driller. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

Today, I will start with our first quarter financial results, our second quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments.

Today, I will start with our first quarter financial results, our second quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. 
As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for other expense of $0.11 per share to refinance debt, increased 18% from last year to $1.49. Total first quarter revenue increased 9% to $1.16 billion from a year ago, primarily due to more operating days as we added 3 new jackups and reinstated 3 upgraded floaters. These results reflect the strong operational and safety performance and expense management that our offshore crews and onshore personnel delivered during the quarter. 
Floaters segment revenue grew 7% to $695 million versus prior year as the ENSCO 5004, 5005 and 5006 returned to the operating fleet after completing shipyard upgrades. As a result, reported floater utilization increased to 86% from 75% a year ago, which more than offset a 9% decline in the average day rate to $421,000 per day. Operational utilization for the Floaters segment, which adjusts for uncontracted days and planned downtime, was 93% compared to 95% a year ago. 
Jackups segment revenue grew 7% to $428 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and ENSCO 122 to the active fleet. These jackups had exceptionally high uptime performance of nearly 100% in the first quarter. Reported utilization for the jackup fleet was 87% compared to 86% a year ago, and the average day rate increased 7% to $144,000. The addition of 3 ENSCO 120 Series rigs to the fleet contributed to the increase in average day rates. Operational utilization for the total jackup fleet was an impressive 99.6%, the highest level that we've achieved in the past 3 years. 
First quarter total contract drilling expense decreased to $518 million from $520 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and repair and maintenance costs more than offset $45 million of additional contract drilling expense related to growth in our operating fleet. Depreciation expense increased $6 million to $137 million, in line with our expectations due to adding rigs to the active fleet. General and administrative expense for the quarter was $30 million, also in line with our outlook and $8 million less than a year ago, primarily due to lower discretionary compensation and disciplined expense management. 
As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $73 million from $29 million a year ago for 2 key reasons: costs related to refinancing our 2016 debt maturities increased other net by $27 million, as shown in our earnings release; and interest expense was $18 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt raise during third quarter 2014. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline from first quarter results of $1.16 billion as lower reported utilization and average day rates across the fleet are expected to more than offset a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 5006. For our entire fleet in continuing operations, we expect reported utilization to be in the high 70% range compared to 86% in the first quarter. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 5% from first quarter levels of $244,000. We anticipate second quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 2% from $518 million in the first quarter, primarily due to more operating days from ENSCO 5006; and approximately $18 million of upfront expenses to cold-stacked rigs, which will reduce operating cost on these rigs in future periods until they are reactivated. 
Here is a breakdown of cost to complete the preservation process for cold stacking: approximately $2 million in total for 4 jackups plus approximately $8 million each for ENSCO 8501 and 8502. These stacking costs are significant because our stacking process for these floaters involves careful preservation, including dehumidifying key equipment and preventing corrosion of the hole. 
We expect second quarter G&A expenses to be in line with the first quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $141 million as ENSCO 5006 operates for a full quarter. In total, other expense is estimated to be $54 million in the second quarter. This breaks down as follows: interest expense of $51 million, interest income of $3 million and other expense of $7 million due to the retirement of the remaining 2016 maturities that were not fully tendered during the first quarter, plus a retirement of some smaller debt maturities. 
Now I will provide an update on the cost reduction plans announced on our last call. The cold-stacking process for ENSCO 8501 and 8502 is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter, at which time cash costs for these 8500 Series rigs will be less than $10,000 per day. Cash savings will be approximately $120,000 per day. The cold-stacking process for 4 jackups, 3 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and 1 in the Middle East, is also expected to be completed by midyear. Once cold stacked, cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day with cash savings of approximately $40,000 per day. 
We remain on target for a 9% reduction in average offshore unit labor costs from 2014 levels beginning in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this will translate into meaningful cost savings since about half of 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 billion was offshore compensation. 
Earlier this year, we reduced onshore personnel by 15% company-wide. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is expected to be $27 million beginning in second quarter 2015. We are also negotiating cost reductions with vendors and suppliers that are expected to reduce expense and capital expenditures going forward. 
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have the highest credit-rating among the major offshore drillers, with investment grade ratings from both S&P and Moody's; $8.4 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place; $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments; a net debt-to-cap ratio of 31%; and by virtue of our recent debt financing, no significant debt maturities until 2019; plus a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us a sufficient liquidity and capital management flexibility. We expect capital expenditures for the remainder of 2015 to be approximately $1.7 billion, including $1.35 billion in newbuild CapEx, $175 million for rig enhancement projects and $175 million for sustaining projects. As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than $1 billion. 
In conclusion, I want to emphasize our focus on the controllable aspects of our business during the current downturn. We remain committed to proactive cost control, including an aggressive expense and cash management program that will drive sustainable cost reductions. For example, we will continue to stack rigs rolling off contracts that do not have near-term contracting opportunities with customers. Our recent actions on the capital markets have further strengthened our liquidity and capital position, giving us more flexibility to navigate the downturn. We have maintained our strong investment grade credit ratings, something that Ensco has always believed is tragically important, especially during the down cycle. And we are the highest rated company in our sector. This will allow us to focus on further improving operational, safety and financial performance, better positioning Ensco in the near term and for the inevitable up cycle. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

What we've done in the process of doing this is look very carefully at the preservation of some of the critical equipment and also the ease with which we can bring it back. And a lot of that has led us to make the decisions of removing some of the critical equipment and put it in temperature-controlled environments and to take off with a bit of critical equipment, and we have power to the rig dehumidify certain areas. But in the process of doing this, we've actually, from our first estimates, dropped the cost to stack these rigs by about $3 million, $4 million per rig.

I mean, it's absolutely clear that we're in the midst of a really significant downturn for the sector, which is hitting the whole of the E&P sector, but is exasperate for the offshore drillers because of the new capacity that's coming to the market. And the pace and aggressiveness with which client/customers have backed off programs and cut CapEx is quite unprecedented. So -- but that said, we find ourselves at the moment in the marketplace exactly where we thought we would be, not better, not worst than we saw at the quarter or 2 quarters ago, when we took some of the decisions that you saw and you've seen us do on strengthening the balance sheet and the decision we took on the dividend. Now as we said in the prepared statements, what we have seen in the market is we've seen little bits of activity, some activity in the shallow water jackup market, some early indication of inquiries and tender inquiries for the -- for later in '15 and going into '16. But these are -- I don't want to overplay that. They are -- it's small and spread around the world, and competition for those will be fierce. In the floater market, we've seen almost nothing new. The number of placements and the opportunities that are out there that everyone knows about have been around for quite a while, so there is nothing materially new developed. And I think in this -- and we believe that these market conditions are certainly going to last through '15 and as we go into and then to '16. Now I think as we move into the second half of the year and we -- hopefully, if we see oil prices, Brent, stabilized a bit or even up a little bit from where they are, we will see clients begin to do little bits of work. And your proposal that we might see shorter-term one-off to 3 well extensions, things like that, I think is a reasonable assumption for the activity you might see in '15."

Now if we jump out further on, as we said -- as I said earlier on, I think that a lot of those market conditions will go over into '16. When we start to see a turnaround and when we start to see enough incremental pickup inclined activity to start to absorb some of the additional capacity is an open question, but I think it will be driven by 2 key drivers. The first one, and that reason is obvious, but the first one is oil price insomuch as it pertains to free cash flow for our customers -- increasing free cash flow for our customers and also sentiment. And the second one is the degree and the speed with which we see rig retirement and stacking and, to some extent, company failure or consolidation. And I think this -- the rate with which those 2 things happen will very much depend on when we see a pickup. And in our view, we don't foresee that much before mid '16, but it could happen earlier if we see more rapid action. Now as we've said, if you start to look a little bit longer term, we do see some positive actions in the sense the rates of retirement for rigs has really started to pick up in the last quarter or 2. And we think that, that will continue. There's a significant number of older rigs both in the floater segment and the jackup segments rolling off contract during '15. I mean, these are very old rigs, and we would expect most of these to be retired and probably ultimately never return to the marketplace. As we said in the prepared statement, what -- it's one event, but I think it's significant in that the first piece of M&A activity we've seen in the E&P space has been basically driven by a view of the profitability of deepwater in, particularly, Brazil. So I think the data points that are out there are still positive. And we've taken a long, hard look at this, and we truly believe that the offshore production is going to play a major part in the world's energy supply going forward. It currently makes up 7% of global supply. I don't believe that, that can be and will be replaced by something else. It has the potential to grow, and that the major reserves that have been developed -- discovered over the last few -- last decade or so will be developed. So we will see eventually an upturn in activity, and we will see a return to offshore and deepwater drilling."

One of the issues you've got to find is the location to be able to stack the rig. But if you think about it in these terms, many companies at the moment are deferring out the delivery of their new drillships, and effectively that is cold stacking in the shipyards. And the process you would go through will be not greatly dissimilar. But I think, just to be clear, we had the early termination on DS-4. But at this stage, we are not going to cold stack the DS-4. We are going to continue to market it, which we have the right to do under the termination agreement. So we have not taken the decision to cold stack a drillship yet.

And then the -- where you can remove some of the sensitivity equipment and put it in a environmentally-controlled area. Obviously, that's a positive.

269488,290567129,802194,"Ensco plc, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Sean. And good morning, everyone.

First quarter results were highlighted by strong operational safety and financial performance. As noted in our press release, we had 99.6% operational utilization for jackups, record safety results and an 18% increase in earnings per share adjusted for expenses to refinance debt. Our offshore crews and onshore personnel are to be commended for this performance, which is consistent with our #1 ranking in customer satisfaction. 
Strong rig utilization drove our top line results, along with fleet high grading since last year, with the addition of 3 new ENSCO 120 Series jackups and 3 upgraded floaters that rejoined the operating fleet. Disciplined expense management also contributed to our bottom line results in the first quarter, as Jay will describe in great detail. 
Looking ahead, we believe there are opportunities for significant incremental cost savings as we described on our last call. I'm pleased to report that we are on track to achieve a 9% reduction in unit labor costs for offshore workers, plus $27 million in annual savings from streamlining our onshore workforce beginning in the second quarter of this year. We are also reducing cost through expedited stacking of rigs. As previously reported, we are completing the preservation process for ENSCO 8501  and ENSCO 8502, and we expect the rigs will be cold stacked by the end of the second quarter. These steps will reduce operating costs until market conditions improve, at which time we will reactivate the rigs. 
As a reminder, we believe this is a prudent approach since 6 out of 7 of these rigs have uncontracted time this year, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where there is a significant supply/demand imbalance. 
ENSCO 8501  and ENSCO 8502 just happened to be among the first 6-gen floaters in the U.S. Gulf rolling off contract this year, and we expect other drillers will be making similar stacking decisions. 
Finally, in terms of our expense management plans, we have also been working with vendors and suppliers to lower cost and improve equipment reliability. 
Turning now to capital management. We further improved our financial position by refinancing near-term debt maturities with 10- and 30-year notes that we issued during the first quarter. As a result, we now have no significant debt maturities until the second quarter of 2019. 
Both S&P and Moody's recently reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating, and we continue to have significant liquidity and capital management flexibility with a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet and revenue backlog of about $8.4 billion. 
Now in terms of the market, as we noted on our last call, most customers are reevaluating their portfolios in light of lower commodity prices. Drilling demand in deepwater remains very low, and there have only been a handful of new floater fixtures announced so far this year. For shallow water, average commodity price hurdles that support drilling are generally lower than deepwater. As such, we are seeing some customer activity in shallow water, although competition for these opportunities will be intense. 
While we continue to believe the current market conditions and excess rig supply will extend into next year, we have seen some positive development that will ultimately help to rebalance the market. First, as we had predicted in second quarter last year, we have seen several announcements regarding floater scrapping that is taking rigs out of the system, plus cold stacking of older floaters and jackups that will likely lead to future scrapping. David will cover this and other aspects of rig supply in great detail, including potential new build orders cancellations in Brazil. 
Second, we continue to see signs that the offshore sector across the supply chain is taking major strides to become more efficient and cost-effective, which will make offshore programs more competitive and lower the commodity price hurdles necessary to support additional drilling. 
And third, we believe there are meaningful opportunities to improve the quality management process across the supply chain in offshore drilling, which should ultimately lead to better equipment and workforce reliability. 
During the last upturn as all aspects of the supply chain were rushing to meet increasing demand, including hiring to fill new positions, inefficiencies crept into the system. Quality suffered. Average experience levels of offshore crews declined, and the result was unacceptable levels of downtime. Now we are in an environment where more attention can be placed on enhancing quality and crew competency, which should lead to meaningful efficiency gains that will also support our sector. 
A recent M&A announcement by 2 E&P companies highlighted that they believe deepwater will continue to be a strategic high growth and profitable piece of their business, one that is projected to see significant future investment, particularly in Brazil, which has the largest offshore reserves of any country in the world. While the near-term focus by most market participants has been on pressures from current commodity prices. It's positive to see this endorsement and investment by some of the largest E&P companies in the deepwater sector. 
In closing, I'd like to say thank you to our Chairman, Dan Rabun, for his dedicated service to Ensco. Dan served as Ensco's CEO for more than 8 years, saw the company grow its fleet and geographic presence significantly under his leadership. Dan is retiring as Chairman at our Annual Shareholders Meeting next month, and we wish Dan and his family all the best. 
Paul Rowsey, our lead director, who has been proposed for reelection to the board, is expected to be appointed Nonexecutive Chairman following the Shareholders Meeting. 
Now I will turn the call over to David."

In terms of customer demand, we have seen a limited number of incremental contracting opportunities since our last conference call. During this phase of the cyclical downturn, however, it is not uncommon to see low levels of tenders and inquiries. We believe most well programs continue to be delayed rather than canceled, and we expect that declining production will prompt future drilling demand. Given our global presence, we are actively pursuing nearly every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jackups. 
Looking out longer term, it is encouraging to see recent lease sales drawing interest from several major customers. This includes international frontier plays, such as Uruguay, and established basins like the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the most recent lease sale saw successful bidders invest more than $0.5 billion on new acreage. 
I believe Ensco's strengths, including our #1 ranking in overall customer satisfaction and safety, give us a competitive edge as new contracting opportunities arise. 
In terms of global supply, we recently took delivery of ENSCO DS-9, and the rig is now undergoing customer specific enhancements for its initial contract. 
Since our last earnings call, more postponements have been announced for newbuild floaters  scheduled for delivery in 2015. As a result, approximately 20 new rigs are now scheduled for delivery by the end of 2015. More than half are contracted. Ensco's next drillship delivery, ENSCO DS-8, is among these contracted rigs. And we expect the rig to commence its initial contract in the fourth quarter of this year. It remains to be seen if the other uncontracted deliveries will be delayed in anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future. 
Recently, there have been many news stories regarding the build in Brazil program. In total, this program was initially expected to add 29 floaters to the global supply by 2020, with all but 1 of these rigs working for Petrobras on their presalt development. 
Recent reports suggest more than half of these rigs may not be delivered, and the remaining rigs are likely to be delayed. Two of the newbuild floaters  currently scheduled for delivery in 2015 are build in Brazil rigs. An additional 8 are scheduled for delivery in 2016 but may be delayed due to financial, shipyard and other issues. If these units were to be delayed or canceled, this could result in demand for rigs from the international market as Petrobras looks to meet production targets. 
Carl mentioned recent merger and acquisition activity by some of our customers, which is not only a strong indication of their commitment to deepwater but also to Brazil in particular, where Ensco has extensive experience. I should add that upcoming lease rounds in Brazil and planned divestitures by Petrobras may lead to more customers entering this market. 
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups. There are approximately 50 newbuilds with expected deliveries by year-end 2015, all of which are uncontracted. More than 60% of these uncontracted deliveries are with companies that do not currently operate a rig, so it remains to be seen whether these 30-plus units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation and delays of many newbuild jackups. This will likely continue as companies who ordered these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments given limited contracting opportunities. This in turn would put more pressure on shipyards that will have to assess continued investment in the construction of partially completed rigs. 
Turning now to scrapping and cold stacking of floaters and jackups. It's reasonable to assume that offshore drillers will continue to rationalize their fleets to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn by scrapping older rigs with limited contracting opportunities that require CapEx to meet -- keep them certified to work and cold stacking other rig that did not have recontracting opportunities. 
Since September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 33 floaters. Over the same time period, an additional 20 floaters have been cold stacked. We believe that the majority of these will also be scrapped. In total, these 53 rigs represent approximately 17% of competitive global supply. Additionally, more than 40 floaters with similar age and technical characteristics to the 33 scrapped rigs I just mentioned are currently idle or will see their contracts expire in 2015. All will be likely candidates for scrapping and/or cold stacking, and as a group, they are double the approximately 20 floaters currently scheduled to enter the market by year end. We anticipate the scrapping and stacking trend will continue, which will help to improve the supply and demand balance. 
Similarly, on the jackups side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jackups, defined as independent leg cantilever rigs; 46 are stacked and older than 30 years of age. Another 66 working rigs that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring in 2015. 
Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years, can be very expensive and involve tens of millions of dollars in upgrades In a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller undercapitalized drillers, these rigs may be scrapped, cold stacked or converted to nondrilling units. Additional information on the global supply of rigs, including details on newbuilds, scrapping and stacking, is provided in our investor presentation on our website. 
As previously reported, we received an early termination notice for convenience for ENSCO DS-4 that requires the customer to make an estimated cash payment of $160 million, thereby accelerating most of the rigs remaining contract backlog into the third quarter of 2015. We are now marketing this rig for new opportunities following the expected July termination date. We negotiated reduced day rates for several jackups with customers in the Middle East and the North Sea, as disclosed in our recent fleet status report, in order to continue the contracts. 
In closing, we remain focused on winning as many contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging Ensco's differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record, our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel and the reputation among customers as the best offshore driller. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

Today, I will start with our first quarter financial results, our second quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. 
As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for other expense of $0.11 per share to refinance debt, increased 18% from last year to $1.49. Total first quarter revenue increased 9% to $1.16 billion from a year ago, primarily due to more operating days as we added 3 new jackups and reinstated 3 upgraded floaters. These results reflect the strong operational and safety performance and expense management that our offshore crews and onshore personnel delivered during the quarter. 
Floaters segment revenue grew 7% to $695 million versus prior year as the ENSCO 5004, 5005 and 5006 returned to the operating fleet after completing shipyard upgrades. As a result, reported floater utilization increased to 86% from 75% a year ago, which more than offset a 9% decline in the average day rate to $421,000 per day. Operational utilization for the Floaters segment, which adjusts for uncontracted days and planned downtime, was 93% compared to 95% a year ago. 
Jackups segment revenue grew 7% to $428 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and ENSCO 122 to the active fleet. These jackups had exceptionally high uptime performance of nearly 100% in the first quarter. Reported utilization for the jackup fleet was 87% compared to 86% a year ago, and the average day rate increased 7% to $144,000. The addition of 3 ENSCO 120 Series rigs to the fleet contributed to the increase in average day rates. Operational utilization for the total jackup fleet was an impressive 99.6%, the highest level that we've achieved in the past 3 years. 
First quarter total contract drilling expense decreased to $518 million from $520 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and repair and maintenance costs, more than offset $45 million of additional contract drilling expense related to growth in our operating fleet. Depreciation expense increased $6 million to $137 million, in line with our expectations due to adding rigs to the active fleet. General and administrative expense for the quarter was $30 million, also in line with our outlook, and $8 million less than a year ago, primarily due to lower discretionary compensation and disciplined expense management. 
As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $73 million from $29 million a year ago for 2 key reasons: Costs related to refinancing our 2016 debt maturities increased other net by $27 million, as shown in our earnings release; and interest expense was $18 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt raise during third quarter 2014. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline from first quarter results of $1.16 billion as lower reported utilization and average day rates across the fleet are expected to more than offset a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 5006. For our entire fleet in continuing operations, we expect reported utilization to be in the high 70% range compared to 86% in the first quarter. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 5% from first quarter levels of $244,000. We anticipate second quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 2% from $518 million in the first quarter, primarily due to more operating days from ENSCO 5006; and approximately $18 million of upfront expenses to cold-stacked rigs, which will reduce operating cost on these rigs in future periods until they are reactivated. 
Here is a breakdown of cost to complete the preservation process for cold stacking: approximately $2 million in total for 4 jackups plus approximately $8 million each for ENSCO 8501 and 8502. These stacking costs are significant because our stacking process for these floaters involves careful preservation, including dehumidifying key equipment and preventing corrosion of the hull. 
We expect second quarter G&A expenses to be in line with the first quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $141 million as ENSCO 5006 operates for a full quarter. In total, other expense is estimated to be $54 million in the second quarter. This breaks down as follows: interest expense of $51 million, interest income of $3 million and other expense of $7 million due to the retirement of the remaining 2016 maturities that were not fully tendered during the first quarter, plus the retirement of some smaller debt maturities. 
Now I will provide an update on the cost reduction plans announced on our last call. The cold-stacking process for ENSCO 8501 and 8502 is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter, at which time cash costs for these 8500 Series rigs will be less than $10,000 per day. Cash savings will be approximately $120,000 per day. The cold-stacking process for 4 jackups, 3 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and 1 in the Middle East, is also expected to be completed by midyear. Once cold stacked, cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day with cash savings of approximately $40,000 per day. 
We remain on target for a 9% reduction in average offshore unit labor costs from 2014 levels beginning in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this will translate into meaningful cost savings since about half of 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 billion was offshore compensation. 
Earlier this year, we reduced onshore personnel by 15% company-wide. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is expected to be $27 million beginning in second quarter 2015. We are also negotiating cost reductions with vendors and suppliers that are expected to reduce expense and capital expenditures going forward. 
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have the highest credit rating among the major offshore drillers, with investment grade ratings from both S&P and Moody's; $8.4 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place; $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments; a net debt-to-cap ratio of 31%; and by virtue of our recent debt financing, no significant debt maturities until 2019; plus a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us sufficient liquidity and capital management flexibility. We expect capital expenditures for the remainder of 2015 to be approximately $1.7 billion, including $1.35 billion in newbuild CapEx, $175 million for rig enhancement projects and $175 million for sustaining projects. As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than $1 billion. 
In conclusion, I want to emphasize our focus on the controllable aspects of our business during the current downturn. We remain committed to proactive cost control, including an aggressive expense and cash management program that will drive sustainable cost reductions. For example, we will continue to stack rigs rolling off contracts that do not have near-term contracting opportunities with customers. Our recent actions in the capital markets have further strengthened our liquidity and capital position, giving us more flexibility to navigate the downturn. We have maintained our strong investment-grade credit ratings, something that Ensco has always believed is strategically important, especially during a down cycle. And we are the highest rated company in our sector. This will allow us to focus on further improving operational, safety and financial performance, better positioning Ensco in the near term and for the inevitable up cycle. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

And I think what we would say is that, yes, it is possible, and we worked this engineering process very carefully. What we've done in the process of doing this is look very carefully the preservation of some of the critical equipment and also the ease with which we can bring it back. And a lot of that has led us to make the decisions of removing some of the critical equipment and put it in temperature-controlled environments and to take off little bit of critical equipment, and we have power to the rig dehumidify certain areas. But in the process of doing this, we've actually, from our first estimates, dropped the cost to stack these rigs by about $3 million, $4 million per rig. So as we've gone through this and refined the process, it hasn't actually led to an increase in cost. We've been able to bring it down somewhat."

I mean, it's absolutely clear that we're in the midst of a really significant downturn for the sector, which is hitting the whole of the E&P sector, but is exasperate for the offshore drillers because of the new capacity that's coming to the market. And the pace and aggressiveness with which client/customers have backed off programs and cut CapEx is quite unprecedented. So -- but that said, we find ourselves at the moment in the marketplace exactly where we thought we would be, not better, not worst than we saw it 1 quarter or 2 quarters ago, when we took some of the decisions that you saw and you've seen us do on strengthening the balance sheet and the decision we took on the dividend. Now as we said in the prepared statements, what we have seen in the market is we've seen little bits of activity, some activity in the shallow water jackup market, some early indication of inquiries and tender inquiries for the -- for later in '15 and going into '16. But these are -- I don't want to overplay that. They are -- it's small and spread around the world, and competition for those will be fierce. In the floater market, we've seen almost nothing new. The number of placements and the opportunities that are out there that everyone knows about have been around for quite a while, so there is nothing materially new developed. And I think in this -- and we believe that these market conditions are certainly going to last through '15 and as we go into and then to '16. Now I think as we move into the second half of the year and we -- hopefully, if we see oil prices, Brent, stabilized a bit or even up a little bit from where they are, we will see clients begin to do little bits of work. And your proposal that we might see shorter-term one-off to 3 well extensions, things like that, I think is a reasonable assumption for the activity you might see in '15."

Now if we jump out further on, as we said -- as I said earlier on, I think that a lot of those market conditions will go over into '16. When we start to see a turnaround and when we start to see enough incremental pickup in client activity to start to absorb some of the additional capacity is an open question, but I think it will be driven by 2 key drivers. The first one -- and they're reasonably obvious, but the first one is oil price insomuch as it pertains to free cash flow for our customers -- increasing free cash flow for our customers and also sentiment. And the second one is the degree and the speed with which we see rig retirement and stacking and, to some extent, company failure or consolidation. And I think this -- the rate with which those 2 things happen will very much depend on when we see a pickup. And in our view, we don't foresee that much before mid '16, but it could happen earlier if we see more rapid action. Now as we've said, if you start to look a little bit longer term, we do see some positive actions in the sense the rates of retirement for rigs has really started to pick up in the last quarter or 2. And we think that, that will continue. There's a significant number of older rigs both in the floater segment and the jackup segments rolling off contract during '15. I mean, these are very old rigs, and we would expect most of these to be retired and probably ultimately never return to the marketplace. As we said in the prepared statement, what -- it's 1 event, but I think it's significant in that the first piece of M&A activity we've seen in the E&P space has been basically driven by a view of the profitability of deepwater, in particularly Brazil. So I think the data points that are out there are still positive. And we've taken a long, hard look at this, and we truly believe that the offshore production is going to play a major part in the world's energy supply going forward. It currently makes up 7% of global supply. I don't believe that, that can be and will be replaced by something else. It has the potential to grow and that the major reserves that have been developed -- discovered over the last few -- last decade or so will be developed. So we will see eventually an upturn in activity, and we will see a return to offshore and deepwater drilling."

One of the issues you've got to find is the location to be able to stack the rig. But if you think about it in these terms, many companies at the moment are deferring out the delivery of their new drillships, and effectively that is cold stacking in the shipyards. And the process you would go through will be not greatly dissimilar. But I think, just to be clear, we had the early termination on DS-4. But at this stage, we are not going to cold stack the DS-4. We are going to continue to market it, which we have the right to do under the termination agreement. So we have not taken the decision to cold stack a drillship yet.

The main thing is you must have a good, detailed, comprehensive plan and execute that plan. And then the -- where you can remove some of the sensitivity equipment and put it in a environmentally controlled area. Obviously, that's a positive. Make sure you're using good inhibitor fluids and good dehumidification devices to protect the sensitive equipment.

First quarter results were highlighted by strong operational safety and financial performance.

Our offshore crews and onshore personnel are to be commended for this performance, which is consistent with our #1 ranking in customer satisfaction. 
Strong rig utilization drove our top line results, along with fleet high grading since last year, with the addition of 3 new ENSCO 120 Series jackups and 3 upgraded floaters that rejoined the operating fleet. Disciplined expense management also contributed to our bottom line results in the first quarter, as Jay will describe in great detail.

I'm pleased to report that we are on track to achieve a 9% reduction in unit labor costs for offshore workers, plus $27 million in annual savings from streamlining our onshore workforce beginning in the second quarter of this year. We are also reducing cost through expedited stacking of rigs. As previously reported, we are completing the preservation process for ENSCO 8501  and ENSCO 8502, and we expect the rigs will be cold stacked by the end of the second quarter. These steps will reduce operating costs until market conditions improve, at which time we will reactivate the rigs. 
As a reminder, we believe this is a prudent approach since 6 out of 7 of these rigs have uncontracted time this year, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where there is a significant supply/demand imbalance. 
ENSCO 8501  and ENSCO 8502 just happened to be among the first 6-gen floaters in the U.S. Gulf rolling off contract this year, and we expect other drillers will be making similar stacking decisions. 
Finally, in terms of our expense management plans, we have also been working with vendors and suppliers to lower cost and improve equipment reliability. 
Turning now to capital management. We further improved our financial position by refinancing near-term debt maturities with 10- and 30-year notes that we issued during the first quarter. As a result, we now have no significant debt maturities until the second quarter of 2019. 
Both S&P and Moody's recently reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating, and we continue to have significant liquidity and capital management flexibility with a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet and revenue backlog of about $8.4 billion. 
Now in terms of the market, as we noted on our last call, most customers are reevaluating their portfolios in light of lower commodity prices. Drilling demand in deepwater remains very low, and there have only been a handful of new floater fixtures announced so far this year. For shallow water, average commodity price hurdles that support drilling are generally lower than deepwater. As such, we are seeing some customer activity in shallow water, although competition for these opportunities will be intense. 
While we continue to believe the current market conditions and excess rig supply will extend into next year, we have seen some positive development that will ultimately help to rebalance the market. First, as we had predicted in second quarter last year, we have seen several announcements regarding floater scrapping that is taking rigs out of the system, plus cold stacking of older floaters and jackups that will likely lead to future scrapping. David will cover this and other aspects of rig supply in great detail, including potential new build orders cancellations in Brazil. 
Second, we continue to see signs that the offshore sector across the supply chain is taking major strides to become more efficient and cost-effective, which will make offshore programs more competitive and lower the commodity price hurdles necessary to support additional drilling. 
And third, we believe there are meaningful opportunities to improve the quality management process across the supply chain in offshore drilling, which should ultimately lead to better equipment and workforce reliability. 
During the last upturn as all aspects of the supply chain were rushing to meet increasing demand, including hiring to fill new positions, inefficiencies crept into the system. Quality suffered. Average experience levels of offshore crews declined, and the result was unacceptable levels of downtime. Now we are in an environment where more attention can be placed on enhancing quality and crew competency, which should lead to meaningful efficiency gains that will also support our sector. 
A recent M&A announcement by 2 E&P companies highlighted that they believe deepwater will continue to be a strategic high growth and profitable piece of their business, one that is projected to see significant future investment, particularly in Brazil, which has the largest offshore reserves of any country in the world. While the near-term focus by most market participants has been on pressures from current commodity prices. It's positive to see this endorsement and investment by some of the largest E&P companies in the deepwater sector. 
In closing, I'd like to say thank you to our Chairman, Dan Rabun, for his dedicated service to Ensco. Dan served as Ensco's CEO for more than 8 years, saw the company grow its fleet and geographic presence significantly under his leadership. Dan is retiring as Chairman at our Annual Shareholders Meeting next month, and we wish Dan and his family all the best. 
Paul Rowsey, our lead director, who has been proposed for reelection to the board, is expected to be appointed Nonexecutive Chairman following the Shareholders Meeting. 
Now I will turn the call over to David."
269488,290567129,803247,"Ensco plc, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Carl.

In terms of customer demand, we have seen a limited number of incremental contracting opportunities since our last conference call. During this phase of the cyclical downturn, however, it is not uncommon to see low levels of tenders and inquiries. We believe most well programs continue to be delayed rather than canceled, and we expect that declining production will prompt future drilling demand. Given our global presence, we are actively pursuing nearly every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jackups. 
Looking out longer term, it is encouraging to see recent lease sales drawing interest from several major customers. This includes international frontier plays, such as Uruguay, and established basins like the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the most recent lease sale saw successful bidders invest more than $0.5 billion on new acreage. 
I believe Ensco's strengths, including our #1 ranking in overall customer satisfaction and safety, give us a competitive edge as new contracting opportunities arise. 
In terms of global supply, we recently took delivery of ENSCO DS-9, and the rig is now undergoing customer specific enhancements for its initial contract. 
Since our last earnings call, more postponements have been announced for newbuild floaters scheduled for delivery in 2015. As a result, approximately 20 new rigs are now scheduled for delivery by the end of 2015. More than half are contracted. Ensco's next drillship delivery, ENSCO DS-8, is among these contracted rigs. And we expect the rig to commence its initial contract in the fourth quarter of this year. It remains to be seen if the other uncontracted deliveries will be delayed in anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future. 
Recently, there have been many news stories regarding the build in Brazil program. In total, this program was initially expected to add 29 floaters to the global supply by 2020, with all but one of these rigs working for Petrobras on their presalt development. 
Recent reports suggest more than half of these rigs may not be delivered, and the remaining rigs are likely to be delayed. Two of the newbuild floaters  currently scheduled for delivery in 2015 are build in Brazil rigs. An additional 8 are scheduled for delivery in 2016 but may be delayed due to financial, shipyard and other issues. If these units were to be delayed or canceled, this could result in demand for rigs from the international market as Petrobras looks to meet production targets. 
Carl mentioned recent merger and acquisition activity by some of our customers, which is not only a strong indication of their commitment to deepwater but also to Brazil in particular, where Ensco has extensive experience. I should add that upcoming lease rounds in Brazil and planned divestitures by Petrobras may lead to more customers entering this market. 
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups. There are approximately 50 newbuilds with expected deliveries by year-end 2015, all of which are uncontracted. More than 60% of these uncontracted deliveries are with companies that do not currently operate a rig, so it remains to be seen whether these 30-plus units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation and delays of many newbuild jackups. This will likely continue as companies who ordered these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments given limited contracting opportunities. This in turn would put more pressure on shipyards that will have to assess continued investment in the construction of partially completed rigs. 
Turning now to scrapping and cold stacking of floaters and jackups. It's reasonable to assume that offshore drillers will continue to rationalize their fleets to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn by scrapping older rigs with limited contracting opportunities that require CapEx to meet -- keep them certified to work and cold stacking other rig that did not have recontracting opportunities. 
Since September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 33 floaters. Over the same time period, an additional 20 floaters have been cold stacked. We believe that the majority of these will also be scrapped. In total, these 53 rigs represent approximately 17% of competitive global supply. Additionally, more than 40 floaters with similar age and technical characteristics to the 33 scrapped rigs I just mentioned are currently idle or will see their contracts expire in 2015. All will be likely candidates for scrapping and/or cold stacking, and as a group, they are double the approximately 20 floaters currently scheduled to enter the market by year end. We anticipate the scrapping and stacking trend will continue, which will help to improve the supply and demand balance. 
Similarly, on the jackups side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jackups, defined as independent leg cantilever rigs; 46 are stacked and older than 30 years of age. Another 66 working rigs that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring in 2015. 
Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years, can be very expensive and involve tens of millions of dollars in upgrades in a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller undercapitalized drillers, these rigs may be scrapped, cold stacked or converted to nondrilling units. Additional information on the global supply of rigs, including details on newbuilds, scrapping and stacking, is provided in our investor presentation on our website. 
As previously reported, we received an early termination notice for convenience for ENSCO DS-4 that requires the customer to make an estimated cash payment of $160 million, thereby accelerating most of the rigs remaining contract backlog into the third quarter of 2015. We are now marketing this rig for new opportunities following the expected July termination date. We negotiated reduced day rates for several jackups with customers in the Middle East and the North Sea, as disclosed in our recent fleet status report, in order to continue the contracts. 
In closing, we remain focused on winning as many contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging Ensco's differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record, our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel and the reputation among customers as the best offshore driller. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."
269488,290567129,803247,"Ensco plc, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, David. Today, I will start with our first quarter financial results, our second quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, earnings from conti",1235,"Thanks, David. Today, I will start with our first quarter financial results, our second quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. 
As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for other expense of $0.11 per share to refinance debt, increased 18% from last year to $1.49. Total first quarter revenue increased 9% to $1.16 billion from a year ago, primarily due to more operating days as we added 3 new jackups and reinstated 3 upgraded floaters. These results reflect the strong operational and safety performance and expense management that our offshore crews and onshore personnel delivered during the quarter. 
Floaters segment revenue grew 7% to $695 million versus prior year as the ENSCO 5004, 5005 and 5006 returned to the operating fleet after completing shipyard upgrades. As a result, reported floater utilization increased to 86% from 75% a year ago, which more than offset a 9% decline in the average day rate to $421,000 per day. Operational utilization for the Floaters segment, which adjusts for uncontracted days and planned downtime, was 93% compared to 95% a year ago. 
Jackups segment revenue grew 7% to $428 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and ENSCO 122 to the active fleet. These jackups had exceptionally high uptime performance of nearly 100% in the first quarter. Reported utilization for the jackup fleet was 87% compared to 86% a year ago, and the average day rate increased 7% to $144,000. The addition of 3 ENSCO 120 Series rigs to the fleet contributed to the increase in average day rates. Operational utilization for the total jackup fleet was an impressive 99.6%, the highest level that we've achieved in the past 3 years. 
First quarter total contract drilling expense decreased to $518 million from $520 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and repair and maintenance costs, more than offset $45 million of additional contract drilling expense related to growth in our operating fleet. Depreciation expense increased $6 million to $137 million, in line with our expectations due to adding rigs to the active fleet. General and administrative expense for the quarter was $30 million, also in line with our outlook, and $8 million less than a year ago, primarily due to lower discretionary compensation and disciplined expense management. 
As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $73 million from $29 million a year ago for 2 key reasons: Costs related to refinancing our 2016 debt maturities increased other net by $27 million, as shown in our earnings release; and interest expense was $18 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt raise during third quarter 2014. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline from first quarter results of $1.16 billion as lower reported utilization and average day rates across the fleet are expected to more than offset a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 5006. For our entire fleet in continuing operations, we expect reported utilization to be in the high 70% range compared to 86% in the first quarter. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 5% from first quarter levels of $244,000. We anticipate second quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 2% from $518 million in the first quarter, primarily due to more operating days from ENSCO 5006; and approximately $18 million of upfront expenses to cold-stacked rigs, which will reduce operating cost on these rigs in future periods until they are reactivated. 
Here is a breakdown of cost to complete the preservation process for cold stacking: approximately $2 million in total for 4 jackups plus approximately $8 million each for ENSCO 8501 and 8502. These stacking costs are significant because our stacking process for these floaters involves careful preservation, including dehumidifying key equipment and preventing corrosion of the hull. 
We expect second quarter G&A expenses to be in line with the first quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $141 million as ENSCO 5006 operates for a full quarter. In total, other expense is estimated to be $54 million in the second quarter. This breaks down as follows: interest expense of $51 million, interest income of $3 million and other expense of $7 million due to the retirement of the remaining 2016 maturities that were not fully tendered during the first quarter, plus the retirement of some smaller debt maturities. 
Now I will provide an update on the cost reduction plans announced on our last call. The cold-stacking process for ENSCO 8501 and 8502 is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter, at which time cash costs for these 8500 Series rigs will be less than $10,000 per day. Cash savings will be approximately $120,000 per day. The cold-stacking process for 4 jackups, 3 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and 1 in the Middle East, is also expected to be completed by midyear. Once cold stacked, cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day with cash savings of approximately $40,000 per day. 
We remain on target for a 9% reduction in average offshore unit labor costs from 2014 levels beginning in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this will translate into meaningful cost savings since about half of 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 billion was offshore compensation. 
Earlier this year, we reduced onshore personnel by 15% company-wide. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is expected to be $27 million beginning in second quarter 2015. We are also negotiating cost reductions with vendors and suppliers that are expected to reduce expense and capital expenditures going forward. 
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have the highest credit rating among the major offshore drillers, with investment grade ratings from both S&P and Moody's; $8.4 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place; $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments; a net debt-to-cap ratio of 31%; and by virtue of our recent debt financing, no significant debt maturities until 2019; plus a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us sufficient liquidity and capital management flexibility. We expect capital expenditures for the remainder of 2015 to be approximately $1.7 billion, including $1.35 billion in newbuild CapEx, $175 million for rig enhancement projects and $175 million for sustaining projects. As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than $1 billion. 
In conclusion, I want to emphasize our focus on the controllable aspects of our business during the current downturn. We remain committed to proactive cost control, including an aggressive expense and cash management program that will drive sustainable cost reductions. For example, we will continue to stack rigs rolling off contracts that do not have near-term contracting opportunities with customers. Our recent actions in the capital markets have further strengthened our liquidity and capital position, giving us more flexibility to navigate the downturn. We have maintained our strong investment-grade credit ratings, something that Ensco has always believed is strategically important, especially during a down cycle. And we are the highest rated company in our sector. This will allow us to focus on further improving operational, safety and financial performance, better positioning Ensco in the near term and for the inevitable up cycle. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

But in the process of doing this, we've actually, from our first estimates, dropped the cost to stack these rigs by about $3 million, $4 million per rig. So as we've gone through this and refined the process, it hasn't actually led to an increase in cost. We've been able to bring it down somewhat."

But clearly as we look around, whether it's Ensco's fleet or other companies' rigs that are rolling off contract, there's not a lot of contract new tenders out in the market, is sort of the expectation, at least on Ensco's part for the industry, that is -- as some of these rigs roll off, really the best opportunity for employment will be in a well extension here or a well extension there? Is that how we should be thinking about utilization for a lot of rigs that have roll-offs in the next, call it, 6 to 18 months?"

I mean, it's absolutely clear that we're in the midst of a really significant downturn for the sector, which is hitting the whole of the E&P sector, but is exasperate for the offshore drillers because of the new capacity that's coming to the market. And the pace and aggressiveness with which client/customers have backed off programs and cut CapEx is quite unprecedented. So -- but that said, we find ourselves at the moment in the marketplace exactly where we thought we would be, not better, not worse than we saw it 1 quarter or 2 quarters ago, when we took some of the decisions that you saw and you've seen us do on strengthening the balance sheet and the decision we took on the dividend. Now as we said in the prepared statements, what we have seen in the market is we've seen little bits of activity, some activity in the shallow water jackup market, some early indication of inquiries and tender inquiries for the -- for later in '15 and going into '16. But these are -- I don't want to overplay that. They are -- it's small and spread around the world, and competition for those will be fierce. In the floater market, we've seen almost nothing new. The number of placements and the opportunities that are out there that everyone knows about have been around for quite a while, so there is nothing materially new developed. And I think in this -- and we believe that these market conditions are certainly going to last through '15 and as we go into and then to '16. Now I think as we move into the second half of the year and we -- hopefully, if we see oil prices, Brent, stabilized a bit or even up a little bit from where they are, we will see clients begin to do little bits of work. And your proposal that we might see shorter-term one-off to 3 well extensions, things like that, I think is a reasonable assumption for the activity you might see in '15."

Now if we jump out further on, as we said -- as I said earlier on, I think that a lot of those market conditions will go over into '16. When we start to see a turnaround and when we start to see enough incremental pickup in client activity to start to absorb some of the additional capacity is an open question, but I think it will be driven by 2 key drivers. The first one -- and they're reasonably obvious, but the first one is oil price insomuch as it pertains to free cash flow for our customers -- increasing free cash flow for our customers and also sentiment. And the second one is the degree and the speed with which we see rig retirement and stacking and, to some extent, company failure or consolidation. And I think this -- the rate with which those 2 things happen will very much depend on when we see a pickup. And in our view, we don't foresee that much before mid '16, but it could happen earlier if we see more rapid action. Now as we've said, if you start to look a little bit longer term, we do see some positive actions in the sense the rates of retirement for rigs has really started to pick up in the last quarter or 2. And we think that, that will continue. There's a significant number of older rigs both in the floater segment and the jackup segments rolling off contract during '15. I mean, these are very old rigs, and we would expect most of these to be retired and probably ultimately never return to the marketplace. As we said in the prepared statement, what -- it's one event, but I think it's significant in that the first piece of M&A activity we've seen in the E&P space has been basically driven by a view of the profitability of deepwater, in particularly Brazil. So I think the data points that are out there are still positive. And we've taken a long, hard look at this, and we truly believe that the offshore production is going to play a major part in the world's energy supply going forward. It currently makes up 7% of global supply. I don't believe that, that can be and will be replaced by something else. It has the potential to grow and that the major reserves that have been developed -- discovered over the last few -- last decade or so will be developed. So we will see eventually an upturn in activity, and we will see a return to offshore and deepwater drilling."

One of the issues you've got to find is the location to be able to stack the rig. But if you think about it in these terms, many companies at the moment are deferring out the delivery of their new drillships, and effectively that is cold stacking in the shipyards. And the process you would go through will be not greatly dissimilar. But I think, just to be clear, we had the early termination on DS-4. But at this stage, we are not going to cold stack the DS-4. We are going to continue to market it, which we have the right to do under the termination agreement. So we have not taken the decision to cold stack a drillship yet.

And then the -- where you can remove some of the sensitivity equipment and put it in a environmentally controlled area. Obviously, that's a positive. Make sure you're using good inhibitor fluids and good dehumidification devices to protect the sensitive equipment.

The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further toward the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most have announced",1252,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. The sharp decline in commodity prices that our industry has witnessed accelerated even further toward the end of last year, concurrent with customers completing their capital budgets for 2015. Most have announced significant CapEx cuts and the severe fall-off in customer demand is unprecedented compared to what we've seen in prior cycles. These market developments drove the goodwill and asset impairments we recorded in fourth quarter 2014 and were also a factor in our decision to reduce our quarterly dividend. Reducing our quarterly dividend would give us greater capital management flexibility to navigate a more challenging market environment. In addition, we've already begun a process of implementing plans that will structurally reduce contract drilling and general and administrative expenses. Jay will discuss this in greater detail, but let me give you the high points. 
First, as part of our continuous fleet high-grading, we've placed 4 additional rigs into discontinued operations. Cold stacking rigs no longer in our go-forward fleet will reduce cost associated with these rigs. Similarly, several of our rigs in our go-forward fleet are currently being cold stacked to rapidly reduce expenses, such as 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, noted in our last Fleet Status Report. 
In addition to these rigs, we've decided to cold stack ENSCO 8502 with the possibility that we stack an additional 8500 Series rig if we do not see sufficient market opportunities. We expect ENSCO 8502 will be fully cold stacked by the middle of this year. This decision is not related to the capability of these rigs, which have an excellent track record, rather it is a reflection of having 6 out of 7 of these rigs rolling off contract by year-end and having to compete with more than 40 other 6th Gen floaters that are either idle, rolling off contract in 2015 or being delivered this year from a shipyard. There will be upfront costs to properly place rigs into cold stack status, but we believe the savings will outweigh the upfront stacking costs for these rigs that have limited near-term contracting opportunities. We will return these rigs to the active fleet when we are able to sign term contract at a favorable day rate.
In terms of compensation expense, we have reevaluated premiums that we put in place for offshore employees during the market upcycle. Based on this review, we've decided to reduce discretionary compensation for offshore personnel. This will result in a meaningful decline in unit labor costs for offshore personnel in 2015 compared to 2014. As the size of our actively marketed rig fleet is decreased, we have decided that it is also appropriate to streamline onshore support functions, including corporate staff, to better align with the size of our current marketed fleet. Last week, we implemented a reduction in force for onshore personnel that will achieve approximately $27 million of annualized savings, beginning in the second quarter of this year. 
Finally, we are negotiating with our vendors and suppliers to reduce costs while maintaining service quality. As we've said in the past, there is much happening in the market that we cannot control, but we will be aggressive about actions we can control and that includes fleet structure and costs. As we have described, we are proactively addressing the cost side of our business so that we are well situated to capitalize on the eventual upturn in the market. We do not anticipate an improvement in the market in the near term and as such, our approach will be to stack rigs which come off contract and have no follow-on work, thereby reducing the size of our actively marketed fleet in the near term. As we look at the risk/reward dynamics, we believe the steps we are taking to streamline costs and preserve capital are the most prudent, will eventually prove to be the best option.
Now I will provide a brief review of fourth quarter results and recap some full year 2014 highlights. Excluding impairment charges and discrete and other nonrecurring tax items during the fourth quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.68. Our marketing teams did an excellent job contracting rigs during the fourth quarter, especially in light of difficult market conditions, signing contracts for several jackups and a multi-year term for one of our floaters. During 2014, we continued our fleet high-grading strategy by adding 3 ENSCO 120 Series newbuild jackups. Each of these newbuild jackups has had exceptional uptime performance since commencing their initial contracts over the past year. 
The other component of our high-grading strategy is to sell less capable assets and during 2014, we sold 7 jackups and 1 floater. The sale of these rigs, coupled with our decision to sell additional floaters and jackups now classified as discontinued operations, reinforces our strategy of staying ahead of the curve in terms of fleet management. By doing so, we ensure high levels of safety and operational uptime performance. During 2014, our offshore crews and onshore personnel achieved a new safety record in terms of our total recordable incident rate and improved our fleet uptime performance. These results contributed to Ensco recently earning the #1 rating in total customer satisfaction, our fifth consecutive year to earn this distinction. 
In addition, to our #1 rating in total customer satisfaction, ENSCO won 9 other categories, including safety and environment, technology, deepwater drilling and shelf wells. These exceptional results in such a challenging market reflect the quality of our systems, our fleet and our offshore crews around the world and are a real differentiator in a challenging contracting environment. 
In terms of capital management, we raised $1.25 billion of new capital through a debt offering and increased the amount of our revolver to $2.25 billion in September of last year. We believe the debt raise was an appropriate step given our upcoming usage of capital, including capital commitments and debt maturities over the next 2 years. By increasing our liquidity, reducing our quarterly dividend and decreasing expenses, we will enhance our capital management flexibility during the market downturn. 
For market conditions to bottom and start to recover, we need to see some key actions. We cannot simply rely on an oil price recovery. Costs need to be driven out of the whole system and rig supply needs to be reduced. We are encouraged to see that the rate of rig retirements has increased significantly and there is some moderation in the marketed rig supply as additional assets are being stacked and newbuilds are being deferred. More needs to happen and we will continue to be proactive.
Before I hand the call over to David, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Ensco's founding CEO, Carl Thorne, earlier this year. Many of you knew Carl and watched him grow Ensco from a small regional company into a major global offshore drilling company. We are indebted to Carl for his entrepreneurial courage, taking on the challenge of starting a new drilling company in the depths of a market downturn not unlike the one we are experiencing today. 
When I joined Ensco, one of the factors that attracted me to the company was the strength of the culture and the commitment to uphold a series of core values that were forged under Carl's leadership and are essential to Ensco to this day. As we face this period of uncertainty, we'll increasingly rely on those core values.
Now I will turn the call over to David."

First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call before I provide additional color on the markets.

First, I would like to recap some of our contract signings since our last earnings call before I provide additional color on the markets. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we signed ENSCO 8503 to a multi-year contract with a repeat customer to drill in both DP and moored capacity, addressing the customers' need to drill in both deep and mid-water depths. The rig is scheduled to commence this new contract in second quarter 2015. As a reminder, this rig has the record for the deepest well ever drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. 
On the jackup side, we signed a 9-month contract for ENSCO 68, earning additional work based on the rig's strong operating and safety track record. In West Africa, we contracted ENSCO 109 for a 3-year term. The rig has commenced operations ahead of schedule after mobilizing from Singapore with excellent uptime performance.
Moving to the Middle East. We secured extensions for 4 of our existing jackups. While market conditions have become more challenging, these contract awards show that we have earned more than our fair share of new business recently. Contracting has certainly become more difficult, but I believe Ensco's strengths give us a competitive edge as new contracting opportunities arise, even though they may be few and far between in the current environment.
Customers recently ranked us #1 in customer satisfaction for the fifth consecutive year, including a #1 ranking in safety. We are honored by this recognition and know that this competitive advantage is most important during a downturn. The challenges of the current market environment are well known and some customers have shortened terms where contracts allow it, while others are attempting to negotiate concessions.
As we have in the past, Ensco will act to protect its contract backlog and only entertain negotiations with customers where new terms are mutually beneficial. Since we have a lot to cover on this earnings call, rather than go market-by-market around the globe in terms of customer demand, let me just say that we are actively pursuing virtually every outstanding tender and inquiry for floaters and jackups. 
In terms of the supply side, looking at the worldwide order book for floaters, approximately 30 new rigs will be delivered before the end of 2015, of which roughly half are contracted. Ensco's next 2 drillship deliveries, ENSCO DS-8 and DS-9 are among these contracted rigs and we expect to commence their initial contracts in the second half of this year. For competitive jackups, the newbuild order book shows approximately 60 to be delivered by year-end 2015, the vast majority of which are uncontracted. 
More than half of the uncontracted newbuild jackup deliveries scheduled for 2015 are with companies that do not currently operate a rig, so it remains to be seen how many of these units will end up entering the global drilling supply. Many offshore drillers with uncontracted newbuild rigs likely will continue to postpone deliveries in an effort to delay final milestone CapEx payments, thereby pushing out new supply.
We have already seen deferrals and delays of new floaters and jackups originally scheduled to be delivered during 2015. While we may choose to delay future rig deliveries, we are in active discussions with customers for ENSCO 110, a high spec jackup and ENSCO DS-10, an ultra-deepwater drillship scheduled for delivery later this year. Overall, supply and demand dynamics will be aided by the retirement and stacking of both floaters and jackups. We expect that offshore drillers will continue to retire uncontracted rigs to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn. Since September, offshore drillers have announced the retirement of 23 floaters. 
Over the same time period, an additional 12 floaters have been cold stacked, and we believe that the majority will end up being retired from the global supply due to the costly nature to reactivate these older rigs. These 35 rigs represent approximately 12% of competitive global supply. In 2015, 40 floaters that are 30 years of age or older will see their current contracts expire. All will be likely candidates for stacking and/or scrapping. And as a group, they are greater in number than the new supply of roughly 30 floaters scheduled to enter the market by year-end. 
We anticipate the stacking and/or scrapping trend will continue into 2016 with these reductions to global supply helping to better balance floater supply and demand. Similarly, on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Approximately 80 competitive jackups that are 30 years of age or older have contracts that expire in 2015. At this time, another 40 jackups that are older than 30 years of age are idle and do not have any future contracted work. Major regulatory surveys to recertify older rigs which must take place every fifth year, can be very expensive and involve tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. 
In a tight cash flow environment, especially for smaller, undercapitalized drillers, these rigs may be stacked and/or retired. Over the next year, our marketing teams are focused on winning as many contracting opportunities as possible. We expect to win business by leveraging Ensco's differentiated technology, our operational and safety track record and our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."
269488,283133384,831896,"Ensco plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, several",1632,"Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. 
As noted in our press release, several items impacted fourth quarter results, including a noncash goodwill impairment of $3 billion, noncash asset impairments totaling $925 million, $56 million of favorable discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, primarily related to foreign tax credits, and the reclassification of 4 rigs into discontinued operations.
Let me quickly remind everyone about how discontinued operations and held-for-sale status works. In order to put a rig into held-for-sale status, we must have a clear plan to sell the rig that has been approved by management and our board. Once the held-for-sale criteria are met, the rig's current period and historical operating results are reclassified into discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. All future operating results are also presented in discontinued operations so that all period-to-period comparisons are on an equivalent basis. In general, we focus our conference call comments on continuing operations. Where appropriate, we may adjust prior guidance to reflect discontinued operations accounting treatment. Having offered all of that explanation, I should mention that discontinued operations accounting rules change in 2015, so any rigs that we decide to sell in the future will remain in continuing operations.
Excluding noncash goodwill and asset impairments as well as discrete and other nonrecurring tax items, fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations were $1.68 per share. Cash flow from operations were $546 million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. Total fourth quarter revenue increased 2% to $1.16 billion from a year ago. Adjusted for rigs that were reclassified into discontinued operations, revenue was 2% lower than our prior guidance of $1.19 billion due to unplanned floater downtime. 
Floater segment revenue declined 5% to $663 million versus prior year due to lower reported utilization and average day rates, which more than offset a full quarter of operations for DS-7 compared to a partial quarter last year. The average day rate for our floaters decreased 6% to $429,000 and reported floater utilization declined to 81% versus 82% a year ago. 
Jackup segment revenue grew 6% to $454 million as we added ENSCO 120, 121 and 122 to the active fleet. These rigs contributed to a $17,000 increase in the average jackup day rate to $147,000. Reported utilization for the jackup fleet was 88% for fourth quarter 2014 compared to 94% a year ago, primarily due to fewer contracted days in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Fourth quarter total contract drilling expense increased to $514 million from $500 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and insurance costs, partially offset $33 million of operating costs for 4 newbuilds.
Depreciation expense for continuing operations increased $11 million to $139 million in line with our expectations due to a growing active fleet. General and administrative expense for the quarter was $28 million, also in line with our outlook, and $7 million less than a year ago, primarily due to lower discretionary compensation. Interest expense increased to $52 million as expected due to our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014.
So now let's turn to outlook for the first quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline slightly from fourth quarter levels of $1.16 billion due to more uncontracted rig days. This is partially offset by the commencement of ENSCO 5006 contract following a major upgrade and a full quarter of operations for ENSCO 109 and ENSCO 122. We anticipate first quarter contract drilling expense will increase approximately 6% from $514 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to more operating days for ENSCO 5006, 109 and 122 and approximately $8 million of expenses to cold stacked rigs. 
Savings from onshore headcount reductions effective mid-February will largely offset $4 million of severance and related costs in the first quarter. We expect first quarter G&A expenses to be relatively in line with fourth quarter as the benefit of our reduction in force offsets $1 million in severance costs for corporate staff. Depreciation expense should be approximately in line with fourth quarter levels of $139 million. Other expense is estimated to be $48 million in the first quarter, comprised of $51 million of interest expense and about $3 million of interest income.
Now let's move to our outlook for full year 2015. Approximately 75% of our floater rig days and 65% of our jackup rig days are contracted for 2015. This translates into contracted revenue backlog of $3.9 billion for 2015, excluding bonuses. This amount does not reflect several factors that could add or subtract to the final results, such as signing new contracts and extending current contracts, bonuses for operational performance above certain levels, unplanned downtime, contract amendments that may extend terms into future periods, but reduce day rates in the near term and early termination of contracts. 
Given the current lack of visibility in terms of customer demand in our sector and the number of contract rollovers we have in 2015, we won't be giving a specific outlook for full year revenues. For the same reason, we also won't be giving a detailed outlook for total contract drilling expense because we intend to manage expenses in line with our revenues to the maximum extent possible. We will, however, provide some of the factors influencing 2015 contract drilling expense. First, additions to the fleet are expected to increase contract drilling expense by approximately $155 million year-to-year and this breaks down as follows: $85 million as several rigs have returned to the active fleet following shipyard upgrades during 2014; $35 million for the full year impact of the 3 ENSCO 120 Series that commenced their initial contracts in 2014; and $35 million for newbuilds commencing initial contracts in 2015.
As noted in our press release, we're taking aggressive steps to reduce our expense base. First, we have continued to high grade our fleet. Second, we are currently expediting the cold stacking of 3 jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to reduce expenses. Daily cash savings achieved by cold stacking these rigs on average will be approximately $40,000 beginning in May. 
As Carl mentioned, we plan to stack ENSCO 8502. We estimate the upfront cost to cold stack an 8500 Series rig will be approximately $12 million, and we expect to incur approximately $7 million of this amount in the first quarter of 2015 and the remaining $5 million in the second quarter of 2015. Cash costs for a cold stacked 8500 Series rig will be less than $10,000 per day, so cash savings achieved by cold stacking this rig will be approximately $120,000 per day beginning midyear when cold stacking is completed. 
We have implemented a number of discretionary compensation reductions and expect offshore unit labor costs to decline by approximately 9% on average from 2014 levels beginning in second quarter of 2015. This will translate into meaningful cost savings since 48% of Ensco's 2014 contract drilling expense of $2.1 billion was offshore compensation. Last week, we also reduced our onshore personnel by 15%. Annualized savings from this workforce reduction is estimated to be $27 million beginning in second quarter 2015. $22 million of this amount will be in contract drilling expense and $5 million will be in G&A. For full year 2015, G&A expense is anticipated to decrease approximately 10% from $132 million in 2014.
Depreciation is expected to increase to approximately $575 million, primarily due to the addition of newbuild rigs, partially offset by lower depreciation for rigs impaired during 2014 that now have lower carrying values. As a result of our $1.25 billion debt offering in the third quarter of 2014, interest expense is estimated to be approximately $180 million compared to $161 million last year. We expect interest income for the year of approximately $7 million due to interest earned on certain long-term contracts for reimbursement of mobilization and capital upgrade costs. 
The 2015 effective tax rate should be approximately 18% based on our current fleet composition and geographic positioning. 2015 capital spending is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion. This includes $1.6 billion in newbuild CapEx plus $250 million for rig enhancement projects and $250 million for sustaining projects. As we look ahead, we project total 2016 CapEx to be less than half of our 2015 guidance.
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. As of December 31, we had $9.7 billion in revenue backlog based on existing contracts in place, $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and a total debt-to-capital ratio of 42%.
In conclusion, I'd like to reinforce some of Carl's comments with respect to cost control. We are clearly in an uncertain environment and it demands immediate action in terms of expense reduction and cash management. We began taking proactive steps in the second quarter of last year and I hope everyone takes away from the call today that we have significantly ramped up an already aggressive expense and cash management program. We have in a very short period of time taken considerable costs out of the system, both onshore and offshore. 
We will continue to drive costs out of the system over the course of the coming year by attacking every element of cost and managing cash outflows wherever possible. We see expense control and cash management as an ongoing imperative for the foreseeable future. We do not see our actions solely as bridging us to a recovery. We are focused on sustainable cost reduction that will allow us to be even more competitive when the inevitable upcycle arrives.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

There are a whole series of issues have come up in this decision and reasons why we've done it. The -- if I go back to the prepared comments, one of the first things that really came into our decision-making process was the rapid deterioration we saw in the market conditions as we went through the end of Q4. But even at that time, we had a relatively opaque view on what our clients were going to do and what our customers were going to do in 2015 and a little bit into '16. And as we came to the end of the quarter and really over the last 4 to 8 weeks, we've had chance to be able to now see some of those announcements and actually sit with most of our customers and really see what the demand outlook was and their drilling plans were going to be. And we're very much focused on, not just '15, but going through into '16. And so we've really tried to look at the company in terms of where we want to be 1 to 2 years down the line, not just today and we looked at several things. The first was the risk and opportunities involved in an extended market downturn and from that, we decided that increased liquidity and the flexibility for our capital management was something we wanted to do earlier rather than later. One to manage the risk, but also to be able to be in a position to take opportunities if they came and we felt they were appropriate. The second is that we wish to maintain our credit rating. And thirdly, we still wish to maintain to pay a meaningful dividend that was comparable to other S&P companies, but to give us more flexibility in what is, we think, quite clearly going to be a multi-year downcycle."

We very much clearly see these rigs as part of our go-forward fleet. And there is a very clear distinction in our mind about the fleet structure that we wish to have in the long term. And so there are some rigs that when we stack them out, and we've clearly identified some of those already in held-for-sale, that have no place in our go-forward plan. But there are rigs such as the 8500 which -- and the 8502, which we may decide to stack, but we intend to bring back. Now on the 8502, the decision has been taken largely because we just find ourselves with 6 of those 7 rigs coming off contract. And certainly, in the Gulf of Mexico, we're competing against ourselves as well as other 6th Generation rigs. But particularly, 8500 is competing against themselves for the same type and class of work. So we've just been very pragmatic about it. When we've looked at the overall utilization we expect on all of those rigs over the next year or so and decided that we will take the action. Now with respect to the hybrid upgrades that we've planned, we're still certainly going to go ahead on 1 and probably 2 of those rigs. We were considering a third one, and that's still an option for us and we will review that as we see the second half of the year materialize. We will likely take the opportunity whilst the rigs are stacked to do some additional work and to look at whether there's modifications we want to do whilst they're stacked, but it is our intention to bring them back when we feel the market can support it."

As far as coming out, we won't give guidance at this time. It will partially depend on how long it's been stacked and exactly how we do it. And the reason I say that is we're looking at a very detailed plan about actually removing some key equipment off the rig to put it in thermally controlled environments to be able to ease the return of the rig. And exactly how much we do of that will govern its cost to return and it will also of course depend on how much it will cost us to mobilize it to where it has another contract.

So let's take it at a high and generic level initially and this is happening across the industry, this is not specific to us. We do see customers in 2 modes at the moment. One is to generally try and reduce costs and bring down the costs and the other is we do have some customers who are overcommitted on their drilling contracts. So there are various customers who are looking for renegotiation of some terms, usually in an -- in exchange for an extension of contract or something to mutual gain. We do have a few customers who are looking at whether they are going to early terminate or not. And so there are, to some more greater or lesser degrees, various conversations happening like that. Now specifically, we have only received 2 formal notifications of termination, which we included in our last Fleet Status Report, which is 2 jackups in Asia and we also had one rig in the North Sea, which didn't move to its next contract because it was outside the window to start because the previous contract ran on drilling operations longer than the window to start. So they're the only ones that we've actually had formal -- any formal notification on. As far as your specific question on Brazil, whilst we've also -- always very nervous to discuss individual discussions with clients, we do -- we have not had any informal or formal discussions with Petrobras about termination on the Megathyst rigs."

Because we have a pre-prepared plan of basically the fleet structure we would like as we go out 2 to 3 years. So it would very much depend on whether it was a rig that fell into the status that we didn't necessarily want it in 2 to 3 years or whether it was one of the go-forward fleet and very much on also considerations on the stacking costs. So there isn't a hard and fast recontracting rate. I think what we've made clear is that our view on this market. Is that it isn't one where you just sit back and hope everything is going to be fine, so -- and rely on just a bounce back in the oil price in the near term, in H2, to bring everything back to balance. We clearly will take our clients' time and even in a higher oil price environment to adjust budgets and react to a better oil price that they can be sure of. And secondly, we will have a structural overhang in rig capacity that has to clear out. So our view is that we'll make a cold, hard rational decision when we see rigs that don't have enough utility ongoing to justify the cost. Because what we don't want to get into is basically a cost bleed -- cash bleed by just wishful thinking because when we do stack out the rigs as we've already done, it allows us to very drastically bring down costs and expenses."

And I think a large part of that is because the people -- our customers don't or didn't have a very clear view on where oil price was going and how some of the fundamentals were driving it, and it's caused a very rapid pullback. So it certainly from, I think the rest of the management team here, but certainly my experience before, this has been a much more rapid and aggressive falloff than the recessions that happened in the downcycles in the 2000, which actually didn't falloff as fast and came back relatively quicker. So that's one and that really, I think, has not only taken us by surprise, it's taken a large part of the sector and the industry by surprise. And the other one, of course, that the offshore drilling sector is facing is the effect of the increase in supply over the past few years which is, again, different from 2007 or 2008, '09 and also from Macondo in 2010. So we have this very marked downturn in capital expenditure happening just exactly at the time that all of the newbuilds are arriving and those 2 are compounding each other. And that's why we believe that this is a mark -- a downcycle is going to take a couple of years to play out and it's why we believe that taking strong and early action is required."

Second quarter results were highlighted by good operational safety and financial performance. As noted in our press release, we had 98% operational utilization for jackups, strong safety performance, and earnings that were driven by disciplined expense management and our efficiency initiatives. Earnings from continuing operations excluding cost to refinance debt was $1.18 per share for the second quarter. Our offshore cruise capital project teams and onshore personnel could be recognized for quarter defined by good execution. Our teams have kept that focus on the things that we can control; operations, safety and efficiency, and not been distracted by the challenges our sector is facing during the current market and term. Since our last earnings call, there have been some significant developments with respect to our fleet structure. In terms of fleet hydrating ENSCO 110, our newest premium jackup rig, we successfully delivered on time and on budget and we've had a seamless handoff between capital projects and operations as the rig commenced its initial three-year contract in Abu Dhabi, while there have been limited number of new contracts announced so far this year, Ensco 110 along with ENSCO 104, earned multiyear contracts during the quarter on the strength of our safety, operations and customer satisfaction track record. Ensco has a particularly strong reputation in the Middle East the largest region for our jackup rig and this helped us to win this new business. Our ENSCO DS-8 drillship was delivered from the shipyards and is on track to commence operations later this year. It will be a major contributor to future financial results given its five-year contract to work for offshore Angola. 
Our capital project team is excellent job delivering ENSCO DS-9 as well, this drillship will also be a significant contributor to our floater segment financial results, given the strong contract provisions that protect us despite previously unannounced cancellation notice from the customer for its convenience. The provisions of the DS 9 contract, which require payments in monthly installments beginning the month of the termination notice, mean in the cash flows for this rig will begin during the third quarter, therefore, there will be no negative impact on earnings for 2015, 2016 and the first half of 2017.
In a mutually negotiated deal, we extended the contract term for ENSCO DS-7 in Angola to the fourth quarter of 2017, gaining approximately $125 million of revenue backlog on a net basis, since as a part of this agreement, contract of the DS 1 was terminated early. As a result, we have accelerated our plans to cold stack DS1 following the completion of its contract since we do not currently view as part of our go forward fleet. Recently, we reached an agreement with the shipyard to do further delivery and a large milestone payment for our final drillship on the construction ENSCO DS-10, by 18 months to the first quarter of 2017. Jay will expand on the financial implications shortly. However, as a consequence of this decision, full year capital expenditures for 2015 have been reduced to approximately $1.7 billion. We have completed stacking for ENSCO 8501, ENSCO 8502, due to a very well-planned and executive process, cost to undertake the stacking has been reduced to approximately $5 million per rig. As previously announced, we intend to bring these rigs back into the active fleet when market conditions improve.
We continue to market the remaining 8500 series rigs and are pursuing several opportunities, we will evaluate to whether to stack another 8500 series rigs as we go through the second half of this year. With respect to our rigs held-for-sale, we recently sold ENSCO 5002 for scrap volume. Over the past 12 months, we have taken delivery of 4 newbuild rigs, we have sold 6 rigs, and placed another 6 rigs into held-for-sale, removing them from our go-forward fleet. This is part of a deliberate strategy to high grade of fleet as we navigate the downturn. 
In addition, we have decided to reduce our near-term marketing fleet by call stacking another 8 rigs including ENSCO 8501 and 8502. 4 newbuild rigs currently under construction will also bolster of fleet restructuring over the next 2 years as they are delivered. In terms of contracting, our marketing teams have done a good job in a tough market, securing additional work including the 2 jackup rigs that I just mentioned in the Middle East, which David will elaborate on in a moment. On the expense side, we are achieving the cost saving targets we set out earlier this year in terms of a 9% reduction in unit labor costs, offshore workers plus $27 million in annual savings from streamlining our onshore workforce. In addition, we are rationalizing office space for shore-based operations in conjunction with our announcement earlier, this year to reduce onshore headcount by 15%. We also plan to streamline our organizational reporting structure by consolidating our 5 geographic business units into 3. Given market conditions in the Asia Pacific region, where we currently have only 4 rigs under contract. And the Brazil market, where we have just 4 active floaters. We will provide more information on our next conference call, including savings related to these steps. We have also been working with vendors and suppliers to lower costs and improve equipment reliability. 
Turning now to capital management. Since our last call, we have completed the tender of a process for our previously announced debt refinancing. As a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities until the second quarter of 2019. We maintained our investment grade credit rating, and we continue to have significant liquidity and capital management flexibility with $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet, fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, and revenue backlog of about $7.4 billion. Our capital expenditures will peak in 2015 at approximately $1.7 billion. Beyond 2015, we anticipate total CapEx will be significantly reducing this level to less than $750 million a year in 2016 and 2017 as we complete our newbuilds on the construction. 
Now let me turn to market conditions and outlook. Clear that we're in the midst of a significant downturn in offshore drilling. And market conditions that would have been supportive of a near-term recovery have not materialized. As a result, we are witnessing a continued pullback in capital expenditures by customers in the deep water market. These conditions reinforce our view that weak market conditions for our sector will continue through 2015 and 2016. We anticipate an uptick in contract placements across sector as we go through the second half of 2015, especially in the jackup markets, but these pictures aren't expected to materially change our outlook for the next 18 months.
That said, we still believe in the long-term recovery of deepwater drilling, there are 3 important factors that will help this market recovery. First, is the reduction in rig supply. As older generation rigs are scrapped and removed from the active fleet, idle rigs are stacked and newbuild deliveries are pushed out or canceled. As David will cover in a moment, a meaningful number of rigs older than 30 years will come off contract in the next 6 months. And we believe most of these will be stacked permanently. Secondly, cost deflation and more standardized engineering solutions have the potential to significantly, reduce the break even cost of deepwater developments. And third, we believe there are meaningful opportunity to improve the quality management process across the supply chain in offshore drilling, which should ultimately lead to better efficiency across our sector. The shallow water, average commodity price hurdles to support drilling are generally lower deepwater. As such, we are seeing more customer activity in shallow water, especially as we go into 2016. Although competition is still intense for these opportunities. 
Finally, we recently announced that given Jay's upcoming retirement, at the moment 12 years with Ensco, we have began a search for our next CFO. Jay is turning 65 next month, hope will remain CFO until we complete the succession process. Jay has been a major contributor in Ensco's many achievements more than a decade. And extremely helpful to me personally over the past year since I joined Ensco. We look forward to his continued contributions as we complete this year for succession process. Now I'll turn the call over to David."

In terms of customer demand, while we are clearly experiencing a very difficult market environment, we have seen an increase in the number of customer discussions for potential opportunities since our last conference call. While this increas",1296,"Thanks, Carl. In terms of customer demand, while we are clearly experiencing a very difficult market environment, we have seen an increase in the number of customer discussions for potential opportunities since our last conference call. While this increases of a low number of tenders and enquires seen during the first quarter, and many of these opportunities are shorter term in nature, we are seeing pockets of customer demand, even in a lower oil price environment. For example, as Carl mentioned, we recently contracted 2 of our premium jackups ENSCO 110 and ENSCO 104 with repeat customer NDC in the Middle East. Both rigs were awarded three-year contract contracts. ENSCO 110 our most recent newbuild jackup delivery commenced its initial contract in May and has had an excellent start for NDC. ENSCO 104 is scheduled to begin its contract in August. The Middle East has been the strongest market in terms of customer demand, and we have 10 jackups contracted in the region. 
Moving to the North sea, we are able to extend ENSCO 101 to midyear 2016 with its current customer. Earlier this month, we signed letters of intent for ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72, both for three-year terms in Denmark. ENSCO 71 is already onsite, and ENSCO 72 is expected to continue working once it completes its current contract in September. As a result, both rigs are scheduled to work into 2018, and once these agreements are finalized, our number of contracted jackups will increased to 9 in North sea. The market where ENSCO has a strong reputation among customers.
Moving to our floater fleet. We were able to extend the term for our ultra-deepwater drillship ENSCO DS-7 for an additional year as part of a blend and extend agreement that will keep the rig working into fourth quarter 2017. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we extended ENSCO 8500 for 2 months, and secured short-term plug and abandon work for ENSCO 8506. While our customer CapEx budgets have been reduced significantly this year, we are seeing some situations where customers regional management is securing corporate level approval to extend certain rigs on certain well programs. In other situations, however, we have experienced some early terminations for convenience, but here we are the strength of our contracts. For example, we recently received notification to terminate the ENSCO DS-9 contract for the customers' convenience. Based on the contract terms, they are obligated to pay the operating day rates of approximately $550,000 for 2 years. So we do not anticipate material negative impact to 2015 or 2016 results as a result of this termination. While some projects have been canceled, such as the exploration work, DS 9 was scheduled to begin later this year, the vast majority of the projects being influenced by spending cuts are being delayed rather than canceled out right. 
Looking at longer-term, it has been encouraging to see it pickup in the offshore exploration success recently. Coupled with lease  sales and frontier place and establish basin that have drawn interest from several major customers. Recently, we saw high profile deepwater program received FID approval for major E&P customer, underscoring the compelling reserves that some offshore basins provide, even in a lower oil price environment. Operating and development of these reserves will require drilling rigs, and I believe Ensco's strength, including our number 1 ranking in overall customer satisfaction and safety, differentiate Ensco from the competition as new contracting opportunities arise. In terms of our newbuild rigs, in addition to DS 9, the except delivery of ENSCO DS-8 earlier this month and the rig is currently mobilizing to Angola for its initial five-year contract. As Carl mentioned, we delayed the delivery of ENSCO DS-10, our only remaining uncontracted newbuild floater until first quarter 2017. Other drillers with uncontracted newbuild floaters have also postponed rigs initially scheduled for delivery in 2015. As a result, only 10 new floaters are now scheduled for delivery by the end of 2015. And half of these rigs are contracted. The other remaining uncontracted deliveries may also be delayed in anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future. Positive supply development since our last earnings call include the cancellation of 4 newbuild floaters that were on order. 
Additionally, reports suggest that the build in Brazil program, originally expected to add 29 floaters to the global supply by 2020 faces significant challenges and that more than half of these rigs may not be delivered. Nine of these floaters are scheduled to delivery in 2016, but may be delayed due to financial, shipyard and other issues. If additional newbuilds were to be delayed or canceled, this would be another incremental positive for global floater supply. 
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups, there are approximately 45 newbuilds with the expected deliveries by year-end 2015, all of which are uncontracted. More than 65% of these uncontracted deliveries are with speculators that have never operated a rig, and it remains to be seen whether these approximately 30 units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation and delays of many newbuild jackups. This will likely continue as the company's quarter these rigs need to put of large milestone CapEx payments given limited contracting opportunities. This in turn would put more pressure on shipyard that will have places continued investment in the construction, partially completed rates. 
Turning now to scrapping and cold stacking of floaters and jackups. It's reasonable to assume that offshore drillers will continue to rationalize their fleets. Scrapping older rigs with limited contracting opportunities that may require CapEx to get them certified to work, and cold stacking other ways that do not have recontracting opportunities allows drillers to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn. Since September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 39 floaters. Over the same period, an additional 22 floaters have been cold stacked. We believe that the majority of these rigs will also be scrapped. In total, these 61 rigs represent approximately 19% of competitive global supply. Additionally, 17 floaters older than 30 years of are currently idle without follow-on work and another approximately 20 floaters greater than 30 years old will see their contracts expire before this year-end. All will be likely candidates for scrapping and or cold stacking. And as a group, they are more than 3x the number of floaters currently scheduled to enter the market by year-end. And as I mentioned earlier, some of these may also be deferred. We anticipate the scrapping and stacking trend will continue, which will help to improve the supply and demand balance. Similarly, on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here's the picture for competitive jackups, defined as independent leg cantilever rigs. Roughly 55 stacks are idle without follow-on work, and older than 30 years of age. Another approximately 45 working rigs that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring before year-end. Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years can involve significant capital investment. In a tight cash flow environment, and faced with uncertain recontracting prospects for less capable jackups, drillers may choose to cold stack or even scrap these older units rather than spend 10s of millions of dollars in upgrades. Additional information on the global supply of rigs is provided in our investor presentation on our website. 
In closing, our operational and safety performance differentiate Ensco in the market as evidenced by several new contract awards since our last call. While the market remains challenging in the near term, we expect to win business by continuing to leverage our operational and safety track record, our differentiated technology, and our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel. Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

Today, I will cover our second quarter financial results, our third quarter 2015 outlook, and then, I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments.
As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for the previously announced debt retirement and loss on impairment a ago were $1.18 compared to $1.49 last year. Total second quarter revenue was $1.06 billion versus $1.14 billion a year ago, as lower utilization across the fleet, including several floaters that have been contracted at above average day rates a year ago, were partially offset by the reactivation of 3 upgraded floaters ENSCO 5004, 5005, and 5006. And the addition of 3 newbuild jackups to the active fleet. Floater segment revenue was $634 million compared to $680 million a year ago, primarily, due to lower utilization for several floaters and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, that contributed to a decline in the average day rate to $417,000 from $481,000 a year ago. Reported floater utilization was 76%, unchanged from a year ago. Operational utilization for the floater segment with adjust for uncontracted days and planned downtime was 92%, also unchanged from a year ago. Jackup segment revenue was $384 million compared to a $441 million a year ago, as utilization declined to 77% from 88% last year. This decline was partially offset by a slight increase in the average day rate to $140,000. The addition of high specification jackups to the active fleet contributed to this increase in an average day rates.
Operational utilization for the total jackup fleet was 98%, reflecting the continued focus of our offshore cruise on delivering high levels of time to our customers regardless of market conditions. We reduced the contract drilling expense to $503 million from $543 million a year ago. Proactive expense management including lower compensation and repair and maintenance costs, more than offset the following items. The reactivation of 3 floaters, the addition of 3 newbuild jackups to the fleet, and approximately $10 million in upfront stacking costs. Depreciation expense increased $8 million to $141 million, in line with our expectations due to the reactivation of the 3 floaters and the addition of the 3 newbuild jackups that I just mentioned. Disciplined expense management including lower personnel costs reduced general and administrative expense to $30 million, which was $6 million less than a year ago. As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $55 million from $31 million a year ago for 2 key reasons. Cost to retire our 2016 senior notes and other smaller debt maturities increased other net by $7 million, and interest expense was $15 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt offering during the third quarter of 2014. Our effective tax rate was 18%, compared to an adjusted tax rate of 10% a year ago, due to the mix of earnings from various tax jurisdictions and tax legislation enacted by the U.K. government. Our third quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 12%. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline from second quarter results of $1.06 billion due to lower reported utilization and average day rates across the feet. For our entire fleet, and continuing operations, we expect reported utilization to be in the mid-60% range compared to 76% in the second quarter. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 3% from second quarter levels, up $237,000. As Carl mentioned, the contract terms for the DS 9 termination fee are expected to bring cash flows forward at the end of the third quarter. As reported, the quarter will also benefit from a lumpsum payment for the DS 4 early termination. We anticipate third quarter contract drilling expense will decline by approximately 8% from $503 million in the second quarter as we continue to actively manage our cost base. We expect third quarter G&A expense to be in line with the second quarter, depreciation expense is expected to increase approximately $3 million from second quarter levels to $144 million, as ENSCO 110 operates through our fourth quarter. In total, other expenses estimate to be approximately $54 million in the third quarter, as interest expense is partially offset by interest income. Now I will provide an update on the cost reduction plans announced earlier this year.
With the cold tracking process for ENSCO 8501 and 8502 now complete, cash costs for these rigs will be less than $10,000 per day. So cash savings will be approximately $120,000 per day until we reactivate the rigs. We have cold stack 4 jackups, 3 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and 1 in the Middle East. We're in the process of cold stacking another jackup in Asia. Cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day with cash savings of approximately $40,000 per day. We remain on track to achieve an 9% reduction in average offshore unit labor cost from 2014 levels, which translates into meaningful cost savings since roughly half of the contract drilling expense is offshore compensation. Second quarter results include a full quarter's impact of the 15% reduction in offshore personnel that was implemented earlier this year, and is expected to generate annualized savings of $27 million. We continue to negotiate cost reductions with vendors and suppliers, and we expect to reduce expense and capital expenditures going forward. So now let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. 
We have $7.4 billion in revenue backlog, based on contracts in place. At June 30, we had a net debt to capital ratio of 32%, and $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. By virtue of our recent debt refinancing, we currently have no remaining debt maturities until 2019, plus we have a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility giving a significant liquidity and capital management flexibility. The delivery delay of DS 10 has changed our contractual commitments. Based on our agreement with the shipyard, the total commitments for our newbuild drillships has increased by approximately $14 million. This delay has also pushed the expected final milestone payment for DS 10 until 2017, and has reduced our outlook for 2015 capital expenditures by approximately $300 million. Through June 30, capital investments in the fleet totaled roughly $900 million. 
For the remainder of the year, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately $800 million. This breaks down as follows. $600 million in newbuild CapEx, including ENSCO DS-8 that was delivered earlier this month, $100 million for rig enhancement projects, and $100 million for sustaining projects. Beyond 2015, newbuild CapEx is estimated to be approximately $800 million with $450 million expected to occur in 2016 and the remaining $350 million in 2017 as the final milestone payment is made for ENSCO DS-10. As Carl just mentioned, we now project total CapEx for 2016 and 2017 to be less than $750 million per year. 
So in closing, the current market calls for aggressive management of costs. We began our cost reduction efforts more than a year ago by identifying several rigs that were not part of our go-forward fleet and would be sold, and we then quickly reduced costs for these rigs. Earlier, this year, we reduced offshore compensation costs and onshore headcount, generating additional savings. Since then, we have continue to proactively stack rigs rolling off contracts, that do not have near term contracting opportunities to further reduce expenses. As Carl outlined earlier, we are taking steps to streamline our organizational structure, which will benefit expenses in the future. We remain diligent on expense management, evaluating opportunities within the company both offshore and onshore and working with vendors and suppliers to drive additional costs out of the system. 
Cyclical downturns like the ones that the offshore industry is currently facing, requires solid financial positioning. Over the past year, our actions in the capital markets have further strengthened our liquidity in capital position, giving us greater flexibility to navigate the downturn. We have maintained strong investment grade credit ratings and remain among the highest rated companies in our sector. This will allow us to continue to focus on further improving operational, safety and financial performance, better positioning Ensco in the near term and for the inevitable up cycle. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Sean."

So we have 3 left under construction, if I deal with the 140 and 141 series, which have been built in the Middle East. At this stage, we don't have any intention to defer those. Those rigs have been very specifically built to a technology and a specification that we know is required by customers in the Middle East and Africa region. And we think that we will find good placement with them by the time they come out. We also have the opportunity if that will happen to actually use them to high grade the fleet that we have and replace some of the older rigs there. So they continue on track at this point. The other jackup rig, ENSCO 123 that has been built in Singapore, this is the final one of the series that have been tremendously successful in the North Sea. We're going to evaluate whether we have immediate work for that rig to go in the next 2 quarters and we'll make a decision, but we may still take delivery of the rig on-time even if we don't have an immediate job for it because it's a very different prospect taking delivery and stacking ourselves, a jackup is a drillship.

If there's any good news at the moment, and with the recent further downturn of commodity price, I think it's going to lead to the realization that we are in an extended period of downturn. And we will",422,"Yes. So let me take you first the big macro picture. If there's any good news at the moment, and with the recent further downturn of commodity price, I think it's going to lead to the realization that we are in an extended period of downturn. And we will force more stacking at a more accelerated rate. I think if things have started to pick up a little bit as we went through the second half of the year, while people felt there was a few, it may have caused people to delay or not take some harsh decisions. I think now, what we're going to see is it's going to lead to a more aggressive stacking and probably scrapping plan as we go forward. We are already seeing about 19% of the floater fleet already strapped or permanently stacked. With the age floaters coming off, a lot of these are going to really struggle to find any continuing work, given that they're competing against much younger rigs. And so I think we're going to more towards 25%, 30% of the current marketing fleet, being stacked and removed from the market. And probably struggle to come back. And I think this is one of the positive stories that probably hasn't been picked up as much by the market commentators, is the rate with which we could see additional stacking over the next 2 to 3 quarters. 
For ourselves, we took the decision to stack our a lot of our age SEMI last year and put them in held-for-sale. We have taken a decision that DS 2 and DS 1 are not a part of our go-forward fleet at the moment. Now, with respect to having rigs available for picking up short-term work or things that may become available in the near term, from our point of view, we do intent to do that, we intend to have a balance, which is why for example, we have stacked some of the 85 series with the intention of bringing baking them back. But we don't intend to market that entire fleet. But we will keep some of those rigs available for work coming up, and we're in negotiations and chasing some leads and opportunities for those rigs. So keeping geographic spread of floaters available to pick up the work is certainly, something we will do. But we will balance it by taking some of the other markets -- some of the other rigs, and stacking them, if we don't there is enough market opportunities."

Let me take the jackup question, maybe I'll expand a little bit into a broader discussion of the market outlook. And so the first thing to remember is a lot of the jackup shallow water basins and environments are still economic of the current oil prices. And accordingly we are seeing still ongoing activity, and we are seeing some new tendering opportunities. Now, clearly, its not the same level it was a year or 2 years ago, but we are seeing ongoing activity. Now the Asia-Pacific region and the Gulf of Mexico are extremely challenged, very difficult market still because of a falloff in activity. Middle East and Africa, largely driven by NOCs, but also some IOCs and independence is actually still quite robust. And in a few countries, or few smaller areas, it's actually growing. And do not see outside of Norway, is holding up actually quite well, given the circumstances, especially because some customers are using the opportunity of market pricing and conditions to do intervention work to bring on more productional to do P&A work -- plug and abandonment. So that's a quick walk around. We do see an uptick coming in some jackup tenders across the world over the next couple of quarters, but as I said in the prepared statements, these are not going to materially change the outlook. In general, if I go to a broader discussion on the outlook, we are all evidenced that people we're looking for that we may see a pickup in activity as we go into '16, that's clearly, not transpired as we go into the second half of the year. We will exit the year as an industry with increased idle capacity. And I don't believe that we will see any increase in our customers offshore budgets next year. And so accordingly, we are going to see utilization and day rate still under pressure at 316. 
Now, that said, when we talk to customers, we do see a number of projects have been pushed out, that seems to be scheduled for '17, tendering in the latter half of '16. And we do see a little evidence of customers coming trying to take current pricing now, 2017 activity, maybe indicates where they feel things might go. So I think it's going to be weak throughout the remainder of '15 and '16, and then, for pick up in '17, we need to see some key things happen on the macroenvironment, but certainly, that's where a lot of the delayed work seems to be getting pushed out."

Second quarter results were highlighted by good operational, safety and financial performance.

Second quarter results were highlighted by good operational, safety and financial performance. As noted in our press release, we had 98% operational utilization for jackups, strong safety performance, and earnings that were driven by disciplined expense management and our efficiency initiatives. 
Earnings from continuing operations, excluding cost to refinance debt, were $1.18 per share for the second quarter. Our offshore crews, capital project teams and onshore personnel are to be recognized for a quarter defined by good execution. Our teams have kept that focus on the things that we can control: Operations, safety and efficiency, and have not been distracted by the challenges our sector is facing during the current market and term.
Since our last earnings call, there have been some significant developments with respect to our fleet structure. In terms of fleet highgrading, ENSCO 110, our newest premium jackup rig, was successfully delivered on time and on budget, and we have had a seamless handoff between capital projects and operations as the rig commenced its initial 3-year contract in Abu Dhabi. While there have been limited number of new contracts announced so far this year, ENSCO 110 along with ENSCO 104, earned multiyear contracts during the quarter on the strength of our safety, operations and customer satisfaction track record. Ensco has a particularly strong reputation in the Middle East, the largest region for our jackup rig, and this helped us to win this new business. 
Our ENSCO DS-8 drillship was delivered from the shipyard and is on track to commence operations later this year. It will be a major contributor to future financial results given its 5-year contract to work offshore Angola.
Our capital projects team did an excellent job delivering ENSCO DS-9 as well. This drillship will also be a significant contributor to our floaters segment financial results, given strong contract provisions that protect us despite previously announced cancellation notice from the customer for its convenience. The provisions of the DS-9 contract, which require payments in monthly installments beginning the month after termination notice, mean that cash flows for this rig will begin during the third quarter. Therefore, there will be no negative impact on earnings for 2015, 2016 and the first half of 2017.
In a mutually negotiated deal, we extended the contract term for ENSCO DS-7 in Angola to the fourth quarter of 2017, gaining approximately $125 million of revenue backlog on a net basis, since, as part of this agreement, the contract for the DS-1 was terminated early. As a result, we have accelerated our plans to cold stack DS-1 following the completion of its contract since we do not currently view it as part of our go-forward fleet. 
Recently, we reached an agreement with a shipyard to defer the delivery and a large milestone payment for our final drillship on the construction, ENSCO DS-10, by 18 months to the first quarter of 2017. Jay will expand on the financial implications shortly. However, as a consequence of this decision, full year capital expenditures for 2015 have been reduced to approximately $1.7 billion. 
We have completed cold stacking for ENSCO 8501 and 8502. Due to a very well-planned and executed process, the cost to undertake this stacking has been reduced to approximately $5 million per rig. As previously announced, we intend to bring these rigs back into the active fleet when market conditions improve.
We continue to market the remaining 8500 Series rigs and are pursuing several opportunities. We will evaluate whether to stack another 8500 Series rig as we go through the second half of this year. 
With respect to our rigs held for sale, we recently sold ENSCO 5002 for scrap volume. Over the past 12 months, we have taken delivery of 4 newbuild rigs, we have sold 6 rigs and placed another 6 rigs into held for sale, removing them from our go-forward fleet. This is part of a deliberate strategy to highgrade our fleet as we navigate the downturn. In addition, we have decided to reduce our near-term marketed fleet by cold stacking another 8 rigs, including ENSCO 8501 and 8502. Four newbuild rigs currently under construction will also bolster our fleet restructuring over the next 2 years as they are delivered. 
In terms of contracting, our marketing teams have done a good job in a tough market, securing additional work including the 2 jackup rigs that I just mentioned in the Middle East, which David will elaborate on in a moment. On the expense side, we are achieving the cost saving targets we set out earlier this year in terms of a 9% reduction in unit labor costs to offshore workers plus $27 million in annual savings from streamlining our onshore workforce. In addition, we are rationalizing office space for shore-based operations in conjunction with our announcement earlier this year to reduce onshore headcount by 15%. We also plan to streamline our organizational reporting structure by consolidating our 5 geographic business units into 3, given market conditions in the Asia Pacific region where we currently have only 4 rigs under contract, and the Brazil market where we have just 4 active floaters. We will provide more information on our next conference call, including savings related to these steps. We have also been working with vendors and suppliers to lower costs and improve equipment reliability.
Turning now to capital management. Since our last call, we have completed the tender of a process for our previously announced debt refinancing. As a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities until the second quarter of 2019. We have maintained our investment grade credit rating. And we continue to have significant liquidity and capital management flexibility, with $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet, a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and revenue backlog of about $7.4 billion. 
Our capital expenditures will peak in 2015 at approximately $1.7 billion. Beyond 2015, we anticipate total CapEx will be significantly reduced from this level to less than $750 million a year in 2016 and 2017 as we complete our newbuilds on the construction.
Now let me turn to market conditions and outlook. It's clear that we are in the midst of a significant downturn in offshore drilling. And market conditions that would have been supportive of a near-term recovery have not materialized. As a result, we are witnessing a continued pullback in capital expenditure by our customers in the deepwater market. These conditions reinforce our view that weak market conditions for our sector will continue through 2015 and 2016. We anticipate an uptick in contract placements across the sector as we go through the second half of 2015, especially in the jackup market, but these pictures aren't expected to materially change our outlook for the next 18 months.
That said, we still believe in the long-term recovery of deepwater drilling. There are 3 important factors that will help this market recovery. First is the reduction in rig supply. As older generation rigs are scrapped and removed from the active fleet, idle rigs are stacked and newbuild deliveries are pushed out or canceled. As David will cover in a moment, a meaningful number of rigs older than 30 years will come off contract in the next 6 months. And we believe most of these will be stacked permanently. 
Secondly, cost deflation and more standardized engineering solutions have the potential to significantly reduce the breakeven costs of deepwater developments. 
And third, we believe there are meaningful opportunity to improve the quality management process across the supply chain in offshore drilling, which should ultimately lead to better efficiency across our sector. 
For shallow water, average commodity price hurdles to support drilling are generally lower than deepwater. As such, we are seeing more customer activity in shallow water, especially as we go into 2016, although competition is still intense for these opportunities.
Finally, we recently announced that given Jay's upcoming retirement after more than 12 years with Ensco, we have begun a search for our next CFO. Jay is turning 65 next month, but will remain CFO until we complete the succession process. Jay has been a major contributor to Ensco's many achievements for more than a decade, and extremely helpful to me personally over the past year since I joined Ensco. We look forward to his continued contributions as we complete the CFO succession process. 
Now I will turn the call over to David."

In terms of customer demand, while we are clearly experiencing a very difficult market environment, we have seen an increase in the number of customer discussions for potential opportunities since our last conference call. While this increas",1303,"Thanks, Carl. In terms of customer demand, while we are clearly experiencing a very difficult market environment, we have seen an increase in the number of customer discussions for potential opportunities since our last conference call. While this increases off the low number of tenders and inquires seen during the first quarter and many of these opportunities are shorter term in nature, we are seeing pockets of customer demand, even in a lower oil price environment. 
For example, as Carl mentioned, we recently contracted 2 of our premium jackups, ENSCO 110 and ENSCO 104, with repeat customer NDC in the Middle East. Both rigs were awarded 3-year contracts. ENSCO 110, our most recent newbuild jackup delivery, commenced its initial contract in May and has had an excellent start for NDC. ENSCO 104 is scheduled to begin its contract in August. The Middle East has been the strongest market in terms of customer demand and we have 10 jackups contracted in the region.
Moving to the North Sea, we were able to extend ENSCO 101 to midyear 2016 with its current customer. Earlier this month, we signed letters of intent for ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72, both for 3-year terms in Denmark. ENSCO 71 is already on-site and ENSCO 72 is expected to continue working once it completes its current contract in September. As a result, both rigs are scheduled to work into 2018. And once these agreements are finalized, our number of contracted jackups will increase to 9 in the North Sea, a market where ENSCO has a strong reputation among customers.
Moving to our floater fleet. We were able to extend the term for our ultra-deepwater drillship, ENSCO DS-7, for an additional year as part of a blend and extend agreement that will keep the rig working into fourth quarter 2017. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we extended ENSCO 8500 for 2 months and secured short-term plug and abandon work for ENSCO 8506. 
While our customer CapEx budgets have been reduced significantly this year, we are seeing some situations where customers' regional management is securing corporate level approval to extend certain rigs on certain well programs. In other situations, however, we had experienced some early terminations for convenience. But here, we are seeing the strength of our contracts. 
For example, we recently received notification to terminate the ENSCO DS-9 contract for the customer's convenience. Based on the contract terms, they are obligated to pay the operating day rate of approximately $550,000 for 2 years, so we do not anticipate a material negative impact to 2015 or 2016 results as a result of this termination. While some projects have been canceled, such as the exploration work DS-9 was scheduled to begin later this year, the vast majority of projects being influenced by spending cuts are being delayed rather than canceled outright.
Looking out longer term, it has been encouraging to see a pickup in the offshore exploration success recently, coupled with lease sales and frontier plays in established basins that have drawn interest from several major customers. 
Recently, we saw a high profile deepwater program receive FID approval from a major E&P customer, underscoring the compelling reserves that some offshore basins provide, even in a lower oil price environment. Operation and development of these reserves will require drilling rigs. And I believe Ensco's strengths, including our number one ranking in overall customer satisfaction and safety, differentiate Ensco from the competition as new contracting opportunities arise.
In terms of our newbuild rigs, in addition to DS-9, we accepted delivery of ENSCO DS-8 earlier this month and the rig is currently mobilizing to Angola for its initial 5-year contract. As Carl mentioned, we delayed the delivery of ENSCO DS-10, our only remaining uncontracted newbuild floater, until first quarter 2017. Other drillers with uncontracted newbuild floaters have also postponed rigs initially scheduled for delivery in 2015. As a result, only 10 new floaters are now scheduled for delivery by the end of 2015 and half of these rigs are contracted. The other remaining uncontracted deliveries may also be delayed in anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future. 
Positive supply development since our last earnings call include the cancellation of 4 newbuild floaters that were on order. Additionally, reports suggest that the build in Brazil program, originally expected to add 29 floaters to the global supply by 2020, faces significant challenges and that more than half of these rigs may not be delivered. Nine of these floaters are scheduled for delivery in 2016, but may be delayed due to financial, shipyard and other issues. If additional newbuilds were to be delayed or canceled, this would be another incremental positive for global floater supply.
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups, there are approximately 45 newbuilds, with expected deliveries by year-end 2015, all of which are uncontracted. More than 65% of these uncontracted deliveries are with speculators that have never operated a rig, and it remains to be seen whether these approximately 30 units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation and delays of many newbuild jackups. This will likely continue as companies who ordered these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments, given the limited contracting opportunities. This, in turn, would put more pressure on shipyards that will have to assess continued investment in the construction of partially completed rigs.
Turning now to scrapping and cold stacking of floaters and jackups. It's reasonable to assume that offshore drillers will continue to rationalize their fleets. Scrapping older rigs with limited contracting opportunities that may require CapEx to keep them certified to work and cold stacking other rigs that do not have recontracting opportunities allows drillers to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn. 
Since September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 39 floaters. Over the same period, an additional 22 floaters have been cold stacked. We believe that the majority of these rigs will also be scrapped. In total, these 61 rigs represent approximately 19% of competitive global supply. 
Additionally, 17 floaters older than 30 years of age are currently idle without follow-on work, and another approximately 20 floaters greater than 30 years old will see their contracts expire before this year-end. All will be likely candidates for scrapping and or cold stacking and, as a group, they are more than 3x the number of floaters currently scheduled to enter the market by year-end. And as I mentioned earlier, some of these may also be deferred. We anticipate the scrapping and stacking trend will continue, which will help to improve the supply and demand balance. 
Similarly, on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jackups defined as independent leg cantilever rigs: Roughly 55 are stacked or idle without follow-on work and older than 30 years of age, another approximately 45 rig -- working rigs that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring before year-end. Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years, can involve significant capital investment. In a tight cash flow environment and faced with uncertain recontracting prospects for less capable jackups, drillers may choose to cold stack or even scrap these older units rather than spend 10s of millions of dollars in upgrades. Additional information on the global supply of rigs is provided in our investor presentation on our website.
In closing, our operational and safety performance differentiate Ensco in the market as evidenced by several new contract awards since our last call. While the market remains challenging in the near-term, we expect to win business by continuing to leverage our operational and safety track record, our differentiated technology and our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

Today, I will cover our second quarter financial results, our third quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments.As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing",1387,"Thanks, David. Today, I will cover our second quarter financial results, our third quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments.
As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for the previously announced debt retirement and loss on impairment a ago, were $1.18 compared to $1.49 last year. Total second quarter revenue was $1.06 billion versus $1.14 billion a year ago as lower utilization across the fleet, including several floaters that have been contracted at above average day rates a year ago, were partially offset by the reactivation of 3 upgraded floaters: ENSCO 5004, 5005 and 5006, and the addition of 3 newbuild jackups to the active fleet. 
Floater segment revenue was $634 million compared to $680 million a year ago, primarily due to lower utilization for several floaters in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that contributed to a decline in the average day rate to $417,000 from $481,000 a year ago. Reported floater utilization was 76%, unchanged from a year ago. Operational utilization for the floater segment, which adjusts for uncontracted days and planned downtime, was 92%, also unchanged from a year ago. 
Jackup segment revenue was $384 million compared to a $441 million a year ago, as utilization declined to 77% from 88% last year. This decline was partially offset by a slight increase in the average day rate to $140,000. The addition of high specification jackups to the active fleet contributed to this increase in average day rates. Operational utilization for the total jackup fleet was 98%, reflecting the continued focus of our offshore crews on delivering high levels of uptime to our customers regardless of market conditions. We reduced total contract drilling expense to $503 million from $543 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and repair and maintenance costs, more than offset the following items: The reactivation of 3 floaters, the addition of 3 newbuild jackups to the fleet, and approximately $10 million in upfront stacking costs, depreciation expense increased $8 million to $141 million, in line with our expectations, due to the reactivation of the 3 floaters and the addition of the 3 newbuild jackups that I just mentioned. 
Disciplined expense management, including lower personnel costs, reduced general and administrative expense to $30 million, which was $6 million less than a year ago. As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $55 million from $31 million a year ago for 2 key reasons: Cost to retire our 2016 senior notes and other smaller debt maturities increased other net by $7 million, and interest expense was $15 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt offering during the third quarter of 2014. 
Our effective tax rate was 18% compared to an adjusted tax rate of 10% a year ago, due to the mix of earnings from various tax jurisdiction and tax legislation enacted by the U.K. government. Our third quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 12%.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline from second quarter results of $1.06 billion due to lower reported utilization and average day rates across the feet. For our entire fleet and continuing operations, we expect reported utilization to be in the mid-60% range compared to 76% in the second quarter. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 3% from second quarter levels, up $237,000. 
As Carl mentioned, the contract terms for the DS-9 termination fee are expected to bring cash flows forward into the third quarter. As previously reported, the quarter will also benefit from a lump sum payment for the DS-4 early termination. 
We anticipate third quarter contract drilling expense will decline by approximately 8% from $503 million in the second quarter as we continue to actively manage our cost base. 
We expect third quarter G&A expense to be in line with the second quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to increase approximately $3 million from second quarter levels to $144 million, as ENSCO 110 operates for a full fourth quarter.
In total, other expense is estimated to be approximately $54 million in the third quarter as interest expense is partially offset by interest income. 
Now I will provide an update on the cost reduction plans announced earlier this year. With the cold stacking process for ENSCO 8501 and 8502 now complete, cash costs for these rigs will be less than $10,000 per day, so cash savings will be approximately $120,000 per day until we reactivate the rigs. 
We have cold stacked 4 jackups, 3 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and one in the Middle East. We're in the process of cold stacking another jackup in Asia. Cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day with cash savings of approximately $40,000 per day. 
We remain on track to achieve a 9% reduction in average offshore unit labor costs from 2014 levels, which translates into meaningful cost savings since roughly half of the contract drilling expense is offshore compensation. 
Second quarter results include a full quarter's impact of the 15% reduction in offshore personnel that was implemented earlier this year and is expected to generate annualized savings of $27 million. We continue to negotiate cost reductions with vendors and suppliers, and we expect to reduce expense and capital expenditures going forward. 
So now let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have $7.4 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place. At June 30, we had a net debt to capital ratio of 32% and $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. 
By virtue of our recent debt refinancing, we currently have no remaining debt maturities until 2019, plus we have a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us significant liquidity and capital management flexibility. 
The delivery delay of DS-10 has changed our contractual commitments. Based on our agreement with the shipyard, the total commitments for our newbuild drillships has increased by approximately $14 million. This delay has also pushed the expected final milestone payment for DS-10 out until 2017 and has reduced our outlook for 2015 capital expenditures by approximately $300 million. Through June 30, capital investments in the fleet totaled roughly $900 million.
For the remainder of the year, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately $800 million. This breaks down as follows: $600 million in newbuild CapEx, including ENSCO DS-8 that was delivered earlier this month; $100 million for rig enhancement projects; and $100 million for sustaining projects. 
Beyond 2015, newbuild CapEx is estimated to be approximately $800 million, with $450 million expected to occur in 2016 and the remaining $350 million in 2017 as the final milestone payment is made for ENSCO DS-10. As Carl just mentioned, we now project total CapEx for 2016 and 2017 to be less than $750 million per year.
So in closing, the current market calls for aggressive management of costs. We began our cost reduction efforts more than a year ago by identifying several rigs that were not part of our go-forward fleet and would be sold, and we then quickly reduced costs for these rigs. Earlier this year, we reduced offshore compensation cost and onshore headcount, generating additional savings. Since then, we have continued to proactively stack rigs, rolling off contracts that do not have near-term contracting opportunities to further reduce expenses. 
As Carl outlined earlier, we are taking steps to streamline our organization structure, which will benefit expenses in the future. We remain diligent on expense management, evaluating opportunities within the company, both offshore and onshore, and working with vendors and suppliers to drive additional costs out of the system.
Cyclical downturns, like the one that the offshore industry is currently facing, requires solid financial positioning. Over the past year, our actions in the capital markets have further strengthened our liquidity and capital position, giving us greater flexibility to navigate the downturn. 
We have maintained strong investment grade credit ratings and remain among the highest rated companies in our sector. This will allow us to continue to focus on further improving operational, safety and financial performance, better positioning Ensco in the near-term and for the inevitable up cycle. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

Before we open up for questions, please note that we filed our 10-Q this morning, which includes an update regarding developments in Brazil. 
Since our last earnings call, there has been media coverage regarding an internal audit report released by our customer, Petrobras. It discusses events dating back to 2007 and 2008 in Brazil before we acquired Pride International. The report makes inferences that former Pride employees may have been involved in improper activities, something that we take very seriously. The customer provided a copy of their internal audit report to Brazil government authorities that have since requested a copy of the DS-5 drilling services contract from Petrobras. While the audit report became public more than 2 months ago, to-date, we have not been contacted by Brazil authorities and none of our current or former employees have been accused of any wrongdoing by any legal authorities.
As our 10-Q states, we have conducted compliance reviews, audits and independent investigations over an extended period of time, including more recent investigations in light of developments in Brazil. After investigation and benchmarking, we respectfully disagree with our customer's internal audit report with respect to comments regarding overpayments under the DS-5 drilling services contract. Publicly available data shows that the terms of the contract were comparable to what is signed at the time. We have shared this information with our customer. And should Brazil authorities contact us regarding these matters, we would, of course, fully cooperate. 
Today, our internal and independent investigations have found no evidence of improper activities by current or former employees regarding these matters. Our investigations continue and we will look at all aspects relating to the award of the DS-5 contract, including the activities of third party consultants. As I mentioned, this is described more -- in more detail within our 10-Q disclosure.

So the -- so we have 3 left under construction, if I deal with the 140 and 141 Series, which have been built in the Middle East. At this stage, we don't have any intention to defer those. Those rigs have been very specifically built to a technology and a specification that we know is required by customers in the Middle East and Africa region. And we think that we will find good placement with them by the time they come out. 
We also have the opportunity if that was to happen to actually use them to highgrade the fleet that we have and replace some of the older rigs that are there. So they continue on track at this point. 
The other jackup rig, ENSCO 123, that has been built in Singapore, this is the final one of a series that has been tremendously successful in the North Sea. We are going to evaluate whether we have immediate work for that rig to go in the next 2 quarters and we will make a decision. But we may still take delivery of the rig on time even if we don't have an immediate job for it because it's a very different prospect, taking delivery and stacking ourselves, a jackup is a drillship.

Whether that's stacked or scrapped, it doesn't really matter. 
But just as we look at the idle floater fleet for Ensco, it looks like everything is kind of positioned we're in a down market. Now you probably want an idle or available rig in the Gulf of Mexico, you probably want one or 2 of those in the Asia region. So just as we think about that, and I know you can't talk to other companies, but as you think about as that impacts Ensco, does it make sense to have that available ready-to-go, hot stacked floater spread out geographically for those one-off jobs that potentially can show up?"

If there is any good news in -- at the moment, and with the recent further downturn of commodity price, I think it's going to lead to the realization that we are in an extended period of downturn and",432,"Yes. So let me take it first at the big macro picture. If there is any good news in -- at the moment, and with the recent further downturn of commodity price, I think it's going to lead to the realization that we are in an extended period of downturn and will force more stacking at a more accelerated rate. I think if things had started to pick up a little bit as we went to the second half of the year, while people felt there was a few green shoots, it may have caused people to delay or not take some harsh decisions. I think now, what we're going to see is that it's going to lead to a more aggressive stacking and probably scrapping plan as we go forward. 
We're already seeing about 19% of the floater fleet already scrapped or permanently stacked. With the aged floaters coming off, a lot of these are going to really struggle to find any continuing work, given that they're competing against much younger rigs. And so I think we're going to move towards 25%, 30% of the current marketed fleet being stacked and removed from the market and probably struggle to come back. And I think this is one of the positive stories that probably hasn't been picked up as much on by the market commentators is the rate with which we could see additional stacking over the next 2 to 3 quarters.
And for ourselves, we took the decision to stack a lot of our aged semis last year and put them in held for sale. And we have taken the decision that DS-2 and DS-1 are not part of our go-forward fleet at the moment. 
Now with respect to having rigs available for picking up short-term work or things that may become available in the near-term, from our point of view, we do intend to do that. We intend to have a balanced, which is why, for example, we have stacked some of the 85 Series with the intention of bringing them back, but we don't intend to market that entire fleet. But we will keep some of those rigs available for work coming up. And we are in negotiations and chasing some leads at the moment for opportunities for those rigs. 
So keeping a geographic spread of floaters available to pick up the work is certainly something we will do. But we will balance it by taking some of the other markets -- some of the other rigs and stacking them if we don't think there is enough market opportunities."

So let me take the jackup question, then maybe I'll expand it a little bit into a broader discussion of the market outlook. 
And so the first thing to remember is that a lot of the jackup shallow water basins and environments are still economic at the current oil prices. And accordingly, we are seeing still ongoing activity and we are seeing some new tendering opportunities. Now, clearly, it's not the same level it was a year or 2 years ago, but we are seeing ongoing activity. 
Now the Asia Pacific region and the Gulf of Mexico are extremely challenged. I mean, they are very difficult markets still because of a falloff in activity. The Middle East and Africa, largely driven by NOCs but also some IOCs and independents, is actually still quite robust. And in a few countries or few smaller areas, it's actually growing. And the North Sea outside of Norway is holding up actually quite well given the circumstances, especially because some customers are using the opportunity of market pricing and conditions to do intervention work to bring on more productional or to do P&A work, plug and abandonment. So that's a quick walk around. 
We do see an uptick coming in some jackup tenders across the world over the next couple of quarters. But as I said in the prepared statements, these are not going to materially change the outlook. 
In general, if I go to a broader discussion on the outlook, we are all evidenced that people we're looking for that we may see a pickup in activity as we go into '16. That's clearly not transpired in the -- as we go into the second half of the year. We will exit the year as an industry with increased idle capacity. And I don't believe that we will see any increase in our customers' offshore budgets next year. And so accordingly, we are going to see utilization and day rates still under pressure through '16.
Now that said, when we talk to customers, we do see a number of projects that have been pushed out that seems to be scheduled for '17 and -- or tendering in the latter half of '16. And we do see little -- a little evidence of customers coming, trying to take current pricing now for 2017 activity, which maybe indicates where they feel things might go. 
So I think it's going to be weak throughout the remainder of '15 and '16. And then, for pick up in '17, we need to see some key things happen on the macroenvironment. But certainly, that's where a lot of the delayed work seems to be getting pushed out here."

While there have been limited number of new contracts announced so far this year, ENSCO 110 along with ENSCO 104 earned multiyear contracts during the quarter on the strength of our safety, operations and customer satisfaction track record. Ensco has a particularly strong reputation in the Middle East, the largest region for our jackup rig, and this helped us to win this new business. 
Our ENSCO DS-8 drillship was delivered from the shipyard and is on track to commence operations later this year. It will be a major contributor to future financial results, given its 5-year contract to work offshore Angola.
Our capital projects team did an excellent job delivering ENSCO DS-9 as well. This drillship will also be a significant contributor to our floaters segment financial results, given strong contract provisions that protect us despite the previously announced cancellation notice from the customer for its convenience. The provisions of the DS-9 contract, which require payments in monthly installments beginning the month after termination notice, means that cash flows for this rig will begin during the third quarter. Therefore, there will be no negative impact on earnings for 2015, 2016 and the first half of 2017.
In a mutually negotiated deal, we extended the contract term for ENSCO DS-7 in Angola to the fourth quarter of 2017, gaining approximately $125 million of revenue backlog on a net basis, since, as part of this agreement, the contract for the DS-1 was terminated early. As a result, we have accelerated our plans to cold stack DS-1 following the completion of its contract since we do not currently view it as part of our go-forward fleet. 
Recently, we reached an agreement with a shipyard to defer the delivery and a large milestone payment for our final drillship under construction, ENSCO DS-10, by 18 months to the first quarter of 2017. Jay will expand on the financial implications shortly. However, as a consequence of this decision, full year capital expenditures for 2015 have been reduced to approximately $1.7 billion. 
We have completed cold stacking for ENSCO 8501 and 8502. Due to a very well-planned and executed process, the cost to undertake the stacking has been reduced to approximately $5 million per rig. As previously announced, we intend to bring these rigs back into the active fleet when market conditions improve.
We continue to market the remaining 8500 Series rigs and are pursuing several opportunities. We will evaluate whether to stack another 8500 Series rig as we go through the second half of this year. 
With respect to our rigs held for sale, we recently sold ENSCO 5002 for scrap value. Over the past 12 months, we have taken delivery of 4 newbuild rigs, we have sold 6 rigs and placed another 6 rigs into held for sale, removing them from our go-forward fleet. This is part of a deliberate strategy to highgrade our fleet as we navigate the downturn. In addition, we have decided to reduce our near-term marketed fleet by cold stacking another 8 rigs, including ENSCO 8501 and 8502. Four newbuild rigs currently under construction will also bolster our fleet restructuring over the next 2 years as they are delivered. 
In terms of contracting, our marketing teams have done a good job in a tough market, securing additional work, including the 2 jackup rigs that I just mentioned in the Middle East, which David will elaborate on in a moment. On the expense side, we are achieving the cost saving targets we set out earlier this year in terms of a 9% reduction in unit labor costs to offshore workers plus $27 million in annual savings from streamlining our onshore workforce. In addition, we are rationalizing office space for shore-based operations in conjunction with our announcement earlier this year to reduce onshore headcount by 15%. We also plan to streamline our organizational reporting structure by consolidating our 5 geographic business units into 3, given market conditions in the Asia Pacific region, where we currently have only 4 rigs under contract, and the Brazil market, where we have just 4 active floaters. We will provide more information on our next conference call, including savings related to these steps. We have also been working with vendors and suppliers to lower costs and improve equipment reliability.
Turning now to capital management. Since our last call, we have completed the tender offer process for our previously announced debt refinancing. As a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities until the second quarter of 2019. We have maintained our investment-grade credit rating. And we continue to have significant liquidity and capital management flexibility, with $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet, a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and revenue backlog of about $7.4 billion. 
Our capital expenditures will peak in 2015 at approximately $1.7 billion. Beyond 2015, we anticipate total CapEx will be significantly reduced from this level to less than $750 million a year in 2016 and 2017 as we complete our newbuilds under construction.
Now let me turn to market conditions and outlook. It's clear that we are in the midst of a significant downturn in offshore drilling. And market conditions that would have been supportive of a near-term recovery have not materialized. As a result, we are witnessing a continued pullback in capital expenditure by our customers in the deepwater market. These conditions reinforce our view that weak market conditions for our sector will continue through 2015 and 2016. We anticipate an uptick in contract placements across the sector as we go through the second half of 2015, especially in the jackup market, but these pictures [ph] aren't expected to materially change our outlook for the next 18 months.
That said, we still believe in the long-term recovery of deepwater drilling. There are 3 important factors that will help this market recovery. First is the reduction in rig supply. As older generation rigs are scrapped and removed from the active fleet, idle rigs are stacked and newbuild deliveries are pushed out or canceled. As David will cover in a moment, a meaningful number of rigs older than 30 years will come off contract in the next 6 months. And we believe most of these will be stacked permanently.
Secondly, cost deflation and more standardized engineering solutions have the potential to significantly reduce the breakeven costs of deepwater developments. 
And third, we believe there are meaningful opportunity to improve the quality management process across the supply chain in offshore drilling, which should ultimately lead to better efficiency across our sector.
For shallow water, average commodity price hurdles to support drilling are generally lower than deepwater. As such, we are seeing more customer activity in shallow water, especially as we go into 2016, although competition is still intense for these opportunities.
Finally, we recently announced that given Jay's upcoming retirement after more than 12 years with Ensco, we have begun a search for our next CFO. Jay is turning 65 next month but will remain CFO until we complete the succession process. Jay has been a major contributor to Ensco's many achievements for more than a decade and extremely helpful to me personally over the past year since I joined Ensco. We look forward to his continued contributions as we complete the CFO succession process. 
Now I will turn the call over to David."

In terms of customer demand, while we are clearly experiencing a very difficult market environment, we have seen an increase in the number of customer discussions for potential opportunities since our last conference call. While this increas",1298,"Thanks, Carl. In terms of customer demand, while we are clearly experiencing a very difficult market environment, we have seen an increase in the number of customer discussions for potential opportunities since our last conference call. While this increase is off a low number of tenders and inquiries seen during the first quarter and many of these opportunities are shorter term in nature, we are seeing pockets of customer demand, even in a lower oil price environment. 
For example, as Carl mentioned, we recently contracted 2 of our premium jackups, ENSCO 110 and ENSCO 104, with repeat customer NDC in the Middle East. Both rigs were awarded 3-year contracts. ENSCO 110, our most recent newbuild jackup delivery, commenced its initial contract in May and has had an excellent start for NDC. ENSCO 104 is scheduled to begin its contract in August. The Middle East has been the strongest market in terms of customer demand, and we have 10 jackups contracted in the region.
Moving to the North Sea, we were able to extend ENSCO 101 to midyear 2016 with its current customer. Earlier this month, we signed letters of intent for ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72, both for 3-year terms in Denmark. ENSCO 71 is already on-site, and ENSCO 72 is expected to continue working once it completes its current contract in September. As a result, both rigs are scheduled to work into 2018. And once these agreements are finalized, our number of contracted jackups will increase to 9 in the North Sea, a market where ENSCO has a strong reputation among customers.
Moving to our floater fleet. We were able to extend the term for our ultra-deepwater drillship, ENSCO DS-7, for an additional year as part of a blend and extend agreement that will keep the rig working into fourth quarter 2017. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we extended ENSCO 8500 for 2 months and secured short-term plug and abandon work for ENSCO 8506. 
While customer CapEx budgets have been reduced significantly this year, we are seeing some situations where customers' regional management is securing corporate level approval to extend certain rigs on certain well programs. In other situations, however, we have experienced some early terminations for convenience. But here, we are seeing the strength of our contracts. 
For example, we recently received notification to terminate the ENSCO DS-9 contract for the customer's convenience. Based on the contract terms, they are obligated to pay the operating day rates of approximately $550,000 for 2 years, so we do not anticipate a material negative impact to 2015 or 2016 results as a result of this termination. While some projects have been canceled, such as the exploration work DS-9 was scheduled to begin later this year, the vast majority of projects being influenced by spending cuts are being delayed rather than canceled outright.
Looking out longer term, it has been encouraging to see a pickup in the offshore exploration success recently, coupled with lease sales and frontier plays in established basins that have drawn interest from several major customers. 
Recently, we saw a high profile deepwater program receive FID approval from a major E&P customer, underscoring the compelling reserves that some offshore basins provide, even in a lower oil price environment. Appraisal and development of these reserves will require drilling rigs, and I believe Ensco's strengths, including our #1 ranking in overall customer satisfaction and safety, differentiate Ensco from the competition as new contracting opportunities arise.
In terms of our newbuild rigs, in addition to DS-9, we accepted delivery of ENSCO DS-8 earlier this month, and the rig is currently mobilizing to Angola for its initial 5-year contract. As Carl mentioned, we delayed the delivery of ENSCO DS-10, our only remaining uncontracted newbuild floater, until first quarter 2017. Other drillers with uncontracted newbuild floaters have also postponed rigs initially scheduled for delivery in 2015. As a result, only 10 new floaters are now scheduled for delivery by the end of 2015, and half of these rigs are contracted. The other remaining uncontracted deliveries may also be delayed in anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future. 
Positive supply development since our last earnings call include the cancellation of 4 newbuild floaters that were on order. Additionally, reports suggest that the build in Brazil program, originally expected to add 29 floaters to the global supply by 2020, faces significant challenges in that more than half of these rigs may not be delivered. Nine of these floaters are scheduled for delivery in 2016 but may be delayed due to financial, shipyard and other issues. If additional newbuilds were to be delayed or canceled, this would be another incremental positive for global floater supply.
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups, there are approximately 45 newbuilds, with expected deliveries by year-end 2015, all of which are uncontracted. More than 65% of these uncontracted deliveries are with speculators that have never operated a rig, and it remains to be seen whether these approximately 30 units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation and delays of many newbuild jackups. This will likely continue as companies who ordered these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments, given limited contracting opportunities. This, in turn, would put more pressure on shipyards that will have to assess continued investment in the construction of partially completed rigs.
Turning now to scrapping and cold stacking of floaters and jackups. It's reasonable to assume that offshore drillers will continue to rationalize their fleets. Scrapping older rigs with limited contracting opportunities that may require CapEx to keep them certified to work and cold stacking other rigs that do not have recontracting opportunities allows drillers to reduce expenses and preserve capital during the downturn. 
Since September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 39 floaters. Over the same period, an additional 22 floaters have been cold stacked. We believe that the majority of these rigs will also be scrapped. In total, these 61 rigs represent approximately 19% of competitive global supply. 
Additionally, 17 floaters older than 30 years of age are currently idle without follow-on work, and another approximately 20 floaters greater than 30 years old will see their contracts expire before this year-end. All will be likely candidates for scrapping and/or cold stacking, and as a group, they are more than 3x the number of floaters currently scheduled to enter the market by year-end. And as I mentioned earlier, some of these may also be deferred. We anticipate the scrapping and stacking trend will continue, which will help to improve the supply and demand balance. 
Similarly, on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jackups defined as independent leg cantilever rigs: Roughly 55 are stacked or idle without follow-on work and older than 30 years of age, another approximately 45 working rigs that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring before year-end. Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years, can involve significant capital investment. In a tight cash flow environment and faced with uncertain recontracting prospects for less capable jackups, drillers may choose to cold stack or even scrap these older units rather than spend tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. Additional information on the global supply of rigs is provided in our investor presentation on our website.
In closing, our operational and safety performance differentiate Ensco in the market, as evidenced by several new contract awards since our last call. While the market remains challenging in the near-term, we expect to win business by continuing to leverage our operational and safety track record, our differentiated technology and our highly capable offshore and onshore personnel. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

Today, I will cover our second quarter financial results, our third quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments.As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing",1383,"Thanks, David. Today, I will cover our second quarter financial results, our third quarter 2015 outlook, and then I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments.
As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for the previously announced debt retirement and loss on impairment a ago, were $1.18 compared to $1.49 last year. Total second quarter revenue was $1.06 billion versus $1.14 billion a year ago as lower utilization across the fleet, including several floaters that have been contracted at above-average day rates a year ago, were partially offset by the reactivation of 3 upgraded floaters: ENSCO 5004, 5005 and 5006, and the addition of 3 newbuild jackups to the active fleet. 
Floater segment revenue was $634 million compared to $680 million a year ago, primarily due to lower utilization for several floaters in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that contributed to a decline in the average day rate to $417,000 from $481,000 a year ago. Reported floater utilization was 76%, unchanged from a year ago. Operational utilization for the floater segment, which adjusts for uncontracted days and planned downtime, was 92%, also unchanged from a year ago. 
Jackup segment revenue was $384 million compared to a $441 million a year ago, as utilization declined to 77% from 88% last year. This decline was partially offset by a slight increase in the average day rate to $140,000. The addition of high specification jackups to the active fleet contributed to this increase in average day rates. Operational utilization for the total jackup fleet was 98%, reflecting the continued focus of our offshore crews on delivering high levels of uptime to our customers regardless of market conditions. We reduced total contract drilling expense to $503 million from $543 million a year ago. Proactive expense management, including lower compensation and repair and maintenance costs, more than offset the following items: the reactivation of 3 floaters, the addition of 3 newbuild jackups to the fleet, and approximately $10 million in upfront stacking costs, depreciation expense increased $8 million to $141 million, in line with our expectations, due to the reactivation of the 3 floaters and the addition of the 3 newbuild jackups that I just mentioned. 
Disciplined expense management, including lower personnel costs, reduced general and administrative expense to $30 million, which was $6 million less than a year ago. As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $55 million from $31 million a year ago for 2 key reasons: Cost to retire our 2016 senior notes and other smaller debt maturities increased other net by $7 million, and interest expense was $15 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt offering during the third quarter of 2014. 
Our effective tax rate was 18% compared to an adjusted tax rate of 10% a year ago, due to the mix of earnings from various tax jurisdiction and tax legislation enacted by the U.K. government. Our third quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 12%.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter. Total revenues are expected to decline from second quarter results of $1.06 billion due to lower reported utilization and average day rates across the feet. For our entire fleet and continuing operations, we expect reported utilization to be in the mid-60% range compared to 76% in the second quarter. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 3% from second quarter levels of $237,000. 
As Carl mentioned, the contract terms for the DS-9 termination fee are expected to bring cash flows forward into the third quarter. As previously reported, the quarter will also benefit from a lump sum payment for the DS-4 early termination. 
We anticipate third quarter contract drilling expense will decline by approximately 8% from $503 million in the second quarter as we continue to actively manage our cost base. 
We expect third quarter G&A expense to be in line with the second quarter. Depreciation expense is expected to increase approximately $3 million from second quarter levels to $144 million, as ENSCO 110 operates for a full quarter.
In total, other expense is estimated to be approximately $54 million in the third quarter as interest expense is partially offset by interest income. 
Now I will provide an update on the cost reduction plans announced earlier this year. With the cold stacking process for ENSCO 8501 and 8502 now complete, cash costs for these rigs will be less than $10,000 per day, so cash savings will be approximately $120,000 per day until we reactivate the rigs. 
We have cold stacked 4 jackups, 3 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and one in the Middle East. We're in the process of cold stacking another jackup in Asia. Cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day, with cash savings of approximately $40,000 per day. 
We remain on track to achieve a 9% reduction in average offshore unit labor costs from 2014 levels, which translates into meaningful cost savings, since roughly half of contract drilling expense is offshore compensation.
Second quarter results include a full quarter's impact of the 15% reduction in offshore personnel that was implemented earlier this year and is expected to generate annualized savings of $27 million. We continue to negotiate cost reductions with vendors and suppliers, and we expect to reduce expense and capital expenditures going forward. 
So now let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have $7.4 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place. At June 30, we had a net debt to capital ratio of 32% and $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. 
By virtue of our recent debt refinancing, we currently have no remaining debt maturities until 2019, plus we have a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us significant liquidity and capital management flexibility. 
The delivery delay of DS-10 has changed our contractual commitments. Based on our agreement with the shipyard, the total commitments for our newbuild drillships has increased by approximately $14 million. This delay has also pushed the expected final milestone payment for DS-10 out until 2017 and has reduced our outlook for 2015 capital expenditures by approximately $300 million. Through June 30, capital investments in the fleet totaled roughly $900 million.
For the remainder of the year, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately $800 million. This breaks down as follows: $600 million in newbuild CapEx, including ENSCO DS-8 that was delivered earlier this month; $100 million for rig enhancement projects; and $100 million for sustaining projects. 
Beyond 2015, newbuild CapEx is estimated to be approximately $800 million, with $450 million expected to occur in 2016 and the remaining $350 million in 2017 as the final milestone payment is made for ENSCO DS-10. As Carl just mentioned, we now project total CapEx for 2016 and 2017 to be less than $750 million per year.
So in closing, the current market calls for aggressive management of costs. We began our cost reduction efforts more than a year ago by identifying several rigs that were not part of our go-forward fleet and would be sold, and we then quickly reduced costs for these rigs. Earlier this year, we reduced offshore compensation cost and onshore headcount, generating additional savings. Since then, we have continued to proactively stack rigs rolling off contracts that do not have near-term contracting opportunities to further reduce expenses. 
As Carl outlined earlier, we are taking steps to streamline our organization structure, which will benefit expenses in the future. We remain diligent on expense management, evaluating opportunities within the company, both offshore and onshore, and working with vendors and suppliers to drive additional costs out of the system.
Cyclical downturns, like the one that the offshore industry is currently facing, requires solid financial positioning. Over the past year, our actions in the capital markets have further strengthened our liquidity and capital position, giving us greater flexibility to navigate the downturn. 
We have maintained strong investment-grade credit ratings and remain among the highest rated companies in our sector. This will allow us to continue to focus on further improving operational, safety and financial performance, better positioning Ensco in the near-term and for the inevitable up cycle. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

Before we open up for questions, please note that we filed our 10-Q this morning, which includes an update regarding developments in Brazil. 
Since our last earnings call, there has been media coverage regarding an internal audit report released by our customer Petrobras. It discusses events dating back to 2007 and 2008 in Brazil before we acquired Pride International. The report makes inferences that former Pride employees may have been involved in improper activities, something that we take very seriously. The customer provided a copy of their internal audit report to Brazil government authorities that have since requested a copy of the DS-5 drilling services contract from Petrobras. While the audit report became public more than 2 months ago, to-date, we have not been contacted by Brazil authorities, and none of our current or former employees have been accused of any wrongdoing by any legal authorities.
As our 10-Q states, we have conducted compliance reviews, audits and independent investigations over an extended period of time, including more recent investigations in light of developments in Brazil. After investigation and benchmarking, we respectfully disagree with our customer's internal audit report with respect to comments regarding overpayments under the DS-5 drilling services contract. Publicly available data shows that the terms of the contract were comparable to others signed at the time. We have shared this information with our customer. And should Brazil authorities contact us regarding these matters, we would, of course, fully cooperate. 
Today, our internal and independent investigations have found no evidence of improper activities by current or former employees regarding these matters. Our investigations continue, and we will look at all aspects relating to the award of the DS-5 contract, including the activities of third-party consultants. As I mentioned, this is described more -- in more detail within our 10-Q disclosure.

Those rigs have been very specifically built to a technology and a specification that we know is required by customers in the Middle East and Africa region. And we think that we will find good placement with them by the time they come out. We also have the opportunity if that was to happen to actually use them to highgrade the fleet that we have and replace some of the older rigs that are there. So they continue on track at this point. The other jackup rig, ENSCO 123, that has been built in Singapore, this is the final one of a series that has been tremendously successful in the North Sea. We are going to evaluate whether we have immediate work for that rig to go in the next 2 quarters, and we'll make a decision.

You probably want one or 2 of those in the Asia [ph] region. So just as we think about that, and I know you can't talk to other companies, but as you think about as that impacts Ensco, does it make sense to have that available ready-to-go, hot stacked floater spread out geographically for those one-off jobs that potentially can show up?"

If there is any good news in -- at the moment, and with the recent further downturn of commodity price, I think it's going to lead to the realization that we are in an extended period of downturn and",433,"Yes. So let me take it first at the big macro picture. If there is any good news in -- at the moment, and with the recent further downturn of commodity price, I think it's going to lead to the realization that we are in an extended period of downturn and will force more stacking at a more accelerated rate. I think if things had started to pick up a little bit as we went to the second half of the year, while people felt there was a few green shoots, it may have caused people to delay or not take some harsh decisions. I think now what we're going to see is that it's going to lead to a more aggressive stacking and probably scrapping plan as we go forward. We're already seeing about 19% of the floater fleet already scrapped or permanently stacked. With the aged floaters coming off, a lot of these are going to really struggle to find any continuing work, given that they're competing against much younger rigs. And so I think we're going to move towards 25%, 30% of the current marketed fleet being stacked and removed from the market and probably struggle to come back. And I think this is one of the positive stories that probably hasn't been picked up as much on by the market commentators is the rate with which we could see additional stacking over the next 2 to 3 quarters. And for ourselves, we took the decision to stack out a lot of our aged semis last year and put them in held for sale. And we have taken the decision that DS-2 and DS-1 are not part of our go-forward fleet at the moment. Now with respect to having rigs available for picking up short-term work or things that may become available in the near-term, from our point of view, we do intend to do that. We intend to have a balance, which is why, for example, we have stacked some of the 85 Series with the intention of bringing them back, but we don't intend to market that entire fleet. But we will keep some of those rigs available for work coming up. And we are in negotiations and chasing some leads at the moment for opportunities for those rigs. So keeping a geographic spread of floaters available to pick up the work is certainly something we will do. But we will balance it by taking some of the other markets -- some of the other rigs and stacking them if we don't think there is enough market opportunities."

So let me take the jackup question, and then maybe I'll expand it a little bit into a broader discussion of the market outlook. So the first thing to remember is that a lot of the jackup shallow water basins and environments are still economic at the current oil prices. And accordingly, we are seeing still ongoing activity, and we are seeing some new tendering opportunities. Now, clearly, it's not the same level that it was a year or 2 years ago, but we are seeing ongoing activity. Now the Asia Pacific region and the Gulf of Mexico are extremely challenged. I mean, they are very difficult markets still because of a falloff in activity. The Middle East and Africa, largely driven by NOCs but also some IOCs and independents, is actually still quite robust. And in a few countries or few smaller areas, it's actually growing. And the North Sea outside of Norway is holding up, actually, quite well, given the circumstances, especially because some customers are using the opportunity of market pricing and conditions to do intervention work to bring on more production or to do P&A work, plug and abandonment. So that's a quick walk around. We do see an uptick coming in some jackup tenders across the world over the next couple of quarters. But as I said in the prepared statements, these are not going to materially change the outlook. In general, if I go to a broader discussion on the outlook, we are -- all evidence that people we're looking for that we may see a pickup in activity as we go into '16 has clearly not transpired in the -- as we go into the second half of the year. We will exit the year as an industry with increased idle capacity. And I don't believe that we will see any increase in our customers' offshore budgets next year. And so accordingly, we're going to see utilization and day rates still under pressure through '16. Now that said, when we talk to customers, we do see a number of projects that have been pushed out that seem to be scheduled for '17 and -- or tendering in the latter half of '16. And we do see little -- a little evidence of customers coming, trying to take current pricing now for 2017 activity, which maybe indicates where they feel things might go. So I think it's going to be weak throughout the remainder of '15 and '16. And then, for a pickup in '17, we need to see some key things happen on the macroenvironment. But certainly, that's where a lot of the delayed work seems to be getting pushed out here."

During the third quarter, our sector has continued to experience challenges from the cyclical downturn. Additional announcements of incremental CapEx guts by customers will further rig demand in 2016 and coupled with newbuild deliveries the utilization in day rates. Our response has been decisive action in terms of further expense reductions, streamlining our business unit reporting structure, strong operational performance and several contracting wins with customers. As previously announced, during the third quarter, we took additional steps to reduce expenses in line with the our fleet restructuring. We consolidated our business unit reporting structure from 5 business units to 3, centralized onshore support functions and reduced headcount accordingly. As a result, onshore support cost-savings now total $57 million annually. We also made further adjustments to supplemental compensation that will now bring offshore unit labor cost-savings to 15% compared with 2014 levels, and finally, we have significantly reduced our daily operating cost to stack rates.
Third quarter contract drilling expense came in even better than our revised outlook and we expect further improvements in the fourth quarter that Jay will describe in a moment. These expense management actions coupled with our strong financial position, including no debt maturities until second quarter 2019, $1.1 billion of cash and short-term securities. Fully available $2.25 billion revolver and $6.6 billion of revenue backlog, put us in a solid competitive position. While Moody's recently downgraded several offshore drillers, Ensco's investment grade rating of BAA to most of the drillers.
Operational performance during the third quarter continued to be positive with a record 99.8% operational utilization for jackups and 95.4% for floaters. We continued strong safety performance. Our drillship performance was particularly strong while semis performance was challenged by loop currents that were experienced in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter. Given our strong operational and safety performance, something that is even more critical during market down cycles, we've been able to secure additional business with customers as highlighted in our most recent Fleet Status Report. David review for details of these new contracts, but briefly let me underscore that, ENSCO 8505 new work in the U.S. gulf and we were awarded multiple jackup contracts in various regions, including the U.S. Gulf, Asia and the North Sea, including ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72 that recently had their contracts finalized. 
In total these contracts represent $400 million of additional revenue backlog. While some of these contracts are for shorter terms, they share the team work between our marketing operations and engineering teams to keep rigs working as much as possible despite challenging market conditions.
We are pleased by the market response to our upgrade of the 8500 series that allows them to work in mode and DP modes. We currently plan to convert a third rig during 2016. Our long-established strategy of being a hybrid driller with both floaters and jackups has been a positive during the downturn and we believe jackup demand will ultimately lead to recovery due to lower breakeven commodity price levels for shallow water programs. 
Turning now to our newbuild rigs, ENSCO DS-8 is completing customer acceptance testing and is on schedule to commence its initial contract with Total in mid-November. As previously reported ENSCO DS-9 that was delivered early this year, is earning its daily rate of 2 years in accordance with the early termination provision of the contract. Jackup rigs ENSCO 140 and 141 remain on schedule for mid-2016 deliveries. We are actively marketing these rigs in the Middle East in particular where they're being built.
As mentioned on our last call, we continue to evaluate our options for ENSCO 123, which is currently scheduled for a mid-2016 delivery. ENSCO DS-10 has already been delayed and is now scheduled for an early 2017 delivery. Jay will expand on our CapEx outlook, but in short, our CapEx would be, in 2015 at $1.65 billion and then decline significantly in future years. We currently forecast 2016 CapEx to be $625 million. 
In summary, I think we've done a good job of building a solid bridge in terms of bolstering our financial position, differing CapEx payments, streamlining costs, consolidating business unit reporting and capitalizing on pockets of customer demand. To not only create a safe path to the future recovery, but also to increase our flexibility to capitalize on opportunities along the way. In the meantime, as we look across our market, other players are also doing their part customers are reengineering projects and driving cost efficiencies, including standardization to lower the breakeven commodity price level for their offshore programs. Major offshore builders in South Korea have agreed to work together to standardize materials, designs and procedures of offshore facilities to better control cost and limit project delays. Service companies are joining forces to leverage vertical integration and investments in new innovation to improve overall project management and to drive costs out of the system. Another drillers have joined in scrapping older rigs to help improve supply demand dynamics.
Deep Water remains critically important to super majors and national oil companies, as well as the service company to support them and we've seen large acquisitions by both operators and service companies in our space underscoring their commitment to the offshore market despite the current downturn.
Each group of market participants is taking positive steps in our own way to improve the economics of the deepwater sector and the combined impact of these actions will be meaningful to our industry. Before I hand it over to David, as noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, our 5 rigs contracted with Petrobras continue to operate day rate under their existing contracts. Similar to last quarter, you may find a recap regarding this matter on our 10-Q that we filed this morning.
Finally, our succession process for our new CFO is going well, and as Jay retires, I'm confident that we'll have a smooth transition during large part to the strong bench of financial talent within our organization. Now, I'll turn the call over to David."

As Carl mentioned customer demand remained at lower levels driven by the cyclical downturn in the offshore drilling markets. Nevertheless, our marketing and operations teams have capitalized on pockets of customer demand around the world that resulted in several new contracts for Ensco. For example, we recently contacted ENSCO 8505 for a multiyear contract in U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We were able to win this work because of versatility that the 8500 series offers to customers and the high levels of operational performance that these rates have delivered to our customers. Similar to a sister rig ENSCO 8503, ENSCO 8505 will use a hybrid mode DP configuration under its new contract. The more upgrade is currently underway and is scheduled to be completed before the rig commences its new contract in December. This more DP configuration is a major advantage for customers who need to drill well programs shallow and Deep Water offering the flexibility, as well as our 8500 series drilling efficiencies and capabilities such as a $2 million and a debt configuration well-suited for plug-in and abandon and intervention work. We continue to have conversations with additional customers who well programs that sync up with the unique advantages of our 8500 series rigs with upgraded more in packages. During the third quarter ENSCO 8500 and 8506 also won short-term contract extensions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Moving to jackups, we finalized three-year contracts for both ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72 in Denmark that are expected to keep the rigs working into 2018. The North Sea is a particularly strong market for Ensco where we have 9 rigs under contract and we are having active discussions with customers for our 2 available rigs in the region. Additionally, we contracted ENSCO 107 for 100 days in New Zealand and ENSCO 68 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for 6 wells both rigs are expected to begin their contracts during the fourth quarter. Our excellent uptime performance and in many cases prior experience with customers were integral into securing these new contracts. Ensco's operational and safety track record and technology continued to differentiate our rigs from the competition. In Total, the new contracts that have just outlined are expected to add more than 9 rig years mandrake years of work and up the bridge us better market conditions in the future. 
We will continue to leverage our experience as an international driller with the established operational and safety management systems, differentiated technology, well-trained rig crews, and a strong reputation among customers to continue winning new work and retaining our existing customers. 
Now, looking at global rig supply. In terms of newbuild rigs, 46 floaters were scheduled to be delivered by year end 2017. Half of these rigs are contracted including 15 rigs that are being built in Brazil. Several of which have already experienced delays in their expected delivery dates due to the financial shipyard and other issues. In anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future, many of the remaining uncontracted deliveries have already been delayed. Additionally, some drillers have recently shown a willingness to refuse floater deliveries were contractually committed. We have also seen some planned orders canceled. These newbuild delays and cancellations are positive developments for reducing global floater supply in additional delays or cancellations would be another positive for the rebalancing floater supply and demand more quickly. 
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups. There are approximately 105 uncontracted newbuilds showing delivery dates by year-end 2017. Most of these uncontracted deliveries are with speculators that have never operated a rig. And it remains to be seen whether these units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation of 6 jackup orders and we may see additional units canceled given current market conditions. Other newbuild rigs have been subject to repeated delivery delays, especially jackups being built by speculators. In fact, based on original scheduled delivery dates, 20 of these speculative rigs should have already been delivered, but have been delayed by nearly a year on average and up to 18 months in some cases. We expect these delays to continue, especially for the 24 speculative new builds scheduled for delivery before year-end 2015, as companies, who order these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments, given limited contracting and rig sale opportunities. With regard to speculators, representing 50% of newbuilds under construction and many of whom have committed only small down payments for the rigs, the shipyards will have to determine whether further investment in partially computer rigs is prudent. 
Turning now to scrapping and cold stacking of floaters and jackups. While the pace of scrapping and stacking slowed in the third quarter, we expect a pickup in the coming months, as offshore drillers continue to rationalize their fleets, and evaluate the go forward competitiveness for older rigs that will require significant CapEx to stay certified to work. 
In a market with limited contracting opportunities, it may not make economic sense for drillers to invest in these older, less capable assets. And some drillers have already telegraphed that more scrapping his ahead, due in part to their focus on reducing expenses and preserving capital during downturn. 
Since last September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 42 floaters, over the same period, an additional 27 floaters have been cold stacked, and we believe that the majority of these stacked rigs will also be scrapped. In Total, these 69 rigs represent more than 20% of competitive global supply a year ago.
Additionally, 24 floaters older than 30 years of age are currently idle without follow on work, and an incremental 59 floaters, greater than 30 years old, will see their contracts expire by year end 2017. All will be likely candidates for scrapping and/or cold stacking. And as a group, they are nearly double the number of floaters currently scheduled to enter the market before the end of 2017. 
Similarly on the jackups side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jackups defined as independent lake rigs. Roughly 7 years stacked or idle without follow-on work and older than 30 years of age. Another 90, that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring by the end of 2017. Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years involve significant capital investment. In a tight cash flow environment with uncertain recontracting prospects, drillers may choose to cold stack or in many cases, retire these older units rather than tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. Additional information on the global supply of rigs is provided in the Investor Presentation on our website.
In closing, as evidenced by several new contract awards since our last call, we are well-positioned to capitalize pockets of customer demand around the world, as we navigate through the downturn. While the market remains challenging in near term, there are several factors that will help to support the demand in the medium to long-term. First, it has been encouraging to see a year to date pick up in offshore exploration success as compared to last year, including a significant recent discovery in the Mediterranean. Second, lease sales and plays and established basins have continued to draw interest for several major customers, as they look to the short-term noise in the commodity markets and longer term potential of offshore reserves. Third, while participation in recently lead sales have been weaker than expected in Brazil and Mexico, we continue to see both markets becoming more diversified from a customer standpoint, and we expect that this will lead to opportunities on the floaters side in particular, in the future. Appraisal and development of newly discovered reserves and eventual exploration of recently acquired leases will require drilling rigs and ENSCO's fleet, geographical presence and customer relationships put us in a great position to participate in the eventual market upturn. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

Today, I'll start with our third quarter financial results, our outlook for the quarter, and then, I'll wrap up with the discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing",1398,"Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our third quarter financial results, our outlook for the quarter, and then, I'll wrap up with the discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations were $1.34 compared to $1.79 last year. Total third quarter revenue was $1.01 billion versus $1.20 billion a year ago. Lower utilization was partially offset by the addition of 2 new build jackups to the active fleet. The reactivation of 2 upgraded floaters, ENSCO 5004 and and 5006, and early termination fee ENSCO DS-4 plus Ensco DS-9 earning day rate sooner than scheduled due to the customer's early termination for convenience. Floaters segment revenue is $646 million compared to $704 million, a year ago, primarily, due to lower utilization of 59% compared to 82% a year ago, and a decline in the average pay rate to  $422,000 from $451,000 last year. 
Operational utilization for the floaters segment, which adjust for unconquered base and planned downtime was 95.4% up from 94.2%, a year ago. Our drillships had an exceptional quarter with 100% operational utilization. Jackup segment revenue was $326 million compared to $481 million, a year ago, as utilization decline to 64% from 92% last year. The average day rate declined 5% to $134,000.
These factors were partially upset by the addition of 2 high specification jackups, ENSCO 122 and ENSCO 110 to the active fleet. Operational utilization for the total jackup rig was 99.8% an all-time high for jackups, reflecting the continued focus of our offshore crudes on delivering high levels of uptime performance to our customers. We reduced total contract drilling expense to $434 million, well below our initial estimate and even lower than ever revised outlook of $450 million to $455 million that we provided in early September.
Year-to-year, we reduced contract drilling expense by 13% from $500 million in third quarter 2014. Proactive expense management, more than offset the incremental cost of adding DS-9 and 2 newbuild jackups to the active fleet, the reactivation of ENSCO 5004 and 5006, $6 million in upfront stacking cost plus $4 million of severance and related costs associated with the streamlining of our business and reporting structure and onshore support functions.
Depreciation expense increased $10 million to $145 million in line with our expectations due to the operating fleet growth that I just mentioned. Disciplined expense management including centralizing certain support functions reduced general and administrative expense to $28 million. As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $52 million from $38 million a year ago, as interest expense was $17 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt offering during third quarter 2014 and our debt refinancing completed in the first quarter of 2015.
Our effective tax rate was 9.5% compared to an adjusted tax rate of 15% a year ago, excluding discrete items such as, the early contract termination for ENSCO DS-4, the effective tax rate was 12.6% compared to 13.9% a year ago. Our fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 15%.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Due principally to the $111 million DS-4 termination revenue that was recognized in the third quarter, total revenues are expected to decline on a sequential quarterly basis. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 5% from the third quarter levels of $232,000. We expect reported utilization for the fleet to be in the low 60% range in line with third quarter utilization. These projections include ENSCO DS-8 to the scheduled to commence its initial contract next month. 
As Karl mentioned anticipated a further reduction in contract drilling expense during the fourth quarter, as we continue actively manage our cost base. Fourth quarter contract drilling expense is expected to decline $15 million to $20 million from $434 million in the third quarter. This includes approximately $5 million of office consolidation restructuring cost for the organizational streamlining, we announced in September. We expect lower contract drilling expense despite office consolidation charges and projected increase in rig operating days for ENSCO DS-8 joining the active fleet and more contracted days for our 8500 series rigs. Please note that this updated outlook for the fourth quarter is an improvement from the initial outlook we provided in early September of $435 million, $440 million. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $149 million and ENSCO DS-8 joined the active fleet. We expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to be in line with third quarter. In total, other expense is estimated to be $59 million in the fourth quarter, mostly due to lower capitalized interest as DS-8 commences its initial contract.
Now I'll provide an update on our cost reduction plan. The decisive actions that we've taken will reduce average offshore unit labor cost by 15% compared to 2014 levels, which translates into the meaningful cost-savings since offshore compensation is roughly half of total contract drilling expense. The full run rate impacted this reduction will begin in the first quarter of 2016. We've streamlined our global operations reporting structure from 5 to 3 business units and raised our estimated annual run rate savings to $57 million beginning in the fourth quarter by rightsizing onshore support functions. In addition, we have continued to expedite the core stacking of rigs without near-term contracting opportunities. On the floater side ENSCO 8501, ENSCO 8502 and ENSCO DS-1 are now fully cold stacked and cash costs for these rigs are now less than $10,000 per day. We have cold stacked 5 jackups and we're in the process of cold stacking another jackup in the U.S. Gulf. Cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day. We will continue to proactively manage costs in line with market conditions throughout the cycle.
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have $6.6 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place. At September 30, we had a net debt-to-capital ratio of 32% and $1.1 million in cash and short-term investments. Since the end of the third quarter, we received a $146 million termination payment for DS-4 that will further bolster our cash position. We have a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us significant liquidity and capital management flexibility. As a reminder, we have no debt maturities until 2019. Recently, as part of an overall sector review that resulted in downgrades from many offshore drillers, Moody's downgraded our credit rating by 1 notch to BAA2. We are rated the equivalent of 1 notch higher or BBB+ by S&P. We remain firmly investment grade with both rating agencies and this action will have no direct impact to borrowing costs for our fixed cost debt obligation. Ensco's commercial paper rating was reaffirmed by Moody's at P2.
The rating actually will also have no impact to our revolver, however, a further 1 notch downgrade would cause a very slight increase in our quarterly commitment fee and the applicable margin rate on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Year-to-date, through September 30, capital investments in the freight totaled $1.45 billion. For the fourth quarter we anticipate CapEx to be approximately $200 million. Based on a detailed review, we have reduced our total CapEx budget for 2016 to $625 million, of which $475 million is for newbuild construction. In terms of rig enhancement CapEx, given our fleet upgrades over the past few years, including major upgrades to several floaters, our only expected rig enhancement project in 2016 is adding a more to another 8500 series rigs. CapEx for liner upgrades and improvements in 2016 will decline relative to 2015 levels due to a smaller active fleet. 
In closing, we've aggressively manage the expenses and CapEx in response to the downturn in the offshore drilling markets and we will continue to do so. Our strong liquidity and capital position give us greater flexibility to navigate the downturn. Our actions over the past year from accessing the capital markets to streamlining our organizational and fleet structure have all been done with an eye towards improving our competitiveness. These actions allow us to focus on areas within our control during the downturn. Improving operational and safety results while optimizing financial performance, which will better position Ensco for both the for near-term and long-term. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

Th",320,"And first let me start by saying, we're just beginning to see the start of the cycle with distressed assets coming available, but it's important also to recognize that actually a lot of those assets you might be thinking of as yet are not unencumbered. There are some complexities around contract positions and arbitration around a lot of them, so a number of assets at the moment that are distressed assets are available still quite limited, but of course, building. I think there is clearly, an opportunity there to look at distressed assets that you would be able to pick up at a discounted rate. The question that, I think everyone needs to ask is, and certainly, asking themselves is does that investment balance makes sense, current market conditions certainly, something like semi or a new drillships could be idle for several years. Because if you start to add in the cost of financing the cost of stacking over a number of years that it might be added, even at a discounted prize the economics don't always work out. So I think that what's going to happen is there's going to be probably a lot of higher ticking and a little bit of exploration on the first assets and something when I sit on the sidelines join the first asset sales. So I don't think when we see the results of some of this first sale we should read too much into, I don't think it establishes necessarily a market or what everyone is going to do. We are certainly going to look at it, but we are not rushing to do anything, we have the liquidity to act if we see the right opportunities, but what we don't want to do is to do something precipitative that doesn't make a sensible investment criteria actually below a lot of the question liquidity question that we have early in the cycle."

If I expanded out a little bit wider, so now I'm not talking about Angola specifically, but the general market conditions, given where we are in the market, there is still a further risk of concessions by various customers and as we have done, where we have good contracts and strong contracts in place, which is the majority of our high-value, high-backlog contracts. We are prepared to work with customers if we can something in return.

So the decision is to whether to put into warm-stack like I described at $40,000 a day for a drillship. For example, it's very different between a new asset and an older asset. So I think we will see and continue to see the retirement of the older assets and I think it's going to be certainly given the market the near-term market outlook now it's going to be more aggressive than some people may be taking into appreciation."

During the third quarter, our sector has continued to experience challenges from the cyclical downturn. Additional announcements of incremental CapEx cuts by customers will further reduce rig demand in 2016 and, c",1018,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, our sector has continued to experience challenges from the cyclical downturn. Additional announcements of incremental CapEx cuts by customers will further reduce rig demand in 2016 and, coupled with newbuild deliveries, add pressure to utilization in day rates. Our response has been decisive action in terms of further expense reductions, streamlining our business unit reporting structure, strong operational performance and several contracting wins with customers. As previously announced, during the third quarter, we took additional steps to reduce expenses in line with our fleet restructuring. We consolidated our business unit reporting structure from 5 business units to 3, centralized onshore support functions and reduced headcount accordingly. As a result, onshore support cost-savings now total $57 million annually. We also made further adjustments to supplemental compensation that will now bring offshore unit labor cost-savings to 15% compared with 2014 levels, and finally, we have significantly reduced daily operating cost for stacked rigs.
Third quarter contract drilling expense came in even better than our revised outlook and we expect further improvements in the fourth quarter that Jay will describe in a moment. These expense management actions, coupled with our strong financial position, including no debt maturities until second quarter 2019, $1.1 billion of cash and short-term securities, fully available $2.25 billion revolver and $6.6 billion of revenue backlog, puts us in a solid competitive position. While Moody's recently downgraded several offshore drillers, Ensco's investment-grade rating of BAA2 stands above most of the drillers.
Operational performance during the third quarter continued to be positive with a record 99.8% operational utilization for jackups and 95.4% for floaters. We continued strong safety performance. Our drillship performance was particularly strong, whilst our semisub performance was challenged by loop currents that were experienced in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter. Given our strong operational and safety performance, something that is even more critical during market down cycles, we've been able to secure additional business with customers, as highlighted in our most recent Fleet Status Report. David will review full details of these new contracts, but briefly, let me underscore that ENSCO 8505, a new work in the U.S. Gulf, and we were awarded multiple jackup contracts in various regions, including the U.S. Gulf, Asia and the North Sea, including ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72 that recently had their contracts finalized. In total, these contracts represent $400 million of additional revenue backlog. While some of these contracts are for shorter terms, they show the teamwork between our marketing, operations and engineering teams to keep rigs working as much as possible, despite challenging market conditions.
We are pleased by the market response to our upgrade of the 8500 series that allows them to work in moored and DP modes. And we currently plan to convert a third rig during 2016. Our long-established strategy of being a hybrid driller with both floaters and jackups has been a positive during the downturn and we believe jackup demand will ultimately lead the recovery due to lower breakeven commodity price levels for shallow water programs. 
Turning now to our newbuild rigs, ENSCO DS-8 is completing customer acceptance testing and is on schedule to commence its initial contract with Total in mid-November. As previously reported, ENSCO DS-9 that was delivered early this year, is earning its daily rate for 2 years in accordance with the early termination provision of the contract. Jackup rigs, ENSCO 140 and 141, remain on schedule for mid-2016 deliveries and we are actively marketing these rigs in the Middle East in particular where they are being built.
As mentioned on our last call, we continue to evaluate our options for ENSCO 123, which is currently scheduled for a mid-2016 delivery. ENSCO DS-10 has already been delayed and is now scheduled for an early 2017 delivery. Jay will expand on our CapEx outlook, but in short, our CapEx would peak in 2015 at $1.65 billion and then decline significantly in future years. We currently forecast 2016 CapEx to be $625 million. 
In summary, I think, we've done a good job of building a solid bridge in terms of bolstering our financial position, deferring CapEx payments, streamlining costs, consolidating business unit reporting and capitalizing on pockets of customer demand to not only create a safe path to the future recovery but also to increase our flexibility to capitalize on opportunities along the way. In the meantime, as we look across our market, other players are also doing their part. Customers are reengineering projects and driving cost efficiencies, including standardization, to lower the breakeven commodity price level for their offshore programs. Major offshore builders in South Korea have agreed to work together to standardize materials, designs and procedures for offshore facilities to better control cost and limit project delays. Service companies are joining forces to leverage vertical integration and investments in new innovation to improve overall project management and to drive costs out of the system. I know the drillers have joined in scrapping older rigs to help improve supply demand dynamics.
Deepwater remains critically important to super majors and national oil companies, as well as the service companies that support them and we've seen large acquisitions by both operators and service companies in our space, underscoring their commitment to the offshore market despite the current downturn. Each group of market participants is taking positive steps in their own ways to improve the economics of the deepwater sector. And the combined impact of these actions will be meaningful to our industry. 
Before I hand it over to David, as noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, our 5 rigs contracted with Petrobras continue to operate an non-day rate under their existing contracts. Similar to last quarter, you may find a recap regarding this matter on our 10-Q that we filed this morning.
Finally, our succession process for our new CFO is going well, and as Jay retires, I'm confident that we'll have a smooth transition due in large part to the strong bench of financial talent within our organization. 
Now I'll turn the call over to David."

As Carl mentioned, customer demand remained at lower levels, driven by the cyclical downturn in the offshore drilling markets. Nevertheless, our marketing and operations teams have capitalized on pockets of customer demand around the world that resulted in several new contracts for Ensco. For example, we recently contracted ENSCO 8505 for a multiyear contract in U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We were able to win this work because of the versatility that the 8500 series offers to customers and the high levels of operational performance that these rigs have delivered to our customers. Similar to a sister rig, ENSCO 8503, ENSCO 8505 will use a hybrid moored DP configuration under its new contract. The mooring upgrade is currently underway and is scheduled to be completed before the rig commences its new contract in December. This moored DP configuration is a major advantage for customers who need to drill well programs that's ratable to shallow and deepwater, offering them added flexibility, as well as our 8500 series drilling efficiencies and capabilities such as a 2 million pound Derek and a deck configuration well-suited for plug-and-abandon and intervention work. We continue to have conversations with additional customers for well programs that sync up with the unique advantages of our 8500 series rigs with upgraded mooring packages. During the third quarter, ENSCO 8500 and 8506 also won short-term contract extensions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Moving to jackups, we finalized three-year contracts for both ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72 in Denmark that are expected to keep the rigs working into 2018. The North Sea is a particularly strong market for Ensco where we have 9 rigs under contract and we are having active discussions with customers for our 2 available rigs in the region. Additionally, we contracted ENSCO 107 for 100 days in New Zealand and ENSCO 68 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for 6 wells, both rigs are expected to begin their contracts during the fourth quarter. Our excellent uptime performance and, in many cases, prior experience with customers were integral in securing these new contracts. Ensco's operational and safety track record and technology continue to differentiate our rigs from the competition. In total, the new contracts I have just outlined are expected to add more than 9 rig years of work and help to bridge us to better market conditions in the future. 
We will continue to leverage our experience as an international driller with established operational and safety management systems, differentiated technology, well-trained rig crews and a strong reputation among customers to continue winning new work and retaining our existing customers. 
Now looking at global rig supply. In terms of newbuild rigs, 46 floaters were scheduled to be delivered by year-end 2017. Half of these rigs are contracted, including 15 rigs that are being built in Brazil, several of which have already experienced delays in their expected delivery dates due to financial, shipyard and other issues. In anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future, many of the remaining uncontracted deliveries have already been delayed. Additionally, some drillers have recently shown a willingness to refuse floater deliveries where contractually permitted. We have also seen some planned orders canceled. These newbuild delays and cancellations are positive developments for reducing global floater supply, and additional delays or cancellations would be another positive for rebalancing floater supply and demand more quickly. 
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups. There are approximately 105 uncontracted newbuilds showing delivery dates by year-end 2017. Most of these uncontracted deliveries are with speculators that have never operated a rig, and it remains to be seen whether these units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation of 6 jackup orders and we may see additional units canceled given current market conditions. Other newbuild rigs have been subject to repeated delivery delays, especially jackups being built by speculators. In fact, based on original scheduled delivery dates, 20 of these speculative rigs should have already been delivered but have been delayed by nearly a year on average and up to 18 months in some cases. We expect these delays to continue, especially for the 24 speculative newbuilds scheduled for delivery before year-end 2015, as companies who ordered these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments, given limited contracting and rig sale opportunities. With regard to speculators representing 60% of newbuilds under construction and many of whom have committed only small down payments for their rigs, the shipyards will have to determine whether further investment in partially completed rigs is prudent. 
Turning now to scrapping and cold stacking of floaters and jackups. While the pace of scrapping and stacking slowed in the third quarter, we expect a pickup in the coming months as offshore drillers continue to rationalize their fleets and evaluate the go forward competitiveness of older rigs that would require significant CapEx to stay certified to work. 
In a market with limited contracting opportunities, it may not make economic sense for drillers to invest in these older, less capable assets. And some drillers have already telegraphed that more scrapping is ahead, due in part to their focus on reducing expenses and preserving capital during downturn. 
Since last September, offshore drillers have announced that they will scrap 42 floaters. Over the same period, an additional 27 floaters have been cold stacked, and we believe that the majority of these stacked rigs will also be scrapped. In total, these 69 rigs represent more than 20% of competitive global supply a year ago.
Additionally, 24 floaters older than 30 years of age are currently idle without follow-on work, and an incremental 59 floaters greater than 30 years old will see their contracts expire by year-end 2017. All will be likely candidates for scrapping and/or cold stacking. And as a group, they are nearly double the number of floaters currently scheduled to enter the market before the end of 2017. 
Similarly, on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jackups defined as independent leg cantilever rigs. Roughly 70 are stacked or idle without follow-on work and older than 30 years of age. Another 90 that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring by the end of 2017. Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years, involve significant capital investment. In a tight cash flow environment and faced with uncertain recontracting prospects, drillers may choose to cold stack or, in many cases, retire these older units rather than spend tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. Additional information on the global supply of rigs is provided in the Investor Presentation on our website.
In closing, as evidenced by several new contract awards since our last call, we are well-positioned to capitalize on pockets of customer demand around the world as we navigate through the downturn. While the market remains challenging in the near term, there are several factors that will help to support rig demand in the medium to long-term. First, it has been encouraging to see a year-to-date pick up in offshore exploration success as compared to last year, including a significant recent discovery in the Mediterranean. Second, lease sales and frontier plays in established basins have continued to draw interest from several major customers as they look through the short-term noise in the commodity markets and the longer term potential of offshore reserves. Third, while participation in recent lease sales have been weaker than expected in Brazil and Mexico, we continue to see both markets becoming more diversified from a customer standpoint, and we expect that this will lead to opportunities, on the floaters side in particular, in the future. Appraisal and development of newly discovered reserves and eventual exploration of recently acquired leases will require drilling rigs. And ENSCO's rig fleet, geographical presence and customer relationships put us in a great position to participate in the eventual market upturn. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

Today, I'll start with our third quarter financial results, our outlook for the fourth quarter, and then, I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations were $1.34 compared to $1.79 last year. Total third quarter revenue was $1.01 billion versus $1.20 billion a year ago. Lower utilization was partially offset by the addition of 2 newbuild jackups to the active fleet. The reactivation of 2 upgraded floaters, ENSCO 5004 and 5006, and early termination fee for ENSCO DS-4, plus Ensco DS-9 earning day rate sooner than scheduled due to the customer's early termination for convenience. Floaters segment revenue was $646 million compared to $704 million a year ago, primarily due to lower utilization of 59% compared to 82% a year ago, and a decline in the average day rate to $422,000 from $451,000 last year. 
Operational utilization for the floaters segment, which adjust for uncontracted days and planned downtime was 95.4%, up from 94.2% a year ago. Our drillships had an exceptional quarter with 100% operational utilization. Jackup segment revenue was $326 million compared to $481 million a year ago, as utilization declined to 64% from 92% last year. The average day rate declined 5% to $134,000.
These factors were partially offset by the addition of 2 high specification jackups, ENSCO 122 and ENSCO 110, to the active fleet. Operational utilization for the total jackup fleet was 99.8%, an all-time high for our jackups, reflecting the continued focus of our offshore crudes on delivering high levels of uptime performance to our customers. We reduced total contract drilling expense to $434 million, well below our initial estimate and even lower than our revised outlook of $450 million to $455 million that we provided in early September.
Year-to-year, we reduced contract drilling expense by 13% from $500 million in third quarter 2014. Proactive expense management more than offset the incremental cost of adding DS-9 and 2 newbuild jackups to the active fleet, the reactivation of ENSCO 5004 and 5006, $6 million in upfront stacking cost, plus $4 million of severance and related costs associated with the streamlining of our business unit reporting structure and onshore support functions.
Depreciation expense increased $10 million to $145 million, in line with our expectations, due to the operating fleet growth that I just mentioned. Disciplined expense management, including centralizing certain support functions, reduced general and administrative expense to $28 million. As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $52 million from $38 million a year ago, as interest expense was $17 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt offering during third quarter 2014 and our debt refinancing completed in the first quarter of 2015.
Our effective tax rate was 9.5% compared to an adjusted tax rate of 15% a year ago. Excluding discrete items such as the early contract termination for ENSCO DS-4, the effective tax rate was 12.6% compared to 13.9% a year ago. Our fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 15%.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Due principally to the $111 million DS-4 termination revenue that was recognized in the third quarter, total revenues are expected to decline on a sequential quarterly basis. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 5% from the third quarter levels of $232,000. We expect reported utilization for the fleet to be in the low 60% range, in line with third quarter utilization. These projections include ENSCO DS-8 that is scheduled to commence its initial contract next month. 
As Carl mentioned, we anticipate a further reduction in contract drilling expense during the fourth quarter as we continue to actively manage our cost base. Fourth quarter contract drilling expense is expected to decline $15 million to $20 million from the $434 million in the third quarter. This includes approximately $5 million of office consolidation and restructuring cost for the organizational streamlining we announced in September. We expect lower contract drilling expense despite the office consolidation charges and the projected increase in rig operating days for ENSCO DS-8 joining the active fleet and more contracted days for our 8500 series rigs. Please note that this updated outlook for the fourth quarter is an improvement from the initial outlook we provided in early September of $435 million to $440 million. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $149 million as ENSCO DS-8 joins the active fleet. We expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to be in line with third quarter. In total, other expense is estimated to be $59 million in the fourth quarter, mostly due to lower capitalized interest as DS-8 commences its initial contract.
Now I'll provide an update on our cost-reduction plans. The decisive actions that we've taken will reduce average offshore unit labor cost by 15% compared to 2014 levels, which translates into meaningful cost-savings since offshore compensation is roughly half of total contract drilling expense. The full run rate impact of this reduction will begin in the first quarter of 2016. We streamlined our global operations reporting structure from 5 to 3 business units and raised our estimated annual run rate savings to $57 million beginning in the fourth quarter by rightsizing onshore support functions. In addition, we have continued to expedite the cold stacking of rigs without near-term contracting opportunities. On the floater side, ENSCO 8501, ENSCO 8502 and ENSCO DS-1 are now fully cold stacked and cash costs for these rigs are now less than $10,000 per day. We have cold stacked 5 jackups and we're in the process of cold stacking another jackup in the U.S. Gulf. Cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day. We will continue to proactively manage costs in line with market conditions throughout the cycle.
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have $6.6 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place. At September 30, we had a net debt-to-capital ratio of 32% and $1.1 million in cash and short-term investments. Since the end of the third quarter, we received a $146 million termination payment for DS-4 that will further bolster our cash position. We have a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us significant liquidity and capital management flexibility. As a reminder, we have no debt maturities until 2019. Recently, as part of an overall sector review that resulted in downgrades from many offshore drillers, Moody's downgraded our credit rating by 1 notch to BAA2. We are rated the equivalent of 1 notch higher or BBB+ by S&P. We remain firmly investment-grade with both rating agencies and this action will have no direct impact to borrowing costs for our fixed cost debt obligations. Ensco's commercial paper rating was reaffirmed by Moody's at P2.
The rating action will also have no impact to our revolver, however, a further 1 notch downgrade would cause a very slight increase in our quarterly commitment fee and the applicable margin rate on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Year-to-date, through September 30, capital investments in the fleet totaled $1.45 billion. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately $200 million. Based on a detailed review, we have reduced our total CapEx budget for 2016 to $625 million, of which $475 million is for newbuild construction. In terms of rig enhancement CapEx, given our fleet upgrades over the past few years, including major upgrades to several floaters, our only expected rig enhancement project in 2016 is adding a mooring tackies to another 8500 series rig. CapEx for minor upgrades and improvements in 2016 will decline relative to 2015 levels due to a smaller active fleet. 
In closing, we have aggressively managed our expenses and CapEx in response to the downturn in the offshore drilling markets and we will continue to do so. Our strong liquidity and capital position give us greater flexibility to navigate in the downturn. Our actions over the past year from accessing the capital markets to streamlining our organizational and fleet structure have all been done with an eye towards improving our competitiveness. These actions allow us to focus on areas within our control during the downturn, improving operational and safety results while optimizing financial performance, which will better position Ensco for both the near-term and the long-term. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

There are some complexities around contract positions and arbitration around a lot of them, so a number of assets at the moment that are distressed assets that are available is still quite limited but, of course, building. I think, there is clearly an opportunity there to look at distressed assets that you would be able to pick up at a discounted rate. The question that, I think, everyone needs to ask is, and certainly asking themselves is does that investment balance makes sense in the current market conditions where, certainly, something like a semi or a new drillship could be idle for several years because if you start to add in the cost of financing, the cost of stacking over the number of years that it might be idle, even at a discounted price, the economics don't always work out. So I think that what's going to happen is there's going to be probably a lot of higher thinking and a little bit of exploration on the first assets. And some people may sit on the sidelines joining those first -- the first asset sales. So I don't think when we see the results of some of these first sale we should read too much into it, I don't think it establishes necessarily a market precedent on what everyone is going to do. We are certainly going to look at it, but we are not rushing to do anything, we have the liquidity to act if we see the right opportunities, but what we don't want to do is do something precipitive [ph] that doesn't make a sensible investment criteria and actually blow a lot of the cushion, the liquidity cushion, that we have early in the cycle."

And as we said in the pre-prepared comments, we think that although that's been relatively modest as far as announcements go in Q3, we do think there will be a step up as we go through the next couple of quarters. So the decision is to whether to put into warm stack, like I described, for $40,000 a day for a drillship, for example. It's very different between a new asset and an older asset.

What they do have is very mixed programs that involve P&A and intervention then maybe drilling an out-stack well or high-back well, and these rigs are really well-suited to that.

But the nature of the work on this long-term contract where it's going to move between intervention, drilling, plug and abandonment, it's going to do some work with the riser, some without the riser and some on mooring. When it's working in some of these configurations, we can reduce the cost base even further.

During the third quarter, our sector has continued to experience challenges from the cyclical downturn. Additional announcements of incremental CapEx cuts by customers will further reduce rig demand in 2016 and, c",1018,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, our sector has continued to experience challenges from the cyclical downturn. Additional announcements of incremental CapEx cuts by customers will further reduce rig demand in 2016 and, coupled with newbuild deliveries, add pressure to utilization and day rates. Our response has been decisive action in terms of further expense reductions, streamlining our business unit reporting structure, strong operational performance and several contracting wins with customers. As previously announced, during the third quarter, we took additional steps to reduce expenses in line with our fleet restructuring. We consolidated our business unit reporting structure from 5 business units to 3, centralized onshore support functions and reduced headcount accordingly. As a result, onshore support cost-savings now total $57 million annually. We also made further adjustments to supplemental compensation that will now bring offshore unit labor cost-savings to 15% compared with 2014 levels, and finally, we have significantly reduced daily operating cost for stacked rigs.
Third quarter contract drilling expense came in even better than our revised outlook and we expect further improvements in the fourth quarter that Jay will describe in a moment. These expense management actions, coupled with our strong financial position, including: no debt maturities until second quarter 2019, $1.1 billion of cash and short-term securities, a fully available $2.25 billion revolver and $6.6 billion of revenue backlog, puts us in a solid competitive position. While Moody's recently downgraded several offshore drillers, Ensco's investment-grade rating of BAA2 stands above most of the drillers.
Operational performance during the third quarter continued to be positive with a record 99.8% operational utilization for jackups and 95.4% for floaters, with continued strong safety performance. Our drillship performance was particularly strong, whilst our semisub performance was challenged by loop currents that were experienced in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter. Given our strong operational and safety performance, something that is even more critical during market down cycles, we've been able to secure additional business with customers, as highlighted in our most recent Fleet Status Report. David will review full details of these new contracts, but briefly, let me underscore that ENSCO 8505, a new work in the U.S. Gulf, and we were awarded multiple jackup contracts in various regions, including the U.S. Gulf, Asia and the North Sea, including ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72 that recently had their contracts finalized. In total, these contracts represent $400 million of additional revenue backlog. While some of these contracts are for shorter terms, they show the teamwork between our marketing, operations and engineering teams to keep rigs working as much as possible, despite challenging market conditions.
We are pleased by the market response to our upgrade of the 8500 series that allows them to work in moored and DP modes. And we currently plan to convert a third rig during 2016. Our long-established strategy of being a hybrid driller with both floaters and jackups has been a positive during the downturn, and we believe jackup demand will ultimately lead the recovery due to lower breakeven commodity price levels for shallow water programs. 
Turning now to our newbuild rigs, ENSCO DS-8 is completing customer acceptance testing and is on schedule to commence its initial contract with Total in mid-November. As previously reported, ENSCO DS-9 that was delivered early this year, is earning its daily rate for 2 years in accordance with the early termination provision of the contract. Jackup rigs, ENSCO 140 and 141, remain on schedule for mid-2016 deliveries and we are actively marketing these rigs in the Middle East in particular where they are being built.
As mentioned on our last call, we continue to evaluate our options for ENSCO 123, which is currently scheduled for a mid-2016 delivery. ENSCO DS-10 has already been delayed and is now scheduled for an early 2017 delivery. Jay will expand on our CapEx outlook, but in short, our CapEx would peak in 2015 at $1.65 billion and then decline significantly in future years. We currently forecast 2016 CapEx to be $625 million. 
In summary, I think, we've done a good job of building a solid bridge in terms of bolstering our financial position, deferring CapEx payments, streamlining costs, consolidating business unit reporting and capitalizing on pockets of customer demand to not only create a safe path to the future recovery but also to increase our flexibility to capitalize on opportunities along the way. In the meantime, as we look across our market, other players are also doing their part. Customers are reengineering projects and driving cost efficiencies, including standardization, to lower the breakeven commodity price level for their offshore programs. Major offshore builders in South Korea have agreed to work together to standardize materials, designs and procedures for offshore facilities to better control cost and limit project delays. Service companies are joining forces to leverage vertical integration and investments in new innovation to improve overall project management and to drive costs out of the system. And other drillers have joined in scrapping older rigs to help improve supply/demand dynamics.
Deepwater remains critically important to super majors and national oil companies, as well as the service companies that support them and we've seen large acquisitions by both operators and service companies in our space, underscoring their commitment to the offshore market despite the current downturn. Each group of market participants is taking positive steps in their own ways to improve the economics of the deepwater sector. And the combined impact of these actions will be meaningful to our industry. 
Before I hand it over to David, as noted in our most recent Fleet Status Report, our 5 rigs contracted with Petrobras continue to operate and earn day rate under their existing contracts. Similar to last quarter, you may find a recap regarding this matter on our 10-Q that we filed this morning.
Finally, our succession process for our new CFO is going well, and as Jay retires, I'm confident that we'll have a smooth transition due in large part to the strong bench of financial talent within our organization. 
Now I'll turn the call over to David."
269488,312855330,886502,"Ensco plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Valaris Limited","Executives","Thanks, Carl.

As Carl mentioned, customer demand remains at lower levels, driven by the cyclical downturn in the offshore drilling markets. Nevertheless, our marketing and operations teams have capitalized on pockets of customer demand around the world that resulted in several new contracts for Ensco. For example, we recently contracted ENSCO 8505 for a multiyear contract in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We were able to win this work because of the versatility that the 8500 series offers to customers and the high levels of operational performance that these rigs have delivered to our customers. Similar to its sister rig, ENSCO 8503, ENSCO 8505 will use a hybrid moored DP configuration under its new contract. The mooring upgrade is currently underway and is scheduled to be completed before the rig commences its new contract in December. This moored DP configuration is a major advantage for customers who need to drill well programs that's straddle both shallow and deepwater, offering them added flexibility, as well as our 8500 series drilling efficiencies and capabilities, such as a 2 million pound derrick and a deck configuration well-suited for plug-and-abandon and intervention work. We continue to have conversations with additional customers for well programs that sync up with the unique advantages of our 8500 series rigs with upgraded mooring packages. During the third quarter, ENSCO 8500 and 8506 also won short-term contract extensions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Moving to jackups. We finalized 3-year contracts for both ENSCO 71 and ENSCO 72 in Denmark that are expected to keep the rigs working into 2018. The North Sea is a particularly strong market for Ensco where we have 9 rigs under contract and we are having active discussions with customers for our 2 available rigs in the region. Additionally, we contracted ENSCO 107 for 100 days in New Zealand and ENSCO 68 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for 6 wells, both rigs are expected to begin their contracts during the fourth quarter. Our excellent uptime performance and, in many cases, prior experience with customers were integral in securing these new contracts. Ensco's operational and safety track record and technology continue to differentiate our rigs from the competition. In total, the new contracts I have just outlined are expected to add more than 9 rig years of work and help to bridge us to better market conditions in the future. 
We will continue to leverage our experience as an international driller with established operational and safety management systems, differentiated technology, well-trained rig crews and a strong reputation among customers to continue winning new work and retaining our existing customers. 
Now looking at global rig supply. In terms of newbuild rigs, 46 floaters were scheduled to be delivered by year-end 2017. Half of these rigs are contracted, including 15 rigs that are being built in Brazil, several of which have already experienced delays in their expected delivery dates due to financial, shipyard and other issues. In anticipation of a better contracting environment in the future, many of the remaining uncontracted deliveries have already been delayed. Additionally, some drillers have recently shown a willingness to refuse floater deliveries where contractually permitted. We have also seen some planned orders canceled. These newbuild delays and cancellations are positive developments for reducing global floater supply, and additional delays or cancellations would be another positive for rebalancing floater supply and demand more quickly. 
Moving to the order book for competitive jackups. There are approximately 105 uncontracted newbuilds showing delivery dates by year-end 2017. Most of these uncontracted deliveries are with speculators that have never operated a rig, and it remains to be seen whether these units will be able to compete effectively. We have already seen the cancellation of 6 jackup orders and we may see additional units canceled given current market conditions. Other newbuild rigs have been subject to repeated delivery delays, especially jackups being built by speculators. In fact, based on original scheduled delivery dates, 20 of these speculative rigs should have already been delivered but have been delayed by nearly a year on average and up to 18 months in some cases. We expect these delays to continue, especially for the 24 speculative newbuilds scheduled for delivery before year-end 2015, as companies who ordered these rigs need to put off large milestone CapEx payments, given limited contracting and rig sale opportunities. With regard to speculators representing 60% of newbuilds under construction and many of whom have committed only small down payments for their rigs, the shipyards will have to determine whether further investment in partially completed rigs is prudent. 
Turning now to scrapping and cold stacking of floaters and jackups. While the pace of scrapping and stacking slowed in the third quarter, we expect a pickup in the coming months as offshore drillers continue to rationalize their fleets and evaluate the go forward competitiveness of older rigs that would require significant CapEx to stay certified to work. 
In a market with limited contracting opportunities, it may not make economic sense for drillers to invest in these older, less capable assets. And some drillers have already telegraphed that more scrapping is ahead, due in part to their focus on reducing expenses and preserving capital during downturn. 
Since last September, offshore drillers have announced they will scrap 42 floaters. Over the same period, an additional 27 floaters have been cold stacked, and we believe that the majority of these stacked rigs will also be scrapped. In total, these 69 rigs represent more than 20% of competitive global supply a year ago.
Additionally, 24 floaters older than 30 years of age are currently idle without follow-on work, and an incremental 59 floaters greater than 30 years old will see their contracts expire by year-end 2017. All will be likely candidates for scrapping and/or cold stacking. And as a group, they are nearly double the number of floaters currently scheduled to enter the market before the end of 2017. 
Similarly, on the jackup side, we expect stacking to accelerate. Here is the picture for competitive jackups defined as independent leg cantilever rigs. Roughly 70 are stacked or idle without follow-on work and older than 30 years of age. Another 90 that are 30 years of age or older have contracts expiring by the end of 2017. Major regulatory surveys to recertify these older rigs, which must take place every 5 years, involve significant capital investment. In a tight cash flow environment and faced with uncertain recontracting prospects, drillers may choose to cold stack or, in many cases, retire these older units rather than spend tens of millions of dollars in upgrades. Additional information on the global supply of rigs is provided in the Investor Presentation on our website.
In closing, as evidenced by several new contract awards since our last call, we are well-positioned to capitalize on pockets of customer demand around the world as we navigate through the downturn. While the market remains challenging in the near term, there are several factors that will help to support rig demand in the medium to long-term. First, it has been encouraging to see a year-to-date pick up in offshore exploration success as compared to last year, including a significant recent discovery in the Mediterranean. Second, lease sales and frontier plays in established basins have continued to draw interest from several major customers as they look through the short-term noise in the commodity markets to the longer term potential of offshore reserves. Third, while participation in recent lease sales have been weaker than expected in Brazil and Mexico, we continue to see both markets becoming more diversified from a customer standpoint, and we expect that this will lead to opportunities, on the floaters side in particular, in the future. Appraisal and development of newly discovered reserves and eventual exploration of recently acquired leases will require drilling rigs. And Ensco's rig fleet, geographical presence and customer relationships put us in a great position to participate in the eventual market upturn. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

As noted in our press release, earnings from conti",1410,"Thanks, David. Today, I'll start with our third quarter financial results, our outlook for the fourth quarter, and then, I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial position and some closing comments. As noted in our press release, earnings from continuing operations were $1.34 compared to $1.79 last year. Total third quarter revenue was $1.01 billion versus $1.20 billion a year ago. Lower utilization was partially offset by the addition of 2 newbuild jackups to the active fleet. The reactivation of 2 upgraded floaters, ENSCO 5004 and 5006, and early termination fee for ENSCO DS-4, plus ENSCO DS-9 earning day rate sooner than scheduled due to the customer's early termination for convenience. Floaters segment revenue was $646 million compared to $704 million a year ago, primarily due to lower utilization of 59% compared to 82% a year ago, and a decline in the average day rate to $422,000 from $451,000 last year. 
Operational utilization for the floaters segment, which adjusts for uncontracted days and planned downtime was 95.4%, up from 94.2% a year ago. Our drillships had an exceptional quarter with 100% operational utilization. Jackup segment revenue was $326 million compared to $481 million a year ago, as utilization declined to 64% from 92% last year. The average day rate declined 5% to $134,000.
These factors were partially offset by the addition of 2 high specification jackups, ENSCO 122 and ENSCO 110, to the active fleet. Operational utilization for the total jackup fleet was 99.8%, an all-time high for our jackups, reflecting the continued focus of our offshore crudes on delivering high levels of uptime performance to our customers. We reduced total contract drilling expense to $434 million, well below our initial estimate and even lower than our revised outlook of $450 million to $455 million that we provided in early September.
Year-to-year, we reduced contract drilling expense by 13% from $500 million in third quarter 2014. Proactive expense management more than offset the incremental cost of adding DS-9 and 2 newbuild jackups to the active fleet, the reactivation of ENSCO 5004 and 5006, $6 million in upfront stacking cost, plus $4 million of severance and related costs associated with the streamlining of our business unit reporting structure and onshore support functions.
Depreciation expense increased $10 million to $145 million, in line with our expectations, due to the operating fleet growth that I just mentioned. Disciplined expense management, including centralizing certain support functions, reduced general and administrative expense to $28 million. As detailed in our press release, other expense increased to $52 million from $38 million a year ago, as interest expense was $17 million higher year-to-year, mostly due to our $1.25 billion debt offering during third quarter 2014 and our debt refinancing completed in the first quarter of 2015.
Our effective tax rate was 9.5% compared to an adjusted tax rate of 15% a year ago. Excluding discrete items such as the early contract termination for ENSCO DS-4, the effective tax rate was 12.6% compared to 13.9% a year ago. Our fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 15%.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Due principally to the $111 million DS-4 termination revenue that was recognized in the third quarter, total revenues are expected to decline on a sequential quarterly basis. Average day rates are projected to decline by approximately 5% from the third quarter levels of $232,000. We expect reported utilization for the fleet to be in the low 60% range, in line with third quarter utilization. These projections include ENSCO DS-8 that is scheduled to commence its initial contract next month. 
As Carl mentioned, we anticipate a further reduction in contract drilling expense during the fourth quarter as we continue to actively manage our cost base. Fourth quarter contract drilling expense is expected to decline $15 million to $20 million from the $434 million in the third quarter. This includes approximately $5 million of office consolidation and restructuring cost for the organizational streamlining we announced in September. We expect lower contract drilling expense despite the office consolidation charges and the projected increase in rig operating days for ENSCO DS-8 joining the active fleet and more contracted days for our 8500 series rigs. Please note that this updated outlook for the fourth quarter is an improvement from the initial outlook we provided in early September of $435 million to $440 million. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $149 million as ENSCO DS-8 joins the active fleet. We expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to be in line with third quarter. In total, other expense is estimated to be $59 million in the fourth quarter, mostly due to lower capitalized interest as DS-8 commences its initial contract.
Now I'll provide an update on our cost-reduction plans. The decisive actions that we've taken will reduce average offshore unit labor cost by 15% compared to 2014 levels, which translates into meaningful cost-savings since offshore compensation is roughly half of total contract drilling expense. The full run rate impact of this reduction will begin in the first quarter of 2016. We have streamlined our global operations reporting structure from 5 to 3 business units and raised our estimated annual run rate savings to $57 million beginning in the fourth quarter by rightsizing onshore support functions. In addition, we have continued to expedite the cold stacking of rigs without near-term contracting opportunities. On the floater side, ENSCO 8501, ENSCO 8502 and ENSCO DS-1 are now fully cold stacked and cash costs for these rigs are now less than $10,000 per day. We have cold stacked 5 jackups and we're in the process of cold stacking another jackup in the U.S. Gulf. Cash costs for these rigs are expected to be less than $5,000 per day. We will continue to proactively manage costs in line with market conditions throughout the cycle.
So let's wrap up with a review of our financial position. We have $6.6 billion in revenue backlog based on contracts in place. At September 30, we had a net debt-to-capital ratio of 32% and $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Since the end of the third quarter, we received a $146 million termination payment for DS-4 that will further bolster our cash position. We have a fully available $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, giving us significant liquidity and capital management flexibility. As a reminder, we have no debt maturities until 2019. Recently, as part of an overall sector review that resulted in downgrades from many offshore drillers, Moody's downgraded our credit rating by 1 notch to BAA2. We are rated the equivalent of 1 notch higher or BBB+ by S&P. We remain firmly investment-grade with both rating agencies and this action will have no direct impact to borrowing costs for our fixed cost debt obligations. Ensco's commercial paper rating was reaffirmed by Moody's at P2.
The rating action will also have no impact to our revolver, however, a further 1 notch downgrade would cause a very slight increase in our quarterly commitment fee and the applicable margin rate on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Year-to-date, through September 30, capital investments in the fleet totaled $1.45 billion. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately $200 million. Based on a detailed review, we have reduced our total CapEx budget for 2016 to $625 million, of which $475 million is for newbuild construction. In terms of rig enhancement CapEx, given our fleet upgrades over the past few years, including major upgrades to several floaters, our only expected rig enhancement project in 2016 is adding a mooring package to another 8500 series rig. CapEx for minor upgrades and improvements in 2016 will decline relative to 2015 levels due to a smaller active fleet. 
In closing, we have aggressively managed our expenses and CapEx in response to the downturn in the offshore drilling markets and we will continue to do so. Our strong liquidity and capital position give us greater flexibility to navigate in the downturn. Our actions over the past year from accessing the capital markets to streamlining our organizational and fleet structure have all been done with an eye towards improving our competitiveness. These actions allow us to focus on areas within our control during the downturn, improving operational and safety results while optimizing financial performance, which will better position Ensco for both the near term and the long term. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean."

There are some complexities around contract positions and arbitration around a lot of them, so a number of assets at the moment that are distressed assets that are available is still quite limited but, of course, building. I think, there is clearly an opportunity there to look at distressed assets that you would be able to pick up at a discounted rate. The question that, I think, everyone needs to ask is, and certainly asking themselves is does that investment balance make sense in the current market conditions where, certainly, something like a semi or a new drillship could be idle for several years because if you start to add in the cost of financing, the cost of stacking over the number of years that it might be idle, even at a discounted price, the economics don't always work out. So I think that what's going to happen is there's going to be probably a lot of tire kicking and a little bit of exploration on the first assets. And some people may sit on the sidelines during those first -- the first asset sales. So I don't think when we see the results of some of these first sale we should read too much into it, I don't think it establishes necessarily a market precedent on what everyone is going to do. We are certainly going to look at it, but we are not rushing to do anything, we have the liquidity to act if we see the right opportunities, but what we don't want to do is do something precipitive [ph] that doesn't make a sensible investment criteria and actually blow a lot of the cushion, the liquidity cushion, that we have early in the cycle."

And that contract comes with the usual type of terms and protections that we have for our high-value contracts. If I expand it out a little bit wider, so now, I'm not talking about Angola specifically, but the general market conditions, given where we are in the market, there still is further risk of being asked for concessions by various customers. And as we have done, where we have good contracts and strong contracts in place, which is the majority of our high-value, high-backlog contracts, we are prepared to work with customers if we can get something in return. If we can get contract extensions, if we can get other contract awards or things that can help us reduce our cost of risk, then we will work with our long-standing customers to put something in place where we can both gain and try and manage through the current situations. Well, of course, we're loathe to do and that we'll resist as much as we can is something that's completely unilateral.

And as we said in the pre-prepared comments, we think that although that's been relatively modest as far as announcements go in Q3, we do think there will be a step up as we go through the next couple of quarters. So the decision as to whether to put into warm stack, like I described, for $40,000 a day for a drillship, for example. It's very different between a new asset and an older asset.

The fact that the rigs can work in multiple water depths on multiple program types, so for example, to be able to swing between drilling a deepwater well, going and doing an intervention, doing a sidetrack, then swing and do a P&A, then go back and do an intervention, that type of program, we are seeing some reasonable opportunities for because a lot of our customer base don't have the CapEx commitments or the sanctions to be able to go off and do 1 year or 2 years just development drilling, for example. What they do have is very mixed programs that involve P&A and intervention then maybe drilling an out-stack well or high-back well, and these rigs are really well-suited to that. And the 8500s are well-suited to that anyway, but with the mooring upgrade, they're even better. So with that in mind, we have pre-ordered and actually bought the equipment for the upgrade with the intention of doing it partially because we think it's, without a particular single contract in mind, but recognizing a market need.

But the nature of the work on this long-term contract where it's going to move between intervention, drilling, plug and abandonment, it's going to do some work with the riser, some without the riser and some on mooring. When it's working in some of these configurations, we can reduce the cost base even further. On top of the cost reductions we have done across the whole company, there are specifics to -- of how we can reduce the operating costs on the operations of this contract. So it will be earning cash margin. And based on that, we would be prepared to enter into similar long-term contracts on the 8500 series rigs if they came up within this pricing range."

As you can imagine, it's relatively complex because, for a lot of these assets, particularly those that were done under a secured financing, there's a lot of different players between bank routes and bondholders and things who have to come up with an agreed price. So we haven't landed there anyway in the market and we haven't seen it clear. So I just don't know exactly where we are on the bid to ask, but I think it's probably going to be lower than some of the debt holders feel comfortable with at the moment to get someone to take it at this stage and put it and basically stack the rig out like that, idle for a while."

On the second issue there, there is a reasonable amount of P&A and intervention work happening as customers take advantage of rig rate and service rates. So there is -- it's the one part in the market where there's a little bit of elasticity to pricing. And the other thing to understand is that depending on the regime and the accounting regime, there are several customers out there who actually can release accrued amounts because the cost to actually P&A a well at the moment is lower than the amount they've accrued if they take advantage of the current pricing.
