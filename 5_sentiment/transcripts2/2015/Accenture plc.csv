We're extremely pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, continuing our momentum from the first quarter. Our strong performance in the second quarter was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business, and we gained significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights. Let me start with our new bookings of $9.4 billion, our second-highest quarterly bookings ever. This brings us to $17 billion for the first half and positions us well for the year. We delivered very strong revenue growth of 12% in local currency with double-digit growth in both consulting and outsourcing. 
Earnings per share were $1.08, a 5% increase. We expanded operating margins 30 basis points to 13.6%. Our balance sheet remained very strong, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion, and we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Today, we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.02 per share, which shall bring total dividend payment for the year to $2.04 per share, a 10% over increase over last year. So with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about ourselves and the momentum we are creating in our business, and we have again raised our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year. 
Over to you, David."

As you heard in Pierre's comments, we delivered a very strong second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of strong and building momentum in our business as we continue to",1386,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we delivered a very strong second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of strong and building momentum in our business as we continue to execute a growth strategy that's clearly resonating in the marketplace. 
During this period, we've gained significant market share by being relevant and responsive to the needs of our clients. 
Looking more specifically at the second quarter. Following a strong start to the year in quarter 1, we again delivered on all 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value. Our 12% growth, which continue to be broad-based across almost every dimension of our business, reflects the durability of our revenue growth model as we drive growth and scale. Our operating margin of 13.6%, 30 basis points higher than last year, demonstrates the success of the actions underway to improve profitability and reflects our ability to manage our business to drive sustainable margin expansion. And our free cash flow of $220 million was consistent with our expectations and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year while returning significant cash to shareholders. 
So we're extremely pleased with the second quarter, very strong growth, strong margin expansion and cash flow consistent with our expectations. 
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.4 billion for the quarter, as Pierre said, representing the second-highest quarter in our history. Consulting bookings were $4.2 billion with a book to bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $5.1 billion with a book to bill of 1.4. 
On a year-to-date basis, bookings are now just over $17 billion, a very healthy level, especially when considering the FX impact and puts us within our target book-to-bill range for both consulting and outsourcing. 
Taking a closer look at our quarter 2 bookings. An important theme was the continued strong demand for both digital-related services and operations. 
At the same time, we saw very good demand for both application services and consulting-related services. Another important characteristic was the broad-based nature of the uptick in new bookings with sequential improvement in bookings across all operating groups and all 3 geographic areas. 
Finally, we were pleased that we had a record 15 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which points to the strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive the most important initiatives on their agenda. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.49 billion, an increase of 5% U.S. dollars and 12% local currency, reflecting a negative 6.5% of foreign exchange impact compared to the negative 5% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for these additional FX headwind, we came in well above the top end of our guided range. 
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, up 6% USD and 13% local currency. 
Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. We saw consistent trends with our most recent quarters. The dominant drivers were strong double-digit growth in digital-related services, operations and application services, and it's also noteworthy that our results reflected an uptick in growth rates in both strategy and consulting services, which are now growing at mid-single digits. 
Turning to the operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology delivered another quarter of 15% growth, which continue to be broad-based with almost all dimensions growing double digits. The strongest growth drivers continue to be a digital-related services, cost rationalization in several large transformational projects as well as increasing demand for network-related services. 
H&PS also grew 15% in the quarter, and the drivers continue to be very significant growth in our health business, particularly in the public sector driven by our health exchange and Medicaid-related projects at U.S. federal and state clients. 
Digital-related services and operations, particularly in BPO continue to be very significant drivers of growth as well. 
Products growth of 13% continue to reflect strong and balanced growth across all 3 geographic regions and most industries. Digital and cost optimization were significant areas of focus for clients in this operating group as well. Application services was also a driver as well as very strong overall growth in consulting. 
Financial Services grew 9% led by strong growth in Europe and across all 3 industries, particularly in capital markets and insurance. Digital-related services continue to be a major theme as our clients are looking for new and innovative ways to connect with their customers and serve their needs. Additionally, cost optimization and risk and regulatory work continue to be significant areas of focus. 
Resources grew 6% with growth in all 3 geographic regions and all industries, except energy. Revenues were driven by growth in outsourcing across all energies, all industries, including energy, as clients focus on operational efficiency and cost rationalization. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.9% compared with 31.3% for the same period last year, down 140 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7% of net revenues compared with 11.7% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down 100 basis points. 
General, administrative expense was 5.6% of net revenues compared with 6.2% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down 60 basis points. Operating income was $1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.6% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with the quarter 2 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% compared with an effective tax rate of 24% in the second quarter last year. 
Net income was $743 million for the second quarter compared with net income of $722 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.08 compared with EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter last year. This reflects the 5% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continue to be industry leading. There were 35 days, down from 37 days last quarter. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $220 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $301 million, net of property and equipment additions of $82 million. 
As I mentioned in quarter 1, we shifted the timing of a portion of our compensation payments from quarter 1 to quarter 2. While this shift negatively impacted the second quarter, there is no impact to full year cash flow. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at February 28 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down $800 million as we've returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in the first half of fiscal '15. 
Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 323,000 people. We now have approximately 226,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 2, our utilization was 91%, consistent with last quarter. 
Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations was 14% compared to 13% in quarter 1 and 12% in the same period last year. Lastly, we continue to expect at least 90,000 people will join our company in fiscal '15. 
Turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 6.8 million shares for $601 million at an average price of $87.72 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 15.2 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion at an average price of $83.62 per share. As of February 28, we have approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.02 per share, representing a 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year. The dividend will be paid on May 15, 2015. 
So with 2 quarters in the books, we've delivered very strong results and feel positive about how we're positioned for the remainder of the year. That said, we don't take anything for granted. We continue to drive our business with rigor and discipline, doing everything possible to deliver a strong second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Pierre."

We are executing very well against our growth strategy and taking the leadership position in each of the businesses in our portfolio. The investments we've made in assets and solutions, in strategic acquisitions and attracting talent and in building the skills and capabilities of our people has positioned us very well to capture new growth opportunities. 
We are driving innovation across Accenture to build capabilities that are both highly relevant to our clients and highly differentiated in the marketplace. You have heard me mention 2 important trends, digitization and rationalization, that are driving demand for our services and contribution to our growth. We invested ahead of the curve to build the capabilities that will help our clients respond to these trends. 
Digitization is all about helping your clients tap into new sources of value and new sources for revenue to create competitive advantage. We are helping clients capitalize on this trend to become the disruptors in the new digital world, not the disrupted. 
A great example is the work we are doing with a leading retailer, helping them envision entirely new ways to attract customers and achieve their goal of quadrupling revenue. We are bringing innovative digital technology to help them move beyond the traditional store model to a multi-channel digital strategy. 
For our global telecommunications provider, we developed a digital strategy underpinned by Analytics to significantly upgrade the customer service while delivering cost savings of almost $100 million. We are also working with our clients to develop innovative products and services based on the Internet of Things. We are helping Visa explore the future of mobile payments to make purchases more convenient even inside the car. Leveraging our expertise in digital commerce, we build a proof-of-concept to show our consumers in the connected car can order and pay for securely. 
Digital services represent about 20% of our total revenues and grew more than 20% in local currency in the first half of the year. We are seeing demand for digital across all dimensions of the business in every industry and around the world, and we are clearly benefiting from the investments we have made in this space. 
In January, we are quite structured a Houston-based firm that will further enhance our smart grid operations, energy trading and risk management services for utilities and in energy clients. In February, we announced the acquisition of Technologies, a provider of digital solutions for the U.S. federal government. The acquisition enhances our digital capabilities in Analytics, cloud and mobility for federal agencies. And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of, a Brazilian Analytics firm that will expand our advanced Analytics capabilities in the supply chain and logistics areas. 
The second theme or rationalization continues to be top of mind for our clients as they look for opportunities to increase productivity and efficiency across their organizations. We have invested to take a leadership position in this space with Accenture Operations, and we are the first company to combine business process services with infrastructure and cloud services at scale. 
We are working with a leading global airline on a major transformation of its procurement function, including a cloud-based supplier portal. The airline expects to realize significant cost savings as well as increased mobilization and transparency. 
We are helping a global beverage company create a global operating hub for finance and accounting, procurement, supply chain and marketing operations. Our multi-BPO services will streamline processes, minimize risk and provide new analytical insights. And we are working with a leading European manufacturer to transform its IT infrastructure. We will migrate existing applications and data services across more than 60 operating companies into a single hybrid cloud environment. We expect to deliver improved services and flexibility, increase automation and a 30% reduction in operating costs. 
Now turning to the geographic dimension of our business. In the second quarter, we again delivered very strong growth across all 3 of our geographic regions. 
In North America, we delivered revenue growth of 13% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in the United States, where we continue to perform extremely well. 
In Europe, we grew revenues 9% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in many of our largest markets, including France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. 
And in our growth markets, we grew revenues 12% in local currency with again strong double-digit growth in 3 of our largest markets: Japan, Australia and Brazil. 
So as you can see, we have delivered an excellent first half of this fiscal year. Our diverse portfolio of business, together with our geographic diversity and our unique ability to integrate our capabilities end to end, positions us very well to bring innovative services to market-leading companies, both globally and locally. 
Looking ahead, based on the successful execution of our growth strategy, I feel confident in our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term, providing value to our clients, our people and our shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year '15. David, over to you."

For the third quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.6 billion. This assumes the impact that foreign exchange will be negative 11% compared to third quarter of fiscal '14. 
For the full fiscal year '15, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX in our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 8% compared to fiscal '14. 
For the full fiscal '15, we now expect our net revenues to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '14. For the full fiscal year '15, we now expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $35 billion, reflecting our revised FX assumptions. 
Before I continue with our business outlook, I'd like to comment briefly on a noncash item that will be recorded in the third quarter. In May, we expect to record a noncash settlement charge estimated to be approximately $60 million as a result of a current offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. Pension Plan. This will reduce future risk and administrative costs to Accenture. 
On a GAAP basis for fiscal '15, the estimated impact of this settlement charge is approximately 20 basis points to the operating margin and approximately $0.05 in EPS. We will provide both GAAP and adjusted results for quarter 3 and year-to-date results. 
For operating margin, on a year-to-date -- on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal '15 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '14 results. 
We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal '15 to be in the range of $4.66 to $4.76 or 3% to 5% growth over fiscal '14 results. Absent the higher FX headwind, which impacts EPS by $0.14, our EPS range would have increased $0.10 to $0.14 driven by higher revenue growth. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect our operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4.15 billion, reflecting our revised FX assumption. Property and equipment additions continue to be approximately $450 million, and free cash flow now to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

You'll remember around what we are calling interactive, Analytics, cloud and mobility. And now indeed, we are significantly benefited from this wave, which is very important. That's why I was very pleased and proud to report our position in term of digital-related services now at 20% of Accenture revenues in that short period in time. And as important and even more important, well above 20% local currency growth for the first half of the year. So needless to say that we have a great momentum in that business, and indeed, it's covering lots of opportunities, small, medium, large, covering consulting or outsourcing type of work. So digital is pervasive across the different dimension of our businesses.

I would say first on your first question, in terms of the second half of the year, I would think in terms of mid- to high single-digit positive growth for consulting, and let's say probably high single-digit positive for outsourcing. So that puts us",453,"Yes. I would say first on your first question, in terms of the second half of the year, I would think in terms of mid- to high single-digit positive growth for consulting, and let's say probably high single-digit positive for outsourcing. So that puts us on a track to the full year of probably mid to high single for consulting again and low double digit for outsourcing. In terms of the profitability point, on the risk of being redundant, I guess let me just share a few things with you beyond what I said in the script. First of all, we're very pleased with the 30 basis points expansion. That obviously is at the upper end of the range that we target, and it does reflect a lot of the hard work that our organization has been doing over the last 4 quarters. What I really focus on when I look at our profitability are a few things. The first thing I focus on is the progression of our contract profitability, and I can tell you that our contract profitability was up compared to the same quarter last year, and we continue to be pleased with the progression of contract profitability. The second thing that I look at is the overall -- the progression of the overall efficiency of our labor costs, both our Accenture personnel and our subcontractors. And we have made really good improvement in our labor cost efficiency for several quarters now, and that's in the mix as well when you look at our second quarter results. The third thing I look at is how our organization is doing in managing every dime we spend as if it's our own individually related to nonpayroll expenses, and we've done a very good job with that. And then finally although this is certainly not last on the list, at the end of the day, we are seeking to create headroom in our P&L so that we can invest at sufficient levels to really drive our business growth going forward, and we have a good mix of investments in our results as well. And so we always are talking about in this forum, at least, we get the questions on the gross margin and the SG&A, but those are the things that I really focus on. And all those things were in the right zone relative to my expectations, creating the 30 basis points of expansion. The last thing I'll say is gross margin again includes a lot of things. It's not just contract profitability. It includes recruiting, training, integration of acquisitions, on boarding costs for new hires, et cetera. So there's a lot that goes in there that ebbs and flows quarter-over-quarter."

I mean, commenting on the first part of your question and what happened these last 3 quarters compared to what happened before. I guess as you know, the world has changed significantly, and we put a lot of thought at Accenture on what it takes to be relevant in this new world and to respond to the current needs of our clients. And the needs are much more around how we deal with uncertainty, how we deal with volatility, how we bring more flexible solution, how we provide more productivity and efficiency, and that's why we come with this. I'm being quite simple but this really vision around at the end of the day, it's all going to be digitization of the business for clients, on behalf of our clients and the rationalization of operations. And then we significantly align the Accenture strategic agenda and our investments toward these 2 main trends. And as you know, and you've see that recently and we communicated to you, we invested in new skills. We invested in new organization with the creation of Accenture Consulting, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Digital Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations. We make several strategic acquisitions especially focusing on digital and operation. We're quite very deep skills. We have more than 1,000 PhD doing algorithm in Analytics at Accenture. So this is what we did these last couple of years, and I guess that now, we are getting the return on the strategy we set and on the investment we've made. We are absolutely not complacent with that, but to a great extent, we are seeing a way to pass through to be relevant to our client. We're committed to it, and now we're executing seamlessly."

And so at the end of the day, all 5 of our operating groups succeeded. So again it was broad-based, and I would say that it was more in our consulting-related services than our outsourcing. So consulting came in stronger, and part of that again goes back to the digital theme that we talk about as a driver of consulting, but also we see more activity across our other consulting-type services, both strategy and our core Consulting business, management consulting, et cetera.

I would say that in application services, again to be clear, David, when we talk about pricing, we're talking about the margin percentage on the contracts that we signed. And in application services, we've also seen positive progression in the last 6 months."

So I guess that we are gaining market share in many of our industries. I mentioned in Europe as an illustration that we have double-digit growth in Germany, in the Netherlands. And again, I'm sure we are gaining significant market share given the market over there when you're growing double digits. So it's quite widespread in many -- again double-digit growth in Japan, in Brazil, in Australia. So in all places where we have double-digit growth, we are gaining market share technically.

If you take chemicals, which is a very important industry for us, we're growing more than 20%. So you need to look from a portfolio standpoint. From a Europe standpoint, I mean, you're absolutely right. You mentioned that the outsourcing market is vibrant. Again, our clients in Europe are looking for more efficiency and more productivity. And if I look at digital versus digitization versus rationalization, probably U.S. would be a bit more digitization while Europe would be a bit on rationalization, which is opening a good space for the outsourcing-related work. And again, we benefit from the diversity of our Global Delivery Network, and we can come with our clients, and you're right to mention that you need to be sometime a little bit more balanced and subtle in the way you're driving outsourcing in Europe with respect to different nationalities labor market and environment, and so the mix, it's more about the right sourcing and the smart sourcing with the good mix of onshore, offshore. And we benefit Accenture of having a very diverse Global Delivery Network with, of course, Resources on an offshore standpoint especially in India and the Philippines as well a network of nearshore centers, which is helping us to get to what we believe is the right sourcing approach for our clients.

We are extremely pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, continuing our momentum from the first quarter. Our strong performance in the second quarter was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business, and we gained significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights. Let me start with our new bookings of $9.4 billion, our second-highest quarterly bookings ever. This brings us to $17 billion for the first half and positions us well for the year. We delivered very strong revenue growth of 12% in local currency with double-digit growth in both consulting and outsourcing. Earnings per share were $1.08, a 5% increase. We expanded operating margins 30 basis points to 13.6%. Our balance sheet remained very strong, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion. And we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.02 per share, which shall bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.04 per share, a 10% over increase over last year. 
So with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our results and the momentum we are creating in our business. And we have again raised our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year. Over to you, David."
972190,280247727,786228,"Accenture plc, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 26, 2015",2015-03-26,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we delivered a very strong second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of strong and building momentum in our business as we continue",1385,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we delivered a very strong second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of strong and building momentum in our business as we continue to execute a growth strategy that's clearly resonating in the marketplace. During this period, we've gained significant market share by being relevant and responsive to the needs of our clients. 
Looking more specifically at the second quarter. Following a strong start to the year in quarter 1, we again delivered on all 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value. Our 12% growth, which continued to be broad-based across almost every dimension of our business, reflects the durability of our revenue growth model as we drive growth at scale. Our operating margin of 13.6%, 30 basis points higher than last year, demonstrates the success of the actions underway to improve profitability and reflects our ability to manage our business to drive sustainable margin expansion. And our free cash flow of $220 million was consistent with our expectations and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year while returning significant cash to shareholders. So we were extremely pleased with the second quarter, very strong growth, strong margin expansion and cash flow consistent with our expectations. 
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.4 billion for the quarter, as Pierre said, representing the second-highest quarter in our history. Consulting bookings were $4.2 billion with book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $5.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.4. On a year-to-date basis, bookings are now just over $17 billion, a very healthy level, especially when considering the FX impact and puts us within our target book-to-bill range for both consulting and outsourcing. 
Taking a closer look at our quarter 2 bookings. An important theme was the continued strong demand for both digital-related services and operations. At the same time, we saw very good demand for both application services and consulting-related services. Another important characteristic was the broad-based nature of the uptick in new bookings with sequential improvement in bookings across all operating groups and all 3 geographic areas. Finally, we were pleased that we had a record 15 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which points to the strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive the most important initiatives on their agenda. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.49 billion, an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% local currency, reflecting a negative 6.5% foreign exchange impact compared to the negative 5% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the additional FX headwind, we came in well above the top end of our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, up 6% in USD and 13% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. We saw consistent trends with our most recent quarters. The dominant drivers were strong double-digit growth in digital-related services, operations and application services. And it's also noteworthy that our results reflected an uptick in growth rates in both strategy and consulting services, which are now growing at mid-single digits. 
Turning to the operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology delivered another quarter of 15% growth, which continued to be broad-based with almost all dimensions growing double digits. The strongest growth drivers continued to be digital-related services, cost rationalization and several large transformational projects as well as increasing demand for network-related services. 
H&PS also grew 15% in the quarter. And the drivers continued to be very significant growth in our health business, particularly in the public sector, driven by our health exchange and Medicaid-related projects at U.S. federal and state clients. Digital-related services and operations, particularly in BPO, continued to be very significant drivers of growth as well. Products growth of 13% continued to reflect strong and balanced growth across all 3 geographic regions and most industries. Digital and cost optimization were significant areas of focus for clients in this operating group as well. Application services was also a driver as well as very strong overall growth in consulting. 
Financial Services grew 9%, led by strong growth in Europe and across all 3 industries, particularly in capital markets and insurance. Digital-related services continued to be a major theme as our clients are looking for new and innovative ways to connect with their customers and serve their needs. Additionally, cost optimization and risk and regulatory work continued to be significant areas of focus. Resources grew 6% with growth in all 3 geographic regions and all industries, except energy. Revenues were driven by growth in outsourcing across all energies -- all industries, including energy, as clients focus on operational efficiency and cost rationalization. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.9% compared with 31.3% for the same period last year, down 140 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7% of net revenues compared with 11.7% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down 100 basis points. General, administrative expense was 5.6% of net revenues compared with 6.2% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down 60 basis points. Operating income was $1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.6% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with the quarter 2 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% compared with an effective tax rate of 24% in the second quarter last year. Net income was $743 million for the second quarter compared with net income of $722 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.08 compared with EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter last year. This reflects the 5% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry leading. There were 35 days, down from 37 days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $220 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $301 million, net of property and equipment additions of $82 million. As I mentioned in quarter 1, we shifted the timing of a portion of our compensation payments from quarter 1 to quarter 2. While this shift negatively impacted the second quarter, there is no impact to full year cash flow. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at February 28 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down $800 million as we've returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in the first half of fiscal '15. 
Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 323,000 people. We now have approximately 226,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 2, our utilization was 91%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14% compared to 13% in quarter 1 and 12% in the same period last year. Lastly, we continue to expect at least 90,000 people will join our company in fiscal '15. 
Turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 6.8 million shares for $601 million at an average price of $87.72 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 15.2 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion at an average price of $83.62 per share. As of February 28, we have approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Finally, as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.02 per share, representing a 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year. The dividend will be paid on May 15, 2015. 
So with 2 quarters in the books, we've delivered very strong results and feel positive about how we're positioned for the remainder of the year. That said, we don't take anything for granted. We continue to drive our business with rigor and discipline, doing everything possible to deliver a strong second half of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Pierre."

Digitization is all about helping your clients tap into new sources of value and new sources for revenue to create competitive advantage. We are helping clients capitalize on this trend to become the disruptors in the new digital world, not the disrupted. 
A great example is the work we are doing with a leading retailer, helping them envision entirely new ways to attract customers and achieve their goal of quadrupling revenue. We are bringing innovative digital technology to help them move beyond the traditional store model to a multichannel digital strategy. For a global telecommunications provider, we developed a digital strategy underpinned by analytics to significantly upgrade their customer service while delivering cost savings of almost $100 million. We are also working with our clients to develop innovative products and services based on the Internet of Things. We are helping Visa explore the future of mobile payments to make purchases more convenient even inside the car. 
Leveraging our expertise in digital commerce, we built a proof-of-concept to show our consumers in a connected car can order and pay for securely. Digital services represent about 20% of our total revenues and grew more than 20% in local currency in the first half of the year. We are seeing demand for digital across all dimensions of the business in every industry and around the world. And we are clearly benefiting from the investments we have made in this space. 
In January, we acquired Structure, a Houston-based firm that will further enhance our smart grid operations, energy trading and risk management services for utilities and energy clients. In February, we announced the acquisition of Agilex Technologies, a provider of digital solutions for the U.S. federal government. The acquisition enhances our digital capabilities in analytics, cloud and mobility for federal agencies. And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Gapso, a Brazilian analytics firm that will expand our advanced analytics capabilities in the supply chain and logistic areas. 
The second theme, rationalization, continues to be top of mind for our clients as they look for opportunities to increase productivity and efficiency across their organizations. We have invested to take a leadership position in this space with Accenture Operations. And we are the first company to combine business process services with infrastructure and cloud services at scale. 
We are working with a leading global airline on a major transformation of its procurement function, including a cloud-based supplier portal. The airline expects to realize significant cost savings as well as increased normalization and transparency. We are helping a global beverage company create a global operating hub for finance and accounting, HR, procurement, supply chain and marketing operations. Our multi-tower BPO services will streamline processes, minimize risk and provide new analytical insights. And we are working with a leading European manufacturer to transform its IT infrastructure. We will migrate existing applications and data services across more than 60 operating companies into a single hybrid cloud environment. We expect to deliver improved services and flexibility, increase automation and a 30% reduction in operating costs. 
Now turning to the geographic dimension of our business. In the second quarter, we again delivered very strong growth across all 3 of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered revenue growth of 13% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in the United States, where we continue to perform extremely well. In Europe, we grew revenues 9% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in many of our largest markets, including France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. And in our growth markets, we grew revenues 12% in local currency with again strong double-digit growth in 3 of our largest markets: Japan, Australia and Brazil. 
So as you can see, we have delivered an excellent first half of this fiscal year. Our diverse portfolio of business, together with our geographic diversity and our unique ability to integrate our capabilities end-to-end positions us very well to bring innovative services to market-leading companies, both globally and locally. Looking ahead, based on the successful execution of our growth strategy, I feel confident in our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term, providing value to our clients, our people and our shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year '15. David, over to you."
972190,280247727,786228,"Accenture plc, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 26, 2015",2015-03-26,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thank you, Pierre. Let me turn now to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.6 billion. This assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 11% compared to third q",483,"Thank you, Pierre. Let me turn now to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.6 billion. This assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 11% compared to third quarter of fiscal '14. For the full fiscal year '15, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX in our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 8% compared to fiscal '14. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '14. For the full fiscal year '15, we now expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $35 billion, reflecting our revised FX assumptions. 
Before I continue with our business outlook, I'd like to comment briefly on a noncash item that will be recorded in the third quarter. In May, we expect to record a noncash settlement charge estimated to be approximately $60 million as a result of a current offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. This will reduce future risk and administrative cost to Accenture. On a GAAP basis for fiscal '15, the estimated impact of this settlement charge is approximately 20 basis points to operating margin and approximately $0.05 in EPS. We will provide both GAAP and adjusted results for quarter 3 and year-to-date results. 
For operating margin, on a year-to-date -- on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal '15 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '14 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal '15 to be in the range of $4.66 to $4.76 or 3% to 5% growth over fiscal '14 results. Absent the higher FX headwind, which impacts EPS by $0.14, our EPS range would have increased $0.10 to $0.14 driven by higher revenue growth. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4.15 billion, reflecting our revised FX assumption. Property and equipment additions continue to be approximately $450 million and free cash flow now to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

And indeed, as we communicated recently and even [indiscernible], we embarked in rotating more of our business to what we are calling now digital-related services. Digital is pervasive across the board. This is something we anticipated frankly a few years ago, probably in the range of 29%, and we invested a lot ahead of the curve. You remember around what we are calling interactive, analytics, cloud and mobility. And now indeed, we have significantly benefited from this wave, which is very important. That's why I was very pleased and proud to report our position in terms of digital-related services now at 20% of Accenture revenues in that short period in time, and as important and even more important, well above 20% local currency growth for the first half of the year. So needless to say that we have a great momentum in that business. And indeed, it's covering a large variety of opportunities, small, medium, large, covering consulting or outsourcing type of work. So digital is pervasive across the different dimension of our businesses, consulting, outsourcing across all industries, they are more or less around this 20%, some above, a few slightly below. And on balance, I guess, David will comment good pricing."

There's a flavor of application services in there. And I mean, I guess, stating the obvious, there's a flavor of digital in there as well. The thing about our bookings that we were especially pleased with, and generally this would apply to the 15 clients, is the pervasiveness of the strength of the bookings. And I mentioned that we had sequential growth across all 5 of our operating groups and all 3 geographic areas. And so I would say that there's not anything unique about the 15.

So that puts us on a track to the full year of probably mid- to high single for consulting again and low double digit for outsourcing. In terms of the profitability point, at the risk of being redundant, I guess, let me just share a few things with you beyond what I said in the script. First of all, we're very pleased with the 30 basis points of expansion. That obviously is at the upper end of the range that we target. And it does reflect a lot of the hard work that our organization has been doing over the last 4 quarters. What I really focus on when I look at our profitability are a few things. The first thing I focus on is the progression of our contract profitability. And I can tell you that our contract profitability was up compared to the same quarter last year and we continue to be pleased with the progression of contract profitability. The second thing that I look at is the overall -- the progression of the overall efficiency of our labor cost, both our Accenture personnel and our subcontractors. And we have made really good improvement in our labor cost efficiency for several quarters now. And that's in the mix as well when you look at our second quarter results. The third thing I look at is how our organization is doing in managing every dime we spend as if it's our own individually related to nonpayroll expenses. And we've done a very good job with that. And then finally, although this is certainly not last on the list, at the end of the day, we are seeking to create headroom in our P&L so that we can invest at sufficient levels to really drive our business growth going forward. And we have a good mix of investments in our results as well. And so we always are talking about -- in this forum, at least, we get the questions on the gross margin and the SG&A. But those are the things that I really focus on. And all of those things were in the right zone relative to my expectations, creating the 30 basis points of expansion. The last thing I'll say is gross margin again includes a lot of things. It's not just contract profitability. It includes recruiting, training, integration of acquisitions, onboarding cost for new hires, et cetera. So there's a lot that goes in there that ebbs and flows quarter-over-quarter."

And that's why we come with this. I'm [indiscernible] being quite simple, but this really vision around at the end of the day, it's all going to be digitization of the business for clients on behalf of our clients and the rationalization of their operations. And then we significantly align the Accenture strategic agenda and our investments toward these 2 main trends. And as you know, and you've see that recently and we communicated a lot, we invested in new skills. We invested in new organization with the creation of Accenture Consulting, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations. We make several strategic acquisitions especially focusing on digital and operation. We're quite very deep skills. We have more than 1,000 Ph.D. doing algorithm in analytics at Accenture. So this is what we did these last couple of years. And I guess, that now we are getting the return on the strategy we set and on the investment we've made. We are absolutely not complacent with that. And to a great extent, we are seeing a way, a path through to be relevant to a client. We committed to it. And now we are executing seamlessly."

And we very much do to ourselves -- I should say we leverage the same kind of capabilities that we sell to our clients internally. And so we use BPO concepts, for example, across HR and finance. And we have more room to go. It's an ongoing journey for us just as it is for our clients. And we've made improvements in what we call our corporate function costs as well.

And not to be too simplistic, but the answer is that all 5 of our operating groups, every single one of them, came in stronger than what we and they expected when we provided guidance in December. And again I think it gets -- part of the deal is that when you're on a revenue ramp, it is -- it can be a little bit more difficult to predict the slope of the ramp because, for example, we can be quite confident in the work activity, but yet we have to also think about our operating groups, the availability to the resources, the timing when the projects get started, et cetera. And so at the end of the day, all 5 of our operating groups exceeded. So again it was broad-based. And I would say that it was more in our consulting-related services than our outsourcing. So consulting came in stronger. And part of that again goes back to this digital theme that we talk about as a driver of consulting. But also we see more activity across our other consulting-type services, both strategy and our core consulting business, management consulting, et cetera. So it's really consulting came in better, and all 5 operating groups came in better. Those were really the drivers. And I do think that the higher volume of smaller contracts is in the mix of everything I said really across the board."

So we're very comfortable with where we are. I think that, by and large, if you look at the last few quarters, our DSO has been relatively stable. It was up a little, now it's down a couple of days.

And if I look at digital versus digitization versus rationalization, probably U.S. would be a bit more on digitization when Europe would be a bit more on rationalization, which is opening a good space for the outsourcing-related work.

And with benefit of Accenture of having a very diverse Global Delivery Network with, of course, Resources on an offshore standpoint, especially in India and the Philippines, but as well a network of nearshore centers, which is helping us to get to what we believe is the right sourcing approach for our clients. So I'm feeling extremely confident. And based on the results, our outsourcing business in Europe is doing well.
Thank you to all of you. Thanks a lot for taking the time and participating to our call today. As you've seen with half of the fiscal year behind us, it's clear that we have built strong momentum in our business and it's clear as well that we are gaining significant market share. We are seeing clearly the return on the investment we've made, particularly in digital and operations. And we will continue to execute our growth strategy to bring innovative and differentiated services to the marketplace. In closing, I want to thank the 323,000 women and men of Accenture for their dedication, their passion and their commitment to delivering value for our clients each and every day in the market place. Thank you to all of you. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC. All the best to all of you."

We are extremely pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, continuing our momentum from the first quarter. Our strong performance in the second quarter was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business, and we gained significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights. Let me start with our new bookings of $9.4 billion, our second-highest quarterly bookings ever. This brings us to $17 billion for the first half and positions us well for the year. We delivered very strong revenue growth of 12% in local currency with double-digit growth in both consulting and outsourcing. Earnings per share were $1.08, a 5% increase. We expanded operating margins 30 basis points to 13.6%. Our balance sheet remained very strong, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion. And we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.02 per share, which shall bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.04 per share, a 10% over increase over last year. 
So with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our results and the momentum we are creating in our business. And we have again raised our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year. Over to you, David."

As you heard in Pierre's comments, we delivered a very strong second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of strong and building momentum in our business as we continue",1385,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we delivered a very strong second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of strong and building momentum in our business as we continue to execute a growth strategy that's clearly resonating in the marketplace. During this period, we've gained significant market share by being relevant and responsive to the needs of our clients. 
Looking more specifically at the second quarter. Following a strong start to the year in quarter 1, we again delivered on all 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value. Our 12% growth, which continued to be broad-based across almost every dimension of our business, reflects the durability of our revenue growth model as we drive growth at scale. Our operating margin of 13.6%, 30 basis points higher than last year, demonstrates the success of the actions underway to improve profitability and reflects our ability to manage our business to drive sustainable margin expansion. And our free cash flow of $220 million was consistent with our expectations and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year while returning significant cash to shareholders. So we were extremely pleased with the second quarter: very strong growth, strong margin expansion and cash flow consistent with our expectations. 
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.4 billion for the quarter, as Pierre said, representing the second-highest quarter in our history. Consulting bookings were $4.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $5.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.4. On a year-to-date basis, bookings are now just over $17 billion, a very healthy level, especially when considering the FX impact and puts us within our target book-to-bill range for both consulting and outsourcing. 
Taking a closer look at our quarter 2 bookings. An important theme was the continued strong demand for both digital-related services and operations. At the same time, we saw very good demand for both application services and consulting-related services. Another important characteristic was the broad-based nature of the uptick in new bookings with sequential improvement in bookings across all operating groups and all 3 geographic areas. Finally, we were pleased that we had a record 15 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which points to the strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive the most important initiatives on their agenda. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.49 billion, an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% local currency, reflecting a negative 6.5% foreign exchange impact compared to the negative 5% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the additional FX headwind, we came in well above the top end of our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, up 6% in USD and 13% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter, we saw consistent trends with our most recent quarters. The dominant drivers were strong double-digit growth in digital-related services, operations and application services. And it's also noteworthy that our results reflected an uptick in growth rates in both strategy and consulting services, which are now growing at mid-single digits. 
Turning to the operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology delivered another quarter of 15% growth, which continued to be broad-based with almost all dimensions growing double digits. The strongest growth drivers continue to be digital-related services, cost rationalization and several large transformational projects as well as increasing demand for network-related services. 
H&PS also grew 15% in the quarter. And the drivers continue to be very significant growth in our health business, particularly in the public sector, driven by our health exchange and Medicaid-related projects at U.S. federal and state clients. Digital-related services and operations, particularly in BPO, continue to be very significant drivers of growth as well. Products growth of 13% continue to reflect strong and balanced growth across all 3 geographic regions and most industries. Digital and cost optimization were significant areas of focus for clients in this operating group as well. Application services was also a driver as well as very strong overall growth in consulting. 
Financial Services grew 9%, led by strong growth in Europe and across all 3 industries, particularly in capital markets and insurance. Digital-related services continued to be a major theme as our clients are looking for new and innovative ways to connect with their customers and serve their needs. Additionally, cost optimization and risk and regulatory work continue to be significant areas of focus. Resources grew 6% with growth in all 3 geographic regions and all industries, except energy. Revenues were driven by growth in outsourcing across all energies -- all industries, including energy, as clients focus on operational efficiency and cost rationalization. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.9% compared with 31.3% for the same period last year, down 140 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7% of net revenues compared with 11.7% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down 100 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.6% of net revenues compared with 6.2% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down 60 basis points. Operating income was $1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.6% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with quarter 2 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% compared with an effective tax rate of 24% in the second quarter last year. Net income was $743 million for the second quarter compared with net income of $722 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.08 compared with EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter last year. This reflects a 5% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. They were 35 days, down from 37 days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $220 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $301 million, net of property and equipment additions of $82 million. As I mentioned in quarter 1, we shifted the timing of a portion of our compensation payments from quarter 1 to quarter 2. While this shift negatively impacted the second quarter, there is no impact to full year cash flow. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at February 28 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down $800 million as we've returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in the first half of fiscal '15. 
Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 323,000 people. We now have approximately 226,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 2, our utilization was 91%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14% compared to 13% in quarter 1 and 12% in the same period last year. Lastly, we continue to expect at least 90,000 people will join our company in fiscal '15. 
Turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 6.8 million shares for $601 million at an average price of $87.72 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 15.2 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion at an average price of $83.62 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Finally, as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.02 per share, representing a 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year. The dividend will be paid on May 15, 2015. 
So with 2 quarters in the books, we've delivered very strong results and feel positive about how we're positioned for the remainder of the year. That said, we don't take anything for granted. We continue to drive our business with rigor and discipline, doing everything possible to deliver a strong second half of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Pierre."

We are executing very well against our growth strategy and taking a leadership position in each of the businesses in our portfolio. The investments we've made in assets and solutions, in strategic acquisitions, in attracting talent and in building the skills and capabilities of our people has positioned us very well to capture new growth opportunities. We are driving innovation across Accenture to build capabilities that are both highly relevant to our clients and highly differentiated in the marketplace. 
You have heard me mention 2 important trends, digitization and rationalization, that are driving demand for our services and contributing to our growth. We invested ahead of the curve to build the capabilities that will help our clients respond to these trends. Digitization is all about helping our clients tap into new sources of value and new sources of revenue to create competitive advantage. We are helping clients capitalize on this trend to become the disruptors in the new digital world, not the disrupted. 
A great example is the work we are doing with a leading retailer, helping them envision entirely new ways to attract customers and achieve their goal of quadrupling revenue. We are bringing innovative digital technology to help them move beyond the traditional store model to a multichannel digital strategy. For a global telecommunications provider, we developed a digital strategy underpinned by analytics to significantly upgrade their customer service while delivering cost savings of almost $100 million. We are also working with our clients to develop innovative products and services based on the Internet of Things. We are helping Visa explore the future of mobile payments to make purchases more convenient even inside the car. 
Leveraging our expertise in digital commerce, we built a proof-of-concept to show how consumers in a connected car can order and pay forward securely. Digital services represent about 20% of our total revenues and grew more than 20% in local currency in the first half of the year. We are seeing demand for digital across all dimensions of the business in every industry and around the world. And we are clearly benefiting from the investment we have made in this space. 
In January, we acquired Structure, a Houston-based firm that will further enhance our smart grid operations, energy trading and risk management services for utilities and energy clients. In February, we announced the acquisition of Agilex Technologies, a provider of digital solutions for the U.S. federal government. The acquisition enhances our digital capabilities in analytics, cloud and mobility for federal agencies. And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Gapso, a Brazilian analytics firm that will expand our advanced analytics capabilities in the supply chain and logistic areas. 
The second theme, rationalization, continues to be top of mind for our clients as they look for opportunities to increase productivity and efficiency across their organizations. We have invested to take a leadership position in this space with Accenture Operations. And we are the first company to combine business process services with infrastructure and cloud services at scale. 
We are working with a leading global airline on a major transformation of its procurement function, including a cloud-based supplier portal. The airline expects to realize significant cost savings as well as increased normalization and transparency. We are helping a global beverage company create a global operating hub for finance and accounting, HR, procurement, supply chain and marketing operations. Our multi-tower BPO services will streamline processes, minimize risk and provide new analytical insights. And we are working with a leading European manufacturer to transform its IT infrastructure. We will migrate existing applications and data services across more than 60 operating companies into a single hybrid cloud environment. We expect to deliver improved services and flexibility, increase automation and a 30% reduction in operating costs. 
Now turning to the geographic dimension of our business. In the second quarter, we again delivered very strong growth across all 3 of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered revenue growth of 13% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in the United States, where we continue to perform extremely well. In Europe, we grew revenues 9% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in many of our largest markets, including France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. And in our growth markets, we grew revenues 12% in local currency with again strong double-digit growth in 3 of our largest markets: Japan, Australia and Brazil. 
So as you can see, we have delivered an excellent first half of this fiscal year. Our diverse portfolio of business, together with our geographic diversity and our unique ability to integrate our capabilities end-to-end positions us very well to bring innovative services to market-leading companies, both globally and locally. Looking ahead, based on the successful execution of our growth strategy, I feel confident in our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term, providing value to our clients, our people and our shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year '15. David, over to you."

For the third quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.6 billion.

For the third quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.6 billion. This assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 11% compared to third quarter of fiscal '14. For the full fiscal year '15, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX in our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 8% compared to fiscal '14. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '14. For the full fiscal year '15, we now expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $35 billion, reflecting our revised FX assumptions. 
Before I continue with our business outlook, I'd like to comment briefly on a noncash item that will be recorded in the third quarter. In May, we expect to record a noncash settlement charge estimated to be approximately $60 million as a result of a current offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. This will reduce future risk and administrative cost to Accenture. On a GAAP basis for fiscal '15, the estimated impact of this settlement charge is approximately 20 basis points to operating margin and approximately $0.05 in EPS. We will provide both GAAP and adjusted results for quarter 3 and year-to-date results. 
For operating margin, on a year-to-date -- on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal '15 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '14 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal '15 to be in the range of $4.66 to $4.76 or 3% to 5% growth over fiscal '14 results. Absent the higher FX headwind, which impacts EPS by $0.14, our EPS range would have increased $0.10 to $0.14 driven by higher revenue growth. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4.15 billion, reflecting our revised FX assumption. Property and equipment additions continue to be approximately $450 million and free cash flow now to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

And indeed, as we communicated recently and even these last years, we are embarked in rotating more of our business to what we are calling now digital-related services. Digital is pervasive across the board. This is something we anticipated frankly a few years ago, probably in the range of 29%, and we invested a lot ahead of the curve. You remember around what we are calling interactive, analytics, cloud and mobility. And now indeed, we have significantly benefited from this wave, which is very important. That's why I was very pleased and proud to report our position in terms of digital-related services now at 20% of Accenture revenues in that short period in time, and as important and even more important, well above 20% local currency growth for the first half of the year. So needless to say that we have a great momentum in that business. And indeed, it's covering a large variety of opportunities: small, medium, large, covering consulting or outsourcing type of work. So digital is pervasive across the different dimension of our businesses: consulting, outsourcing across all industries, they are more or less around this 20%, some above, a few slightly below. And on balance, I guess, David will comment good pricing."

And I mentioned that we had sequential growth across all 5 of our operating groups and all 3 geographic areas. And so I would say that there's not anything unique about the 15. And again we feel good about our pipeline going forward."

So that puts us on a track to the full year of probably mid- to high single for consulting again and low double digit for outsourcing. In terms of the profitability point, at the risk of being redundant, I guess, let me just share a few things with you beyond what I said in the script. First of all, we're very pleased with the 30 basis points of expansion. That obviously is at the upper end of the range that we target. And it does reflect a lot of the hard work that our organization has been doing over the last 4 quarters. What I really focus on when I look at our profitability are a few things. The first thing I focus on is the progression of our contract profitability. And I can tell you that our contract profitability was up compared to the same quarter last year and we continue to be pleased with the progression of contract profitability. The second thing that I look at is the overall -- the progression of the overall efficiency of our labor cost, both our Accenture personnel and our subcontractors. And we have made really good improvement in our labor cost efficiency for several quarters now. And that's in the mix as well when you look at our second quarter results. The third thing I look at is how our organization is doing in managing every dime we spend as if it's our own individually related to nonpayroll expenses. And we've done a very good job with that. And then finally, although this is certainly not last on the list, at the end of the day, we are seeking to create headroom in our P&L so that we can invest at sufficient levels to really drive our business growth going forward. And we have a good mix of investments in our results as well. And so we always are talking about -- in this forum, at least, we get questions on the gross margin and the SG&A. But those are the things that I really focus on. And all of those things were in the right zone relative to my expectations, creating the 30 basis points of expansion. The last thing I'll say is gross margin again includes a lot of things. It's not just contract profitability. It includes recruiting, training, integration of acquisitions, onboarding cost for new hires, et cetera. So there's a lot that goes in there that ebbs and flows quarter-over-quarter."

And the needs are much more around how we deal with uncertainty, how we deal with volatility, how we bring more flexible solution, how we provide more productivity and efficiency. And that's why we come with this. I'm being personally [ph] quite simple, but this really vision around at the end of the day, it's all going to be digitization of the business for clients on behalf of our clients and the rationalization of their operations. And then we significantly align the Accenture strategic agenda and our investments toward these 2 main trends. And as you know, and you've see that recently and we communicated a lot, we invested in new skills. We invested in new organization with the creation of Accenture Consulting, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations. We make several strategic acquisitions especially focusing on digital and operation. We've acquired very deep skills. We have more than 1,000 Ph.D. doing algorithm in analytics at Accenture. So this is what we did these last couple of years. And I guess that now we are getting the return on the strategy we set and on the investment we've made. We are absolutely not complacent with that. But to a great extent, we have seen a way, a path through to be relevant to our client. We committed to it. And now we are executing seamlessly."

And so at the end of the day, all 5 of our operating groups exceeded. So again it was broad-based. And I would say that it was more in our consulting-related services than our outsourcing.

But also we see more activity across our other consulting-type services, both strategy and our core consulting business, management consulting, et cetera.

We saw actually improvement in our pricing in the second quarter. I would be clear though that the environment continues to be a competitive environment, no doubt.

If you take chemical, which is a very important industry for us, we're growing more than 20%. So you need to look at this from a portfolio standpoint. From a European standpoint, I mean, you're absolutely right to mention that the outsourcing market is vibrant. Again our clients in Europe are looking for more efficiency and more productivity. And if I look at digital versus digitization versus rationalization, probably U.S. would be a bit more on digitization when Europe would be a bit more on rationalization, which is opening a good space for the outsourcing-related work. And again we benefit from the diversity of our Global Delivery Network. And we can come with our clients, and you're right to mention that you need to be sometime a little bit more balanced and subtle in the way you're driving outsourcing in Europe with respect to the different nationalities, labor markets and environment. And so the mix, it's more about the right sourcing and the smart sourcing with the good mix of onshore, offshore. And with benefit of Accenture of having a very diverse Global Delivery Network with, of course, resources on an offshore standpoint, especially in India and the Philippines, but as well a network of nearshore centers, which is helping us to get to what we believe is the right sourcing approach for our clients. So I'm feeling extremely confident. And based on the results, our outsourcing business in Europe is doing well.

We delivered excellent results for the third quarter, building on the momentum we created in the first half of the year. I'm particularly pleased that our strong third quarter performance was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business. 
We gained substantial market share and accelerated our growth in digital-related services. Here are a few highlights. 
We delivered strong new bookings of $8.5 billion, bringing us to $25.5 billion year-to-date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency with growth across all 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. 
We delivered earnings per share of $1.30 on an adjusted basis, a 3% increase. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 15.4% on an adjusted basis. We generated solid free cash flow of $1.3 billion, and our balance sheet remains very strong ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4 billion, and we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. So we have delivered very strong performance for the third quarter. And as we enter the fourth quarter, I feel very good about where we are and what we have achieved for the year-to-date. 
Now let me hand over to David for more details. Over to you, David."
972190,290568556,831027,"Accenture plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jun 25, 2015",2015-06-25,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thanks, Pierre, and thanks to you all for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, the strong momentum that we established in our business continued in the third quarter as we delivered excellent financial results. We're very pleased",1398,"Thanks, Pierre, and thanks to you all for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, the strong momentum that we established in our business continued in the third quarter as we delivered excellent financial results. We're very pleased with the ongoing execution of our growth strategy, underpinned by strong operational discipline. 
The underlying business drivers and key themes in the third quarter were very consistent with the past 2 quarters, and importantly, we again delivered on all 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value. Starting with durable revenue growth. Even with a tougher compare this quarter, we delivered 10% growth in local currency, which represents the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Once again, our broad-based growth demonstrates the strength of our diversified business and our ability to drive growth above the market, resulting in increased market share. 
With respect to sustainable operating margin expansion, we continue to drive value from our strong growth by expanding operating margin 20 basis points while continuing to invest in our business and our people. 
Then finally, regarding the strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow and returned roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We're on track to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And while we continue our disciplined approach of returning cash to shareholders, we also remain focused on investing in our business to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas. 
So we're very pleased with the third quarter as our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows. With that said, let's now turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $8.5 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were the second highest ever at $4.5 billion, reflecting a book to bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4 billion, also with a book to bill of 1.1. We were pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter, especially when you consider the significant headwind due to foreign exchange impacts. 
The major themes in our new bookings were consistent with last quarter. We saw continued strong demand for both digital-related services and operations and new bookings for application services and consulting-related services blended within our book-to-bill target range. 
Finally, we had 12 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, giving us 33 year-to-date, which signifies the unique and trusted relationship that we have with many of the largest companies in the world. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, slightly positive growth in U.S. dollars and an increase of 10% in local currency, reflecting a negative 10% foreign exchange impact compared to the negative 11% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the lower FX headwind, we still came in well above the top end of our guided range. 
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.1 billion, up 1% in USD and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 10% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. The trends we've seen in recent quarters remain very consistent. The dominant drivers were very strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and operations, application services continue to grow in a range consistent with our overall rate of growth, and strategy and consulting services combined continue to grow in mid-single digits. 
Turning to the operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology continued to lead all operating groups with 17% growth in the quarter. While growth continue to be broad-based, it was most significant in North America, the growth markets and communications globally. The drivers across CMT continue to be digital-related services, cost rationalization, several large transformational projects and demand for network-related services. 
H&PS grew 10% in the quarter. We again saw significant growth in our health business, particularly in the public sector at U.S. federal clients and our Medicaid-related projects at state clients. Digital-related services and operations, particularly BPO, were also strong growth drivers. 
Financial Services also grew 10% with significant growth in both capital markets and insurance. Clients continue to be focused on 3 main areas: risk and regulatory, cost optimization and digital-related services especially in distribution and marketing. 
Products grew by 8% led by very strong growth in consumer goods and services, life sciences and automotive. Clients continue to be focused on digital-related services and operational effectiveness as they position themselves to be more competitive in the marketplace. 
Resources grew 6%, continuing the recent trend of positive growth in all 3 geographic regions and all industries except energy, with particularly strong growth in utilities. The pattern of broad-based growth for outsourcing-related services continued as clients remain focused on operational efficiency and cost rationalization. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.5% compared with 32.8% for the same period last year, down 30 basis points. So the marketing expense for the quarter was 11.3% of net revenues compared with 11.6% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 30 basis points. 
General and administrative expense was 5.8% of net revenues compared with 5.9% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 10 basis points. 
As I mentioned in quarter 2, this quarter, we recorded a non-cash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. Pension Plan. This $64 million charge impacted quarter 3 operating margin by 80 basis points and diluted earnings per share by $0.06. 
The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $1.2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.4% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with the quarter 3 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared with an effective tax rate of 25% for the third quarter last year. 
Net income on an adjusted basis was $889 million for the third quarter compared with net income of $882 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $1.30 compared with EPS of $1.26 in the third quarter last year. This reflects a 3% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSO. Our days services outstanding continue to be industry-leading. There were 37 days, up from 35 days last quarter. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $114 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down $900 million as we returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends year-to-date. 
Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 336,000 people, and we now have approximately 237,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 3, our utilization was 90%, down from 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes voluntary terminations, was 15% compared to 14% in both quarter 2 and the same period last year. 
Lastly, we now expect that approximately 95,000 people would join our company in fiscal '15. 
So turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 5.6 million shares for $518 million at an average price of $93.11 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 20.8 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion at an average price of $86.16 per share. At May 31, we had approximately $3.2 billion of shares -- share repurchase authority remaining. 
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 15, 2015, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal '15 in the amount of $1.02 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. 
So with 3 quarters in the books, we're extremely pleased with our results and are now focused on quarter 4 and closing on a strong year. As always, we're working hard to continue to manage our business with a high degree of rigor and discipline, which enables us to deliver on our near-term objectives while also investing at scale for long-term market leadership. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our strong results for the quarter and year-to-date demonstrate that we are benefiting from the investment we've made in key growth areas such as digital, and I'm very pleased with the leadership position we are establishing in this important part of our business. 
In the third quarter, we delivered more than 30% growth in local currency in digital-related services, which now account for more than 20% of our total revenues. Demand for digital is pervasive across the entire business, and we're leveraging our digital capabilities in the services we provide to clients in every industry around the world. 
Here are a few examples. We are helping Pizza Hut build and operate a new club-based digital platform to transform the customer experience and boost online sales. The new platform will also enable Pizza Hut to expand its Digital Marketing capabilities through enhanced customer segmentation, analytics and mobility. 
We are working with the leading global shipbuilding company to deploy an Internet of Things connected platform to enable realtime monitoring of its shipping fleet. We will use over 100 different kinds of sensors to provide predictive maintenance and spare parts optimization. 
And we are helping Rio Tinto, the global mining company, accelerate its journey to become a digital business by migrating its enterprise IT systems to an as a service solution on the Accenture platform. Rio Tinto expect to realize significant cost savings as well as increased agility from the consumption-based pricing model. 
At the same time, we continue to invest to further differentiate Accenture and to scale our capabilities in order to capture new growth opportunities in the marketplace. In Accenture Strategy, we announced 2 acquisitions in the third quarter that further enhance our capabilities. We acquired Axia Limited, a U.S.-based strategy services provider with expertise in life sciences, health and consumer goods industries. 
And in May, we announced the acquisition of Javelin Group, a U.K.-based strategic consulting provider with significant digital expertise in the retail industry. 
In Accenture Digital, we are rapidly scaling our capabilities to bring innovative solutions to clients to enable digital transformation. Just last week, we announced that we are joining forces with Fast Retailing in Japan to develop digitally enabled consumer services across the retailer's 7 global brands, including UNIQLO. 
Through this joint initiative, we are developing new digital business models to drive transformation in the retail industry and beyond. 
We opened the Accenture Interactive Innovation Center at our technology lab in Sophia Antipolis in France. This is all about providing clients with immersive experience that brings to life the latest digital technologies for engaging with customers in new and innovative ways. 
We are expanding Fjord, the leading design and innovation group within Accenture Interactive. We recently opened new design studios in São Paulo, Milan and Sydney, and now we have 15 Fjord design studios around the world. 
And with Accenture mobility is now one of the world's leading developers of mobile apps. Leveraging the capabilities of our global delivery center, we have now developed over 1,000 apps across nearly all industries. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. In the third quarter, we delivered strong growth in local currency and gained significant market share across all 3 of our geographic regions. 
In North America, we delivered very strong 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by continued double-digit growth in the United States, where we are strengthening our positioning as the market leader. 
In Europe, I'm very pleased with our growth of 7% in local currency, driven primarily by Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. 
And in growth markets, we delivered very strong revenue growth of 13% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Japan, Australia and Brazil, our largest markets in this region. 
So with the first 3 quarters of the year behind us, I'm extremely pleased with our results. We have excellent momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are well positioned to deliver a very strong fiscal year '15. In a market environment that remain uncertain and fast-changing, innovation, agility and flexibility are more than ever the name of the game, and we remain extraordinarily focused on executing our strategy to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year '15. David, over to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.45 billion to $7.70 billion. This assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '14. 
For the full fiscal '15, based upon how rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 7.5% compared to fiscal '14. 
For the full fiscal '15, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '14. 
For the full fiscal '15, we continue to expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $35 billion. As I mentioned previously in May, we recorded a noncash settlement charge of $64 million, which will impact full year '15 operating margin by 20 basis points and diluted earnings per share by $0.06. Our guidance for full year fiscal '15 excludes this impact. 
For operating margin, on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal '15 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '14 results. 
On an adjusted basis, we continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in a range of 26% to 27%. 
For earnings per share on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal '15 to be in the range of $4.73 to $4.78 or 5% to 6% growth over fiscal '14 results. This EPS range includes a $0.02 increase due to the lower FX headwind and a $0.05 increase to the lower end of the range as a result of narrowing the revenue growth range.
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, property and equipment additions to now be approximately $400 million, and we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning this substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

Again, when I look at profitability, and I don't need to be redundant on this, but let me just restate the things that I focused on in the context of our quarter 3 results. So the first thing that I look at is the trend in our contract profitability, and we were pleased with our contract profitability. It was up year-over-year for both consulting and outsourcing, and it was up year-over-year in total, and that has an influencing factor on gross margin, but it's certainly not the only influencing factor. The second thing that I look at for our overall profitability is the evolution of our labor costs in relation to our revenue growth, and that pattern continued as we've seen in the first half of this year, where we were very pleased with being able to manage our labor cost efficiently. But I should add at the same time, investing in our people through actions that we took -- have taken through the year, including the third quarter with respect to promotions and salary increases. And then I'd really look at those 2 things primarily in the context of are those things progressing to the point that we're creating headroom so that we can invest in our business while at the same time, drive the profitability our GAAP margin expansion in this quarter, our adjusted margin expansion to support the objectives that we communicate externally, and all of those things happened as planned in the third quarter. So in terms of evolution of gross margin, Tien-tsin, as you know, we don't -- I don't really guide or make forward-looking statements on gross margin because we focus on operating margin. It does ebb and flow in different quarters across the year, but if we have the right evolution of contract profitability and the right evolution of our payroll efficiency, then frankly, that's -- everything is clicking from a profitability standpoint, and that's what we focus on."

If you look in terms of public sector, we've been among the first to launch the local exchange insurance centers, and you know how much it's important now. In federal, we recently invested in to bring more digital rich services in the context of our Federal business. So again for us, the name of the game is always the same.

So for the benefit of other listeners, there were 4 areas of focus for expanding our margins, both near-term and over a longer-term horizon. The first thing that I called out was our focus on managing each of the 5 dimensions. Pierre mentioned those",409,"Yes. So for the benefit of other listeners, there were 4 areas of focus for expanding our margins, both near-term and over a longer-term horizon. The first thing that I called out was our focus on managing each of the 5 dimensions. Pierre mentioned those earlier. I mentioned them in my script in a fit-for-purpose way, recognizing that each of those dimensions has a different economic profile from price points in the marketplace to the cost to serve points to how much we invest, management and overhead, et cetera. And on that front, we have made very good progress this year as we continue to take our organization up the maturity curve or the adoption curve for our new growth strategy and really reorienting how we manage and drive our business fundamentally around those 5 dimensions. And I see evidence of that, for example, in the way we approach pricing for our strategy services and our consulting services in a much more differentiated way than we would have been doing certainly a year ago, 18 months ago, 24 months ago as one example. So I think we're making good progress. The other thing I called out was leveraging our talent-based model, which is also aligned with these 5 dimensions as a way to manage our workforce, our talent and the associated market relevant labor costs in a more fit-for-purpose, more granular way, and everything we're doing to evolve how we manage our talent, how we develop careers and also how we do compensation management and planning is progressing nicely against that objective, and that certainly has been one of the contributing factors to our profitability so far. I mentioned portfolio optimization as a third area, again very -- we are making progress on that front in terms of raising the game of all of the P&L runners around Accenture so that they look at our business across the portfolio and are turning dollars to optimize the total by looking more discreetly at the individual pieces. And then underpinning all of that was our ongoing efforts in operational efficiency, the cost of running the organization. That includes, for example, our business management functions, finance, HR, marketing, and we have made very good progress this year across all of those functions in the efficiency of those organizations. So, Lisa, we're very pleased, a lot of work to do. It's ongoing, but we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far."

As you know, in Accenture, we're not using anymore or much more the terminology consulting and outsourcing, and that's something especially in the we will continue to comment on how we see the market and professional and business services. And when we created Accenture Operations, we're creating a very unique capability in the marketplace. I don't believe that anyone else has been building a similar capability. With 2 major capabilities in it, one which is around infrastructure services, where you will find as much consulting and outsourcing in it. So it's a combination of services from cloud-related services, leveraging the Accenture platform from high-value services in security and from, indeed, infrastructure outsourcing. And the other significant capability is going to be around business process management, if you will, where again we are providing business process more and more as a service, platform based in the cloud as an illustration. I'm thinking about what we're doing, which is extremely with procurement, where we are probably the first in the industry to provide procurement as a service platform base with an economic model on the consumption and on the transaction. So operation is, indeed, already combination of consulting and outsourcing, this is what you're going to see more and more in Accenture is the richness of the services we are providing will come from the integration of consulting and outsourcing services in a new economic model only platforms."

Again, let me direct you back to -- because I think it's important to just reinforce the dot connecting between the consulting and outsourcing and the 5 dimensions of our business. And again, as we introduced the 5 dimensions of our business at IA day, the reason we're moving in this direction is because this is reflective of where the market is moving, and so again, when you look at our 5 dimensions of strategy, consulting, app services and operations with digital across all 4, if you relate that back to consulting as a type of work, which we've talked about historically, that includes strategy, consulting and a part of application services to be clear. And if you look at outsourcing, that includes a part of application services and most of operations. And so we really think it's more helpful to talk about our business in the new dimension, and so again if you look at strategy and consulting as more of the traditionally consulting-centric part of our business that grew at mid-single digits again, which is a very good growth rate relative to the market. If you look at application services, which has components of consulting and outsourcing using our historical vernacular, systems integration Application Outsourcing, that grew mid-single digits. And the thing that's unique about Accenture in that space, as Pierre explained very clearly, is our ability to play across the spectrum of services within application services from the application maintenance side, which has one set of buyer values and economic profile to the deployment of technology, which is part of the application services markets space, which has a different set of buyer values and economic profile. That grew again roughly at the average of Accenture so in that 10% plus-or-minus range, and then when you look at operations, it was strong double digits, and so really when you think about our business and what's driving the growth, think about it in those terms because I think you'll find that to be most helpful."

Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.

We delivered excellent results for the third quarter, building on the momentum we created in the first half of the year. I'm particularly pleased that our strong third quarter performance was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business. We gained substantial market share and accelerated our growth in digital-related services. Here are a few highlights. 
We delivered strong new bookings of $8.5 billion, bringing us to $25.5 billion year-to-date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency with growth across all 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. We delivered earnings per share of $1.30 on an adjusted basis, a 3% increase. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 15.4% on an adjusted basis. We generated solid free cash flow of $1.3 billion and our balance sheet remains very strong, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4 billion, and we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So we have delivered very strong performance for the third quarter. And as we enter the fourth quarter, I feel very good about where we are and what we have achieved for the year-to-date. Now let me hand over to David for more details. Over to you, David."
972190,290568556,831076,"Accenture plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jun 25, 2015",2015-06-25,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thanks, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, the strong momentum that we established in our business continued in the third quarter as we delivered excellent financial results. We're very plea",1393,"Thanks, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, the strong momentum that we established in our business continued in the third quarter as we delivered excellent financial results. We're very pleased with the ongoing execution of our growth strategy, underpinned by strong operational discipline. The underlying business drivers and key themes in the third quarter were very consistent with the past 2 quarters. And importantly, we again delivered on all 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value. 
Starting with durable revenue growth. Even with a tougher compare this quarter, we delivered 10% growth in local currency, which represents the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Once again, our broad-based growth demonstrates the strength of our diversified business and our ability to drive growth above the market, resulting in increased market share. With respect to sustainable operating margin expansion, we continue to drive value from our strong growth by expanding operating margin 20 basis points while continuing to invest in our business and our people. And finally, regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow and returned roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. 
We're on track to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And while we continue our disciplined approach of returning cash to shareholders, we also remain focused on investing in our business to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas. So we're very pleased with the third quarter as our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows. With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $8.5 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were the second highest ever at $4.5 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter, especially when you consider the significant headwind due to foreign exchange impacts. The major themes in our new bookings were consistent with last quarter. We saw continued strong demand for both digital-related services and operations and new bookings for application services and consulting-related services landed within our book-to-bill target range. Finally, we had 12 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, giving us 33 year-to-date, which signifies the unique and trusted relationship that we have with many of the largest companies in the world. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, slightly positive growth in U.S. dollars and an increase of 10% in local currency, reflecting a negative 10% foreign exchange impact compared to the negative 11% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the lower FX headwind, we still came in well above the top end of our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.1 billion, up 1% in USD and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 10% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. The trends we've seen in recent quarters remain very consistent. The dominant drivers were very strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and operations, application services continued to grow in a range consistent with our overall rate of growth and strategy and consulting services combined continued to grow in mid-single digits. 
Turning to the operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology continued to lead all operating groups with 17% growth in the quarter. While growth continued to be broad-based, it was most significant in North America, the growth markets in communications globally. The drivers across CMT continued to be digital-related services, cost rationalization, several large transformational projects and demand for network-related services. 
H&PS grew 10% in the quarter. We again saw significant growth in our health business, particularly in the public sector at U.S. federal clients and our Medicaid-related projects at state clients. Digital-related services and operations, particularly BPO, were also strong growth drivers. Financial Services also grew 10% with significant growth in both capital markets and insurance. Clients continued to be focused on 3 main areas: risk and regulatory, cost optimization and digital-related services, especially in distribution and marketing. 
Products grew by 8% led by very strong growth in consumer goods and services, life sciences and automotive. Clients continued to be focused on digital-related services and operational effectiveness as they position themselves to be more competitive in the marketplace. Resources grew 6%, continuing the recent trend of positive growth in all 3 geographic regions and all industries except energy, with particularly strong growth in utilities. The pattern of broad-based growth for outsourcing-related services continued as clients remain focused on operational efficiency and cost rationalization. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.5% compared with 32.8% for the same period last year, down 30 basis points. So the marketing expense for the quarter was 11.3% of net revenues compared with 11.6% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 30 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.8% of net revenues compared with 5.9% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 10 basis points. 
As I mentioned in quarter 2, this quarter, we recorded a noncash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. This $64 million charge impacted quarter 3 operating margin by 80 basis points and diluted earnings per share by $0.06. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Operating income on an adjusted basis was $1.2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.4% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 3 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared with an effective tax rate of 25% for the third quarter last year. Net income on an adjusted basis was $889 million for the third quarter compared with net income of $882 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $1.30 compared with EPS of $1.26 in the third quarter last year. This reflects a 3% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSO. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. They were 37 days, up from 35 days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $114 million. Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down $900 million as we returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends year-to-date. 
Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 336,000 people and we now have approximately 237,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 3, our utilization was 90%, down from 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 15% compared to 14% in both quarter 2 and the same period last year. Lastly, we now expect that approximately 95,000 people will join our company in fiscal '15. 
So turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 5.6 million shares for $518 million at an average price of $93.11 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 20.8 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion at an average price of $86.16 per share. At May 31, we had approximately $3.2 billion of shares -- share repurchase authority remaining. Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 15, 2015, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal '15 in the amount of $1.02 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. 
So with 3 quarters in the books, we're extremely pleased with our results and are now focused on quarter 4 and closing on a strong year. As always, we're working hard to continue to manage our business with a high degree of rigor and discipline, which enables us to deliver on our near-term objectives while also investing at scale for long-term market leadership. Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our strong results for the quarter and year-to-date demonstrate that we are benefiting from the investment we've made in key growth areas, such as digital. And I'm very pleased with the leadership position we are establishing in this important part of our business. In the third quarter, we delivered more than 30% growth in local currency in digital-related services, which now account for more than 20% of our total revenues. Demand for digital is pervasive across the entire business and we are leveraging our digital capabilities in the services we provide to clients in every industry around the world. 
Here are a few examples. We are helping Pizza Hut build and operate a new cloud-based digital platform to transform the customer experience and boost online sales. The new platform will also enable Pizza Hut to expand its digital marketing capabilities through enhanced customer segmentation, analytics and mobility. We are working with a leading global shipbuilding company to deploy an Internet of Things connected platform to enable real-time monitoring of its shipping fleet. We will use over 100 different kinds of sensors to provide predictive maintenance and spare parts optimization. And we are helping Río Tinto, the global mining company, accelerate its journey to become a digital business by migrating its enterprise IT systems to an as-a-service solution on the Accenture Cloud platform. Río Tinto expects to realize significant cost savings as well as increased agility from the consumption-based pricing model. 
At the same time, we continue to invest to further differentiate Accenture and to scale our capabilities in order to capture new growth opportunities in the marketplace. In Accenture Strategy, we announced 2 acquisitions in the third quarter that further enhanced our capabilities. We acquired Axia Limited, a U.S.-based strategy services provider with expertise in life sciences, health and consumer goods industries. And in May, we announced the acquisition of the Javelin Group, a U.K.-based strategy consulting provider with significant digital expertise in the retail industry. 
In Accenture Digital, we are rapidly scaling our capabilities to bring innovative solutions to clients to enable digital transformation. Just last week, we announced that we are joining forces with Fast Retailing in Japan to develop digitally enabled consumer services across the retailer's 7 global brands, including UNIQLO. Through this joint initiative, we are developing new digital business models to drive transformation in the retail industry and beyond. 
We opened the Accenture Interactive Innovation Center at our technology lab in Sophia Antipolis in France. This is all about providing clients with an immersive experience that brings to life the latest digital technologies for engaging with customers in new and innovative ways. We are expanding Fjord, the leading design and innovation group within Accenture Interactive. We recently opened new design studios in São Paulo, Milan and Sydney, and now we have 15 Fjord design studios around the world. And with Accenture Mobility is now one of the world's leading developers of mobile apps. Leveraging the capabilities of our global delivery center, we have now developed over 1,000 apps across nearly all industries. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. In the third quarter, we delivered strong growth in local currency and gained significant market share across all 3 of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered very strong 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by continued double-digit growth in the United States, where we are strengthening our positioning as the market leader. In Europe, I'm very pleased with our growth of 7% in local currency, driven primarily by Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. And in growth markets, we delivered very strong revenue growth of 13% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Japan, Australia and Brazil, our largest markets in this region. 
So with the first 3 quarters of the year behind us, I'm extremely pleased with our results. We have excellent momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are well positioned to deliver a very strong fiscal year '15. In a market environment that remain uncertain and fast-changing, innovation, agility and flexibility are more than ever the name of the game, and we remain extraordinarily focused on executing our strategy to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year '15. David, over to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.45 billion to $7.70 billion. This assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '14. For the full fiscal '15, based upon how rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 7.5% compared to fiscal '14. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '14. 
For the full fiscal '15, we continue to expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $35 billion. As I mentioned previously in May, we recorded a noncash settlement charge of $64 million, which will impact full year '15 operating margin by 20 basis points and diluted earnings per share by $0.06. Our guidance for full year fiscal '15 excludes this impact. 
For operating margin on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal '15 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '14 results. On an adjusted basis, we continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in a range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal '15 to be in the range of $4.73 to $4.78 or 5% to 6% growth over fiscal '14 results. This EPS range includes a $0.02 increase due to the lower FX headwind and a $0.05 increase to the lower end of the range as a result of narrowing the revenue growth range.
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, property and equipment additions to now be approximately $400 million and we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning this substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

Again, when I look at profitability -- and I don't mean to be redundant on this, but let me just restate the things that I focus on in the context of our quarter 3 results. So the first thing that I look at is the trend in our contract profitability, and we were pleased with our contract profitability. It was up year-over-year for both consulting and outsourcing and it was up year-over-year in total. And that has an influencing factor on gross margin, but it's certainly not the only influencing factor. The second thing that I look at for our overall profitability is the evolution of our labor costs in relation to our revenue growth. And that pattern continued as we've seen in the first half of this year, where we were very pleased with being able to manage our labor cost efficiently. But I should add, at the same time, investing in our people through actions that we took -- have taken through the year, including in the third quarter with respect to promotions and salary increases. And then I really look at those 2 things primarily in the context of are those things progressing to the point that we're creating headroom so that we can invest in our business while at the same time, drive the profitability, our GAAP margin expansion, in this quarter, our adjusted margin expansion to support the objectives that we communicate externally? And all of those things happened as planned in the third quarter. So in terms of evolution of gross margin, Tien-tsin, as you know, we don't -- I don't really guide or make forward-looking statements on gross margin because we focus on operating margin. It does ebb and flow in different quarters across the year. But if we have the right evolution of contract profitability and the right evolution of our payroll efficiency, then frankly that's -- everything is clicking from a profitability standpoint, and that's what we focus on."

So we have become very experienced in executing our inorganic strategy. And an important part of that is the approach that we take to integrating and assimilating the companies that we buy. And we're fundamentally a people-based business, so we're especially tuned into that with respect to integrating and assimilating the people in these companies that we acquire. And our experience has been positive in terms of the retention and assimilating them into our culture very quickly. And again, as we've mentioned before, the financial returns had been certainly in line with our expectations and in many cases, better."

And we will continue to do so and look at the kind of acquisition we believe we could get an excellent return and that are going to further improve our differentiation, our competitiveness and our relevance in the business. And so far, frankly, I'm very pleased. I found even David a bit neutral on this, less neutral. I think we have an excellent return on the investment we made. It is making an impact in the marketplace. I'm thinking about Fjord, I'm thinking about Acuity, I'm thinking about Procurian, where clearly we are taking leading position in these different areas, not only we have a good retention, but we are scaling further the acquisition we made. I announced in this call that we are significantly and rapidly scaling Fjord, our design and innovation studio in Accenture Interactive, where we are now 15 design studio around the world and more to come.

In health care, we decided to be extremely digital-rich by being among the first to deliver digital health record, connected health care and a very significant differentiation in health care. If you look in terms of public sector, we've been among the first to launch the local exchange insurance centers, and you know how much it's important now. In federal, we recently invested in Agilex to bring more digital-rich services in the context of our federal business. So again for us, the name of the game is always the same.

So all our job with our clients is to look at this application services and to make sure that the money, if you will, they are saving in application maintenance and development through leveraging offshore, through productivity, through automation, which we provide a lot, will be reinvested in capability building and new technology solution.

So for the benefit of other listeners, there were 4 areas of focus for expanding our margins, both near-term and over a longer-term horizon. The first thing that I called out was our focus on managing each of the 5 dimensions. Pierre mentioned those earlier, I mentioned them in my script in a fit-for-purpose way, recognizing that each of those dimensions has a different economic profile from the price points in the marketplace to the cost-to-serve points to how much we invest, management and overhead, et cetera. And on that front, we have made very good progress this year as we continue to take our organization up the maturity curve or the adoption curve for our new growth strategy and really reorienting how we manage and drive our business fundamentally around those 5 dimensions. And I see evidence of that, for example, in the way we approach pricing for our strategy services and our consulting services in a much more differentiated way than we would have been doing certainly a year ago, 18 months ago, 24 months ago as one example. So I think we're making good progress. The other thing I called out was leveraging our talent-based model, which is also aligned with these 5 dimensions as a way to manage our workforce, our talent and the associated market-relevant labor costs in a more fit-for-purpose, more granular way. And everything we're doing to evolve how we manage our talent, how we develop careers and also how we do compensation management and planning is progressing nicely against that objective, and that certainly has been one of the contributing factors to our profitability so far. I mentioned portfolio optimization as a third area. Again very -- we are making progress on that front in terms of raising the game of all of the P&L runners around Accenture so that they look at our business across the portfolio and are turning dials to optimize the total by looking more discreetly at the individual pieces. And then underpinning all of that was our ongoing efforts in operational efficiency, the cost of running the organization. That includes, for example, our business management functions, finance, HR, marketing. And we have made very good progress this year across all of those functions in the efficiency of those organizations. So Lisa, we're very pleased. A lot of work to do, it's ongoing, but we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far."

And I'm pleased to have a couple of minutes to mention the good progress and the positioning we're taking on operations. As you know, in Accenture, we're not using any more or much more the terminology consulting and outsourcing. And that's something, especially in the IA Day, we will continue to comment on how we see the market in professional and business services evolving. And when we created Accenture Operations, we're creating a very unique capability in the marketplace. I don't believe that anyone else has been building a similar capability with 2 major capabilities in it, one which is around infrastructure services, where you will find as much consulting and outsourcing in it. So it's a combination of services from cloud-related services leveraging the Accenture Cloud platform from high-value services in security and from, indeed, infrastructure outsourcing. And the other significant capability is going to be around business process management, if you will, where again we are providing business process more and more as a service, platform-based in the cloud. As an illustration, think about what we are doing, which is extremely leading edge with procurement, where we are probably the first in the industry to provide procurement as a service, platform-based with an economic model on the consumption and on the [indiscernible] transaction. So operation is, indeed, already a combination of consulting and outsourcing. And this is what you're going to see more and more in Accenture is the richness of the services we are providing will come from the integration of consulting and outsourcing services in a new economic model on leading-edge platforms."

Again, let me direct you back to -- because I think it's important to just reinforce the dot connecting between the consulting and outsourcing and the 5 dimensions of our business. And again, as we introduced the 5 dimensions of our business at IA Day, the reason we're moving in this direction is because this is reflective of where the market is moving. And so again, when you look at our 5 dimensions of strategy, consulting, app services and operations with digital across all 4, if you relate that back to consulting as a type of work, which we've talked about historically, that includes strategy, consulting and a part of application services to be clear. And if you look at outsourcing, that includes a part of application services and most of operations. And so we really think that it's more helpful to talk about our business in the new dimension. And so again, if you look at strategy and consulting as more of the traditionally consulting-centric part of our business, that grew at mid-single digits again, which is a very good growth rate relative to the market. If you look at application services, which has components of consulting and outsourcing using our historical vernacular, systems integration and application outsourcing, that grew mid-single digits. And the thing that's unique about Accenture in that space, as Pierre explained very clearly, is our ability to play across the spectrum of services within application services from the application maintenance side, which has one set of buyer values and economic profile to the deployment of technology, which is part of the application services market space, which has a different set of buyer values and economic profile. That grew again roughly at the average of Accenture, so in that 10% plus-or-minus range. And then when you look at operations, it was strong double digits. And so really when you think about our business and what's driving the growth, think about it in those terms because I think you'll find that to be most helpful."

So I'm not surprised at all with the return we have made on Gianfranco's investments, if you will. And we have growth in Japan, Australia, in Brazil. Part of the growth in Brazil, of course, is the recovery, is probably a kind of catch-up. But now we are beyond the catch-up mode. And I guess, what we see in Brazil, likewise the other markets, is how our strategy of rotating the Accenture business to be more digital-rich and cloud services-rich, what we tend now to call the new, if you will, is paying off. So again, all the markets, they have a potential if you find the right entry point.

I'm particularly pleased that our strong third quarter performance was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business. We gained substantial market share and accelerated our growth in digital-related services. Here are a few highlights. 
We delivered strong new bookings of $8.5 billion, bringing us to $25.5 billion year-to-date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency, with growth across all 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. We delivered earnings per share of $1.30 on an adjusted basis, a 3% increase. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 15.4% on an adjusted basis. We generated solid free cash flow of $1.3 billion and our balance sheet remains very strong, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4 billion, and we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So we have delivered very strong performance for the third quarter. And as we enter the fourth quarter, I feel very good about where we are and what we have achieved for the year-to-date. Now let me hand over to David for more details. Over to you, David."
972190,290568556,831148,"Accenture plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jun 25, 2015",2015-06-25,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thanks, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, the strong momentum that we established in our business continued in the third quarter as we delivered excellent financial results. We're very plea",1394,"Thanks, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, the strong momentum that we established in our business continued in the third quarter as we delivered excellent financial results. We're very pleased with the ongoing execution of our growth strategy, underpinned by strong operational discipline. The underlying business drivers and key themes in the third quarter were very consistent with the past 2 quarters. And importantly, we again delivered on all 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value. 
Starting with durable revenue growth. Even with a tougher compare this quarter, we delivered 10% growth in local currency, which represents the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Once again, our broad-based growth demonstrates the strength of our diversified business and our ability to drive growth above the market, resulting in increased market share. With respect to sustainable operating margin expansion, we continue to drive value from our strong growth by expanding operating margin 20 basis points while continuing to invest in our business and our people. And finally, regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow and returned roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. 
We're on track to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And while we continue our disciplined approach of returning cash to shareholders, we also remain focused on investing in our business to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas. So we're very pleased with the third quarter, as our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows. With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $8.5 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were the second highest ever at $4.5 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter, especially when you consider the significant headwind due to foreign exchange impacts. The major themes in our new bookings were consistent with last quarter. We saw continued strong demand for both digital-related services and operations and new bookings for application services and consulting-related services landed within our book-to-bill target range. Finally, we had 12 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, giving us 33 year-to-date, which signifies the unique and trusted relationship that we have with many of the largest companies in the world. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, slightly positive growth in U.S. dollars and an increase of 10% in local currency, reflecting a negative 10% foreign exchange impact, compared to the negative 11% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the lower FX headwind, we still came in well above the top end of our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.1 billion, up 1% in USD and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 10% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. The trends we've seen in recent quarters remain very consistent. The dominant drivers were very strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and operations, application services continued to grow in a range consistent with our overall rate of growth and strategy and consulting services combined continued to grow in mid-single digits. 
Turning to the operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology continued to lead all operating groups with 17% growth in the quarter. While growth continued to be broad-based, it was most significant in North America and the growth markets in communications globally. The drivers across CMT continued to be digital-related services, cost rationalization, several large transformational projects and demand for network-related services. 
H&PS grew 10% in the quarter. We again saw significant growth in our health business, particularly in the public sector at U.S. federal clients and our Medicaid-related projects at state clients. Digital-related services and operations, particularly BPO, were also strong growth drivers. Financial Services also grew 10%, with significant growth in both capital markets and insurance. Clients continued to be focused on 3 main areas: risk and regulatory; cost optimization; and digital-related services, especially in distribution and marketing. 
Products grew by 8% led by very strong growth in consumer goods and services, life sciences and automotive. Clients continued to be focused on digital-related services and operational effectiveness as they position themselves to be more competitive in the marketplace. Resources grew 6%, continuing the recent trend of positive growth in all 3 geographic regions and all industries except energy, with particularly strong growth in utilities. The pattern of broad-based growth for outsourcing-related services continued, as clients remain focused on operational efficiency and cost rationalization. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.5%, compared with 32.8% for the same period last year, down 30 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.3% of net revenues, compared with 11.6% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 30 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.8% of net revenues, compared with 5.9% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 10 basis points. 
As I mentioned in quarter 2, this quarter, we recorded a noncash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. This $64 million charge impacted quarter 3 operating margin by 80 basis points and diluted earnings per share by $0.06. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Operating income on an adjusted basis was $1.2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.4% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 3 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, compared with an effective tax rate of 25% for the third quarter last year. Net income on an adjusted basis was $889 million for the third quarter, compared with net income of $882 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $1.30, compared with EPS of $1.26 in the third quarter last year. This reflects a 3% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSO. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. They were 37 days, up from 35 days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $114 million. Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $4 billion, compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down $900 million as we returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends year-to-date. 
Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 336,000 people and we now have approximately 237,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 3, our utilization was 90%, down from 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 15% compared to 14% in both quarter 2 and the same period last year. Lastly, we now expect that approximately 95,000 people will join our company in fiscal '15. 
So turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 5.6 million shares for $518 million at an average price of $93.11 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 20.8 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion at an average price of $86.16 per share. At May 31, we had approximately $3.2 billion of shares -- share repurchase authority remaining. Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 15, 2015, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal '15 in the amount of $1.02 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. 
So with 3 quarters in the books, we're extremely pleased with our results and are now focused on quarter 4 and closing on a strong year. As always, we're working hard to continue to manage our business with a high degree of rigor and discipline, which enables us to deliver on our near-term objectives while also investing at scale for long-term market leadership. Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our strong results for the quarter and year-to-date demonstrate that we are benefiting from the investment we've made in key growth areas, such as digital. And I'm very pleased with the leadership position we are establishing in this important part of our business. In the third quarter, we delivered more than 30% growth in local currency in digital-related services, which now account for more than 20% of our total revenues. Demand for digital is pervasive across the entire business and we are leveraging our digital capabilities in the services we provide to clients in every industry around the world. 
Here are a few examples. We are helping Pizza Hut build and operate a new cloud-based digital platform to transform the customer experience and boost online sales. The new platform will also enable Pizza Hut to expand its digital marketing capabilities through enhanced customer segmentation, analytics and mobility. We are working with a leading global shipbuilding company to deploy an Internet of Things connected platform to enable real-time monitoring of its shipping fleet. We will use over 100 different kinds of sensors to provide predictive maintenance and spare parts optimization. And we are helping Río Tinto, the global mining company, accelerate its journey to become a digital business by migrating its enterprise IT systems to an as-a-service solution on the Accenture Cloud platform. Río Tinto expects to realize significant cost savings as well as increased agility from the consumption-based pricing model. 
At the same time, we continue to invest to further differentiate Accenture and to scale our capabilities in order to capture new growth opportunities in the marketplace. In Accenture Strategy, we announced 2 acquisitions in the third quarter that further enhance our capabilities. We acquired Axia Limited, a U.S.-based strategy services provider with expertise in life sciences, health and consumer goods industries. And in May, we announced the acquisition of the Javelin Group, a U.K.-based strategy consulting provider with significant digital expertise in the retail industry. 
In Accenture Digital, we are rapidly scaling our capabilities to bring innovative solutions to clients to enable digital transformation. Just last week, we announced that we are joining forces with Fast Retailing in Japan to develop digitally enabled consumer services across the retailer's 7 global brands, including UNIQLO. Through this joint initiative, we are developing new digital business models to drive transformation in the retail industry and beyond. 
We opened the Accenture Interactive Innovation Center at our technology lab in Sophia Antipolis in France. This is all about providing clients with an immersive experience that brings to life the latest digital technologies for engaging with customers in new and innovative ways. We are expanding Fjord, the leading design and innovation group within Accenture Interactive. We recently opened new design studios in São Paulo, Milan and Sydney, and now we have 15 Fjord design studios around the world. And with Accenture Mobility, is now one of the world's leading developers of mobile apps. Leveraging the capabilities of our global delivery center, we have now developed over 1,000 apps across nearly all industries. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. In the third quarter, we delivered strong growth in local currency and gained significant market share across all 3 of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered very strong 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by continued double-digit growth in the United States, where we are strengthening our positioning as the market leader. In Europe, I'm very pleased with our growth of 7% in local currency, driven primarily by Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. And in growth markets, we delivered very strong revenue growth of 13% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Japan, Australia and Brazil, our largest markets in this region. 
So with the first 3 quarters of the year behind us, I'm extremely pleased with our results. We have excellent momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are well positioned to deliver a very strong fiscal year '15. In a market environment that remains uncertain and fast-changing, innovation, agility and flexibility are more than ever the name of the game, and we remain extraordinarily focused on executing our strategy to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year '15. David, over to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.45 billion to $7.70 billion. This assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '14. For the full fiscal '15, based upon how rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 7.5% compared to fiscal '14. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '14. 
For the full fiscal '15, we continue to expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $35 billion. As I mentioned previously in May, we recorded a noncash settlement charge of $64 million, which will impact full year '15 operating margin by 20 basis points and diluted earnings per share by $0.06. Our guidance for full year fiscal '15 excludes this impact. 
For operating margin on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal '15 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '14 results. On an adjusted basis, we continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in a range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal '15 to be in the range of $4.73 to $4.78 or 5% to 6% growth over fiscal '14 results. This EPS range includes a $0.02 increase due to the lower FX headwind and a $0.05 increase to the lower end of the range as a result of narrowing the revenue growth range.
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '15, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, property and equipment additions to now be approximately $400 million and we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2%, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

So the first thing that I look at is the trend in our contract profitability, and we were pleased with our contract profitability. It was up year-over-year for both consulting and outsourcing and it was up year-over-year in total. And that has an influencing factor on gross margin, but it's certainly not the only influencing factor. The second thing that I look at for our overall profitability is the evolution of our labor costs in relation to our revenue growth. And that pattern continued as we've seen in the first half of this year, where we were very pleased with being able to manage our labor cost efficiently. But I should add, at the same time, investing in our people through actions that we took -- have taken through the year, including in the third quarter with respect to promotions and salary increases. And then I really look at those 2 things primarily in the context of are those things progressing to the point that we're creating headroom so that we can invest in our business while at the same time drive the profitability or GAAP margin expansion, and this quarter, our adjusted margin expansion, to support the objectives that we communicate externally? And all of those things happened as planned in the third quarter. So in terms of evolution of gross margin, Tien-tsin, as you know, we don't -- I don't really guide or make forward-looking statements on gross margin because we focus on operating margin. It does ebb and flow in different quarters across the year. But if we have the right evolution of contract profitability and the right evolution of our payroll efficiency, then frankly, that's -- everything is clicking from a profitability standpoint, and that's what we focus on."

In health care, we decided to be extremely digital-rich by being among the first to deliver digital health record, connected health care and a very significant differentiation in health care. If you look in terms of public sector, we've been among the first to launch the local exchange insurance centers, and you know how much it's important now. In federal, we recently invested in Agilex to bring more digital-rich services in the context of our federal business. So again for us, the name of the game is always the same.

Pierre mentioned those",407,"Yes, so for the benefit of other listeners, there were 4 areas of focus for expanding our margins, both near-term and over a longer-term horizon. The first thing that I called out was our focus on managing each of the 5 dimensions. Pierre mentioned those earlier, I mentioned them in my script, in a fit-for-purpose way, recognizing that each of those dimensions has a different economic profile, from the price points in the marketplace to the cost-to-serve points, to how much we invest, management and overhead, et cetera. And on that front, we have made very good progress this year as we continue to take our organization up the maturity curve or the adoption curve for our new growth strategy and really reorienting how we manage and drive our business fundamentally around those 5 dimensions. And I see evidence of that, for example, in the way we approach pricing for our strategy services and our consulting services in a much more differentiated way than we would have been doing certainly a year ago, 18 months ago, 24 months ago, as one example. So I think we're making good progress. The other thing I called out was leveraging our talent-based model, which is also aligned with these 5 dimensions, as a way to manage our workforce, our talent and the associated market-relevant labor costs in a more fit-for-purpose, more granular way. And everything we're doing to evolve how we manage our talent, how we develop careers and also how we do compensation management and planning is progressing nicely against that objective, and that certainly has been one of the contributing factors to our profitability so far. I mentioned portfolio optimization as a third area. Again, very -- we are making progress on that front in terms of raising the game of all of the P&L runners around Accenture so that they look at our business across the portfolio and are turning dials to optimize the total by looking more discretely at the individual pieces. And then underpinning all of that was our ongoing efforts in operational efficiency, the cost of running the organization. That includes, for example, our business management functions, finance, HR, marketing. And we have made very good progress this year across all of those functions and the efficiency of those organizations. So Lisa, we're very pleased, a lot of work to do, it's ongoing, but we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far."

And I'm pleased to have a couple of minutes to mention the good progress and the positioning we're taking on operations. As you know, in Accenture, we're not using any more or much more the terminology consulting and outsourcing. And that's something, especially in the IA Day, we will continue to comment on how we see the market in professional and business services evolving. And when we created Accenture Operations, we're creating a very unique capability in the marketplace. I don't believe that anyone else has been building a similar capability with 2 major capabilities in it, one which is around infrastructure services, where you will find as much consulting and outsourcing in it. So it's a combination of services from cloud-related services leveraging the Accenture Cloud platform, from high-value services in security and from, indeed, infrastructure outsourcing. And the other significant capability is going to be around business process management, if you will, where again, we are providing business process more and more as a service, platform-based in the cloud. As an illustration, think about what we are doing, which is extremely leading edge with procurement, where we are probably the first in the industry to provide procurement as a service, platform-based, with an economic model on the consumption and on the per transaction. So operation is, indeed, already a combination of consulting and outsourcing. And this is what you're going to see more and more in Accenture, is the richness of the services we are providing will come from the integration of consulting and outsourcing services in a new economic model on leading-edge platforms."

Again, let me direct you back to -- because I think it's important to just reinforce the dot-connecting between the consulting and outsourcing and the 5 dimensions of our business. And again, as we introduced the 5 dimensions of our business at IA Day, the reason we're moving in this direction is because this is reflective of where the market is moving. And so again, when you look at our 5 dimensions of strategy, consulting, app services and operations, with digital across all 4, if you relate that back to consulting as a type of work, which we've talked about historically, that includes strategy, consulting and a part of application services, to be clear. And if you look at outsourcing, that includes a part of application services and most of operations. And so we really think that it's more helpful to talk about our business in the new dimensions. And so again, if you look at strategy and consulting as more of the traditionally consulting-centric part of our business, that grew at mid-single digits again, which is a very good growth rate relative to the market. If you look at application services, which has components of consulting and outsourcing, using our historical vernacular, systems integration and application outsourcing, that grew mid-single digits. And the thing that's unique about Accenture in that space, as Pierre explained very clearly, is our ability to play across the spectrum of services within application services, from the application maintenance side, which has one set of buyer values and economic profile, to the deployment of technology, which is part of the application services market space, which has a different set of buyer values and economic profile. That grew again roughly at the average of Accenture, so in that 10% plus-or-minus range. And then when you look at operations, it was strong double digits. And so really, when you think about our business and what's driving the growth, think about it in those terms, because I think you'll find that to be most helpful."

We continue to see a nice chunk of our bookings, so the bookings in the quarter, a nice chunk of that, that will convert to revenue in the next 4 quarters.

Part of the growth in Brazil, of course, is the recovery, is probably a kind of catch-up. But now we are beyond the catch-up mode.

We are extremely pleased with our very strong financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Our excellent fourth quarter performance continues the momentum we have been building in our business all year. 
For the full year, we delivered strong new bookings, generated record revenues, grew EPS faster than revenues and generated strong free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in our business and delivering significant value for clients and shareholder. 
Here are a few highlights for the year. 
We delivered very strong new bookings of $34.4 billion. We grew revenues 11% in local currency to a record $31 billion. Our growth was broad-based across the business, including double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. We delivered earnings per share of $4.82 on an adjusted basis, a 7% increase. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 14.5% on an adjusted basis. We generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We returned $3.8 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, an 8% increase over our prior dividend. 
So I feel very good about what we delivered in fiscal year '15. Our outstanding performance clearly demonstrates that we continue to provide highly relevant and differentiated services to our clients. 
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you."

Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter 4, which culminated an extremely strong year for Accenture. Once again, our results reflect",1479,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. 
Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter 4, which culminated an extremely strong year for Accenture. Once again, our results reflect our unique position in the marketplace, the relevance of our growth strategy and our ability to drive our business to produce value for our clients, our people and our shareholders. As you listen to our prepared remarks, you'll hear continued consistency in the key business drivers and 3 overriding themes: durability of revenue growth, sustainable margin expansion and strong cash flow with disciplined and capital allocation. 
Before getting into the details, I'd like to emphasize a few highlights in each of these areas. Revenue momentum continued, with very strong local currency growth of 12% even against our toughest quarterly compare of the year. A key characteristic was our balanced growth across our operating groups, our geographic regions and our 5 businesses, which speaks to the durability of our growth strategy. Our rate of growth continued to outpace the market as we gained share in most dimensions of our business. Driving profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion continues to be our focus. And in the fourth quarter, our operating margin came in as expected and consistent with last year. For the full year, we delivered 20 basis points of margin expansion on an adjusted basis, while investing significantly to position our business for long-term market leadership. And finally, we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow, $1.4 billion in free cash flow to be specific. In terms of capital allocation, it's noteworthy that we closed 11 acquisitions in the quarter, giving us 18 acquisitions for the full year with invested capital of $800 million, providing us with scale and capabilities in key growth areas. 
So we finished the year much like we started, with strong broad-based growth underpinned by a very good profitability and cash flows. 
With those summary comments, let me now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $8.8 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.1 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $4.7 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.3. We are very pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter, especially considering the FX headwind, which we estimate to be 13% in the quarter. 
The overall demand for our services remains robust, with the strongest quarterly bookings growth coming from operations, Products, Europe and the growth markets. Across-the-board, digital-related services continued to be an important driver of our new bookings. We also had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, bringing the total for the year to 43, which again signifies the unique relationship that we have made with many of the largest companies in the world. 
Turning to revenues. 
Net revenues for the quarter were $7.9 billion, a 1% increase in USD and 12% in local currency, reflecting the negative 10% foreign exchange impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in June. 
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% in USD and 14% in local currency. 
Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 1% in USD and an increase of 9% in local currency. 
The overriding theme in quarter 4 continued to be broad-based and balanced growth across our operating groups and geographic regions. And we are pleased with revenue performance across all of our business dimensions, with the dominant drivers continuing to be strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and operations. But we were also very pleased with our growth in application services and the combined growth for strategy and consulting. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. 
Communications, Media & Technology led all operating groups with 16% growth, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Broad-based growth continued with double-digit growth across all 3 industries and in all 3 geographic areas. 
Financial Services delivered their strongest growth of the year at 14%, fueled by double-digit growth in all 3 industries and of both Europe and the growth markets. H&PS continued their trend of double-digit growth, posting 13% in the quarter. The strength of our H&PS business continues to be very strong growth in both Health & Public Service in North America. Products grew by 10%, led by consumer goods and services, life sciences and automotive, with very strong growth in Europe and the growth markets. And finally, Resources continued to deliver very consistent growth of 6% in the quarter, with positive growth in all 3 geographic regions and in all industries except energy. 
Moving down the income statement. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 31.7%, consistent with the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.7% of net revenues, down 10 basis points. General and administrative expense was 6.2% of net revenues, up 10 basis points. Operating margin was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13.9% operating margin, consistent with quarter 4 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 30.1% in the fourth quarter last year. Net income was $788 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $760 million for the same quarter last year. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.15 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 6% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. They were 37 days, consistent with last quarter. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.5 billion net of property and equipment additions of $148 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. 
Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down roughly $500 million, as we have returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in fiscal '15. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. 
We continued to attract significant talent, hiring more than 100,000 people in fiscal '15, ending the year with a global headcount of over 358,000 people. We now have approximately 257,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 4, our utilization was 90%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14% compared to 15% in quarter 3 and in the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.6 million shares for $664 million at an average price of $100.03 per share. For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 27.4 million shares for approximately $2.5 billion at an average price of $89.52 per share. This week, our Board of Directors approved $5 billion of additional share repurchase authority, bringing the total to $7.6 billion. And as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 13 and represents an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. 
So before I turn it back over to Pierre, let me just briefly summarize where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. 
I'm pleased to say that we successfully managed our business and delivered on every metric in our original outlook. New bookings for the full year landed at $34.4 billion, which was just above the upper end of our guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Net revenues grew 11% for the year in local currency, above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 14.5%, reflecting 20 basis points of expansion, the midpoint of our guided range. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $4.82, which was above the upper end of our original guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Free cash flow was $3.7 billion, in the middle of our original guided range even with a much higher FX headwind. And finally, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, right at our initial objective through $1.4 billion in dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by 2%. 
So again, we had an extremely strong year by any measure. We are very pleased with the progress we've made in executing our growth strategy and especially as it relates to the accelerated rotation of our business to digital-related services. Overall, our results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability in cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our excellent results for the year reflect the successful execution of our strategy across the different dimensions of our business. We are making focused investments in high-growth areas, including more than $2.5 billion in acquisitions over the last 3 years. These investments are all about building new capabilities to further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. At the same time, we have aligned our organization around 5 businesses: Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations, all highly competitive in their own right and synergistic in delivering end-to-end outcomes for our clients. In particular, the new, innovative services we have created in Accenture Digital and Accenture Operations has contributed significantly to our growth. In Accenture Digital, we are working with our clients to help them create competitive advantage and tap into new sources of value. In Accenture Analytics, we are using our new Accenture Insights platform to help in the U.K, embrace the Internet of Things to transform decision-making. Our new cloud-based solution monitors and analyzes data in real time from more than 20,000 centers. And with data visualization tools, managers can proactively respond to risk on the network. And we are helping one of the largest banks in the Eurozone implement a major digital transformation. We are combining our design capabilities from Fjord, which we acquired 2 years ago, with our analytics capabilities to create a new and seamless multi-channel customer experience, while also driving significant operating efficiencies. In Accenture Operations, we have strong momentum across our infrastructure, business process, security and cloud services. In procurement, we continued to lead the market, building on the capabilities we acquired with per curiam. Let me share 2 examples. We are helping Glencore Queensland, a division of global mining company, to enhance its competitiveness. With our category management expertise and cloud-based sourcing, we expect to achieve total cost savings of more than $300 million. And we are helping TNT, the express delivery company, to reduce costs and focus on its core business, leveraging our procurement, and finance and accounting capabilities, we expect to drive annual cost savings of more than $100 million. 
And when you look across our business, only Accenture has the full range of capabilities to integrate and deliver end-to-end services in an industry context to drive transformation and mission-critical outcomes for our clients. A great example is the work we are doing with Mondelez, the global food and beverage company, to drive growth, increase profitability and reduce costs. We started this program with Accenture Strategy and our zero-based budgeting approach, and are now leveraging our business process capabilities in Accenture Operations. We expect to deliver total savings of more than $1 billion over 3 years. And we continued to invest to further differentiate our capabilities, taking a first mover position and investing ahead of the curve in fast-growing areas, such as cloud and security. 
Last week, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Share, a global leader in cloud advisory and technology services specializing in sales force, service now and Google. The addition of 1,100 professionals from Cloud Share Pass will further strengthen our position as the leading enterprise cloud services provider. 
And last month, we acquired fusionx, a leader in the emerging field of cybersecurity. fusionx elite team of cybersecurity experts works at the C-suite level to help clients security and see their vulnerabilities through actual replica attacks. This acquisition brings to Accenture the critical ability to help our clients assess and respond to sophisticated cyber attacks. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. 
I am delighted that in fiscal year '15, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency in each of our 3 geographic regions. And we achieved this result despite a global economic environment that remains sluggish and a geopolitical environment that is quite concerning. In North America, we delivered 13% revenue growth for the year in the United States, where we have now delivered double-digit growth in 4 of the last 5 years. We have gained significant market share in the U.S. and are now positioned as the market leader. In Europe, we grew revenues 10% in local currency for the year, driven primarily by Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, The Netherlands, Italy and France. And in gross markets, we delivered revenue growth of 11% in local currency for the year, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in both Japan and Brazil, with high single-digit growth in Australia. 
So in closing, we created very strong momentum in our business in fiscal year '15 by leveraging the investment we've made and by accelerating our rotation to new high-growth areas. And I'm especially pleased with our performance in digital-related services, which grew approximately 35% for the year to more than $7 billion. 
With the relevance and differentiated capabilities we have built, along with the continued disciplined management of our business, I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year '16."

Let me now turn to our business outlook, starting with the first quarter of fiscal '16. 
We expect revenues to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 8.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in USD will be negative 4% compared to fiscal '15. For the full fiscal '16, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. 
For operating margin, we expect the fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal '16 to be in a range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Turning to cash flow. 
For the full fiscal '16, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million. And free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
We expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by just under 2% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. 
Finally, you may have noticed that I did not provide new bookings guidance for fiscal 2016. Each year, we evaluate our guidance approach to ensure that we're providing appropriate visibility to our expected results. Starting this year, we'll no longer provide new bookings guidance, as we believe that it is not the best indicator of future revenue performance and has created confusion in recent years. We'll continue to report actual new bookings results each quarter. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

I mean I think just reflecting on '15 and Pierre I'm sure will have some reflections as well, I mean, the first thing I would start off with is the fact that while we were confident that we were well positioned for a very attractive market in the digital space, frankly, it's hard, and I'm sure you're going to appreciate this, Tien-tsin, it would have been hard to bank on and predict a 35% growth in our digital-related services business, so that clearly was part of the driver. I think secondly, while we also felt very confident in our operations business, which is truly distinctive in the marketplace, no doubt about that, the growth rate was higher. We knew it would be strong, but it came in even stronger than we expected. When I reflect on the operating groups, and you may remember, and I won't recount what I said or recount what I've said when we started the year, but I had laid out a view of how we thought the operating groups would emerge. I mean, clearly, when you look at CMT's growth for the year, as proud as we are of that growth, it frankly it would've been tough to predict that level of growth, double-digit growth in all industries and in all 3 geographic markets. I mean, that -- it's kind of a trifecta of stars aligning. On the other end of the spectrum, not to go through every operating group, we were comfortable with our return to growth in Resources, but there were still some risk, as we highlighted. And at the end of the day, congratulations to our Resources team again that they reconnected with growth and sustained a very solid growth. And then I think across the patch, when we talk about consulting in our traditional type of work way, which in our new way of looking at the business includes strategy, consulting and part of application services related to application development within app services, that part of our business was very strong in '15 and exceeded our expectations."

The point being that when you look at our 11% growth for the year, the organic growth was obviously substantial. As we look forward to '16, we are very proud of the success that we've had in the market, with our acquisition activity in the last 2 quarters in particular. We also have 4 acquisitions. Pierre mentioned Cloud Sherpas, which have been announced but not yet closed. But if you take what we've closed and the 4 that have been announced, not yet closed, then we would estimate that our inorganic would be, let's say, approaching the range -- in the range of about 2%. And of course, that can change depending on the timing of when these 4 deals, Cloud Sherpas in particular, ultimately gets closed, but we would be in that range, so it would be a quick up."

Again, I want to point out that the year we just closed, our organic growth would have been about 9.5% roughly. And so the organic part of our business, that machine was hitting on all cylinders in '15 and was a real testament to the power of our growth strategy and this evolution of Accenture to focusing on our 5 businesses that we've talked about, leveraging the very distinctive channel that we have through our operating groups and our largest geographic markets. So just that factual point, our inorganic growth machine is hitting on all cylinders. You mentioned ERP, I'll go ahead and put this out there, that the ERP business -- we've always said that ERP goes through cycles and -- but yet at the end of the day, it's an attractive business.

Now as a percentage of our total revenue, it's actually gotten -- it's come down a click in terms of what it represents of Accenture's business because the non-ERP is growing significantly.

Just to -- just only reconfirm the element of our acquisition strategy. We are doing acquisitions for 3 reasons. I mean, the first one is to accelerate access to capabilities in the new, and what we're calling the new at Accenture is now the combination of digital services, cloud services, security services or new technologies, if you will, such as cognitive computing, automation or artificial intelligence. Second is to have access to a very deep industry expertise, especially in consulting. That is the rationale for acquisition of Axia, Javelin companies, consulting the structure, I track, either deep industry expertise in upstream energy, in retail. That's the reason -- that's #2. And the #3, would be to scale faster, to take the leadership position in the marketplace, and by leadership, we mean the #1. I'm thinking about . I'm thinking about Cloud Sherpas. I would put in that category scale to lead, putting more distance between Accenture and the competition. Three reasons where -- why are we are doing acquisition. And then we grew organic on top of this acquisition, probably one of the best case coming in my mind would be Procuria. We made the acquisition of Procuria. We became the #1 in procurement services. And since we made this acquisition, we've been scaling faster, and now we are the market leader. And the organic growth of our procurement services is even higher than the business case with."

I mean, first of all, I would encourage you and others to look at the absolute amount because the absolute amount, as you referenced, I'll use my word, but your thought I hope is that it's outstanding. Our operating cash flow, our free cash flow exceeds net income, which I think is a standard for any company, which is indicative of outstanding cash flow. And we're in the range of -- across our range. We're in the range of let's the around 1.1 of free cash flow to net income, and so the absolute number is very, very strong. As we talked about before, there are many puts and takes in our cash flow in any particular year. Changes in DSO is an example. We have allowed for the possibility not that this is our -- what we're trying to drive our teams do, but we've allowed for the possibility of a slight uptick in DSOs. You also noticed that we have allowed for a further CapEx spending, which is part of the increase. And then beyond that, there are differences in timings. For example, tax cash payments can be here different on 1 year -- from one year to the next. And so there are many swings, but what I would encourage you to focus on is the absolute cash flow, which exceeds net income, and is great indicator of a strong cash-generating company."

And we believe we have some pretty tough hurdles, financial hurdles for the transactions that we do. Having said that, as you know, it's certainly wouldn't be unusual for an acquisition to be dilutive in the first year or 2 possibly. But we do -- one of our hurdles is the pace at which a deal becomes on par and then accretive. But certainly, in the first couple of years, they can be dilutive I'd also point out that whereas many other companies in our sector tend to adjust for certain types of acquisition-related cost, the amortization intangibles, things like performance retention payments at the time of closure, third-party fees, et cetera, we've chosen not to do that, and we report our margin all in. To date, our margin expansion commitment has been based on a philosophy that we absorb those as part of our investments and we drive the business forward. And of course, that's just one part of our investment. We have investments that go well beyond that. The impressive thing about our profit model to date is that, when you look at that 20 basis points of expansion, underneath that, we are driving significant efficiency across our business to absorb the investments, acquisition and otherwise, and that's an important story to understand something why you asked that question."

I mean, when I look at quarter 1 or the full year maybe, Lisa, if you'll -- I'll just -- let me just expand my comments a little bit. I mean, when you look at our guidance, you first of all have to understand what is our assumption on market growth. And we assume that the market will continue to grow, plus or minus in the 4% range. And so when you look at our guidance for the year, certainly, if you look at our guidance for quarter 1, the same would apply through -- across that range. But certainly, at the upper end of that range, it reflects taking significant market share, continuing to take significant market share, which is our strategic objective. The other thing that you have to consider goes back to some of the discussion that Pierre had, I believe, with Darrin on the growth markets and the risk profile. But also, I think when we look at the macroenvironment in general, relative to, where we were 90 days ago, I would say relative to where we were at this time last year, the volatility and risk of the macro -- in the microenvironment has clicked up a notch or 2, and so that's a factored in. The other thing that we think about when we look at our guidance is that it's as important if not more important to look at the absolute dollars as it is the percentage, whether it be the first quarter or the full year. And if you just look at the full year, before you adjust for the FX headwind just taking that out and look at the underlying growth. At the upper end of our range, we would be adding about $2.5 billion of revenue, excluding the impact of FX in fiscal '16, which is a pretty healthy number, and so we work hard to drive to the upper end of the range, although the range reflects what we think are the range of possibilities. And as it relates to the full year, we're early in the year. And as we did last year, we'll adjust as we go. That was more of an answer than your question, but it gave me an opportunity to share some of those thoughts."

And of course, when you understand the overall economic environment in Europe, it's much different from the one, for instance, you have in the U.S. So it's more about us than about the market at course. And I would call probably the same trend. It's fascinating to see that the digital rotation we seen in Europe is as strong, even slightly stronger than the one we could see in the U.S. It appears that our target clients, mainly the premium brand in the G2000 we are solving in Europe really accelerating their investments in term of digital rotation. Second, we had some very significant transactions leveraging Accenture Operations with our business process services. I'm thinking about -- I mean, the finance and accounting, the HR, the procurement as well. And it's made a significant source of growth. And overall, the consulting is back, probably driven as well with the digital-related services. So for Europe, again, the clients we are serving, more than the GUs, are reinvesting with always an eye on rationalization, driving good growth for Accenture Operations and the other eye on growth and digital, which is driving more business for Accenture Digital, Accenture Strategy and Accenture consulting, and of course, the leadership of the other player."

We are extremely pleased with our very strong financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Our excellent fourth quarter performance continues the momentum we have been building in our business all year. 
For the full year, we delivered strong new bookings, generated record revenues, grew EPS faster than revenues and generated strong free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in our business and delivering significant value for clients and shareholder. 
Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $34.4 billion. We grew revenues 11% in local currency to a record $31 billion. Our growth was broad-based across the business, including double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. We delivered earnings per share of $4.82 on an adjusted basis, a 7% increase. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 14.5% on an adjusted basis. We generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion. 
We returned $3.8 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, an 8% increase over our prior dividend. 
So I feel very good about what we delivered in fiscal year '15. Our outstanding performance clearly demonstrates that we continue to provide highly relevant and differentiated services to our clients.

972190,310598125,872570,"Accenture plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter 4, which culminated an extremely strong year for Accenture. Once again, our results reflect",1473,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. 
Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter 4, which culminated an extremely strong year for Accenture. Once again, our results reflect our unique position in the marketplace, the relevance of our growth strategy and our ability to drive our business to produce value for our clients, our people and our shareholders. 
As you listen to our prepared remarks, you'll hear continued consistency in the key business drivers and 3 overriding themes: durability of revenue growth, sustainable margin expansion and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. 
Before getting into the details, I'd like to emphasize a few highlights in each of these areas. Revenue momentum continued with very strong local currency growth of 12% even against our toughest quarterly compare of the year. A key characteristic was our balanced growth across our operating groups, our geographic regions and our 5 businesses, which speaks to the durability of our growth strategy. Our rate of growth continued to outpace the market as we gained share in most dimensions of our business. 
Driving profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion continues to be our focus. And in the fourth quarter, our operating margin came in as expected and consistent with last year. For the full year, we delivered 20 basis points of margin expansion on an adjusted basis while investing significantly to position our business for long-term market leadership. And finally, we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow, $1.4 billion in free cash flow to be specific. 
In terms of capital allocation, it's noteworthy that we closed 11 acquisitions in the quarter, giving us 18 acquisitions for the full year with invested capital of $800 million, providing us with scale and capabilities in key growth areas. 
So we finished the year much like we started, with strong broad-based growth underpinned by very good profitability and cash flows. 
With those summary comments, let me now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.8 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.1 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $4.7 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.3. We're very pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter, especially considering the FX headwind which we estimate to be 13% in the quarter. 
The overall demand for our services remains robust, with the strongest quarterly bookings growth coming from Operations, Products, Europe and the growth markets. Across the board, digital-related services continued to be an important driver of our new bookings. We also had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, bringing the total for the year to 43, which again signifies the unique relationship that we have with many of the largest companies in the world. 
Turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.9 billion, a 1% increase in USD and 12% in local currency, reflecting the negative 10% foreign exchange impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in June. 
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% in USD and 14% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 1% in USD and an increase of 9% in local currency. 
The overriding theme in quarter 4 continued to be broad-based and balanced growth across our operating groups and geographic regions. And we're pleased with revenue performance across all of our business dimensions, with the dominant drivers continuing to be strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and operations. But we were also very pleased with our growth in application services and the combined growth for strategy and consulting. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology led all operating groups with 16% growth, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Broad-based growth continued with double-digit growth across all 3 industries and in all 3 geographic areas. 
Financial Services delivered their strongest growth of the year, 14%, fueled by double-digit growth in all 3 industries in both Europe and the growth markets. H&PS continued their trend of double-digit growth, posting 13% in the quarter. The strength of our H&PS business continues to be very strong growth in both Health & Public Service in North America. 
Products grew by 10%, led by consumer goods and services, life sciences and automotive, with very strong growth in Europe and the growth markets. And finally, Resources continued to deliver very consistent growth of 6% in the quarter, with positive growth in all 3 geographic regions and in all industries except energy. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.7%, consistent with the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.7% of net revenues, down 10 basis points. General and administrative expense was 6.2% of net revenues, up 10 basis points. Operating margin was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13.9% operating margin, consistent with quarter 4 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 30.1% in the fourth quarter last year. Net income was $788 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $760 million for the same quarter last year. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.15 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 6% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. They were 37 days, consistent with last quarter. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.5 billion net of property and equipment additions of $148 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down roughly $500 million as we have returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in fiscal '15. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We continue to attract significant talent, hiring more than 100,000 people in fiscal '15, ending the year with a global headcount of over 358,000 people. We now have approximately 257,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. 
In quarter 4, our utilization was 90%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14% compared to 15% in quarter 3 and in the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.6 million shares for $664 million at an average price of $100.03 per share. For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 27.4 million shares for approximately $2.5 billion at an average price of $89.52 per share. 
This week, our Board of Directors approved $5 billion of additional share repurchase authority, bringing the total to $7.6 billion. And as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 13 and represents an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. 
So before I turn it back over to Pierre, let me just briefly summarize where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. 
I'm pleased to say that we successfully managed our business and delivered on every metric in our original outlook. New bookings for the full year landed at $34.4 billion, which was just above the upper end of our guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Net revenues grew 11% for the year in local currency, above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. 
Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 14.5%, reflecting 20 basis points of expansion, the midpoint of our guided range. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $4.82, which was above the upper end of our original guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Free cash flow was $3.7 billion, in the middle of our original guided range even with a much higher FX headwind. 
And finally, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, right at our initial objective through $1.4 billion in dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by 2%. 
So again, we had an extremely strong year by any measure. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in executing our growth strategy and especially as it relates to the accelerated rotation of our business to digital-related services. Overall, our results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability in cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our excellent results for the year reflect the successful execution of our strategy across the different dimensions of our business. We are making focused investments in high-growth areas, including more than $2.5 billion in acquisitions",840,"Thank you, David. Our excellent results for the year reflect the successful execution of our strategy across the different dimensions of our business. We are making focused investments in high-growth areas, including more than $2.5 billion in acquisitions over the last 3 years. These investments are all about building new capabilities to further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. 
At the same time, we have aligned our organization around 5 businesses: Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations, all highly competitive in their own right and synergistic in delivering end-to-end outcomes for our clients. In particular, the new, innovative services we have created in Accenture Digital and Accenture Operations has contributed significantly to our growth. In Accenture Digital, we are working with our clients to help them create competitive advantage and tap into new sources of value. 
In Accenture Analytics, we are using our new Accenture Insights Platform to help Thames Water in the U.K. embrace the Internet of Things to transform decision-making. Our new cloud-based solution monitors and analyzes data in real time from more than 20,000 centers. And with data visualization tools, managers can proactively respond to risks on the network. 
And we are helping one of the largest banks in the Eurozone implement a major digital transformation. We are combining our design capabilities from Fjord, which we acquired 2 years ago, with our analytics capabilities to create a new and seamless multichannel customer experience while also driving significant operating efficiencies. 
In Accenture Operations, we have strong momentum across our infrastructure, business process, security and cloud services. In procurement, we continued to lead the market, building on the capabilities we acquired with Procurian. Let me share 2 examples. 
We are helping Glencore Queensland, a division of the global mining company, to enhance its competitiveness. With our category management expertise and cloud-based sourcing, we expect to achieve total cost savings of more than $300 million. And we are helping TNT, the express delivery company, to reduce costs and focus on its core business. Leveraging our procurement and finance and accounting capabilities, we expect to drive annual cost savings of more than $100 million. 
And when you look across our entire business, only Accenture has the full range of capabilities to integrate and deliver end-to-end services in an industry context to drive transformation and mission-critical outcomes for our clients. 
A great example is the work we are doing with Mondelez, the global food and beverage company, to drive growth, increase profitability and reduce costs. We started this program with Accenture Strategy and our zero-based budgeting approach and are now leveraging our business process capabilities in Accenture Operations. We expect to deliver total savings of more than $1 billion over 3 years. And we continue to invest to further differentiate our capabilities, taking a first-mover position and investing ahead of the curve in fast-growing areas, such as cloud and security. 
Last week, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Sherpas, a global leader in cloud advisory and technology services specializing in Salesforce, ServiceNow and Google. The addition of 1,100 professionals from Cloud Sherpas will further strengthen our position as the leading enterprise cloud services provider. 
And last month, we acquired FusionX, a leader in the emerging field of cybersecurity. FusionX elite team of cybersecurity experts works at the C-suite level to help clients test security and see their vulnerabilities through actual replica attacks. This acquisition brings to Accenture the critical ability to help our clients assess and respond to sophisticated cyber attacks. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm delighted that in fiscal year '15, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency in each of our 3 geographic regions. And we achieved this result despite a global economic environment that remains sluggish and a geopolitical environment that is quite concerning. 
In North America, we delivered 13% revenue growth for the year in the United States, where we have now delivered double-digit growth in 4 of the last 5 years. We have gained significant market share in the U.S. and are now positioned as the market leader. 
In Europe, we grew revenues 10% in local currency for the year, driven primarily by Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, The Netherlands, Italy and France. And in growth markets, we delivered revenue growth of 11% in local currency for the year, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in both Japan and Brazil, with high single-digit growth in Australia. 
So in closing, we created very strong momentum in our business in fiscal year '15 by leveraging the investment we've made and by accelerating our rotation to new high-growth areas. And I'm especially pleased with our performance in digital-related services, which grew approximately 35% for the year to more than $7 billion. 
With the relevance and differentiated capabilities we have built, along with the continued disciplined management of our business, I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year '16."

We expect revenues to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 8.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in USD will be negative 4% compared to fiscal '15. For the full fiscal '16, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. 
For operating margin, we expect the fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. 
For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
We expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by just under 2% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. 
Finally, you may have noticed that I did not provide new bookings guidance for fiscal 2016. Each year, we evaluate our guidance approach to ensure that we're providing appropriate visibility to our expected results. Starting this year, we'll no longer provide new bookings guidance as we believe that it is not the best indicator of future revenue performance and has created confusion in recent years. We'll continue to report actual new bookings results each quarter. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

I mean, I think just reflecting on '15, and Pierre, I'm sure, will have some reflections as well, I mean, the first thing I would start off with is the fact that while we were confident that we were well positioned for a very attractive market in the digital space, frankly, it's hard, and I'm sure you're going to appreciate this, Tien-tsin, it would have been hard to bank on and predict 35% growth in our digital-related services business. So that clearly was part of the driver. I think secondly, while we also felt very confident in our Operations business, which is truly distinctive in the marketplace, no doubt about that, the growth rate was higher. We knew it would be strong, but it came in even stronger than we expected. When I reflect on the operating groups, and you may remember, and I won't recount what I've said or recount what I've said when we started the year, but I had laid out a view of how we thought the operating groups would emerge, I mean, clearly, when you look at CMT's growth for the year, as proud as we are of that growth, it -- frankly, it would have been tough to predict that level of growth, double-digit growth in all industries and in all 3 geographic markets. I mean, that -- it's kind of a trifecta of stars aligning. On the other end of the spectrum, not to go through every operating group, we were comfortable with our return to growth in Resources, but yet there were still some risk, as we highlighted. And at the end of the day, congratulations to our Resources team again that they reconnected with growth and sustained very solid growth. And then I think across the patch, when we talk about consulting in our traditional type of work way, which in our new way of looking at the business includes strategy, consulting and part of application services related to application development within app services, that part of our business was very strong in '15 and exceeded our expectations."

Just to your other question, I'll start with '15, our inorganic contribution I signaled last quarter was in the range of 1% to 1.5%. Our actual inorganic came in roughly at the midpoint of that range, the point being that when you look at our 11% growth for the year, the organic growth was obviously substantial. As we look forward to '16, we are very proud of the success that we've had in the market, with our acquisition activity in the last 2 quarters in particular. We also have 4 acquisitions. Pierre mentioned Cloud Sherpas, which have been announced but not yet closed. But if you take what we've closed and the 4 that have been announced, not yet closed, then we would estimate that our inorganic would be, let's say, approaching the range -- in the range of about 2%. And of course, that can change depending on the timing of when these 4 deals, Cloud Sherpas in particular, ultimately gets closed. But we would be in that range, so it would be a click up."

And so the organic part of our business, that machine was hitting on all cylinders in '15 and was a real testament to the power of our growth strategy and this evolution of Accenture to focusing on our 5 businesses that we've talked about, leveraging the very distinctive channel that we have through our operating groups in our largest geographic markets. So just that factual point, our inorganic growth machine is hitting on all cylinders. You mentioned ERP. I'll go ahead and put this out there that the ERP business -- we've always said that ERP goes through cycles and -- but yet at the end of the day, it's an attractive business. Our ERP business did stabilize in '15. It actually grew slightly. Now as a percentage of our total revenue, it's actually gotten -- it's come down a click in terms of what it represents of Accenture's business because the non-ERP is growing significantly. But nonetheless, the ERP story is not a bad story. I'll just pass it over to Pierre."

Just to probably just only reconfirm the element of our acquisition strategy, we are doing acquisitions for 3 reasons.

Second is to have access to very deep industry expertise especially in consulting. That is the rationale for acquisition of Axia, Javelin companies, consulting deep structure, iTrack, either deep industry expertise in upstream energy, in retail. That's the reason -- that's number two. And the number three would be to scale faster, to take the leadership position in the marketplace, and by leadership, we mean the #1. I'm thinking about Procurian. I'm thinking about Cloud Sherpas. I would put in that category scale to lead, putting more distance between Accenture and the competition. Three reasons where -- why we are doing acquisition, and then we grew organic on top of this acquisition. Probably one of the best case coming in my mind would be Procurian. We made the acquisition of Procurian. We became the #1 in procurement services. And since we made this acquisition, we've been scaling faster, and now we are the market leader, and the organic growth of our procurement services is even higher than the business case we set."

I mean, first of all, I would encourage you and others to look at the absolute amount because the absolute amount, as you referenced, I'll use my word, but your thought, I hope, is that it's outstanding. Our operating cash flow, our free cash flow exceeds net income, which I think is a standard for any company, which is indicative of outstanding cash flow. And we're in the range -- across our range, we're in the range of, let's say, a rounded 1.1 of free cash flow to net income. And so the absolute number is very, very strong. As we talked about before, there are many puts and takes in our cash flow in any particular year. Changes in DSO is an example. And we have allowed for the possibility -- not that this is what we're trying to drive our teams to, but we've allowed for the possibility of a slight uptick in DSOs. You also noticed that we have allowed for further CapEx spending, which is part of the increase. And then beyond that, there are differences in timings. For example, tax cash payments can be different on 1 year to -- from 1 year to the next. And so there are many swings, but what I would encourage you to focus on is the absolute cash flow, which exceeds net income and is great indicator of a strong cash-generating company."

Well, first of all, Ed, I would say that if you look at the performance of our portfolio overall, we're quite pleased with the performance of our portfolio of acquisitions, from revenue through profitability and cash flow. And that's something we track very carefully, we review certainly ourselves but with our board as well each quarter. And we believe we have some pretty high hurdles, financial hurdles for the transactions that we do. Having said that, as you know, it certainly wouldn't be unusual for an acquisition to be dilutive in the first year or 2 possibly. But we do -- one of our hurdles is the pace at which a deal becomes on par and then accretive. But certainly, in the first couple of years, they can be dilutive. I'd also point out that whereas many other companies in our sector tend to adjust for certain types of acquisition-related costs, the amortization of intangibles, things like performance retention payments at the time of closure, third-party fees, et cetera, we've chosen not to do that, and we report our margin all in. To date, our margin expansion commitment has been based on a philosophy that we absorb those as part of our investments and we drive the business forward. And of course, that's just one part of our investment. We have investments that go well beyond that. The impressive thing about our profit model to date is that when you look at that 20 basis points of expansion, underneath that, we are driving significant efficiency across our business to absorb the investment to acquisition and otherwise. And that's an important story to understand, so I'm glad you asked that question."

So if you look at our guide for quarter 1, the range is 6% to 9% in local-currency growth.

So if you look at our guide for quarter 1, the range is 6% to 9% in local-currency growth. I mean, when I look at quarter 1 or the full year maybe, Lisa, if you'll -- I'll just -- let me just expand my comments a little bit. I mean, when you look at our guidance, you first of all have to understand what is our assumption on market growth. And we assume that the market will continue to grow plus or minus in the 4% range. And so when you look at our guidance for the year, certainly, if you look at our guidance for quarter 1, the same would apply through -- across that range but certainly at the upper end of that range, it reflects taking significant market share, continuing to take significant market share, which is our strategic objective. The other thing that you have to consider goes back to some of the discussion that Pierre had, I believe, with Darrin on the growth markets and the risk profile. But also, I think when we look at the macro environment in general, relative to where we were 90 days ago, I would say relative to where we were at this time last year, the volatility and risk of the macro -- in the macro environment has clicked up a notch or 2, and so that's factored in. The other thing that we think about when we look at our guidance is that it's as important, if not more important, to look at the absolute dollars as it is the percentage, whether it be the first quarter or the full year. And if you just look at the full year, before you adjust for the FX headwind, just taking that out and look at the underlying growth, at the upper end of our range, we would be adding about $2.5 billion of revenue, excluding the impact of FX in fiscal '16, which is a pretty healthy number. And so we work hard to drive to the upper end of the range although the range reflects what we think are the range of possibilities. And as it relates to the full year, we're early in the year. And as we did last year, we'll adjust as we go. That was more of an answer than your question, but it gave me an opportunity to share some of those thoughts."

And by the way, Jo Deblaere who's leading our European business is in the room, and he couldn't be more pleased with your comment on Europe. And yes, I mean, we're pleased with where we are because you've seen the growth, and of course, when you understand the overall economic environment in Europe is much different from the one, for instance, you have in the U.S. So it's more about us than about the market, of course. And I would call probably the same trend. It's fascinating to see that the digital rotation we've seen in Europe is as strong, even slightly stronger than the one we could see in the U.S. It appears that our target clients, mainly the premium brand in the G2000 we are serving in Europe, are really accelerating their investments in terms of digital rotation. Second, we had some very significant transactions leveraging Accenture Operations with our business process services. I'm thinking about -- I mean, the finance and accounting, the HR, the procurement as well. And it's made a significant source of growth. And overall, the consulting is back, probably driven as well with the digital-related services. So for Europe, again, the clients we are serving, more than the GUs, are reinvesting with always an eye on rationalization, driving good growth for Accenture Operations and the other eye on growth and digital, which is driving more business for Accenture Digital, Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting and, of course, the leadership of Jo Deblaere."

We are extremely pleased with our very strong financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Our excellent fourth quarter performance continues the momentum we have been building in our business all year. 
For the full year, we delivered strong new bookings, generated record revenues, grew EPS faster than revenues and generated strong free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in our business and delivering significant value for clients and shareholder. 
Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $34.4 billion. We grew revenues 11% in local currency to a record $31 billion. Our growth was broad-based across the business, including double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. We delivered earnings per share of $4.82 on an adjusted basis, a 7% increase. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 14.5% on an adjusted basis. We generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion. 
We returned $3.8 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, an 8% increase over our prior dividend. 
So I feel very good about what we delivered in fiscal year '15. Our outstanding performance clearly demonstrates that we continue to provide highly relevant and differentiated services to our clients. 
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you."

Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter 4, which culminated an extremely strong year for Accenture. Once again, our results reflect",1474,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. 
Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter 4, which culminated an extremely strong year for Accenture. Once again, our results reflect our unique position in the marketplace, the relevance of our growth strategy and our ability to drive our business to produce value for our clients, our people and our shareholders. 
As you listen to our prepared remarks, you'll hear continued consistency in the key business drivers and 3 overriding themes: durability of revenue growth, sustainable margin expansion and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. 
Before getting into the details, I'd like to emphasize a few highlights in each of these areas. Revenue momentum continued with very strong local currency growth of 12% even against our toughest quarterly compare of the year. A key characteristic was our balanced growth across our operating groups, our geographic regions and our 5 businesses, which speaks to the durability of our growth strategy. Our rate of growth continued to outpace the market as we gained share in most dimensions of our business. 
Driving profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion continues to be our focus. And in the fourth quarter, our operating margin came in as expected and consistent with last year. For the full year, we delivered 20 basis points of margin expansion on an adjusted basis while investing significantly to position our business for long-term market leadership. And finally, we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow, $1.4 billion in free cash flow to be specific. 
In terms of capital allocation, it's noteworthy that we closed 11 acquisitions in the quarter, giving us 18 acquisitions for the full year with invested capital of $800 million, providing us with scale and capabilities in key growth areas. 
So we finished the year much like we started, with strong broad-based growth underpinned by very good profitability and cash flows. 
With those summary comments, let me now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.8 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.1 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $4.7 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.3. We're very pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter, especially considering the FX headwind which we estimate to be 13% in the quarter. 
The overall demand for our services remains robust, with the strongest quarterly bookings growth coming from Operations, Products, Europe and the growth markets. Across the board, digital-related services continued to be an important driver of our new bookings. We also had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, bringing the total for the year to 43, which again signifies the unique relationship that we have with many of the largest companies in the world. 
Turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.9 billion, a 1% increase in USD and 12% in local currency, reflecting the negative 10% foreign exchange impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in June. 
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% in USD and 14% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 1% in USD and an increase of 9% in local currency. 
The overriding theme in quarter 4 continued to be broad-based and balanced growth across our operating groups and geographic regions. And we're pleased with revenue performance across all of our business dimensions, with the dominant drivers continuing to be strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and operations. But we were also very pleased with our growth in application services and the combined growth for strategy and consulting. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology led all operating groups with 16% growth, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Broad-based growth continued with double-digit growth across all 3 industries and in all 3 geographic areas. 
Financial Services delivered their strongest growth of the year at 14%, fueled by double-digit growth in all 3 industries in both Europe and the growth markets. H&PS continued their trend of double-digit growth, posting 13% in the quarter. The strength of our H&PS business continues to be very strong growth in both Health & Public Service in North America. 
Products grew by 10%, led by consumer goods and services, life sciences and automotive, with very strong growth in Europe and the growth markets. And finally, Resources continued to deliver very consistent growth of 6% in the quarter, with positive growth in all 3 geographic regions and in all industries except energy. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.7%, consistent with the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.7% of net revenues, down 10 basis points. General and administrative expense was 6.2% of net revenues, up 10 basis points. Operating margin was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13.9% operating margin, consistent with quarter 4 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 30.1% in the fourth quarter last year. Net income was $788 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $760 million for the same quarter last year. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.15 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 6% year-over-year increase. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. They were 37 days, consistent with last quarter. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.5 billion net of property and equipment additions of $148 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year, down roughly $500 million as we have returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in fiscal '15. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We continue to attract significant talent, hiring more than 100,000 people in fiscal '15, ending the year with a global headcount of over 358,000 people. We now have approximately 257,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. 
In quarter 4, our utilization was 90%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14% compared to 15% in quarter 3 and in the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.6 million shares for $664 million at an average price of $100.03 per share. For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 27.4 million shares for approximately $2.5 billion at an average price of $89.52 per share. 
This week, our Board of Directors approved $5 billion of additional share repurchase authority, bringing the total to $7.6 billion. And as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 13 and represents an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. 
So before I turn it back over to Pierre, let me just briefly summarize where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. 
I'm pleased to say that we successfully managed our business and delivered on every metric in our original outlook. New bookings for the full year landed at $34.4 billion, which was just above the upper end of our guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Net revenues grew 11% for the year in local currency, above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. 
Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 14.5%, reflecting 20 basis points of expansion, the midpoint of our guided range. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $4.82, which was above the upper end of our original guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Free cash flow was $3.7 billion, in the middle of our original guided range even with a much higher FX headwind. 
And finally, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, right at our initial objective through $1.4 billion in dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by 2%. 
So again, we had an extremely strong year by any measure. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in executing our growth strategy and especially as it relates to the accelerated rotation of our business to digital-related services. Overall, our results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability in cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our excellent results for the year reflect the successful execution of our strategy across the different dimensions of our business.

Our excellent results for the year reflect the successful execution of our strategy across the different dimensions of our business. We are making focused investments in high-growth areas, including more than $2.5 billion in acquisitions over the last 3 years. These investments are all about building new capabilities to further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. 
At the same time, we have aligned our organization around 5 businesses: Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations, all highly competitive in their own right and synergistic in delivering end-to-end outcomes for our clients. In particular, the new, innovative services we have created in Accenture Digital and Accenture Operations has contributed significantly to our growth. In Accenture Digital, we are working with our clients to help them create competitive advantage and tap into new sources of value. 
In Accenture Analytics, we are using our new Accenture Insights Platform to help Thames Water in the U.K. embrace the Internet of Things to transform decision-making. Our new cloud-based solution monitors and analyzes data in real time from more than 20,000 centers. And with data visualization tools, managers can proactively respond to risks on the network. 
And we are helping one of the largest banks in the Eurozone implement a major digital transformation. We are combining our design capabilities from Fjord, which we acquired 2 years ago, with our analytics capabilities to create a new and seamless multichannel customer experience while also driving significant operating efficiencies. 
In Accenture Operations, we have strong momentum across our infrastructure, business process, security and cloud services. In procurement, we continued to lead the market, building on the capabilities we acquired with Procurian. Let me share 2 examples. 
We are helping Glencore Queensland, a division of the global mining company, to enhance its competitiveness. With our category management expertise and cloud-based sourcing, we expect to achieve total cost savings of more than $300 million. And we are helping TNT, the express delivery company, to reduce costs and focus on its core business. Leveraging our procurement and finance and accounting capabilities, we expect to drive annual cost savings of more than $100 million. 
And when you look across our entire business, only Accenture has the full range of capabilities to integrate and deliver end-to-end services in an industry context to drive transformation and mission-critical outcomes for our clients. 
A great example is the work we are doing with Mondelez, the global food and beverage company, to drive growth, increase profitability and reduce costs. We started this program with Accenture Strategy and our zero-based budgeting approach and are now leveraging our business process capabilities in Accenture Operations. We expect to deliver total savings of more than $1 billion over 3 years. And we continue to invest to further differentiate our capabilities, taking a first-mover position and investing ahead of the curve in fast-growing areas, such as cloud and security. 
Last week, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Sherpas, a global leader in cloud advisory and technology services specializing in Salesforce, ServiceNow and Google. The addition of 1,100 professionals from Cloud Sherpas will further strengthen our position as the leading enterprise cloud services provider. 
And last month, we acquired FusionX, a leader in the emerging field of cybersecurity. FusionX elite team of cybersecurity experts works at the C-suite level to help clients test security and see their vulnerabilities through actual replica attacks. This acquisition brings to Accenture the critical ability to help our clients assess and respond to sophisticated cyber attacks. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm delighted that in fiscal year '15, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency in each of our 3 geographic regions. And we achieved this result despite a global economic environment that remains sluggish and a geopolitical environment that is quite concerning. 
In North America, we delivered 13% revenue growth for the year in the United States, where we have now delivered double-digit growth in 4 of the last 5 years. We have gained significant market share in the U.S. and are now positioned as the market leader. 
In Europe, we grew revenues 10% in local currency for the year, driven primarily by Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and France. And in growth markets, we delivered revenue growth of 11% in local currency for the year, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in both Japan and Brazil, with high single-digit growth in Australia. 
So in closing, we created very strong momentum in our business in fiscal year '15 by leveraging the investment we've made and by accelerating our rotation to new high-growth areas. And I'm especially pleased with our performance in digital-related services, which grew approximately 35% for the year to more than $7 billion. 
With the relevance and differentiated capabilities we have built, along with the continued disciplined management of our business, I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year '16."

We expect revenues to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 8.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in USD will be negative 4% compared to fiscal '15. For the full fiscal '16, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. 
For operating margin, we expect the fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. 
For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
We expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by just under 2% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. 
Finally, you may have noticed that I did not provide new bookings guidance for fiscal 2016. Each year, we evaluate our guidance approach to ensure that we're providing appropriate visibility to our expected results. Starting this year, we'll no longer provide new bookings guidance as we believe that it is not the best indicator of future revenue performance and has created confusion in recent years. We'll continue to report actual new bookings results each quarter. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

I mean, I think just reflecting on '15, and Pierre, I'm sure, will have some reflections as well, I mean, the first thing I would start off with is the fact that while we were confident that we were well positioned for a very attractive market in the digital space, frankly, it's hard, and I'm sure you're going to appreciate this, Tien-tsin, it would have been hard to bank on and predict 35% growth in our digital-related services business. So that clearly was part of the driver. I think secondly, while we also felt very confident in our Operations business, which is truly distinctive in the marketplace, no doubt about that, the growth rate was higher. We knew it would be strong, but it came in even stronger than we expected. When I reflect on the operating groups, and you may remember, and I won't recount what I've said or recount what I've said when we started the year, but I had laid out a view of how we thought the operating groups would emerge, I mean, clearly, when you look at CMT's growth for the year, as proud as we are of that growth, it -- frankly, it would have been tough to predict that level of growth, double-digit growth in all industries and in all 3 geographic markets. I mean, that -- it's kind of a trifecta of stars aligning. On the other end of the spectrum, not to go through every operating group, we were comfortable with our return to growth in Resources, but yet there were still some risk, as we highlighted. And at the end of the day, congratulations to our Resources team again that they reconnected with growth and sustained very solid growth. And then I think across the patch, when we talk about consulting in our traditional type of work way, which in our new way of looking at the business includes strategy, consulting and part of application services related to application development within app services, that part of our business was very strong in '15 and exceeded our expectations."

Just working backwards, Tien-tsin, I'll give you a view on digital growth as well as our dimensional growth, I'm going to give that view at IA Day as we're still working through our view on that. Just to your other question, I'll start with '15, our inorganic contribution I signaled last quarter was in the range of 1% to 1.5%. Our actual inorganic came in roughly at the midpoint of that range, the point being that when you look at our 11% growth for the year, the organic growth was obviously substantial. As we look forward to '16, we are very proud of the success that we've had in the market, with our acquisition activity in the last 2 quarters in particular. We also have 4 acquisitions. Pierre mentioned Cloud Sherpas, which had been announced but not yet closed. But if you take what we've closed and the 4 that have been announced, not yet closed, then we would estimate that our inorganic would be, let's say, approaching the range -- in the range of about 2%. And of course, that can change depending on the timing of when these 4 deals, Cloud Sherpas in particular, ultimately gets closed. But we would be in that range, so it would be a click up."

Again, I want to point out that the year we just closed, our organic growth would have been about 9.5% roughly. And so the organic part of our business, that machine was hitting on all cylinders in '15 and was a real testament to the power of our growth strategy and this evolution of Accenture to focusing on our 5 businesses that we've talked about, leveraging the very distinctive channel that we have through our operating groups in our largest geographic markets. So just that factual point, our inorganic growth machine is hitting on all cylinders. You mentioned ERP. I'll go ahead and put this out there that the ERP business -- we've always said that ERP goes through cycles and -- but yet at the end of the day, it's an attractive business. Our ERP business did stabilize in '15. It actually grew slightly. Now as a percentage of our total revenue, it's actually gotten -- it's come down a click in terms of what it represents of Accenture's business because the non-ERP is growing significantly. But nonetheless, the ERP story is not a bad story. I'll just pass it over to Pierre."

Just to probably just only reconfirm the element of our acquisition strategy, we are doing acquisitions for 3 reasons. I mean, the first one is to accelerate access to capabilities in the new, and what we're calling the new at Accenture is now the combination of digital services, cloud services, security services or new technologies, if you will, such as cognitive computing, automation or artificial intelligence. Second is to have access to very deep industry expertise especially in consulting. That is the rationale for acquisition of Axia, Javelin companies, consulting deep structure, iTRAK, either deep industry expertise in upstream energy, in retail. That's the reason -- that's number two. And the number three would be to scale faster, to take the leadership position in the marketplace, and by leadership, we mean the #1. I'm thinking about Procurian. I'm thinking about Cloud Sherpas. I would put in that category scale to lead, putting more distance between Accenture and the competition. Three reasons where -- why we are doing acquisition, and then we grew organic on top of this acquisition. Probably one of the best case coming in my mind would be Procurian. We made the acquisition of Procurian. We became the #1 in procurement services. And since we made this acquisition, we've been scaling faster, and now we are the market leader, and the organic growth of our procurement services is even higher than the business case we set."

I mean, first of all, I would encourage you and others to look at the absolute amount because the absolute amount, as you referenced, I'll use my word, but your thought, I hope, is that it's outstanding. Our operating cash flow, our free cash flow exceeds net income, which I think is a standard for any company, which is indicative of outstanding cash flow. And we're in the range -- across our range, we're in the range of, let's say, a rounded 1.1 of free cash flow to net income. And so the absolute number is very, very strong. As we talked about before, there are many puts and takes in our cash flow in any particular year. Changes in DSO is an example. And we have allowed for the possibility -- not that this is what we're trying to drive our teams to, but we've allowed for the possibility of a slight uptick in DSOs. You also noticed that we have allowed for further CapEx spending, which is part of the increase. And then beyond that, there are differences in timings. For example, tax cash payments can be very different on 1 year to -- from 1 year to the next. And so there are many swings, but what I would encourage you to focus on is the absolute cash flow, which exceeds net income and is great indicator of a strong cash-generating company."

Well, first of all, Ed, I would say that if you look at the performance of our portfolio overall, we're quite pleased with the performance of our portfolio of acquisitions, from revenue through profitability and cash flow. And that's something we track very carefully, we review certainly ourselves but with our board as well each quarter. And we believe we have some pretty high hurdles, financial hurdles for the transactions that we do. Having said that, as you know, it certainly wouldn't be unusual for an acquisition to be dilutive in the first year or 2 possibly. But we do -- one of our hurdles is the pace at which a deal becomes on par and then accretive. But certainly, in the first couple of years, they can be dilutive. I'd also point out that whereas many other companies in our sector tend to adjust for certain types of acquisition-related costs, the amortization of intangibles, things like performance retention payments at the time of closure, third-party fees, et cetera, we've chosen not to do that, and we report our margin all in. To date, our margin expansion commitment has been based on a philosophy that we absorb those as part of our investments and we drive the business forward. And of course, that's just one part of our investment. We have investments that go well beyond that. The impressive thing about our profit model to date is that when you look at that 20 basis points of expansion, underneath that, we are driving significant efficiency across our business to absorb the investment to acquisition and otherwise. And that's an important story to understand, so I'm glad you asked that question."

So if you look at our guide for quarter 1, the range is 6% to 9% in local-currency growth. I mean, when I look at quarter 1 or the full year maybe, Lisa, if you'll -- I'll just -- let me just expand my comments a little bit. I mean, when you look at",402,"Yes. So if you look at our guide for quarter 1, the range is 6% to 9% in local-currency growth. I mean, when I look at quarter 1 or the full year maybe, Lisa, if you'll -- I'll just -- let me just expand my comments a little bit. I mean, when you look at our guidance, you first of all have to understand what is our assumption on market growth. And we assume that the market will continue to grow plus or minus in the 4% range. And so when you look at our guidance for the year, certainly, if you look at our guidance for quarter 1, the same would apply through -- across that range but certainly at the upper end of that range, it reflects taking significant market share, continuing to take significant market share, which is our strategic objective. The other thing that you have to consider goes back to some of the discussion that Pierre had, I believe, with Darrin on the growth markets and the risk profile. But also, I think when we look at the macro environment in general, relative to where we were 90 days ago, I would say relative to where we were at this time last year, the volatility and risk of the macro -- in the macro environment has clicked up a notch or 2, and so that's factored in. The other thing that we think about when we look at our guidance is that it's as important, if not more important, to look at the absolute dollars as it is the percentage, whether it be the first quarter or the full year. And if you just look at the full year, before you adjust for the FX headwind, just taking that out and look at the underlying growth, at the upper end of our range, we would be adding about $2.5 billion of revenue, excluding the impact of FX in fiscal '16, which is a pretty healthy number. And so we work hard to drive to the upper end of the range although the range reflects what we think are the range of possibilities. And as it relates to the full year, we're early in the year. And as we did last year, we'll adjust as we go. That was more of an answer than your question, but it gave me an opportunity to share some of those thoughts."

And I would call probably the same trend. It's fascinating to see that the digital rotation we've seen in Europe is as strong, even slightly stronger than the one we could see in the U.S. It appears that our target clients, mainly the premium brand in the G2000 we are serving in Europe, are really accelerating their investments in terms of digital rotation. Second, we had some very significant transactions leveraging Accenture Operations with our business process services. I'm thinking about -- I mean, the finance and accounting, the HR, the procurement as well. And it's made a significant source of growth. And overall, the consulting is back, probably driven as well with the digital-related services. So for Europe, again, the clients we are serving, more than the GUs, are reinvesting with always an eye on rationalization, driving good growth for Accenture Operations and the other eye on growth and digital, which is driving more business for Accenture Digital, Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting and, of course, the leadership of Jo Deblaere."

We had a strong first quarter and I'm very pleased with our results and the continuing momentum in our business. Our revenue growth was again broad-based across the different dimension of our business, including double-digit local currency growth in 3 of our 5 operating groups and in North America and Europe, our 2 largest geographic regions. I'm particularly pleased with our results in digital related services where we delivered very strong revenue growth of more than 20%. 
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered $7.7 billion in new bookings, which were in line with our expectations. We grew revenues 10% in local currency, gaining significant market share. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 15.2%. We delivered earnings per share of $1.28, which includes a negative impact of $0.07 from the higher tax rate in the quarter. We generated solid free cash flow of $517 million, and we returned approximately $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend. So we're a good start in fiscal 2016. And given our strong performance, we have raised our outlook for revenue growth for the full year. 
Now let me hand it over to David, over to you."

Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, especially as it relates to our strong broad-",1272,"Thank you, Pierre, and happy holidays to all of you and thank you for taking the time to join us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, especially as it relates to our strong broad-based topline growth. Our differentiated growth strategy, which focuses on 5 businesses delivered in an industry relevant context continues to resonate with the market and yield strong value for our clients and our shareholders. 
Before I get into the details, let me comment on a few of the highlights this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 10% represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as we continue to outpace the market and take share. The durability of our growth model is evident in our results with double-digit growth in 3 of the 5 operating groups in both Europe and North America. Digital related services continues to be the dominant growth theme as we continue to be a market leader in the rotation to the new home. Operating margin of 15.2% reflects 20 basis points of expansion consistent with our objective to expand margins while investing significantly in our business and our people. Free cash flow came in as expected at just over $500 million. And at the same time, we returned roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continue to invest at scale in our business closing 4 acquisitions in the quarter with invested capital of over $600 million, which represents a great start towards our fiscal '16 objective to invest as much as $900 million to $1 billion to add scale and capabilities in key growth areas. 
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $7.7 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.4 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $3.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings on our first quarter, which then build throughout the year. It is important to note that this level of new bookings represents 9% growth in local currency over last year's quarter 1, with a significant portion expected to convert to revenue in fiscal '16. 
The highlight of the quarter was strong consulting bookings, which reflect 24% growth in local currency over last year, fueled by demand for digital related services across Accenture's strategy, Accenture consulting and application services. 
Looking forward, we're very pleased with the expansion in our pipeline and expect strong bookings in the second quarter. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8 billion, a 1.5% increase in USD, 10% local currency, reflecting a negative 8.5% FX impact consistent with the assumption we provided in September. Quarter 1 revenues were roughly $60 million above the upper end of our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected consulting revenues. 
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD and 15% local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 4% in USD and an increase of 5% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter, digital related services grew over 20% in local currency and fueled strong double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined. Operations and application services came in as expected with high single-digit growth and mid single-digit growth, respectively. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Communications, Media and Technology grew 12%, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Growth was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets as well as communications and media and entertainment globally. Financial Services strong momentum continued to 12% growth driven by very strong growth in banking and capital markets and in both Europe and the growth markets. Products also delivered broad-based growth of 12% led by our industrial and life sciences industries, with continued very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. H&PS grew 8% of the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our health industry, which again delivered double-digit growth and additionally, H&PS grew double digits overall in North America, including in both health and the public sector. Finally, Resources delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% growth led by strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. Revenue performance in the energy industry and in the growth markets was challenged this quarter due to industry and country specific cyclical headwinds. 
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32% compared to 32.2% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.9% compared with 11.5% for the first quarter last year, down 60 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.8% compared with 5.6% for the first quarter last year, up 20 basis points. 
Operating income was $1.2 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 15.2% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 1 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.1% for the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations and other adjustments to prior year taxes compared to the first quarter of last year. As you know, our quarterly tax rate can vary and our view of our full-year tax rate has not changed as you'll hear when I provide our business outlook in a few minutes. 
Net income was $869 million for the first quarter compared with net income of $892 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.28 compared with EPS of $1.29 in the first quarter last year. As I just referenced, there was a $0.07 impact to EPS this quarter from a higher tax rate compared to the first quarter last year. 
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. There were 41 days compared to 37 days last quarter and in the first quarter of last year. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $517 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $611 million net of property and equipment additions of $95 million. 
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at November 30 was $3.1 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. The current levels reflect both the cash return to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and our investments and acquisitions. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of 373,000 people, with 270,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. Utilization was 90% compared with last quarter, consistent with last quarter. Attrition was 13%, down 1% from quarter 4 and consistent with the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.5 million shares for $658 million at an average price of $100.53 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share for a total of $721 million. This represented an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the dividend we paid in May. 
So in summary, we're off to a very good start in fiscal '16. Our top line results and our increased revenue outlook for the year, which I'll cover shortly, reflect continued strong momentum in our business. Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. At our investor and analyst conference in November, we provided an update on the actions we have taken and investments we have made to position Accenture to lead in the new, which we defined as digital, cloud and security related services, all enabled by new and innovative technology. 
In the first quarter, we continued to rapidly rotate our business to the new, with digital, cloud and security revenues combined already approaching 40% of our total revenue. So the investments we are making in these areas are clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace and driving significant growth. 
Let me bring this to light with a few examples. Digital. It's all about enabling our clients to unleash the power of digital technologies to create new sources of value. We continue to see very strong demand in this area and are leveraging in our digital capabilities with clients in nearly every industry around the world. We are working on a 5-year digital transformation with the European aerospace company, bringing our capabilities in mobility, analytics and the Internet of Things to drive productivity improvements. We are helping a global pharma company, improve its supply chain by leveraging our advanced analytics capability, including the Accenture platform giving patients and doctors access to the diagnostics and medicine they need faster than ever. 
Cloud is increasingly becoming a starting point for clients who want to create new services faster and get access to computing capabilities in a more cost-effective way. We are working with the leading U.S. energy company to deliver a new operating model underpinned by the Accenture Cloud platform and our hybrid cloud solution. With this new as a service model, the client leverage our cloud-based data analytics while benefiting from a flexible consumption-based pricing structure. At Accenture, we have a Cloud First agenda to help clients move their businesses to the Cloud quickly and easily, and we continue to invest to build our capabilities. 
In September, we announced the acquisition of Patterson and in October, we announced the new partnership with Amazon Web Services. The newly formed Amazon AWS business group will offer integrated consulting and technology solutions to help clients take advantage of the flexibility of another service model. 
Turning to security. In the digital and connected world, security is increasingly important to our clients. We are now leveraging Fusion ex, a cyber security business we acquired in Q4 and our work with our global IT company. We identify gaps in the clients' differences are simulating a sophisticated cyber attack and we are in now working with them to improve their security strategy. And of course, we continue to work with clients on large-scale, mission-critical transformation programs. We bring our full range of services and strategy, consulting, digital technology and operations together with our industry expertise to deliver tangible outcomes for clients. As an example, we are working with the global manufacturer on an enterprise-wide transformation to reduce back-office costs by 50% and position the company for growth. As a first step, we are enhancing the efficiency and quality of the client's finance and accounting processes across 26 countries while significantly reducing costs. 
Turning now to the performance of our 3 geographic regions. In North America, I am very pleased that we again, delivered double-digit growth. The 11% increase in revenues was driven by strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we had another great quarter with 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in many of our markets such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Switzerland as well as high single-digit growth in Germany. And in growth markets, we delivered 6% growth in local currency, led by Japan, the largest country in our growth markets. Japan has delivered 8 quarters in a row of double-digit growth. At the same time, we are carefully monitoring the situation in Australia and Brazil, which have been affected by commodity price volatility in the energy and natural resources sectors. 
Before I turn it back to David, let me comment on talent and leadership at Accenture. I am extremely pleased that we just promoted and recruited 723 people to Managing Director and Senior Managing Director, and I'm particularly pleased that 28% of our new promotes are women. These promotions reflect our commitment to growth to people and developing the talented leaders we need to serve our clients and run Accenture as a world-class business. 
So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with the continued momentum in our business. We are executing our strategy very well and our rotation to the new, combined with our unique ability to deliver end to end solutions our clients continues to drive strong demand. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal '15. 
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 6% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. For our operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. We continue to expect our effective tax rate, our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. 
For earnings per share, we continue to expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24, or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment editions to be approximately $500 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. We continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and now expect to reduce the rate of weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

I mean, when you pull outsourcing back, as a type of work and then related to our business, our 5 businesses, a large part of operations, a significant operations is part of the outsourcing type of work and then the application maintenance piece of application services as part of the outsourcing type of work as well. Within operations, the core driver is BPO and I'll say, we continue to feel very good about our BPO business. The growth rates have been such that we've continued to take significant share. And if you look at our operations business overall, our expectation for growth remains the same, no different from what I communicated at IA Day we think our operating operations business will grow very well at in the upper single or low double-digit range, and of course, BPO is a key anchor to that. If you look at the other component of applications are outsourcing with the application maintenance within application services, let me say that for application services, we now see mid-single digit growth as we've talked about there's kind of 2 components in application services. There's the maintenance of the existing kind of legacy applications for our clients, which is an important function. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there's the investment in new technology and the deployment of new technology. So when you look at out services, we see extremely strong growth in the project-based work in application services. That work related to deploying and building new technology. That is reflected in our consulting type of work, which is why you see consulting type of work growth so strong. What we see is clients are looking to reduce their cost of ownership of their existing applications. So therefore, there's relatively less investment in the maintenance piece in lieu of higher investments in the development piece."

A key component of what Pierre just said is that our talent strategy is aligned with our 5 businesses. And so we have talent that is managed, nurtured and developed specific to Accenture Strategy. Those people tend to work essentially exclusively on Accenture Strategy work. We have people that are identified as Accenture Consulting, developed and nurtured, et cetera. Those people tend to work for the most part exclusively of consulting work. Probably, that includes our client account leads, people that are predominantly deployed to our operating groups that really not only deliver consulting services but are also the integrator of Accenture capabilities to serve the client's needs. You have operations where again we have talent model for operations. Mike Salvino and Debra Polishook manage that work force. They, for the most part, work exclusively in operations. And then you have Accenture Technology. And Accenture Technology is a little bit different in that they have a unique talent model, but yet some of those technology people support the development type work, the new tech. Some of those people may actually be even part of consulting project delivery. We also have some of those people that at points in time maybe part of our operations project delivery.

We delivered earnings per share of $1.28, which includes a negative impact of $0.07 from the higher tax rate in the quarter. We generated solid free cash flow of $517 million, and we returned approximately $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend.

Happy holidays to all of you, and thank you for taking the time to join us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, especially as it relates to our strong and broad",1265,"Thank you, Pierre. Happy holidays to all of you, and thank you for taking the time to join us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, especially as it relates to our strong and broad-based top line growth. Our differentiated growth strategy, which focuses on 5 businesses, delivered in an industry relevant context, continues to resonate with the market and yield strong value for our clients and our shareholders.
Before I get into the details, let me comment on a few of the highlights this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 10% represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as we continue to outpace the market and take share. The durability of our growth model is evident in our results with double-digit growth in 3 of the 5 operating groups and both Europe and North America. Digital-related services continues to be the dominant growth theme as we continue to be a market leader in the rotation to the new. Operating margin of 15.2% reflects 20 basis points of expansion, consistent with our objective to expand margins while investing significantly in our business and our people. Free cash flow came in as expected at just over $500 million. And at the same time, we returned roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continue to invest at scale in our business, closing 4 acquisitions in the quarter with invested capital of over $600 million, which represents a great start towards our fiscal '16 objective to invest as much as $900 million to $1 billion to add scale and capabilities in key growth areas.
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $7.7 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.4 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $3.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in our first quarter, which then build throughout the year. It's important to note that this level of new bookings represents 9% growth in local currency over last year's quarter 1, with a significant portion expected to convert to revenue in fiscal '16.
The highlight of the quarter was strong consulting bookings, which reflect 24% growth in local currency over last year, fueled by demand for digital-related services across Accenture's strategy, Accenture consulting and application services.
Looking forward, we're very pleased with the expansion in our pipeline and expect strong bookings in the second quarter.
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8 billion, a 1.5% increase in USD, 10% local currency, reflecting a negative 8.5% FX impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in September. Quarter 1 revenues were roughly $60 million above the upper end of our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected consulting revenues.
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD and 15% local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 4% USD and an increase of 5% in local currency.
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. Digital-related services grew over 20% local currency and fueled strong double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined. Operations and application services came in as expected with high single-digit growth and mid-single-digit growth, respectively.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology grew 12%, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Growth was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets as well as communications and media and entertainment globally. Financial Services' strong momentum continued, with 12% growth driven by very strong growth in banking and capital markets and in both Europe and the growth markets. Products also delivered broad-based growth of 12%, led by our industrial and life sciences industries, with continued very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. H&PS grew 8% in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our health industry, which again delivered double-digit growth. And additionally, H&PS grew double digits overall in North America, including in both health and the public sector. Finally, Resources delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% growth, led by strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. Revenue performance in the energy industry and in the growth markets was challenged this quarter due to industry- and country-specific cyclical headwinds.
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32% compared to 32.2% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.9% compared with 11.5% for the first quarter last year, down 60 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.8% compared with 5.6% for the first quarter last year, up 20 basis points.
Operating income was $1.2 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 15.2% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 1 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.1% for the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations and other adjustments to prior year taxes compared to the first quarter of last year. As you know, our quarterly tax rate can vary, and our view of our full year tax rate has not changed, as you'll hear when I provide our business outlook in a few minutes.
Net income was $869 million for the first quarter compared with net income of $892 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.28 compared with EPS of $1.29 in the first quarter last year. As I just referenced, there was a $0.07 impact to EPS this quarter from the higher tax rate compared to the first quarter last year.
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. There were 41 days compared to 37 days last quarter and in the first quarter of last year.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $517 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $611 million, net of property and equipment additions of $95 million.
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at November 30 was $3.1 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. The current levels reflect both the cash returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and our investments and acquisitions.
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of 373,000 people, with 270,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. Utilization was 90% compared with last quarter, consistent with last quarter. Attrition was 13%, down 1% from quarter 4 and consistent with the same period last year.
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.5 million shares for $658 million at an average price of $100.53 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share for a total of $721 million. This represented an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the dividend we paid in May.
So in summary, we're off to a very good start in fiscal '16. Our top line results and our increased revenue outlook for the year, which I'll cover shortly, reflect continued strong momentum in our business.
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October, we provided an update on the actions we have taken and investments we have made to position Accenture to lead in the new, which we define as digital, cloud and security-related services, all enabled by new and innovative technology.
In the first quarter, we continued to rapidly rotate our business to the new, with digital, cloud and security revenues combined already approaching 40% of our total revenue. So the investments we are making in these areas are clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace and driving significant growth.
Let me bring this to light with a few examples. Digital is all about enabling our clients to unleash the power of digital technologies to create new sources of value. We continue to see very strong demand in this area and are leveraging our digital capabilities with clients in nearly every industry around the world. We are working on a 5-year digital transformation with a European aerospace company, bringing our capabilities in mobility, analytics and the Internet of Things to drive productivity improvements. We are helping a global pharma company improve its supply chain by leveraging our advanced analytics capability, including the Accenture Insights platform, ultimately giving patients and doctors access to the diagnostics and medicine they need faster than ever.
Cloud is increasingly becoming a starting point for clients who want to create new services faster and get access to computing capabilities in a more cost-effective way. We are working with a leading U.S. energy company to deliver a new operating model underpinned by the Accenture Cloud platform and our hybrid cloud solution. With this new-as-a-service model, the client leveraged our cloud-based data analytics while benefited from a flexible consumption-based pricing structure. At Accenture, we have a Cloud First agenda to help clients move their businesses to the cloud quickly and easily, and we continue to invest to build our capabilities.
In September, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Sherpas, and in October, we announced the new partnership with Amazon Web Services. The newly formed Amazon AWS business group will offer integrated consulting and technology solutions to help clients take advantage of the flexibility of another service model.
Turning to security. In the digital and connected world, security is increasingly important to our clients. We are now leveraging FusionX, a cyber security business we acquired in Q4 in our work with a global high-tech company. We identified gaps in the clients' differences are simulating a sophisticated cyber attack, and we are now working with them to improve their security strategy. And of course, we continue to work with clients on large-scale, mission-critical transformation programs. We bring our full range of services and strategy, consulting, digital technology and operations, together with our industry expertise, to deliver tangible outcomes for clients. As an example, we are working with a global apparel manufacturer on an enterprise-wide transformation to reduce back-office costs by 50% and position the company for growth. As a first step, we are enhancing the efficiency and quality of the client's finance and accounting processes across 26 countries while significantly reducing costs.
Turning now to the performance of our 3 geographic regions. In North America, I am very pleased that we again delivered double-digit growth. The 11% increase in revenues was driven by strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we had another great quarter, with 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in many of our emerging markets such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Switzerland as well as high single-digit growth in Germany. And in growth markets, we delivered 6% growth in local currency, led by Japan, the largest country in our growth markets. Japan has delivered 8 quarters in a row of double-digit growth. At the same time, we are carefully monitoring the situation in Australia and Brazil, which have been affected by commodity price volatility in the energy and natural resources sectors.
Before I turn it back to David, let me comment on talent and leadership at Accenture. I am extremely pleased that we just promoted a record 723 people to Managing Director and Senior Managing Director, and I'm particularly pleased that 28% of our new promotes are women. These promotions reflect our commitment to carry our growth for people and to developing the talented leaders we need to serve our clients and run Accenture as a world-class business.
So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with the continued momentum in our business. We are executing our strategy very well. And our rotation to the new, combined with our unique ability to deliver end-to-end solutions to clients, continues to drive strong demand.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the second quarter of fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $7.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal '15.
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 6% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal '15.
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. We continue to expect our effective tax rate -- our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%.
For earnings per share, we continue to expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results.
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. We continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and now expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

I mean, when you pull outsourcing back, the -- as a type of work and then related to our business, our 5 businesses, a large part of operations, a significant portion of operations is part of the outsourcing type of work and then the application maintenance piece of application services as part of the outsourcing type of work as well. Within operations, the core driver is BPO, and I'll say, we continue to feel very good about our BPO business. The growth rates have been such that we've continued to take significant share. And if you look at our operations business overall, our expectation for growth remains the same, no different from what I communicated at IA Day where we think our operating -- operations business will grow very well in the upper single or low double-digit range, and of course, BPO is a key anchor to that. If you look at the other component of outsourcing with the application maintenance within application services, let me say that for application services, we now see mid-single-digit growth. As we've talked about, there's kind of 2 components in application services. There's the maintenance of the existing kind of legacy applications for our clients, which is an important function. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there's the investment in new technology and the deployment of new technology. So when you look at app services, we see extremely strong growth in the project-based work in application services. That work related to deploying and building new technology, that is reflected in our consulting type of work, which is why you see consulting type of work growth so strong. What we see is clients are looking to reduce their cost of ownership of their existing applications. So therefore, there's relatively less investment in the maintenance piece in lieu of higher investments in the development piece."

Those can ebb and flow across the quarters of the year, and that was a factor in the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter of last year. Then change our expectation for the full year just means that we had a higher percentage of tax cash payments in the first quarter this year relative to the first quarter last year. So those really are the 2 drivers, tax cash payments and DSO."

I think it is important to kind of peel that back, and you'll understand that growth markets is appropriate when I say this is that we talked about the cyclical challenges in energy and natural resources, which is reflected in our Resources operating group results. So I can tell you that if you look at the growth markets absent the Resources operating group, which are attributed to the cyclical challenges that we know and understand in energy and natural resources, the rest of the Accenture business is growing double digits in the growth markets. And so it's important to peel that one layer back so that you can be exposed to the fact that we actually have a very vibrant business in the growth markets. On the other side, I think I get the essence of your question is that we have a fixed capacity of partners in the channel. And if they direct their focus to our Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and the development part of application services, is simply a function of if our capacity is focused on one part of our spectrum of our 5 businesses, does that mean by design that outsourcing goes down? And I would say not necessarily at all. I do think that there's a lot of activity in the consulting type of work, which is strategy consulting and the development part of app services. There's a lot of market activity and a lot of demand, and I think that's what the growth reflects. It's not so much about partners spending time on activity A versus activity B."

Indeed, in the growth markets, the explanation of the growth slowing down compared to prior quarters is all coming from this cyclical impact of energy and natural resources. Otherwise, we are very pleased. I mentioned Japan, part of our growth markets, again, posting a double-digit growth for, I think, 8 quarters now in a row, which is frankly a fabulous result, and we are taking opportunities in each and every market as per our strategy in outsourcing and in consulting. I think we did comment the difference between outsourcing and consulting momentum because of the digital-related services nature of the business, which is more around consulting than outsourcing, which is just a demonstration that budget from our clients are a bit moving from this outsourcing type of business to the consulting type of business. And as you see, in Europe, we strive to some growth. We are definitely putting our act together to create our own growth almost against the economic condition of the markets."

And to your question, indeed, they are run as a business with the objective of being top class in their own category. But of course, where we differentiate in the marketplace is our unique ability to combine our services to deliver what we are calling the end-to-end services because we truly believe that more and more clients are buying an outcome more than input. And if you want to deliver an outcome, you need to contribute and participate to the design and planning typically done by Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting, the high-value services and consultancy, if you will, then you move into building solution with absolutely leading and cutting-edge solutions, exactly the job of Accenture Digital for digital native solutions and Accenture technology for the leading platform solutions or application packages. When you have been building solution, you're moving to Accenture Operations, the part of Accenture where we could operate on behalf of the clients, either their business process, their cloud operation or their security operation. This depth and breadth and kind of operating model is absolutely unique in the marketplace and is a great source of differentiation for Accenture. And on top of that, indeed, Lisa, we're putting our rotation to the new. Each of the 5 have a clear mandate to rotate their business to new type of services. So Accenture Strategy is going to be -- being cutting-edge in developing digital technologies and creating new business model for clients. Accenture Technology will now embed very innovative ways of doing development, what we're calling liquid intelligence and connected. Accenture Operations, well, the extraordinary analytics which in the way we are developing operations and in security with the acquisition of FusionX. We are absolutely top of the game in terms of simulating cyber attack. So all these architecture we're putting in place, and I say that with a lot of passion and energy during that call, is indeed unique in the marketplace, Lisa."

A key component of what Pierre just said is that our talent strategy is aligned with our 5 businesses. And so we have talent that is managed, nurtured, developed specific to Accenture Strategy. Those people tend to work essentially exclusively on Accenture Strategy work. We have people that are identified at Accenture Consulting developed and nurtured, et cetera. Those people tend to work, for the most part, exclusively on consulting work. Probably that includes our client account leads, people who are predominantly deployed to our operating groups that really not only deliver consulting services but are also the integrator of Accenture capabilities to serve the client's need. You have operations where, again, we have a talent model for operations. Mike Salvino and Debbie Polishook manage that work force. They, for the most part, work exclusively in operations. And then you have Accenture Technology. And Accenture Technology is a little bit different in that they have a unique talent model, but yet some of those technology people support the development-type work, the new tech. Some of those people may actually even be part of consulting project delivery. We also have some of those people that at points in time maybe part of our operations project delivery. So they work a little bit more across the organization. But beyond technology, we also have the innovation labs and things like that. But excluding technology, the other businesses are very specific and fit for purpose in terms of the talent model and the types of projects those people work on for our clients."

I'm particularly pleased with our results in digital-related services where we delivered very strong revenue growth of more than 20%.
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered $7.7 billion in new bookings, which were in line with our expectations. We grew revenues 10% in local currency, gaining significant market share. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 15.2%. We delivered earnings per share of $1.28, which includes a negative impact of $0.07 from the higher tax rate in the quarter. We generated solid free cash flow of $517 million, and we returned approximately $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend. So we're off to a good start in fiscal year '16. And given our strong performance, we have raised our outlook for revenue growth for the full year.

Happy holidays to all of you, and thank you for taking the time to join us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, especially as it relates to our strong and broad-based top line growth. Our differentiated growth strategy, which focuses on 5 businesses, delivered in an industry relevant context, continues to resonate with the market and yield strong value for our clients and our shareholders.
Before I get into the details, let me comment on a few of the highlights this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 10% represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as we continue to outpace the market and take share. The durability of our growth model is evident in our results with double-digit growth in 3 of the 5 operating groups and both Europe and North America. Digital-related services continues to be the dominant growth theme as we continue to be a market leader in the rotation to the new. Operating margin of 15.2% reflects 20 basis points of expansion, consistent with our objective to expand margins while investing significantly in our business and our people. Free cash flow came in as expected at just over $500 million. And at the same time, we returned roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continue to invest at scale in our business, closing 4 acquisitions in the quarter with invested capital of over $600 million, which represents a great start towards our fiscal '16 objective to invest as much as $900 million to $1 billion to add scale and capabilities in key growth areas.
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $7.7 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.4 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $3.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in our first quarter, which then build throughout the year. It's important to note that this level of new bookings represents 9% growth in local currency over last year's quarter 1, with a significant portion expected to convert to revenue in fiscal '16.
The highlight of the quarter was strong consulting bookings, which reflect 24% growth in local currency over last year, fueled by demand for digital-related services across Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and application services.
Looking forward, we're very pleased with the expansion in our pipeline and expect strong bookings in the second quarter.
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8 billion, a 1.5% increase in USD, 10% local currency, reflecting a negative 8.5% FX impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in September. Quarter 1 revenues were roughly $60 million above the upper end of our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected consulting revenues.
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD and 15% local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 4% USD and an increase of 5% in local currency.
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. Digital-related services grew over 20% local currency and fueled strong double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined. Operations and application services came in as expected with high single-digit growth and mid-single-digit growth, respectively.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology grew 12%, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Growth was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets as well as communications and media and entertainment globally. Financial Services' strong momentum continued, with 12% growth driven by very strong growth in banking and capital markets and in both Europe and the growth markets. Products also delivered broad-based growth of 12%, led by our industrial and life sciences industries, with continued very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. H&PS grew 8% in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our health industry, which again delivered double-digit growth. And additionally, H&PS grew double digits overall in North America, including in both health and the public sector. Finally, Resources delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% growth, led by strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. Revenue performance in the energy industry and in the growth markets was challenged this quarter due to industry- and country-specific cyclical headwinds.
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32% compared to 32.2% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.9% compared with 11.5% for the first quarter last year, down 60 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.8% compared with 5.6% for the first quarter last year, up 20 basis points.
Operating income was $1.2 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 15.2% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 1 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.1% for the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations and other adjustments to prior year taxes compared to the first quarter of last year. As you know, our quarterly tax rate can vary, and our view of our full year tax rate has not changed, as you'll hear when I provide our business outlook in a few minutes.
Net income was $869 million for the first quarter compared with net income of $892 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.28 compared with EPS of $1.29 in the first quarter last year. As I just referenced, there was a $0.07 impact to EPS this quarter from the higher tax rate compared to the first quarter last year.
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. There were 41 days compared to 37 days last quarter and in the first quarter of last year.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $517 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $611 million, net of property and equipment additions of $95 million.
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at November 30 was $3.1 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. The current levels reflect both the cash returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and our investments and acquisitions.
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of 373,000 people, with 270,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. Utilization was 90% compared with last quarter, consistent with last quarter. Attrition was 13%, down 1% from quarter 4 and consistent with the same period last year.
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.5 million shares for $658 million at an average price of $100.53 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share for a total of $721 million. This represented an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the dividend we paid in May.
So in summary, we're off to a very good start in fiscal '16. Our top line results and our increased revenue outlook for the year, which I'll cover shortly, reflect continued strong momentum in our business.
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October, we provided an update on the actions we have taken and investments",821,"Thank you, David. Our strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October, we provided an update on the actions we have taken and investments we have made to position Accenture to lead in the new, which we define as digital, cloud and security-related services, all enabled by new and innovative technology.
In the first quarter, we continued to rapidly rotate our business to the new, with digital, cloud and security revenues combined already approaching 40% of our total revenue. So the investments we are making in these areas are clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace and driving significant growth.
Let me bring this to light with a few examples. Digital is all about enabling our clients to unleash the power of digital technologies to create new sources of value. We continue to see very strong demand in this area and are leveraging our digital capabilities with clients in nearly every industry around the world. We are working on a 5-year digital transformation with a European aerospace company, bringing our capabilities in mobility, analytics and the Internet of Things to drive productivity improvements. We are helping a global pharma company improve its supply chain by leveraging our advanced analytics capability, including the Accenture Insights platform, ultimately giving patients and doctors access to the diagnostics and medicine they need faster than ever.
Cloud is increasingly becoming a starting point for clients who want to create new services faster and get access to computing capabilities in a more cost-effective way. We are working with a leading U.S. energy company to deliver a new operating model underpinned by the Accenture Cloud platform and our hybrid cloud solution. With this new-as-a-service model, the client leveraged our cloud-based data analytics while benefited from a flexible consumption-based pricing structure. At Accenture, we have a Cloud First agenda to help clients move their businesses to the cloud quickly and easily, and we continue to invest to build our capabilities.
In September, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Sherpas, and in October, we announced a new partnership with Amazon Web Services. The newly formed Amazon AWS business group will offer integrated consulting and technology solutions to help clients take advantage of the flexibility of another service model.
Turning to security. In the digital and connected world, security is increasingly important to our clients. We are now leveraging FusionX, a cyber security business we acquired in Q4 in our work with a global high-tech company. We identified gaps in the clients' differences by simulating a sophisticated cyber attack, and we are now working with them to improve their security strategy. And of course, we continue to work with clients on large-scale, mission-critical transformation programs. We bring our full range of services and strategy, consulting, digital technology and operations, together with our industry expertise, to deliver tangible outcomes for clients. As an example, we are working with a global apparel manufacturer on an enterprise-wide transformation to reduce back-office costs by 50% and position the company for growth. As a first step, we are enhancing the efficiency and quality of the client's finance and accounting processes across 26 countries while significantly reducing costs.
Turning now to the performance of our 3 geographic regions. In North America, I am very pleased that we again delivered double-digit growth. The 11% increase in revenues was driven by strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we had another great quarter, with 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in many of our major markets such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Switzerland as well as high single-digit growth in Germany. And in growth markets, we delivered 6% growth in local currency, led by Japan, the largest country in our growth markets. Japan has delivered 8 quarters in a row of double-digit growth. At the same time, we are carefully monitoring the situation in Australia and Brazil, which have been affected by commodity price volatility in the energy and natural resources sectors.
Before I turn it back to David, let me comment on talent and leadership at Accenture. I am extremely pleased that we just promoted a record 723 people to Managing Director and Senior Managing Director, and I'm particularly pleased that 28% of our new promotes are women. These promotions reflect our commitment to carry our growth for people and to developing the talented leaders we need to serve our clients and run Accenture as a world-class business.
So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with the continued momentum in our business. We are executing our strategy very well. And our rotation to the new, combined with our unique ability to deliver end-to-end solutions to clients, continues to drive strong demand.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the second quarter of fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $7.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal '15.
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 6% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal '15.
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. We continue to expect our effective tax rate -- our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%.
For earnings per share, we continue to expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results.
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. We continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and now expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?"

I mean, when you pull outsourcing back, the -- as a type of work and then related to our business, our 5 businesses, a large part of operations, a significant portion of operations is part of the outsourcing type of work and then the application maintenance piece of application services as part of the outsourcing type of work as well. Within operations, the core driver is BPO, and I'll say, we continue to feel very good about our BPO business. The growth rates have been such that we've continued to take significant share. And if you look at our operations business overall, our expectation for growth remains the same, no different from what I communicated at IA Day where we think our operating -- operations business will grow very well in the upper single or low double-digit range, and of course, BPO is a key anchor to that. If you look at the other component of outsourcing would be application maintenance within application services, let me say that for application services, we now see mid-single-digit growth. As we've talked about, there's kind of 2 components in application services. There's the maintenance of the existing kind of legacy applications for our clients, which is an important function. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there's the investment in new technology and the deployment of new technology. So when you look at app services, we see extremely strong growth in the project-based work in application services. That work related to deploying and building new technology, that is reflected in our consulting type of work, which is why you see consulting type of work growth so strong. What we see is clients are looking to reduce their cost of ownership of their existing applications. So therefore, there's relatively less investment in the maintenance piece in lieu of higher investments in the development piece."

Right now, you've got your growth markets, which currently looks a little bit like a misnomer, right? Your growth markets are growing at half the rate of the U.S. and Europe. And consulting, even on an organic basis, is growing a lot faster than outsourcing. Is that partly a function of where your partners are spending their time in the pipeline and it's really -- it wouldn't be feasible for us to expect you to grow outsourcing and consulting right at this sort of a double-digit pace because your partners can only spend their time on certain things at -- in 1 given quarter?"

I think it is important to kind of peel that back, and you'll understand that growth markets is appropriate when I say this is that we talked about the cyclical challenges in energy and natural resources, which is reflected in our Resources operating group results. So I can tell you that if you look at the growth markets absent the Resources operating group, which are attributed to the cyclical challenges that we know and understand in energy and natural resources, the rest of the Accenture business is growing double digits in the growth markets. And so it's important to peel that one layer back so that you can be exposed to the fact that we actually have a very vibrant business in the growth markets. On the other side, I think I get the essence of your question is that we have a fixed capacity of partners in the channel. And if they direct their focus to our Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and the development part of application services, is it's simply a function of if our capacity is focused on one part of our spectrum of our 5 businesses, does that mean by design that outsourcing goes down? And I would say not necessarily at all. I do think that there's a lot of activity in the consulting type of work, which is strategy consulting and the development part of app services. There's a lot of market activity and a lot of demand, and I think that's what the growth reflects. It's not so much about partners spending time on activity A versus activity B."

We have clear leaders in the 3, with Julie Sweet in North America, Gianfranco Casati in growth markets and Jo Deblaere in Europe. They are executing their strategy, so there is not a priori or some biased views on this. Indeed, in the growth markets, the explanation of the growth slowing down compared to prior quarters is all coming from this cyclical impact of energy and natural resources. Otherwise, we are very pleased. I mentioned Japan, part of our growth markets, again, posting a double-digit growth for, I think, 8 quarters now in a row, which is frankly a fabulous result, and we are taking opportunities in each and every market as per our strategy in outsourcing and in consulting. I think we did comment the difference between outsourcing and consulting momentum because of the digital-related services nature of the business, which is more around consulting than outsourcing, which is just a demonstration that budget from our clients are a bit moving from this outsourcing type of business to the consulting type of business. And as you see, in Europe, we strive for some growth. We are definitely putting our act together to create our own growth almost against the economic condition of the markets."

Happy to comment on this because I truly believe that we are proposing to the marketplace and organizing Accenture in a very unique and differentiated way. And I understand and believe that none of our competitors yet could match the capabilities and the organization we're putting in place.

And to your question, indeed, they are run as a business with the objective of being top class in their own category. But of course, where we differentiate in the marketplace is our unique ability to combine our services to deliver what we are calling the end-to-end services because we truly believe that more and more clients are buying an outcome more than input. And if you want to deliver an outcome, you need to contribute and participate to the design and planning typically done by Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting, the high-value services and consultancy, if you will, then you move into building solution with absolutely leading and cutting-edge solutions, exactly the job of Accenture Digital for digital native solutions and Accenture technology for the leading platform solutions or application packages. When you have been building solution, you're moving to Accenture Operations, the part of Accenture where we could operate on behalf of the clients, either their business process, their cloud operation or their security operation. This depth and breadth and kind of operating model is absolutely unique in the marketplace and is a great source of differentiation for Accenture. And on top of that, indeed, Lisa, we're putting our rotation to the new. Each of the 5 have a clear mandate to rotate their business to new type of services. For Accenture Strategy is going to be -- being cutting-edge in developing digital technologies and creating new business model for clients. Accenture Technology will now embed very innovative ways of doing development, what we're calling liquid intelligence and connected. Accenture Operations will be extraordinary analytics, rich in the way we are developing operations and in security with the acquisition of FusionX. We are absolutely top of the game in terms of simulating a cyber attack. So all this architecture we're putting in place, and I say that with a lot of passion and energy during that call, is indeed unique in the marketplace, Lisa."

Those people tend to work, for the most part, exclusively on consulting work. Probably that includes our client account leads, people who are predominantly deployed to our operating groups that really not only deliver consulting services but are also the integrator of Accenture capabilities to serve the client's need. You have operations where, again, we have a talent model for operations. Mike Salvino and Debbie Polishook manage that work force. They, for the most part, work exclusively in operations. And then you have Accenture Technology.

Some of those people may actually even be part of consulting project delivery. We also have some of those people that at points in time may be part of our operations project delivery.

I'm particularly pleased with our results in digital-related services where we delivered very strong revenue growth of more than 20%.
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered $7.7 billion in new bookings, which were in line with our expectations. We grew revenues 10% in local currency, gaining significant market share. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 15.2%. We delivered earnings per share of $1.28, which includes a negative impact of $0.07 from the higher tax rate in the quarter. We generated solid free cash flow of $517 million, and we returned approximately $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend. So we're off to a good start in fiscal year '16. And given our strong performance, we have raised our outlook for revenue growth for the full year.

Happy holidays to all of you, and thank you for taking the time to join us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, especially as it relates to our strong and broad-based top line growth. Our differentiated growth strategy, which focuses on 5 businesses, delivered in an industry relevant context, continues to resonate with the market and yield strong value for our clients and our shareholders.
Before I get into the details, let me comment on a few of the highlights this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 10% represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as we continue to outpace the market and take share. The durability of our growth model is evident in our results with double-digit growth in 3 of the 5 operating groups and both Europe and North America. Digital-related services continues to be the dominant growth theme as we continue to be a market leader in the rotation to the new. Operating margin of 15.2% reflects 20 basis points of expansion, consistent with our objective to expand margins while investing significantly in our business and our people. Free cash flow came in as expected at just over $500 million. And at the same time, we returned roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continue to invest at scale in our business, closing 4 acquisitions in the quarter with invested capital of over $600 million, which represents a great start towards our fiscal '16 objective to invest as much as $900 million to $1 billion to add scale and capabilities in key growth areas.
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $7.7 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.4 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $3.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in our first quarter, which then build throughout the year. It's important to note that this level of new bookings represents 9% growth in local currency over last year's quarter 1, with a significant portion expected to convert to revenue in fiscal '16.
The highlight of the quarter was strong consulting bookings, which reflect 24% growth in local currency over last year, fueled by demand for digital-related services across Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and application services.
Looking forward, we're very pleased with the expansion in our pipeline and expect strong bookings in the second quarter.
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8 billion, a 1.5% increase in USD, 10% local currency, reflecting a negative 8.5% FX impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in September. Quarter 1 revenues were roughly $60 million above the upper end of our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected consulting revenues.
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD and 15% local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 4% USD and an increase of 5% in local currency.
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. Digital-related services grew over 20% local currency and fueled strong double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined. Operations and application services came in as expected with high single-digit growth and mid-single-digit growth, respectively.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology grew 12%, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Growth was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets as well as communications and media and entertainment globally. Financial Services' strong momentum continued, with 12% growth driven by very strong growth in banking and capital markets and in both Europe and the growth markets. Products also delivered broad-based growth of 12%, led by our industrial and life sciences industries, with continued very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. H&PS grew 8% in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our health industry, which again delivered double-digit growth. And additionally, H&PS grew double digits overall in North America, including in both health and the public sector. Finally, Resources delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% growth, led by strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. Revenue performance in the energy industry and in the growth markets was challenged this quarter due to industry- and country-specific cyclical headwinds.
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32% compared to 32.2% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.9% compared with 11.5% for the first quarter last year, down 60 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.8% compared with 5.6% for the first quarter last year, up 20 basis points.
Operating income was $1.2 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 15.2% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 1 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.1% for the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations and other adjustments to prior year taxes compared to the first quarter of last year. As you know, our quarterly tax rate can vary, and our view of our full year tax rate has not changed, as you'll hear when I provide our business outlook in a few minutes.
Net income was $869 million for the first quarter compared with net income of $892 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.28 compared with EPS of $1.29 in the first quarter last year. As I just referenced, there was a $0.07 impact to EPS this quarter from the higher tax rate compared to the first quarter last year.
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. There were 41 days compared to 37 days last quarter and in the first quarter of last year.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $517 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $611 million, net of property and equipment additions of $95 million.
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at November 30 was $3.1 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. The current levels reflect both the cash returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and our investments and acquisitions.
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of 373,000 people, with 270,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. Utilization was 90% compared with last quarter, consistent with last quarter. Attrition was 13%, down 1% from quarter 4 and consistent with the same period last year.
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.5 million shares for $658 million at an average price of $100.53 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share for a total of $721 million. This represented an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the dividend we paid in May.
So in summary, we're off to a very good start in fiscal '16. Our top line results and our increased revenue outlook for the year, which I'll cover shortly, reflect continued strong momentum in our business.
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October, we provided an update on the actions we have taken and investments",821,"Thank you, David. Our strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October, we provided an update on the actions we have taken and investments we have made to position Accenture to lead in the new, which we define as digital, cloud and security-related services, all enabled by new and innovative technology.
In the first quarter, we continued to rapidly rotate our business to the new, with digital, cloud and security revenues combined already approaching 40% of our total revenue. So the investments we are making in these areas are clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace and driving significant growth.
Let me bring this to light with a few examples. Digital is all about enabling our clients to unleash the power of digital technologies to create new sources of value. We continue to see very strong demand in this area and are leveraging our digital capabilities with clients in nearly every industry around the world. We are working on a 5-year digital transformation with a European aerospace company, bringing our capabilities in mobility, analytics and the Internet of Things to drive productivity improvements. We are helping a global pharma company improve its supply chain by leveraging our advanced analytics capability, including the Accenture Insights platform, ultimately giving patients and doctors access to the diagnostics and medicine they need faster than ever.
Cloud is increasingly becoming a starting point for clients who want to create new services faster and get access to computing capabilities in a more cost-effective way. We are working with a leading U.S. energy company to deliver a new operating model underpinned by the Accenture Cloud platform and our hybrid cloud solution. With this new-as-a-service model, the client leveraged our cloud-based data analytics while benefited from a flexible consumption-based pricing structure. At Accenture, we have a Cloud First agenda to help clients move their businesses to the cloud quickly and easily, and we continue to invest to build our capabilities.
In September, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Sherpas, and in October, we announced a new partnership with Amazon Web Services. The newly formed Amazon AWS business group will offer integrated consulting and technology solutions to help clients take advantage of the flexibility of another service model.
Turning to security. In the digital and connected world, security is increasingly important to our clients. We are now leveraging FusionX, a cyber security business we acquired in Q4 in our work with a global high-tech company. We identified gaps in the clients' differences by simulating a sophisticated cyber attack, and we are now working with them to improve their security strategy. And of course, we continue to work with clients on large-scale, mission-critical transformation programs. We bring our full range of services and strategy, consulting, digital technology and operations, together with our industry expertise, to deliver tangible outcomes for clients. As an example, we are working with a global apparel manufacturer on an enterprise-wide transformation to reduce back-office costs by 50% and position the company for growth. As a first step, we are enhancing the efficiency and quality of the client's finance and accounting processes across 26 countries while significantly reducing costs.
Turning now to the performance of our 3 geographic regions. In North America, I am very pleased that we again delivered double-digit growth. The 11% increase in revenues was driven by strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we had another great quarter, with 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in many of our major markets such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Switzerland as well as high single-digit growth in Germany. And in growth markets, we delivered 6% growth in local currency, led by Japan, the largest country in our growth markets. Japan has delivered 8 quarters in a row of double-digit growth. At the same time, we are carefully monitoring the situation in Australia and Brazil, which have been affected by commodity price volatility in the energy and natural resources sectors.
Before I turn it back to David, let me comment on talent and leadership at Accenture. I am extremely pleased that we just promoted a record 723 people to Managing Director and Senior Managing Director, and I'm particularly pleased that 28% of our new promotes are women. These promotions reflect our commitment to carry our growth for people and to developing the talented leaders we need to serve our clients and run Accenture as a world-class business.
So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with the continued momentum in our business. We are executing our strategy very well. And our rotation to the new, combined with our unique ability to deliver end-to-end solutions to clients, continues to drive strong demand.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the second quarter of fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $7.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal '15.
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 6% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal '15.
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. We continue to expect our effective tax rate -- our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%.
For earnings per share, we continue to expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results.
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. We continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and now expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

I mean, when you pull outsourcing back, the -- as a type of work and then related to our business, our 5 businesses, a large part of operations, a significant portion of operations is part of the outsourcing type of work and then the application maintenance piece of application services as part of the outsourcing type of work as well. Within operations, the core driver is BPO, and I'll say, we continue to feel very good about our BPO business. The growth rates have been such that we've continued to take significant share. And if you look at our operations business overall, our expectation for growth remains the same, no different from what I communicated at IA Day where we think our operating -- operations business will grow very well in the upper single or low double-digit range, and of course, BPO is a key anchor to that. If you look at the other component of outsourcing would be application maintenance within application services, let me say that for application services, we now see mid-single-digit growth. As we've talked about, there's kind of 2 components in application services. There's the maintenance of the existing kind of legacy applications for our clients, which is an important function. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there's the investment in new technology and the deployment of new technology. So when you look at app services, we see extremely strong growth in the project-based work in application services. That work related to deploying and building new technology, that is reflected in our consulting type of work, which is why you see consulting type of work growth so strong.

I'm thinking about the investments we made in credit services where we are now building a leading independent mortgage processor in the U.S. and very pleased with the momentum we're getting in Brazil where we are expanding our services to, again, a technical position.

Happy to comment on this because I truly believe that we are proposing to the marketplace and organizing Accenture in a very unique and differentiated way.

And to your question, indeed, they are run as a business with the objective of being top class in their own category. But of course, where we differentiate in the marketplace is our unique ability to combine our services to deliver what we are calling the end-to-end services because we truly believe that more and more clients are buying an outcome more than input. And if you want to deliver an outcome, you need to contribute and participate to the design and planning typically done by Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting, the high-value services and consultancy, if you will, then you move into building solution with absolutely leading and cutting-edge solutions, exactly the job of Accenture Digital for digital native solutions and Accenture technology for the leading platform solutions or application packages. When you have been building solution, you're moving to Accenture Operations, the part of Accenture where we could operate on behalf of the clients, either their business process, their cloud operation or their security operation. This depth and breadth and kind of operating model is absolutely unique in the marketplace and is a great source of differentiation for Accenture. And on top of that, indeed, Lisa, we're putting our rotation to the new. Each of the 5 have a clear mandate to rotate their business to new type of services. For Accenture Strategy is going to be -- being cutting-edge in developing digital technologies and creating new business model for clients. Accenture Technology will now embed very innovative ways of doing development, what we're calling liquid intelligence and connected. Accenture Operations will be extraordinary analytics, rich in the way we are developing operations and in security with the acquisition of FusionX. We are absolutely top of the game in terms of simulating a cyber attack.

You have operations where, again, we have a talent model for operations. Mike Salvino and Debbie Polishook manage that work force. They, for the most part, work exclusively in operations.

We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC. All the best to all of you and best for the new year."
