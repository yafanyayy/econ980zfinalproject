I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. 2014 full year results reflect solid underlying performance across all of our businesses. Consistent with our expectations provided at the beginning of the year, 2014 pre-provision earnings were $10.1 billion",362,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. 2014 full year results reflect solid underlying performance across all of our businesses. Consistent with our expectations provided at the beginning of the year, 2014 pre-provision earnings were $10.1 billion. Net income grew 7% and earnings per share grew 10%. For the year, return on average tangible common equity was 15.8%. Our balance sheet remains strong with an ending common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%. And we reduced our common shares outstanding by 3%, reflecting our share buyback program that began in April.
For the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $999 million or $1.73 per share. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.68 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $2.5 billion were down $125 million from the third quarter as higher linked quarter revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, largely driven by seasonal growth related costs and investments in our technology and regulatory agendas that we have highlighted for you over the past several quarters.  Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as higher charge-offs for more than offset a smaller allowance build over the previous quarter.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported NIM increased 12 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.81%. Average interest-earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter driven by growth across our segments. 
Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.4%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, we were at 11.4% in the fourth quarter.
We reduced our net share count by 5 million shares in the quarter, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We expect to complete our previously announced $2.5 billion buyback program in the first quarter of 2015.
We formally entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches as of January 1, 2015, and we continue to estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%. Regarding the LCR as of year-end, we estimate that we are comfortably above the fully phased-in requirement for our consolidated company.
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic card business, which delivered another quarter of strong growth in results. Ending loans were up about 6% year-over-year. Growth from the linked quarter was also about 6%, stronger than typical season",1881,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic card business, which delivered another quarter of strong growth in results. Ending loans were up about 6% year-over-year. Growth from the linked quarter was also about 6%, stronger than typical seasonal growth. Continuing momentum in new account originations and credit line increase programs drove loan growth in the quarter.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label credit cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 18% year-over-year. Revenue margin for the quarter decreased modestly to about 17.3%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue dollars grew 5% year-over-year, in line with average loan growth. 
As expected, noninterest expenses increased significantly from the third quarter. Strong growth opportunities drove higher marketing, and operating expense increased to support loan and account growth as well as our continuing investments to be a digital leader and meet rising industry regulatory requirements. 
Credit trends in the fourth quarter were in line with our expectation.  Last quarter, we explained that the third quarter charge-off rate was unusually low. It was the seasonal low point for charge-off rate and also included the temporary benefit from better-than-expected delinquency rates in early 2014.  In the fourth quarter, charge-off rate increased 56 basis points to 3.39%. About half of the increase resulted from expected seasonality and about half from normalization of the temporary delinquency favorability.
The fourth quarter delinquency rates increased in line with normal seasonal patterns. Our expectations for the charge-off rate have not changed. We continue to expect the quarterly Domestic Card charge-off rate throughout 2015 to be in the mid- to high 3% range. We expect normal seasonal patterns throughout the year, including an increase in the charge-off rate in the first quarter.
In addition to seasonality, we continue to expect that loan growth will impact the charge-off rate. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate will be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond.  In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions.
For the full year 2014, the biggest story in our Domestic Card results was the return to growth. Ending loans grew 6% and general-purpose credit card purchase volume grew 16%. Revenues declined 5%, driven by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio. Excluding the revenue impact of the portfolio sale, full year 2014 revenues were flat, in line with average loans.
Noninterest expense declined 6%, with lower operating expense partially offset by higher marketing. Lower operating expense resulted from tight cost management across the business; lower acquisition-related expenses; taking out costs associated with the Best Buy portfolio; and the absence of a nonrecurring legal reserve that impacted 2013 expenses. Provision for credit losses improved modestly, with lower charge-off rate offset by additions to the allowance.
The rekindling of growth, along with our continuing focus on delivering strong and resilient returns, enabled the Domestic card business to post strong net income while improving the quality of our franchise in 2014. Our card business remains well-positioned.
Moving to Slide 8. The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were up about 1% from both the linked quarter and the prior year. Growth in Auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 25% year-over-year, driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers.
Ending deposit balances were essentially flat compared to both the linked quarter and the prior year. We've had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition, and we've been allowing the least attractive deposits from Capital One's legacy direct bank to run off.
On a linked-quarter basis, Consumer Banking revenue was up 2%. Noninterest expense increased $89 million or 9% from the linked quarter, driven mostly by auto loan growth, infrastructure and digital investments and higher marketing. And provision for credit losses increased $24 million from the linked quarter, driven by expected seasonal trends in auto charge-offs.
For the full year 2014, revenues were down 3%, driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining balances and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts.
Full year noninterest expense was up 3%, driven by auto loan growth and the change in the income geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses.
Full year provision for credit losses increased $47 million or 7%, consistent with a gradual normalization of auto charge-offs and allowance builds for auto loan growth.
Full year 2014 trends show that our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. While our auto business remains well-positioned, we remain cautious and continue to closely monitor pricing, underwriting practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors. Returns on new originations vintages are lower than the returns in the overall auto loan portfolio, but remain resilient and above hurdle. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low-rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015.
As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter, although the pace of growth is slowing. Loan balances increased about 2% in the quarter and 13% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE.
Loan yields declined 6 basis points in the quarter and 59 basis points compared to the prior year, driven mostly by increased competition, lower tax equivalent yield and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. The declining trend in loan yields stabilized somewhat in the quarter.
Revenues increased 5% from the third quarter and about 2% from the prior year. Year-over-year, higher loan volumes have been largely offset by declining yields. 
Noninterest expenses were up 4% from the prior year and 9% from the third quarter as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $23 million from the linked quarter to $32 million. Charge-offs, nonperforming loans and criticized loans remained strong in the fourth quarter. The current levels of commercial credit results are exceptionally low, and we continue to closely manage credit risk.
For the full year, ending loans grew 13% and average loans grew 17%. Revenues grew 6% as volume growth was partially offset by declining yield. 
Noninterest expense grew 13%, moderately lower than the growth in average loans. Provision for credit losses increased $117 million from a negative $24 million to positive $93 million, driven entirely driven entirely by the swing from allowance releases in 2013 to allowance build in 2014.
Our Commercial Banking business is well positioned to navigate current market conditions. While falling oil prices are likely a positive for our consumer businesses, we're closely monitoring and managing the potential impact of low oil prices on our $3.7 billion energy portfolio. And competition remains intense in the Commercial Banking business, pressuring margins and returns. It's likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015. We expect our Commercial Banking business will continue to deliver solid results.
Following up, Commercial Banking is thriving at Capital One. The business has steadily and profitably grown to over $50 billion. We built deep industry specialties and established great relationships with our commercial customers.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. 2014 was a strong year for Capital One. As Steve mentioned, we delivered 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10.1 billion. We posted strong earnings. We strengthened our balance sheet. We returned to growth in our card business and continued to prudently grow our auto and commercial business. We improved the quality of our franchise, and we returned significant capital to our shareholders. We're poised to build on the momentum in 2015.
Our expectations for 2015 include the impacts of investments we've been discussing for several quarters. In our Domestic Card business, we see attractive marketing opportunities to drive future growth. Marketing efficiency, cost to acquire new accounts and the net present value of our marketing investments are strong. We'll continue to invest to drive and support growth in loans, deposits and account relationships across our business. 
We're making significant investment in our foundational infrastructure and capabilities to be a digital leader. Banking inherently is a digital product, and digital will transform banking over time. Capital One is well-positioned to succeed in a digital world with our heritage as an innovative information-based company. We are committed to deeply embedding digital in how we work, not merely bolting digital onto the side of our company.
We're also spending to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We're enhancing our capabilities, infrastructure and talent to deliver on the broad set of expanding regulatory requirements and meet increasing expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. And we're continuously improving processes for capital and liquidity management, including CCAR and the new LCR.
Capital One is delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today, and we expect that, that will continue. We have the financial strength to invest in our future without compromising current financial results.
Pulling all this together, in 2015, we expect growth in full year revenues, driven by growth in average loans. We expect that full year marketing and operating expenses will both be higher in 2015 than they were in 2014.
Let me turn to our efficiency ratio, specifically our expectations for the full year 2015 efficiency ratio. In July, we articulated an expected range of 53% to 54%, excluding nonrecurring items. We reaffirmed that range in October. Since then, we've experienced a sizable adverse change in interest rates. As a consequence, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53.5% and 54.5%, excluding nonrecurring items. This change in range is driven entirely by the movement in rates.
We don't take this change in expectations lightly, but we don't believe we should make long-term business decisions based on spot prices for interest rates. We continue to manage costs very tightly across our businesses, while making our planned expenditures to drive growth, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. These expenditures are essential to our ability to deliver strong shareholder returns on a sustainable basis.  We also expect that the efficiency ratio will vary, perhaps significantly, from quarter to quarter based on factors such as day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues and the timing of investments throughout the year.
Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not changed, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto, Retail Banking and Commercial Banking. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly while we invest to grow among, be a digital leader and to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.
And now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?"

Industry balances remain flat, have been flat for quite a while now. We're seeing a little bit of growth.  Of course, there been some increases in marketing levels with respect to direct mail. You can certainly feel in the rewards segment in particular, especially in cash back products, a lot of competition. And it manifests itself in their version of teaser rates, which is early spend, bonus offers. Long-term pricing in general has been stable in the segments that we compete in. And overall, while again, I think it is intense, I would describe this industry as pretty rational and more stable than the other markets that we compete in, most notably auto and commercial. Now that was the description of the branded card business. 
The partnership business, which as you know, Moshe, is sort of a deal flow business, and the -- as one who's certainly been around the branded card business for more than a couple of decades, the most striking difference between these 2 businesses is the auction nature of the partnerships. And that has -- that is the biggest factor that leads this business to have, in my opinion on an apples-to-apples kind of basis, lower inherent returns. And the wild card of the marketplace and the nature of sort of auction prices that exist at any point in time. That -- there are a number of partnerships that are sort of ""up for grabs"" in the marketplace. I would stress that one of the characteristics of this business is the significant majority of all partnerships actually sort of stay with the incumbent. But they certainly go, nonetheless, most go through the RFP process. So there is a -- there's fair amount of activity in this space, and I am struck by how competitive that is. And certainly, we've been to some auctions where people are stepping up and paying prices in excess of what we're comfortable with. But certainly, I would describe that as pretty intensely competitive and one that we're going to stay very disciplined in."

And we also periodically adjust our rewards liabilities based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. But even beyond that variability and sort of if you look past quarterly noise, the phenomenon you're talking about is real in that net interchange generally lagged general-purpose credit card interchange growth for Capital One. And we would expect this trend to continue. Our rewards programs have been, and they continue to be very successful with, of course, flagship products like Quicksilver card, the Venture card, the Spark card for Small Business. We're also building a long-term for franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and, in many ways consistent with the industry, extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And there's some near-term cannibalization when we do this, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. But the net effect of all of this including leading with great flagship products, this -- all of this contributes franchise to that delta that we think will continue, although there'll be a lot of volatility in that between purchase volume growth and interchange growth."

And if you think about the drivers of our commentary about efficiency ratio and costs and the margin, one is growth opportunities. We have been stepping up increasingly sort of in the card business to invest as we see particular opportunities there. On the commercial side, if anything, our growth opportunity is decelerating because of the choices that we're making in response to market conditions. But those are factors that will play out over time. The regulatory costs are pretty much pretty much all across the enterprise, and that's going in only one direction. And I'd be pretty surprised if over the next few years, there any forces that would move those cost pressures in the opposite direction. And finally, and investments in digital, while digital is a big opportunity across consumer and commercial, certainly, with -- on a relative basis, I think the revolution is going to be greater on the consumer side. It's literally going to transform all aspects of how banking is done. It's going to transform not only how people often think through the lens of the customer experience, but really, the whole way, the way retail distribution works, the way operations, marketing, servicing and even something that's very, very core to how Capital One works, which is information-based strategy itself. So this is a big deal on the commercial side. It's pretty much a revolutionary deal on the consumer side."

And it sort of started with our comments for some -- for many of the years right after the Great Recession started raging, which is we went into this kind of -- I don't think it's an exaggeration to call it sort of once in a lifetime kind of confluence of events that led the auto industry, both from a growth and from a kind of returns and credit point of view, to be absolutely exceptional. And most of what we have seen happening since then is sort of a progression more toward normal, if you will. And so what's happened, I think for Capital One and certainly for other players, is with each passing quarter, the intensity of the commentary that people in the business make is -- it is increased. But if we pull way up, that we don't see things that are -- that would cause us to have great alarm about the business. But what we see is just on the pricing side, increased pressure, although that's stabilized. And when I look at prime and subprime, that's stabilized more recently. But frankly, in the prime space at a below kind of cycle, a little bit below-cycle norms, things pretty tight there. The subprime space has been steadily declining, a little bit stable of late. On the underwriting side, the most noteworthy place that there has been any risk expansion has been in terms of terms, and there's been significant growth of the over 72 months loans. But still, things like LCVs, which probably is the single most important variable, have remained, certainly on the prime side, stable and healthy; on the subprime side, moderately increasing, but well below sort of prerecession levels. So the more the way I would characterize this auto business is that we just have to stay very, very vigilant. And what I find is we -- our choices, sort of one dealer and one deal at a time, end up with the growth moderating in subprime, for example. Subprime has been flat for Capital One, at Capital One, I think, for -- in the originations for about, I'm guessing since 2011, I think it's been pretty flat, so that essentially, although the growth in originations has been on the near prime and especially the prime side. So those -- that -- that -- I think that's manifestation of our reaction to the marketplace and continuing to pursue opportunity where it is prudent and where we can build deeper dealer relationships. But that I would say the important thing I want to leave with you is while even new originations you can see have, pound for pound, kind of a bit higher credit risk than some of the exceptional stuff of the past, the business that we are originating, we still feel is well above hurdle and we like the opportunity."

First of all, it feels to us that pretty much exactly the same as when we talked about this a quarter ago. But just to put this in perspective, card credit has been exceptionally strong over the past few years. And our portfolio has benefited from the improving economy and a generally more disciplined consumer. And our back book, which is made up mostly of customers who weathered the Great Recession, that continues to show exceptionally low risk and is very resilient. We see great opportunities for resilient new business. But from the starting point of our highly seasoned back book, most new business will have higher losses. So the credit performance of our new originations and our credit line increases has been strong. And in fact, it's meeting in -- well, it is this meeting and in some cases, even exceeding our expectations in a good way. And since we've returned to growth, I've been emphasizing that these new loan -- as these new loan balance season, they will start putting upward pressures on cards overall charge-off rate. And this impact is going to be modest at first, but we expect it to grow through 2015 and beyond. And we've been growing in this segment we've always been focused on. We continue to avoid the segments that we think lack resilience, even if they have quite nice returns in today's environment. And the -- on that -- that -- that is really the essence of our credit story. And we wanted to make sure that people exactly understand what is the dynamic that is leading charge-offs to increase. But back to the original question that you asked, this is not driven by a worsening of credit performance of the existing book or anything like this. It's really the by-product of our seizing the growth opportunity and sort of the vintage math of that."

And the -- and this is, of course, in  the context of headwind that are pushing things so hard in the other direction. And you can see over the -- starting -- well, the second half of 2012 and through 2013 and 2014, the trajectory of operating expense. And of course, some of that comes from the related expenses that sort of automatically happen. We also worked hard to make sure that we get the synergies we talked about in the deals and drive out the integration costs and things like that. Also though, other big areas of focus have been the area of procurement and we always sort of worked hard at that. But by building a big, centralized and almost the whole science about it and making it have the feel almost like a line of business, has been a -- has been something that's even exceeded our own expectations. And we pretty rigorously measure, not just what talking to ourselves about how things are better, but really a before-and-after kind of thing. And that has led to some tangible -- I mean, pretty sizable, tangible benefits. Another area that, of course, should generate increasing benefit is in digitization. So a lot of the impacts of digital are really sort of hard to measure, and it really relates to the way we work. But it's things like going paperless, driving people away from some of the more expensive channels into the digital channels and some of the transformation in terms of marketing to be more online and so on. These have effects that we measure, and they -- the numbers are starting to grow. The ---- on digital, just take digital itself, that is a net trade that have costs a lot higher than benefits at the moment in terms of what you can purely measure. Because we're investing heavily in digital, and all of our -- there's almost nothing that we're investing in digital where the primary objective is to save money. This digital transformation is such a comprehensive revolution. It really allows for things to be faster and way better for the customer, a better associate experience, much better controlled from a compliance point of view, more scalable and yes, lower cost. So right now, one of the important net negative trades is what's happening on just the pure cost side with respect to digital. But by the way, the overall economic benefits of digital, I would argue that an important reason that we're on the growth trajectory we're on in the card business is in fact because of our digital success, not only in terms of the customer experience but really in things like how we do marketing and things like that. So this will -- I believe the long-term payoff of the digital investment is going to be very significant in the near term. From the cost line, this is going to be a net negative traits. And of course, the investments in the regulatory thing is a -- very substantial. And of course, we know which direction those things are moving. And the other thing on the cost side, of course, is the investment in growth itself. And there, the biggest number is, of course, marketing, but there are also operating costs that go along with that as well. And as you know, Eric, we -- that's our highest priority for our own expenditures is to make sure that we're investing in our own growth, and those investments will continue. So net-net, one minus all of that needs to be just -- there's kind of a fanatical, multiyear quest to wring out every single penny that we can. And all of that is -- nets out in this number that I am sure some people look at and say, ""Well, with all the growth and all the digital, somehow shouldn't that be lower?"""

And it's not as simple, nor would ever be as simple, as we take 13 months of anything. It's actually looking at lost content in our portfolio. And there are 2 things that are really going on. One is the growth that we've talked about. And unless you assume growth has 0 losses, adding growth will drive up a need for allowance. The second piece of it is a little bit of the mix movement that which talked about from an incredibly low and resilient that book to a very much expected but higher loss front book. And as that becomes more of the equation, that is going to drive up the loss content, which ultimately is reflected in the allowance. It's not a matter of not wanting to be helpful to actually give you a sense as to where allowance would end up. We have to accurately forecast 24 months of losses and 12 months of balances. And that's better than, frankly, anybody has been able to do. And we think we're pretty good at looking at how credit evolves. So we're not trying to be difficult. It's just beyond clearly your delinquency roll rates, I think it's very hard to predict credit from a quarter-to-quarter basis. So in general, one can think of a little bit about how the balances are growing as being the first factor and a trend rate in losses being a second factor. But even that's not enough because our balance growth quarter-to-quarter has a seasonal component, right? So the fourth quarter uptick that you see isn't necessarily going to last throughout the entire year. So we're actually trying to figure out which of those components are going to be more lasting. So there's a whole bunch of things going on there. But I think you can see since we expect growth going up, since we talked about losses is going up, there's going to be more need for allowance going forward."

And some other banks may feel differently about this, but I think may also manifest what we're trying to achieve here. I think in the long run, there's going to be very significant cost benefit from all these digital investments. But the biggest benefit, and the reason we're doing it is in almost all cases not for that reason. And what I'm most excited about is actually the opportunities to generate growth and to generate that are real-time decision-making, to make better credit decision and in the end, build a deeper franchise through very significant improvements in the customer experience and things that really create more loyalty and more stickiness for customers. And so over the years, it will be very, very hard for us to measure that because digital and digital -- I mean, digital investments are turning -- are more and more turning us into a digital company as opposed to a company that just tries to digitize what they do, or the phrase I said earlier, to bolt digital on the side of a bank. So it's more and more becoming, over a longer period of time, who we are in terms of how we operate and how we make decisions and how information is used in the company. And if you notice, my passion about this is because I have not seen -- and probably this speaks for mankind as well over our long history. But certainly, I haven't seen anything remotely like this in terms of the ability to transform how a business works. The only parallel is the thing that led me to go out and build Capital One in the first place was looking at how information and technology were going to transform, starting with the card business and ultimately, banking. This is going to be a very, very big change, and I think its biggest impacts will not be the impact that they have on cost. But what is also clear is that for anything as transformational as this, one has to, on a sustainable basis, invest to build the foundational capabilities upon which the sort of digital innovation that the world can see will occur. And this is going to be a longer journey, but I think it's ultimately as significant a transformation as what the information-based opportunity we saw 20-some years ago turned out to be."

Just wanted to follow up on the issue of provision as we look forward. Given that there've been a lot of changes in consumer behavior and timeliness of payment, I'm just wondering if the assumption that new originations for card loans will have their peak charge-offs in say, say, 18 to 30 months. Is that based on what we're seeing sort of post-crisis? Or is that really based on what you've experienced over the history of the credit card business?

Well, first of all, there's few different phenomenons that are going on. When we talk about our charge-offs, especially the second half of next year and into 2016, going up as a result of growth, that is the composite effect of all the different vintages of actions that are being taken. And I want to separate out a couple of different effects. One is originations and one is credit line increases. These themselves have quite different dynamics. They also have quite different flow in terms of many other metrics, including the timing of profitability and costs in the near term and so on. But anyway, with respect to credit, I would characterize credit line increases tend to, right when they happen, they have a benefit with respect to losses. And then over time, the charge-offs, on a more delayed basis, build over time. Originations trend to -- they have a momentary kind of benefit from the effect that they have, but then they tend to peak earlier and then, actually improve over the longer term, so -- And again, our credit guidance is just a sort of a composite of all the different things that are going on. We have sizable credit line increase activity. We have very significant origination activity that's been going on and -- over the past year and we hope will continue well. And the most important thing we have wanted to do is just make sure that, as we started signaling some time ago, the charge-off math of this very good development for Capital One is pretty predictable. And we wanted to just make sure we got in front of that, and that's what we've done."

So just about anything we do these days versus an equivalent action in 2006 or 2007, certainly, we would expect would peak in a better place. But this is -- and but the main thing is we're also saying is that paradoxically, even as we are guiding to higher credit losses, and frankly, guiding to more growth in credit losses than it appears that our competitors are, this is in the context of a very stable and good credit environment. It's in the context of originations that are coming in very much as expected and consistent with what we've seen recently and one that is really therefore entirely just the result of charge-off math associated with separation of growth, and frankly, going strikingly from a shrinking situation into one with some pretty good growth."

I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. 2014 full year results reflect solid underlying performance across all of our businesses. Consistent with our expectations provided at the beginning of the year, 2014 pre-provision earnings were $10.1 billion",360,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. 2014 full year results reflect solid underlying performance across all of our businesses. Consistent with our expectations provided at the beginning of the year, 2014 pre-provision earnings were $10.1 billion. Net income grew 7% and earnings per share grew 10%. For the year, return on average tangible common equity was 15.8%. Our balance sheet remains strong with an ending common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%. And we reduced our common shares outstanding by 3%, reflecting our share buyback program that began in April.
For the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $999 million or $1.73 per share. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.68 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $2.5 billion were down $125 million from the third quarter as higher linked-quarter revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, largely driven by seasonal and growth-related costs and investments in our technology and regulatory agendas that we have highlighted for you over the past several quarters. Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as higher charge-offs more than offset a smaller allowance build over the previous quarter.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported NIM increased 12 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.81%. Average interest-earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter, driven by growth across our segments. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.4%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, we were at 11.4% in the fourth quarter.
We reduced our net share count by 5 million shares in the quarter, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We expect to complete our previously announced $2.5 billion buyback program in the first quarter of 2015.
We formally entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches as of January 1, 2015, and we continue to estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%. Regarding the LCR as of year-end, we estimate that we are comfortably above the fully phased-in requirement for our consolidated company.
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business, which delivered another quarter of strong growth in results. Ending loans were up about 6% year-over-year. Growth from the linked quarter was also about 6%, stronger than typical season",1883,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business, which delivered another quarter of strong growth in results. Ending loans were up about 6% year-over-year. Growth from the linked quarter was also about 6%, stronger than typical seasonal growth. Continuing momentum in new account originations and credit line increase programs drove loan growth in the quarter.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label credit cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 18% year-over-year. Revenue margin for the quarter decreased modestly to about 17.3%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue dollars grew 5% year-over-year, in line with average loan growth. 
As expected, noninterest expenses increased significantly from the third quarter. Strong growth opportunities drove higher marketing, and operating expense increased to support loan and account growth as well as our continuing investments to be a digital leader and meet rising industry regulatory requirements. 
Credit trends in the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations. Last quarter, we explained that the third quarter charge-off rate was unusually low. It was the seasonal low point for charge-off rate and also included the temporary benefit from better-than-expected delinquency rates in early 2014. In the fourth quarter, charge-off rate increased 56 basis points to 3.39%. About half of the increase resulted from expected seasonality and about half from normalization of the temporary delinquency favorability.
The fourth quarter delinquency rate increased in line with normal seasonal pattern. Our expectations for the charge-off rate have not changed. We continue to expect the quarterly Domestic Card charge-off rate throughout 2015 to be in the mid- to high 3% range. We expect normal seasonal patterns throughout the year, including an increase in the charge-off rate in the first quarter.
In addition to seasonality, we continue to expect that loan growth will impact the charge-off rate. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate will be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond.  In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions.
For the full year 2014, the biggest story in our Domestic Card results was the return to growth. Ending loans grew 6% and general-purpose credit card purchase volume grew 16%. Revenues declined 5%, driven by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio. Excluding the revenue impact of the portfolio sale, full year 2014 revenues were flat, in line with average loans.
Noninterest expense declined 6%, with lower operating expense partially offset by higher marketing. Lower operating expense resulted from tight cost management across the business; lower acquisition-related expenses; taking out costs associated with the Best Buy portfolio; and the absence of a nonrecurring legal reserve that impacted 2013 expenses. Provision for credit losses improved modestly, with lower charge-off rate offset by additions to the allowance.
The rekindling of growth, along with our continuing focus on delivering strong and resilient returns, enabled the Domestic Card business to post strong net income while improving the quality of our franchise in 2014. Our card business remains well positioned.
Moving to Slide 8. The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were up about 1% from both the linked quarter and the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 25% year-over-year, driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers.
Ending deposit balances were essentially flat compared to both the linked quarter and the prior year. We've had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition, and we've been allowing the least attractive deposits from Capital One's legacy direct bank to run off.
On a linked-quarter basis, Consumer Banking revenue was up 2%. Noninterest expense increased $89 million or 9% from the linked quarter, driven mostly by auto loan growth, infrastructure and digital investments and higher marketing. And provision for credit losses increased $24 million from the linked quarter, driven by expected seasonal trends in auto charge-offs.
For the full year 2014, revenues were down 3%, driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts.
Full year noninterest expense was up 3%, driven by auto loan growth and the change in the income statement geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses.
Full year provision for credit losses increased $47 million or 7%, consistent with the gradual normalization of auto charge-offs and allowance builds for auto loan growth.
Full year 2014 trends show that our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. While our auto business remains well positioned, we remain cautious and continue to closely monitor pricing, underwriting practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors. Returns on new origination vintages are lower than returns in the overall auto loan portfolio but remain resilient and above hurdle. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low-rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015.
As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter, although the pace of growth is slowing. Loan balances increased about 2% in the quarter and 13% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry verticals, in C&I lending and CRE.
Loan yields declined 6 basis points in the quarter and 59 basis points compared to the prior year, driven mostly by increased competition, lower tax equivalent yield and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. The declining trend in loan yields stabilized somewhat in the quarter.
Revenues increased 5% from the third quarter and about 2% from the prior year. Year-over-year, higher loan volumes have been largely offset by declining yields. 
Noninterest expenses were up 4% from the prior year and 9% from the third quarter as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $23 million from the linked quarter to $32 million. Charge-offs, nonperforming loans and criticized loans remained strong in the fourth quarter. The current levels of commercial credit results are exceptionally low, and we continue to closely manage credit risk.
For the full year, ending loans grew 13% and average loans grew 17%. Revenues grew 6% as volume growth was partially offset by declining yield. 
Noninterest expense grew 13%, moderately lower than the growth in average loans. Provision for credit losses increased $117 million from a negative $24 million to positive $93 million, driven entirely by the swing from allowance releases in 2013 to allowance build in 2014.
Our Commercial Banking business is well positioned to navigate current market conditions. While falling oil prices are likely a positive for our consumer businesses, we're closely monitoring and managing the potential impact of low oil prices on our $3.7 billion energy portfolio. And competition remains intense in the Commercial Banking business, pressuring margins and returns. It's likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015. But we expect our Commercial Banking business will continue to deliver solid results.
Pulling up, Commercial Banking is thriving at Capital One. The business has steadily and profitably grown to over $50 billion. We've built deep industry specialties and established great relationships with our commercial customers.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. 2014 was a strong year for Capital One. As Steve mentioned, we delivered 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10.1 billion. We posted strong earnings. We strengthened our balance sheet. We returned to growth in our card business and continued to prudently grow our auto and commercial businesses. We improved the quality of our franchise, and we returned significant capital to our shareholders. We're poised to build on the momentum in 2015.
Our expectations for 2015 include the impacts of the investments we've been discussing for several quarters. In our Domestic Card business, we see attractive marketing opportunities to drive future growth. Marketing efficiency, cost to acquire new accounts and the net present value of our marketing investments are strong. We'll continue to invest to drive and support growth in loans, deposits and account relationships across our businesses. 
We're making significant investments in our foundational infrastructure and capabilities to be a digital leader. Banking inherently is a digital product, and digital will transform banking over time. Capital One is well positioned to succeed in the digital world with our heritage as an innovative, information-based company. We are committed to deeply embedding digital in how we work, not merely bolting digital onto the side of our company.
We're also spending to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We're enhancing our capabilities, infrastructure and talent to deliver on the broad set of expanding regulatory requirements and meet increasing expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. And we're continuously improving processes for capital and liquidity management, including CCAR and the new LCR.
Capital One is delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today, and we expect that, that will continue. We have the financial strength to invest in our future without compromising current financial results.
Pulling all this together, in 2015, we expect growth in full year revenues, driven by growth in average loans. We expect that full year marketing and operating expenses will both be higher in 2015 than they were in 2014.
Let me turn to our efficiency ratio, specifically our expectations for the full year 2015 efficiency ratio. In July, we articulated an expected range of 53% to 54%, excluding nonrecurring items. We reaffirmed that range in October. Since then, we've experienced a sizable adverse change in interest rates. As a consequence, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53.5% and 54.5%, excluding nonrecurring items. This change in range is driven entirely by the movement in rates.
We don't take this change in expectations lightly, but we don't believe we should make long-term business decisions based on spot prices for interest rates. We continue to manage costs very tightly across our businesses while making our planned expenditures to drive growth, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. These expenditures are essential to our ability to deliver strong shareholder returns on a sustainable basis. We also expect that efficiency ratio will vary, perhaps significantly, from quarter to quarter based on factors such as day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues and the timing of investments throughout the year.
Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not changed, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto, retail banking and Commercial Banking. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly while we invest to grow, be a digital leader and to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.
And now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?"

Industry balances remain flat -- I mean, have been flat for quite a while. Now we're seeing a little bit of growth. Of course, there have been some increases in marketing levels with respect to direct mail. You can certainly feel in the rewards segment in particular, especially in cash back products, a lot of competition. And it manifests itself in their version of teaser rates, which is early spend, bonus offers. Long-term pricing in general has been stable in the segments that we compete in. And overall, while, again, I think it is intense, I would describe this industry as pretty rational and more stable than the other markets that we compete in, most notably auto and commercial.

And that has -- that is the biggest factor that leads this business to have, in my opinion, on an apples-to-apples kind of basis, lower inherent returns and the wild card of the marketplace and the nature of sort of auction prices that exist at any point in time. That -- there are a number of partnerships that are sort of ""up for grabs"" in the marketplace. I would stress that one of the characteristics of this business is the significant majority of all partnerships actually sort of stay with the incumbent. But they certainly go -- nonetheless, most go through the RFP process. So there is a -- there's fair amount of activity in this space, and I am struck by how competitive that is. And certainly, we've been to some auctions where people are stepping up and paying prices in excess of what we're comfortable with. But certainly, I would describe that as pretty intensely competitive and one that we're going to stay very disciplined in."

And we also periodically adjust our rewards liabilities based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. But even beyond that variability and sort of if you look past quarterly noise, the phenomenon you're talking about is real in that net interchange growth has generally lagged general-purpose credit card interchange growth for Capital One. And we would expect this trend to continue. Our rewards programs have been, and they continue to be, very successful with, of course, flagship products like Quicksilver card, the Venture card, the Spark card for Small Business. We're also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and in many ways consistent with the industry, extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And there's some near-term cannibalization when we do this, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. But the net effect of all of this, including leading with great flagship products, this -- all of this contributes to that delta that we think will continue, although there'll be a lot of volatility in that between purchase volume growth and interchange growth."

And if you think about the drivers of our commentary about efficiency ratio and costs at the margin, one is growth opportunities. We have been stepping up increasingly sort of in the card business to invest because we see particular opportunities there. On the commercial side, if anything, our growth opportunity is decelerating because of the choices that we're making in response to market conditions. But those are factors that will play out over time. The regulatory costs are pretty much all across the enterprise, and that's going in only one direction. And I'd be pretty surprised if over the next few years, there's any forces that would move those cost pressures in the opposite direction. And finally, the investments in digital. And while digital is a big opportunity across consumer and commercial, certainly, with -- on a relative basis, I think the revolution is going to be greater on the consumer side. And it's literally going to transform all aspects of how banking is done. It's going to transform not only as people often think through the lens of the customer experience but really the whole way -- the way retail distribution works, the way operations, marketing, servicing and even something that's very, very core to how Capital One works, which is information-based strategy itself. So this is a big deal on the commercial side. It's pretty much a revolutionary deal on the consumer side."

And it sort of started with our comments for some -- for many of the years right after the Great Recession started raging, which is we went into this kind of -- I don't think it's an exaggeration to call it sort of once in a lifetime kind of confluence of events that led the auto industry, both from a growth and from a kind of returns and credit point of view, to be absolutely exceptional. And most of what we have seen happening since then is sort of a regression more toward normal, if you will. And so what's happened, I think for Capital One and certainly for other players, is with each passing quarter, the intensity of the commentary that people in the business make is it is increased. But if we pull way up, that we don't see things that are -- would cause us to have great alarm about the business. But what we see is just on the pricing side, increased pressure, although that's stabilized. And when -- if I look at prime and subprime, that's stabilized more recently. But frankly, in the prime space at a below kind of cycle -- a little bit below cycle norms, things are pretty tight there. The subprime space has been steadily declining, a little bit stable of late. On the underwriting side, the most noteworthy place that there has been any risk expansion has been in terms of terms, and there's been significant growth of the over 72 months loans. But still, things like LTVs, which is probably the single most important variable, have remained, certainly on the prime side, stable and healthy; on the subprime side, moderately increasing but well below sort of prerecession levels. So more the way I would characterize this auto business is that we just have to stay very, very vigilant. And what I find is we -- our choices, sort of one dealer and one deal at a time, end up with the growth moderating in subprime. For example, subprime has been flat for -- at Capital One, I think, for -- in the originations for about -- I'm guessing, since 2011. I think it's been pretty flat so that essentially all of the growth in originations has been on the near prime and especially the prime side. So those -- that -- I think that's a manifestation of our reaction to the marketplace and continuing to pursue opportunity where it is prudent and where we can build deeper dealer relationships. But I would say the important thing I want to leave with you is while even new originations you can see have, pound for pound, kind of a bit higher credit risk than some of the exceptional stuff of the past, we -- the business that we are originating, we still feel, is well above hurdle and we like the opportunity."

First of all, it feels to us pretty much exactly the same as when we talked about this a quarter ago. But just to put this in perspective, card credit has been exceptionally strong over the past few years. And our portfolio has benefited from the improving economy and a generally more disciplined consumer. And our back book, which is made up mostly of customers who weathered the Great Recession, that continues to show exceptionally low risk and is very resilient. We see great opportunities for resilient new business. But from the starting point of our highly seasoned back book, most new business will have higher losses. So the credit performance of our new originations and our credit line increases has been strong. And in fact, it's meeting in -- well, it is this meeting and in some cases even exceeding our expectations in a good way. And since we've returned to growth, I've been emphasizing that these new loan -- as these new loan balances season, they will start putting upward pressure on card's overall charge-off rate. And this impact is going to be modest at first, but we expect it to grow through 2015 and beyond. And we've been growing in this segment we've always been focused on. We continue to avoid the segments that we think lack resilience even if they have quite nice returns in today's environment. And the -- and that's -- that is really the essence of our credit story, and we wanted to make sure that people exactly understand what is the dynamic that is leading charge-offs to increase. But back to the original question that you asked, this is not driven by a worsening of credit performance of the existing book or anything like this. It's really the by-product of our seizing a growth opportunity and sort of the vintage math of that."

I -- my guess is the reason for the question is you're looking at the other part of our income statement and the change year-over-year. And the biggest driver there was treasury. I mean, there are other things in there as well. We've got corporate items that run through that tend to be lumpy. But the biggest year-over-year change was treasury. And there were several reasons for the improvement in treasury in 2014, including change in rates, hedging actions we took in 2014 to manage the risk -- rate risk in our balance sheet and improved securities yield because of a slower runoff. And there were a couple of onetime items in there, too. We had roughly $70 million of expenses for redeeming a preferred issuance in 2013 that we didn't in '14. The one thing we did do, a little bit along the lines of what you're talking about, is with LCR coming on, we continued to refine the way that we charge our businesses for the liquidity that they use. So we were passing out more liquidity cost of the business, really consistent with things like LCR."

And the -- and this is, of course, in the context of headwinds that are pushing things so hard in the other direction. And you can see over the -- starting, well, the second half of 2012 and through 2013 and 2014 the trajectory of operating expense. And of course, some of that comes from deal-related expenses that sort of automatically happen. We've also worked hard to make sure that we get the synergies we talked about in the deals and drive out the integration costs and things like that. Also though, other big areas of focus have been the area of procurement and we always sort of worked hard at that. But by building a big, centralized and almost the whole science about it and making it have the feel almost like a line of business has been a -- has been something that's even exceeded our own expectations. And we pretty rigorously measure not just what -- talking to ourselves about how things are better but really a before-and-after kind of thing. And that has led to some tangible -- I mean, pretty sizable, tangible benefits. Another area that, of course, should generate increasing benefit is in digitization. So a lot of the impacts of digital are really sort of hard to measure, and it really relates to the way we work but things like going paperless, driving people away from some of the more expensive channels into the digital channels and some of the transformation in terms of marketing to be more online and so on. These have effects that we measure, and they -- the numbers are starting to grow. The ---- on digital, just take digital itself, that is a net trade that has cost a lot higher than benefits at the moment in terms of what you can purely measure because we're investing heavily in digital. And all of our -- there's almost nothing that we're investing in digital where the primary objective is to save money. This digital transformation is such a comprehensive revolution. It really allows for things to be faster and way better for the customer, a better associate experience, much better controlled from a compliance point of view, more scalable, and yes, lower cost. So right now, one of the important net negative trades is what's happening on just the pure cost side with respect to digital. By the way, the overall economic benefits of digital, and I would argue that an important reason that we're on the growth trajectory we're on in the card business, is, in fact, because of our digital success not only in terms of the customer experience but really in things like how we do marketing and things like that. So this will -- I believe the long-term payoff of the digital investment is going to be very significant. In the near term, from the cost line, this is going to be a net negative trait. And of course, the investments in the regulatory thing is a -- very substantial. And of course, we know which direction those things are moving. And the other thing on the cost side, of course, is the investment in growth itself. And there, the biggest number is, of course, marketing, but there are also operating costs that go along with that as well. And as you know, Eric, we -- that's our highest priority for our own expenditures is to make sure that we're investing in our own growth, and those investments will continue. So net-net, one minus all of that needs to be just -- there's kind of a fanatical multiyear quest to wring out every single penny that we can. And all of that is -- nets out in this number that I am sure some people look at and say, ""Well, with all the growth and all the digital, somehow shouldn't that be lower?"""

And it's not as simple, nor would ever be as simple, as we take 13 months of anything. It's actually looking at loss content in our portfolio. And there are 2 things that are really going on. One is the growth that we've talked about. And unless you assume growth has 0 losses, adding growth will drive up a need for allowance. The second piece of it is a little bit of the mix movement that Rich talked about from an incredibly low and resilient back book to a very much expected but higher loss front book. And as that becomes more of the equation, that is going to drive up the loss content, which ultimately is reflected in allowance. It's not a matter of not wanting to be helpful to actually give you a sense as to where allowance would end up. We have to accurately forecast 24 months of losses and 12 months of balances. And that's better than, frankly, anybody has been able to do. And we think we're pretty good at looking at how credit evolves. So we're not trying to be difficult. It's just out beyond, particularly your delinquency roll rates. I think it's very hard to predict credit from a quarter-to-quarter basis. So in general, one can think a little bit about how the balances are growing as being the first factor and a trend rate in losses being a second factor. But even that's not enough because our balance growth quarter-to-quarter has a seasonal component, right? So the fourth quarter uptick that you see isn't necessarily going to last throughout the entire year. So we're actually trying to figure out which of those components are going to be more lasting. So there's a whole bunch of things going in there. But I think you can see since we expect growth going up, since we've talked about losses going up, there's going to be more need for allowance going forward."

And some other banks may feel differently about this, but I think it may also manifest what we're trying to achieve here. I think in the long run, there's going to be very significant cost benefit from all of these digital investments. But the biggest benefit and the reason we're doing it is, in almost all cases, not for that reason. And what I'm most excited about is actually the opportunities to generate growth and to generate better real-time decision-making, to make better credit decision and in the end build a deeper franchise through very significant improvements in the customer experience and things that really create more loyalty and more stickiness with the customers. And so over the years, it will be very, very hard for us to measure that because digital and digital -- I mean, digital investments are turning -- are more and more turning us into a digital company as opposed to a company that just tries to digitize what they do, or the phrase I said earlier, to bolt digital on the side of a bank. So it's more and more becoming, over a longer period of time, who we are in terms of how we operate and how we make decisions and how information is used in the company. And if you notice, my passion about this is because I have not seen -- and probably this speaks for mankind as well over our long history, but certainly, I haven't seen anything remotely like this in terms of the ability to transform how a business works. The only parallel is the thing that led me to go out and build Capital One in the first place was looking at how information and technology were going to transform, starting with the card business and ultimately banking. This is going to be a very, very big change, and I think its biggest impacts will not be the impacts that they have on cost. But what is also clear is that for anything as transformational as this, one has to, on a sustainable basis, invest to build the foundational capabilities upon which the sort of digital innovation that the world can see will occur. And this is going to be a longer journey, but I think it's ultimately as significant a transformation as what the information-based opportunity we saw 20-some years ago turned out to be."

Just wanted to follow up on the issue of the provision as we look forward.

Well, first of all, there's a few different phenomena that are going on. When we talk about our charge-offs, especially in the second half of next year and into 2016, going up as a result of growth, that is the composite effect of all the different vintages of actions that are being taken. And I want to separate out a couple of different effects. One is originations and one is credit line increases. These themselves have quite different dynamics. They also have quite different flow in terms of many other metrics, including the timing of profitability and costs in the near term and so on. But anyway, with respect to credit, I would characterize credit line increases tend to -- right when they happen, they have a benefit with respect to losses. And then over time, the charge-offs, on a more delayed basis, build over time. Originations trend to -- they have a momentary kind of benefit from the speedboat effect that they have, but then they tend to peak earlier and then actually improve over the longer term. So -- and again, our credit guidance is just a sort of a composite of all the different things that are going on. We have sizable credit line increase activity. We have very significant origination activity that's been going on and -- over the past year and we hope will continue. And the most important thing we have wanted to do is just make sure that, as we started signaling some time ago, the charge-off math of this very good development for Capital One is pretty predictable. And we wanted to just make sure we got in front of that, and that's what we've done."

So just about anything we do these days versus an equivalent action in 2006 or 2007, certainly, we would expect would peak in a better place. But this is -- and -- but the main thing is we're also saying is that paradoxically, even as we are guiding to higher credit losses, and frankly, guiding to more growth in credit losses than it appears that our competitors are, this is in the context of a very stable and good credit environment. It's in the context of originations that are coming in very much as expected and consistent with what we've seen recently and one that is really therefore entirely just the result of charge-off math associated with acceleration of growth, and frankly, going strikingly from a shrinking situation into one of some pretty good growth."

I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. 2014 full year results reflect solid underlying performance across all of our businesses. Consistent with our expectations provided at the beginning of the year, 2014 pre-provision earnings were $10.1 billion. Net income grew 7% and earnings per share grew 10%. For the year, return on average tangible common equity was 15.8%. Our balance sheet remains strong with an ending common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%. And we reduced our common shares outstanding by 3%, reflecting our share buyback program that began in April.
For the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $999 million or $1.73 per share. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.68 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $2.5 billion were down $125 million from the third quarter as higher linked-quarter revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, largely driven by seasonal and growth-related costs and investments in our technology and regulatory agendas that we have highlighted for you over the past several quarters. Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as higher charge-offs more than offset a smaller allowance built over the previous quarter.
As you can see on Slide 4, reported NIM increased 12 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.81%. Average interest-earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter, driven by growth across our segments. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.4%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, we were at 11.4% in the fourth quarter.
We reduced our net share count by 5 million shares in the quarter, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We expect to complete our previously announced $2.5 billion buyback program in the first quarter of 2015.
We formally entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches as of January 1, 2015, and we continue to estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%. Regarding the LCR as of year-end, we estimate that we are comfortably above the fully phased-in requirement for our consolidated company.
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business, which delivered another quarter of strong growth and results. Ending loans were up about 6% year-over-year. Growth from the linked quarter was also about 6%, stronger than typical seasonal growth. Continuing momentum in new account originations and credit line increase programs drove loan growth in the quarter.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label credit cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 18% year-over-year. Revenue margin for the quarter decreased modestly to about 17.3%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue dollars grew 5% year-over-year, in line with average loan growth. 
As expected, noninterest expenses increased significantly from the third quarter. Strong growth opportunities drove higher marketing, and operating expense increased to support loan and account growth as well as our continuing investments to be a digital leader and meet rising industry regulatory requirements. 
Credit trends in the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations. Last quarter, we explained that the third quarter charge-off rate was unusually low. It was the seasonal low point for charge-off rate and also included the temporary benefit from better-than-expected delinquency rates in early 2014. In the fourth quarter, charge-off rate increased 56 basis points to 3.39%. About half of the increase resulted from expected seasonality and about half from normalization of the temporary delinquency favorability.
The fourth quarter delinquency rate increased in line with normal seasonal pattern. Our expectations for the charge-off rate have not changed. We continue to expect the quarterly Domestic Card charge-off rate throughout 2015 to be in the mid- to high 3% range. We expect normal seasonal patterns throughout the year, including an increase in the charge-off rate in the first quarter.
In addition to seasonality, we continue to expect that loan growth will impact the charge-off rate. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate will be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond.  In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions.
For the full year 2014, the biggest story in our Domestic Card results was the return to growth. Ending loans grew 6% and general-purpose credit card purchase volume grew 16%. Revenues declined 5%, driven by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio. Excluding the revenue impact of the portfolio sale, full year 2014 revenues were flat, in line with average loans.
Noninterest expense declined 6%, with lower operating expense partially offset by higher marketing. Lower operating expense resulted from tight cost management across the business; lower acquisition-related expenses; taking out costs associated with the Best Buy portfolio; and the absence of a nonrecurring legal reserve that impacted 2013 expenses. Provision for credit losses improved modestly, with lower charge-off rate offset by additions to the allowance.
The rekindling of growth, along with our continuing focus on delivering strong and resilient returns, enabled the Domestic Card business to post strong net income while improving the quality of our franchise in 2014. Our card business remains well positioned.
Moving to Slide 8. The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were up about 1% from both the linked quarter and the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 25% year-over-year, driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers.
Ending deposit balances were essentially flat compared to both the linked quarter and the prior year. We've had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition, and we've been allowing the least attractive deposits from Capital One's legacy direct bank to run off.
On a linked-quarter basis, Consumer Banking revenue was up 2%. Noninterest expense increased $89 million or 9% from the linked quarter, driven mostly by auto loan growth, infrastructure and digital investments and higher marketing. And provision for credit losses increased $24 million from the linked quarter, driven by expected seasonal trends in auto charge-offs.
For the full year 2014, revenues were down 3%, driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts.
Full year noninterest expense was up 3%, driven by auto loan growth and the change in the income statement geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses.
Full year provision for credit losses increased $47 million or 7%, consistent with the gradual normalization of auto charge-offs and allowance builds for auto loan growth.
Full year 2014 trends show that our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. While our auto business remains well positioned, we remain cautious and continue to closely monitor pricing, underwriting practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors. Returns on new origination vintages are lower than returns in the overall auto loan portfolio but remain resilient and above hurdle. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low-rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015.
As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter, although the pace of growth is slowing. Loan balances increased about 2% in the quarter and 13% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry verticals, in C&I lending and CRE.
Loan yields declined 6 basis points in the quarter and 59 basis points compared to the prior year, driven mostly by increased competition, lower tax equivalent yield and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. The declining trend in loan yields stabilized somewhat in the quarter.
Revenues increased 5% from the third quarter and about 2% from the prior year. Year-over-year, higher loan volumes have been largely offset by declining yields. 
Noninterest expenses were up 4% from the prior year and 9% from the third quarter as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $23 million from the linked quarter to $32 million. Charge-offs, nonperforming loans and criticized loans remained strong in the fourth quarter. The current levels of commercial credit results are exceptionally low, and we continue to closely manage credit risk.
For the full year, ending loans grew 13% and average loans grew 17%. Revenues grew 6% as volume growth was partially offset by declining yield. 
Noninterest expense grew 13%, moderately lower than the growth in average loans. Provision for credit losses increased $117 million from a negative $24 million to positive $93 million, driven entirely by the swing from allowance releases in 2013 to allowance builds in 2014.
Our Commercial Banking business is well positioned to navigate current market conditions. While falling oil prices are likely a positive for our consumer businesses, we're closely monitoring and managing the potential impact of low oil prices on our $3.7 billion energy portfolio. And competition remains intense in the Commercial Banking business, pressuring margins and returns. It's likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015. But we expect our Commercial Banking business will continue to deliver solid results.
Pulling up, Commercial Banking is thriving at Capital One. The business has steadily and profitably grown to over $50 billion. We've built deep industry specialties and established great relationships with our commercial customers.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. 2014 was a strong year for Capital One. As Steve mentioned, we delivered 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10.1 billion. We posted strong earnings. We strengthened our balance sheet. We returned to growth in our card business and continued to prudently grow our auto and commercial businesses. We improved the quality of our franchise, and we returned significant capital to our shareholders. We're poised to build on the momentum in 2015.
Our expectations for 2015 include the impacts of the investments we've been discussing for several quarters. In our Domestic Card business, we see attractive marketing opportunities to drive future growth. Marketing efficiency, cost to acquire new accounts and the net present value of our marketing investments are strong. We'll continue to invest to drive and support growth in loans, deposits and account relationships across our businesses. 
We're making significant investments in our foundational infrastructure and capabilities to be a digital leader. Banking inherently is a digital product, and digital will transform banking over time. Capital One is well positioned to succeed in the digital world with our heritage as an innovative, information-based company. We are committed to deeply embedding digital in how we work, not merely bolting digital onto the side of our company.
We're also spending to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We're enhancing our capabilities, infrastructure and talent to deliver on the broad set of expanding regulatory requirements and meet increasing expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. And we're continuously improving processes for capital and liquidity management, including CCAR and the new LCR.
Capital One is delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today, and we expect that, that will continue. We have the financial strength to invest in our future without compromising current financial results.
Pulling all this together, in 2015, we expect growth in full year revenues, driven by growth in average loans. We expect that full year marketing and operating expenses will both be higher in 2015 than they were in 2014.
Let me turn to our efficiency ratio, specifically our expectations for the full year 2015 efficiency ratio. In July, we articulated an expected range of 53% to 54%, excluding nonrecurring items. We reaffirmed that range in October. Since then, we've experienced a sizable adverse change in interest rates. As a consequence, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53.5% and 54.5%, excluding nonrecurring items. This change in range is driven entirely by the movement in rates.
We don't take this change in expectations lightly, but we don't believe we should make long-term business decisions based on spot prices for interest rates. We continue to manage costs very tightly across our businesses while making our planned expenditures to drive growth, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. These expenditures are essential to our ability to deliver strong shareholder returns on a sustainable basis. We also expect that efficiency ratio will vary, perhaps significantly, from quarter to quarter based on factors such as day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues and the timing of investments throughout the year.
Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not changed, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto, retail banking and Commercial Banking. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly while we invest to grow, be a digital leader and to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.
And now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?"

Industry balances remain flat -- I mean, have been flat for quite a while. Now we're seeing a little bit of growth. Of course, there have been some increases in marketing levels with respect to direct mail. You can certainly feel in the rewards segment in particular, especially in cash back products, a lot of competition. And it manifests itself in their version of teaser rates, which is early spend, bonus offers. Long-term pricing in general has been stable in the segments that we compete in. And overall, while, again, I think it is intense, I would describe this industry as pretty rational and more stable than the other markets that we compete in, most notably auto and commercial. Now that was the description of the branded card business. The partnership business, which, as you know, Moshe, is sort of a deal flow business, and the -- as one who's certainly been around the branded card business for more than a couple of decades, the most striking difference between these 2 businesses is the auction nature of the partnerships. And that has -- that is the biggest factor that leads this business to have, in my opinion, on an apples-to-apples kind of basis, lower inherent returns and the wild card of the marketplace and the nature of sort of auction prices that exist at any point in time. That -- there are a number of partnerships that are sort of ""up for grabs"" in the marketplace. I would stress that one of the characteristics of this business is the significant majority of all partnerships actually sort of stay with the incumbent. But they certainly go -- nonetheless, most go through the RFP process. So there is a -- there's fair amount of activity in this space, and I am struck by how competitive that is. And certainly, we've been to some auctions where people are stepping up and paying prices in excess of what we're comfortable with. But certainly, I would describe that as pretty intensely competitive and one that we're going to stay very disciplined in."

The -- first of all, I want to say that the net interchange metric can have quarter-to-quarter variability because it includes partnership contractual payments and international card. And we also periodically adjust our rewards liabilities based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. But even beyond that variability and sort of if you look past quarterly noise, the phenomenon you're talking about is real in that net interchange growth has generally lagged general-purpose credit card interchange growth for Capital One. And we would expect this trend to continue. Our rewards programs have been, and they continue to be, very successful with, of course, flagship products like Quicksilver card, the Venture card, the Spark card for Small Business. We're also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and in many ways consistent with the industry, extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And there's some near-term cannibalization when we do this, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. But the net effect of all of this, including leading with great flagship products, this -- all of this contributes to that delta that we think will continue, although there'll be a lot of volatility in that between purchase volume growth and interchange growth."

And if you think about the drivers of our commentary about efficiency ratio and costs at the margin, one is growth opportunities. We have been stepping up increasingly sort of in the card business to invest because we see particular opportunities there. On the commercial side, if anything, our growth opportunity is decelerating because of the choices that we're making in response to market conditions. But those are factors that will play out over time. The regulatory costs are pretty much all across the enterprise, and that's going in only one direction. And I'd be pretty surprised if over the next few years, there's any forces that would move those cost pressures in the opposite direction. And finally, the investments in digital. And while digital is a big opportunity across consumer and commercial, certainly, with -- on a relative basis, I think the revolution is going to be greater on the consumer side. And it's literally going to transform all aspects of how banking is done. It's going to transform not only as people often think through the lens of the customer experience but really the whole way -- the way retail distribution works, the way operations, marketing, servicing and even something that's very, very core to how Capital One works, which is information-based strategy itself. So this is a big deal on the commercial side. It's pretty much a revolutionary deal on the consumer side."

And it sort of started with our comments for some -- for many of the years right after the Great Recession started raging, which is we went into this kind of -- I don't think it's an exaggeration to call it sort of once in a lifetime kind of confluence of events that led the auto industry, both from a growth and from a kind of returns and credit point of view, to be absolutely exceptional. And most of what we have seen happening since then is sort of a regression more toward normal, if you will. And so what's happened, I think for Capital One and certainly for other players, is with each passing quarter, the intensity of the commentary that people in the business make is -- it is increased. But if we pull way up, that we don't see things that are -- would cause us to have great alarm about the business. But what we see is just on the pricing side, increased pressure, although that's stabilized. And when -- if I look at prime and subprime, that's stabilized more recently. But frankly, in the prime space at a below kind of cycle -- a little bit below cycle norms, things are very tight there. The subprime space has been steadily declining, a little bit stable of late. On the underwriting side, the most noteworthy place that there has been any risk expansion has been in terms of terms, and there's been significant growth of the over 72 months loans. But still, things like LTVs, which is probably the single most important variable, have remained, certainly on the prime side, stable and healthy; on the subprime side, moderately increasing but well below sort of prerecession levels. So more the way I would characterize this auto business is that we just have to stay very, very vigilant. And what I find is we -- our choices, sort of one dealer and one deal at a time, end up with the growth moderating in subprime. For example, subprime has been flat for -- at Capital One, I think, for -- in the originations for about -- I'm guessing, since 2011. I think it's been pretty flat so that essentially all of the growth in originations has been on the near prime and especially the prime side. So those -- that -- I think that's a manifestation of our reaction to the marketplace and continuing to pursue opportunity where it is prudent and where we can build deeper dealer relationships. But I would say the important thing I want to leave with you is while even new originations you can see have, pound for pound, kind of a bit higher credit risk than some of the exceptional stuff of the past, we -- the business that we are originating, we still feel, is well above hurdle and we like the opportunity."

First of all, it feels to us pretty much exactly the same as when we talked about this a quarter ago. But just to put this in perspective, card credit has been exceptionally strong over the past few years. And our portfolio has benefited from the improving economy and a generally more disciplined consumer. And our back book, which is made up mostly of customers who weathered the Great Recession, that continues to show exceptionally low risk and is very resilient. We see great opportunities for resilient new business. But from the starting point of our highly seasoned back book, most new business will have higher losses. So the credit performance of our new originations and our credit line increases has been strong. And in fact, it's meeting in -- well, it is this meeting and in some cases even exceeding our expectations in a good way. And since we've returned to growth, I've been emphasizing that these new loan -- as these new loan balances season, they will start putting upward pressure on card's overall charge-off rate. And this impact is going to be modest at first, but we expect it to grow through 2015 and beyond. And we've been growing in this segment we've always been focused on. We continue to avoid the segments that we think lack resilience even if they have quite nice returns in today's environment. And the -- and that's -- that is really the essence of our credit story, and we wanted to make sure that people exactly understand what is the dynamic that is leading charge-offs to increase. But back to the original question that you asked, this is not driven by a worsening of credit performance of the existing book or anything like this. It's really the by-product of our seizing a growth opportunity and sort of the vintage math of that."

And there were a couple of onetime items in there, too. We had roughly $70 million of expenses for redeeming a preferred issuance in 2013 that we didn't in '14.

And the -- and this is, of course, in the context of headwinds that are pushing things so hard in the other direction. And you can see over the -- starting, well, the second half of 2012 and through 2013 and 2014, the trajectory of operating expense. And of course, some of that comes from deal-related expenses that sort of automatically happen. We've also worked hard to make sure that we get the synergies we talked about in the deals and drive out the integration costs and things like that. Also though, other big areas of focus have been the area of procurement and we always sort of worked hard at that. But by building a big, centralized and almost the whole science about it and making it have the feel almost like a line of business has been a -- has been something that's even exceeded our own expectations. And we pretty rigorously measure not just what -- talking to ourselves about how things are better but really a before-and-after kind of thing. And that has led to some tangible -- I mean, pretty sizable, tangible benefits. Another area that, of course, should generate increasing benefit is in digitization. So a lot of the impacts of digital are really sort of hard to measure, and it really relates to the way we work but things like going paperless, driving people away from some of the more expensive channels into the digital channels and some of the transformation in terms of marketing to be more online and so on. These have effects that we measure, and they -- the numbers are starting to grow. The ---- on digital, just take digital itself, that is a net trade that has cost a lot higher than benefits at the moment in terms of what you can purely measure because we're investing heavily in digital. And all of our -- there's almost nothing that we're investing in digital where the primary objective is to save money. This digital transformation is such a comprehensive revolution. It really allows for things to be faster and way better for the customer, a better associate experience, much better controlled from a compliance point of view, more scalable, and yes, lower cost. So right now, one of the important net negative trades is what's happening on just the pure cost side with respect to digital. By the way, the overall economic benefits of digital, and I would argue that an important reason that we're on the growth trajectory we're on in the card business, is, in fact, because of our digital success not only in terms of the customer experience but really in things like how we do marketing and things like that. So this will -- I believe the long-term payoff of the digital investment is going to be very significant. In the near term, from the cost line, this is going to be a net negative trade. And of course, the investments in the regulatory thing is a -- very substantial. And of course, we know which direction those things are moving. And the other thing on the cost side, of course, is the investment in growth itself. And there, the biggest number is, of course, marketing, but there are also operating costs that go along with that as well. And as you know, Eric, we -- that's our highest priority for our own expenditures is to make sure that we're investing in our own growth, and those investments will continue. So net-net, one minus all of that needs to be just -- there's kind of a fanatical multiyear quest to wring out every single penny that we can. And all of that is -- nets out in this number that I am sure some people look at and say, ""Well, with all the growth in all the digital, somehow shouldn't that be lower?"""

And it's not as simple, nor would ever be as simple, as we take 13 months of anything. It's actually looking at loss content in our portfolio. And there are 2 things that are really going on. One is the growth that we've talked about. And unless you assume growth has 0 losses, adding growth will drive up a need for allowance. The second piece of it is a little bit of the mix movement that Rich talked about from an incredibly low and resilient back book to a very much expected but higher loss front book. And as that becomes more of the equation, that is going to drive up the loss content, which ultimately is reflected in allowance. It's not a matter of not wanting to be helpful to actually give you a sense as to where allowance would end up. We have to accurately forecast 24 months of losses and 12 months of balances. And that's better than, frankly, anybody has been able to do. And we think we're pretty good at looking at how credit evolves. So we're not trying to be difficult. It's just out beyond, particularly your delinquency roll rates. I think it's very hard to predict credit from a quarter-to-quarter basis. So in general, one can think a little bit about how the balances are growing as being the first factor and a trend rate in losses being a second factor. But even that's not enough because our balance growth quarter-to-quarter has a seasonal component, right? So the fourth quarter uptick that you see isn't necessarily going to last throughout the entire year. So we're actually trying to figure out which of those components are going to be more lasting. So there's a whole bunch of things going in there. But I think you can see since we expect growth going up, since we've talked about losses going up, there's going to be more need for allowance going forward."

And some other banks may feel differently about this, but I think it may also manifest what we're trying to achieve here. I think in the long run, there's going to be very significant cost benefit from all of these digital investments. But the biggest benefit and the reason we're doing it is, in almost all cases, not for that reason. And what I'm most excited about is actually the opportunities to generate growth and to generate better real-time decision-making, to make better credit decisions and in the end build a deeper franchise through very significant improvements in the customer experience and things that really create more loyalty and more stickiness with the customers. And so over the years, it will be very, very hard for us to measure that because digital and digital -- I mean, digital investments are turning -- are more and more turning us into a digital company as opposed to a company that just tries to digitize what they do, or the phrase I said earlier, to bolt digital on the side of a bank. So it's more and more becoming, over a longer period of time, who we are in terms of how we operate and how we make decisions and how information is used in the company. And if you notice, my passion about this is because I have not seen -- and probably this speaks for mankind as well over our long history, but certainly, I haven't seen anything remotely like this in terms of the ability to transform how a business works. The only parallel is the thing that led me to go out and build Capital One in the first place was looking at how information and technology were going to transform, starting with the card business and ultimately banking. This is going to be a very, very big change, and I think its biggest impacts will not be the impacts that they have on cost. But what is also clear is that for anything as transformational as this, one has to, on a sustainable basis, invest to build the foundational capabilities upon which the sort of digital innovation that the world can see will occur. And this is going to be a longer journey, but I think it's ultimately as significant a transformation as what the information-based opportunity we saw 20-some years ago turned out to be."

When we talk about our charge-offs, especially in the second half of next year and into 2016, going up as a result of growth, that is the composite effect of all the different vintages of actions that are being taken. And I want to separate out a couple of different effects. One is originations and one is credit line increases. These themselves have quite different dynamics. They also have quite different flow in terms of many other metrics, including the timing of profitability and costs in the near term and so on. But anyway, with respect to credit, I would characterize credit line increases tend to -- right when they happen, they have a benefit with respect to losses. And then over time, the charge-offs, on a more delayed basis, build over time. Originations trend to -- they have a momentary kind of benefit from the speedboat effect that they have, but then they tend to peak earlier and then actually improve over the longer term. So -- and again, our credit guidance is just a sort of a composite of all the different things that are going on. We have sizable credit line increase activity. We have very significant origination activity that's been going on and -- over the past year and we hope will continue. And the most important thing we have wanted to do is just make sure that, as we started signaling some time ago, the charge-off math of this very good development for Capital One is pretty predictable. And we wanted to just make sure we got in front of that, and that's what we've done."

So just about anything we do these days versus an equivalent action in 2006 or 2007, certainly, we would expect would peak in a better place. But this is -- and -- but the main thing is we're also saying is that paradoxically, even as we are guiding to higher credit losses, and frankly, guiding to more growth in credit losses than it appears that our competitors are, this is in the context of a very stable and good credit environment. It's in the context of originations that are coming in very much as expected and consistent with what we've seen recently and one that is really therefore entirely just the result of charge-off math associated with acceleration of growth, and frankly, going strikingly from a shrinking situation into one of some pretty good growth."

For the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2 per share and has an average return on tangible common equity of 15%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.97 per share.
Net income was up $154 million, driven by higher pre-provision earnings and the lower provision expense versus the prior quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased by $69 million versus the prior quarter as lower revenue was more than offset by lower marketing and operating expenses.
Provision for credit losses decreased on a linked quarter basis driven by a smaller allowance and lower charge-offs versus the previous quarter.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll briefly touch on an interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 24 basis points in the first quarter to 6.57%. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by 2 fewer days to recognize income and temporarily higher your cash balances. We don't expect any incremental margin pressure to meet the LCR since we already are above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of March 31, 2015.
Turning to Slide 5, let me cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.5% as of March 31. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this ratio would be approximately 12.1%. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5.4 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions that began last April. Over the past year, we have reduced shares outstanding by $24.9 million or 4%. 
We entered for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1 and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target. We were pleased with our 2015 CCAR results and believe they continue to demonstrate our strong commitment to return capital to shareholders.
Our approved submission includes a planned increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per share. In addition, our plan authorizes the repurchase of up to 3.125 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016.
Our long-stated preference for the focus of capital return continues to be in the form of share repurchases. And while investors can expect an ongoing ability to generate strong returns and a commitment to return excess capital subject to regulatory approval, investors should not infer a long-term commitment from our more recent payout ratios. With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

And I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see good opportunities",1408,"Thanks, Steve. And I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year and average loans grew about 7%. 
We continue to post strong growth and see good opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 19% year-over-year. This growth was driven by the success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations across our card business and credit line increases.
Compared to the first quarter of 2014, revenues were up 7%, in line with average loan growth as revenue margin was stable. On a linked quarter basis, revenue margin decreased seasonally to 16.9%. Year-over-year, noninterest expenses increased 2%, driven by a higher marketing consistent with our return to loan growth. As expected, noninterest expenses decreased about 6% from the linked quarter with seasonal declines in marketing.
Credit in the first quarter was stronger-than-expected. We experienced better than forecasted delinquency flow rates. The charge off rate increased 16 basis points to 3.55%. The delinquency rate improved 35 basis points to 2.92%. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through the charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rates in the lower end of our previously communicated mid- to high 3% range, perhaps even getting into the low 3% range at the third quarter seasonal low point. The improvement in our outlook for Domestic Card credit drove a modest allowance release in the quarter. We also expect favorable credit to drive lower-than-expected past due fees, putting modest pressure on revenue.
Longer-term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth mass. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate is modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. We still expect growth mass to drive quarter charge-off rate to be in the mid- to high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016. 
In addition, while this quarter shows that we may not have allowance builds every quarter, we expect growth to drive allowance additions going forward.
Our card business remains well-positioned to deliver growth with attractive and resilient returns.
Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were up about 1% from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 10% year-over-year driven by strong auto sales and deepening we ships with our existing dealers.
Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continues to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposits business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto.
Provision for credit losses grew $66 million to $207 million, driven by a change in allowance. In the first quarter of last year, we had a modest allowance release. In the first quarter of this year, growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit drove an allowance build.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. Personally low interest rates will continue to pressure returns and our deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2015. In our auto business, we've been experiencing normalization of both credit and returns from once-in-a-lifetime levels coming out of the Great Recession. Credit performance is gradually worsening in the industry and we see slightly higher losses on newer originations. We've been cautious on industry underwriting and competitive practices for some time. As a result, lower subprime originations have been essentially flat for nearly 2 years.
In the first quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. And used vehicle values remain at historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results but be assume lower prices in our underwriting so we remain comfortable with the resilience of the business.
Despite our guided caution, we will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased about 10% year-over-year with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I and CRE. As we've been signaling, our year-over-year growth is slowing compared to prior years in response to market conditions. Loan balances declined modestly from the linked quarter as we've seen some slippage in industry underwriting standards in pockets of the market. 
Revenues increased 13% from the prior year, driven by growth in average loans, as well as increased fee income from agency multifamily originations. These factors we're partially offset by loan yields, which declined 25 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition. 
Noninterest expenses were up 7% from the prior year as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $28 million in the quarter to $60 million. The provision in the quarter was primarily driven by an allowance build for our $3.6 billion of loans to the oil and gas industry, driven by the impact of lower oil prices.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. 96% of our loans are secured and 73% are shared national credits. Our largest exposure is in exploration and production in which we benefit from holding loans at the top of the capital structure and discounted collateral values. Many of our borrowers are at least partially hedged against falling oil and gas prices. Our second largest exposure is in oilfield services in which our customers face greater downstream challenges as the E&P companies cut back in response to lower asset prices. We're working through these issues on a customer by customer basis.
We're also a lender in the taxi medallion finance industry, with a small portfolio of less than $1 billion in loans. Medallion values have softened because of increased competition from new entrants like Uber. We continue to closely watch this sector.
Overall, commercial charge-offs, nonperforming loans and criticized loans remained strong. While we continue to closely manage credit risk, we don't expect these levels to be sustainable through the cycle.
Our Commercial Banking business remains well-positioned to navigate a challenging environment in which intense competition continues to put pressure on growth, margins and returns.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. 
Capital One posted strong results in the first quarter. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today and we expect that will continue. For the full year of 2015, we expect growth in revenues driven by growth in average loans. As you can see in our Domestic Card business, we are experiencing very strong growth. And in this window, we are likely to increase marketing to take advantage of the opportunities we see to help sustain the current trajectory. While growth opportunity will drive long-term value creation, the higher marketing and the higher operating expense of additional volumes will put pressure -- will put pressure on the efficiency ratio.
As a result, we are likely to be in the higher end or possibly modestly above the 53.5% to 54.5% efficiency ratio range, excluding nonrecurring items. We're managing costs very tightly across our businesses to stay within the range but we will also strive to make the right business choices to drive long-term value as growth opportunities unfold through the year.
Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not change and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline and underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly while we invest to grow, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.
And now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?"

There's a charge-off component and then there's what happens on your allowance. So you have one piece of that already in the charge-off guidance but that charge-off guidance, in and of itself, is also a contributor to what's likely to happen to allowances. So let me back up for a second, because I know this is a continuing question, and just trying to give a little bit more help. At the highest level, we build our card allowance and, actually, it's not too different anywhere but let's talk about our card allowance off in 3 different things. With the loan balances at the end of the period, that our charge-off forecast would be over the next 12 months and then, there are qualitative factors, which really cover the risk that are not captured by models. So if you're really trying to model the allowance in future quarters, you're going to need to make assumptions on all of those. A growth rate in the assumptions alone. And remember, if you're not doing a year-over-year growth rate, you've got to think about the seasonality because they can run off in different ways. Next, you also would need to -- however -- whenever you want to forecast it for the balance is, look at what the charge-offs are over the next quarters after that. And then with regards to our qualitative factors, they have been about 10% to 15% in benign periods but they can vary pretty significantly if you're entering or exiting a credit cycle. So I'm trying to give you a little bit of a picture of why small movements and assumptions can create swings in a quarter, which end up being meaningful. And the most impactful of the 3 assumptions is really the net charge-off rate. And just looking at this on a static basis with our current loan balances of $74 billion, a 15-basis point change in loss rate in the quarter, all other things being equal, will drive $100 million change in allowance. As Rich talked about in the first quarter, we experienced better-than-expected delinquencies in the flow rates. So the starting point for our next 12 months loss forecast have shifted down and as a result, we had allowance releases. Had that not happened, growth would have actually probably driven allowance builds. So going forward, it's a combination of growth and our expectations for loss that suggests that we're going to need allowance builds. But it's really hard to go a lot further than that, given all of the factors that I've been through. Hopefully, that helps, Ryan, in a way that you think about constructing what could happen to allowance."

It's interesting -- you may remember last year, we flagged it this time, kind of a similar phenomena that we saw this year that, better-than-expected flow rates. And then just seeing those flow rates kind of mechanically, we put a, given the 6-month window that we have, that we can watch delinquencies flow in the charge-offs, you can see that we've adjusted our projections for that 6-month window. You may remember last year that this phenomenon that we saw around this time last year, in the latter part of the year, we said we saw most of it dissipates. So we are not assuming that this changes the outlook for the end of the year or beyond and if that changes obviously we would -- if this phenomenon sustained itself, obviously we would do just that. So we are here today with the same kind of outlook that we had last time we were talking to you and it is just very clear that the growth math and you can see the pretty dramatic growth numbers that we have the growth math just pretty much have to carry the day and that's why we're looking to the fourth quarter as is still the mid- to high 3% range. And then we are saying, and then 2016 would be up from there and we're saying up from there just again by the vintage math of growth. And all of this is in the context of a kind of unique time in the industry and for Capital One where most of our customers that we have right now in our book, they weathered the Great Recession and are very low risk and I think exceptionally resilient. So it's pretty much anything we book moves the numbers up from here. We feel great about the credit quality of what we're booking but the growth math is just very inexorable in that sense. Now you asked the question when will this level off? We are reluctant to be predicting something that's going to be, have a lot of factors driving that when we get there. But I think our point is that 2016 will be a year of rising charge-offs off of the trajectory with which we leave 2015 just because again, the accumulated math of the vintages of the new business that we're booking."

Bill, first of all, I want to say that most of you may be aware that in both the U.K. and in Canada, there have been a regulatory-based moves to lower interchange. The need of our businesses, there particularly our U.K. business are highly dependent on purchase volume for the economics of the business. So I don't think this will have a big impact on our particular overall economics even though it's an important move in the marketplace. They already, a number of issuers have come out in response to the lower interchange rates in the U.K. and have notified their customers that future reward -- rewards will be at a lower rate. I think that's pretty natural in a tight-margin business and a rewards business is a very tight-margin business. With the interchange and the high payment of reward benefits, that's pretty natural market phenomenon and we already see that going on in the U.K. Interestingly, there's been some pushback and noise on the consumer side because consumers really do like their rewards. And I think we should all take note that even in the country where the rewards rates are lower, there is some pushback there. And I think it's a reminder that in the U.S, consumers who are enjoying higher rates of rewards are pretty vocal for us for the preservation of these benefits."

If I may ask a bit of a high-level question on what we're seeing on the partnership business. Did you, I believe, I've heard you express in the past, is that you like the partnership business but that your optimism is somewhat tempered by the fact that contracts come up for renewal every 5 years or so and the potential exists for outsized profits to get computer the way in that process and I'm paraphrasing, but is that's a sense of that in from your commentary. But there are others in the space who are expressing a bit more of an optimistic view on the partnership businesses and kind of thinking, talking about how the thing that they're most focus on is how their merchant partners are looking for them to help them drive incremental sales growth and they talk about how the pipeline is very strong. And so I guess the question then is, what do you think is driving these differences and views? Some folks in the partnership business are a little bit more optimistic in their outlook?

So as one who built this company initially on a direct to consumer model, one customer at the time. You have seen that the long history and current performance of that business and a little bit spoils me on the the pretty much, everything else in the banking business and I kind of start for my calibration. And frankly, the big difference between, as you said, between the regular direct to consumer credit card business and the partnership business is the holding of auctions that happens on average every 5 years. And that tends to, all other things being equal, be quite a mitigator in terms of some of the upside potential. So that, many of my comments have been just that calibration. The partnership business is a very interesting and intriguing one to me and for a lot of the reasons that you cited others are talking about. As you know, the retailing business, for example, is in massive strategic turmoil and the impact to digital and the need for retailers to reinvent themselves is an extraordinary, in many ways, kind of existential kind of imperative. And I think that companies like Capital One that are doing very significant investments in digital and in mobile and in not just the customer experience associated with that, but all the underlying infrastructure that is behind what it takes to actually innovate in digital. Companies like ours, I think, are in very good position to partner with retailers and help them strategically and actually, in terms of real product innovation and execution in that transformation. So we are also investing in an opportunity and we have partners that are with whom we're working on right now with some pretty cool digital innovations and -- so, that's one reason I like this space a lot. It's also such a natural sibling to our regular branded business and but what we're doing is, we're -- how do we deal with sort of this overhang of the options, we just make sure that we never say we have to win no matter what. We go out there, we're selective relative to make sure these are great companies we're working with, companies that are in the partnership business with us for the right reason. We're just really motivated to build the franchise and not just for the making of near-term money that sometimes comes to the sacrifice of customer practices. And finally, selectively, where ultimately, the price of the deal is something where both parties can win."

But that's really a small effect. I mean, mostly, what -- essentially what we're talking about here is something that we've seen on not infrequently over the -- for me, the 20-year history of being in this business is that from time to time, we notice that all our flow rates, our delinquency flow rates move in a similar direction all at one time. And usually when this happens, there's not necessarily an explanation for it. Often, we're able to go back later and tie it back to economic data that comes out later and so on. This is not a huge effect. I don't want to get carried away and see much bigger effects in other times. But because we have actually gone out to give sort of quarterly guidance, all we're saying is, coming in better than the quarterly guidance in the relatively near term, relative to when we did it, just relates to better-than-expected flow rates without having a perfect explanation. There's probably some general economic effect that's going on. But then our most important point is that we don't necessarily see any evidence that this should change our longer-term view about the trajectory and magnitude of the charge-off we're talking about."

And then when we see them, we tend to seize them because we've also learned markets continue to move. So that's the phenomenon that's going on here. Where we are seeing the growth opportunity is pretty much in our branded book across-the-board where we are investing. And we're pretty much investing in all places other -- as we talked about, other than high-balanced revolvers, so it's pretty much 1 minus that. And it's where the opportunities are happening there.

So it's not like, well, this is a practice, we don't use that one, or when do we require this kind of collateral or this kind of information for a particular loan. It is the intersection of the particular practices as it relates to a particular customer and the credit risk of that customer that has moved for some players. And it is -- it is not a universal thing. Some players have been more aggressive than others and we just haven't been around long enough to know the the key thing is, we very much have a culture around here. Nobody is -- people don't live with growth targets to Capital One. We forecast growth when we think it's going to come but people all know that job one if you raise your hand and flag when you see opportunities and the most important thing is, that we go after resilient business. We are flagging some of the -- yes, we ticked up a little bit our commentary on this although we have been talking for quite a while about it. We talked in many ways taking 2 different perspectives. Partly what we've said over time is, just understand coming off once-in-a-lifetime unique situation of incredibly tight credit and incredibly, conservative borrowers. Some of the kind that's loosening out there would be in the category of normal reversion to the main. Some of the stuff that we're flagging here would, I think be on the other side of that. But on the other hand, this is not something where we're saying, oh my gosh, this is, you're going to see us just pull out of this thing. We still believe there's selectively very good opportunity for Capital One to go get the assets that we want and build the -- continue to build and even expand the number of dealer relationships that we have. But we wanted to just put the street on increasingly, I notice in the sense that we are very carefully watching the practices and we're going to make the choices that we make for resilience. And we hope that there really are many ways to offsetting forces with respect to growth. We're clearly losing deals, one customer at a time sometime -- sometimes that we might have won in the past because others have moved farther in there underwriting. On the other hand, some of the innovations we have and the really sustained success in building deeper relationships moving up through their prime relationships and expanding dealer relationships is a force in the opposite direction that still generates growth. So the net effect of those 2 things will drive our results. You can see that in general, Subprimers where we have -- you don't see that much growth going on anymore and most of it really has been in prime only lately."

They were the only seasoning that one would have on existing accounts. While the buffers of all, existing accounts always, the outstanding ebb and flow with people spending and borrowing and just general kind of ambient activity. The only big mover on the existing file would be line increases. And having been in sort of a brownout period for a couple of years with respect to line increases as we said, getting back in the line increases led to, if you will, sort of a surge of catching for a second, we're on a slightly higher side of equilibrium, probably at the moment, I would say there, the seasoning of those is the difference seasoning dynamic with respect to new business. The line increases tend to -- all the economics of line increases have upfront, it's sort of upfront very good things, doesn't cost much to get them. There's no kind of spike of diabolical behaviors or anything. So what you tend to have is, and for a well, people use their line to pay any obligations and so on. So what you have there is more of a steady delayed sort of rising charge-offs over time with that vantage. That is an important but minority part of the overall growth right now. It's an important minority, shall we say. The majority of the growth is coming from the origination side of the business or from recent originations and the very immediate sort of credit line moves we might make relative to those. But I'd put that all in the category of originations. The vintage dynamics for that are very different. First of all, all the economics that are upfront, you take all you're paying, you got your high cost to originate. the big allowance builds, there's even sort of the peak of charge-offs comes pretty early. And then it moderates over time so that all the good news aspect of that thing happens over time. Our -- the majority of our growth is coming on the origination side but there's a sizable minority that is on the line increase side. And that's approaching an equilibrium now, it's on the high side of equilibrium."

Well, Moshe, you're talking about a sector that as long as I've been around it has been pretty intensely competitive. Now it tends to be lopsided relative to a lot of competition from a small number of players and sort of modest involvement from everybody in the business. This rewards space is, certainly, is still very competitive and the recent manifestation of extra competition there has been early spend bonuses have continued to rise, that's probably the most noteworthy thing. I think others in general, have  come out with products that are a little better than what they have for the existing books. So there's a little movement on product value and continued competition on early spend bonuses. So we have our eye on that and of course, the other place for the competition, of course, is just in the amount of marketing. And people are stepping up the amounts of marketing as well. So overall, I would say there has been, modest, pretty, pretty modest, in the overall scheme of things, sort of increase in the intensity of competition there. Now you talked about, so in the context of all of that, as rates go up at some point, I think a sizable increase in interest rates will probably have a fair amount of impact on that to, I would expect, modest interest rate changes to impact that too much but and of the most you can be spent a lot of time thinking about this, what were you going to say?"

The other big uncertainty we've talked about and continue to have going forward is how CCAR advance to purchase will come together. So this just whole bunch of reasons why we don't want people to lock into what we have done over the last 3 years and just assume that's the minimum going forward."

Are we going to continue to see an acceleration in that business? I mean, your spend of growth in the U.S. is pretty amazing compared to the industry and I guess that's credit line driven as well. So outlook for growth and are we -- which products and are you near the end of the credit line increases?"

So Bob, the -- let me talk about the outstanding growth to start with. That is being driven by somewhat by line increases and also by the success of origination programs on sort of across the various parts of all the parts of the business that we're investing in. So the line increases, I guess my description was we're on the higher side of equilibrium but if they're sort of approaching on an equilibrium there. But we're probably bid on higher side of equilibrium there. On the spend side, that is, that's driven by, I mean, you were kind of right when you are going on in a sense, the spend is, partly the success we have in the rewards programs we have, it's also people filling up their lines in a sense, either coming from line increases or a lot of new originations where people or starting to ramp up their spending there. So there's a number of things that have come together to make really quite extraordinary spend growth and all of that, I think, is reflective of a kind of pull that way up and just talk about our growth here for a second. The growth that you see here, and Bob, you've known Capital One for a long, long time. Our strong growth is really driven by the investments we made in the last few years and the current market dynamics that represent a window opportunity. And we're continuing to invest to try to sustain this trajectory and it's been around long enough to know that life's about Windows of opportunity. And the way Capital One works is, when we see Windows, we really do kind of go for it. We also, interestingly, if there's a reverse window, if you will, when we think market dynamics get, in a kind of negative sense, we, a lot of times, exceed the market in the other directions, sometimes in pulling back. But this is one of those things where a number of things that have come together in the byproduct of a lot of investment opportunities in digital innovation that going on and we'll capitalize on it, as long as it lasts. We're reluctant to give a growth outlook because almost by definition, when you're growing at some of the kind of rates that you've seen here, it's just hard to predict where things go from here, but we certainly are continuing to invest and that's reflective in some of our comments about on the cost side."

So, Betsy, first of all, with respect to external digital parties, there's a lot of manifestations of Capital One's commitment to digital. We've done a number of partnerships. We've done a number of acquisitions like adaptive path, level money and things like that. We've done a number of -- a very large number of recruiting -- recruiting successes and including some pretty high-profile folks that we've brought in. One thing is absolutely clear, and it's, we believe this from the beginning, that every bank is going to need to transform itself. The digital revolution is changing banking on just about every dimension that you can imagine. Basically, it's changing what it takes to win in payments and distribution and in marketing brand, foundational infrastructure, experience, design if you will. The way information is used and in the end, that really means the role of talent is central to that kind of transformation. And so in the talent marketplace, in the partnership marketplace, I think these folks, you can't just go out there with a checkbook and say, here we are, we're here to bring you into the fold. I think these folks look to see and they come in and kick the tires to say, is this a company that's both in a digital onto the side of a traditional bank? Or is this the company that is really, like in our case is really trying to build a really leading information-based technology company in a sense? And the key manifestation of that are, inside the company, are the leaders committed? Are they digitally fluent, have they digitally reimagined their business? Are they bringing technology talent not just into some like place in IT in a sense, but is it really being brought right into the heart of the business and become sort of who you are? So when you've heard me talk a lot about digital, its just that, this reminds me a lot of 20 years ago sort of building an information based company, I'm incredibly excited end sobered by the what it takes to actually really build an information-based technology company and I really like our chances. And along the way, as we go on that journey, the more success we have there will correlate also with a lot of people from the outside. That is the kind of company that I think speaks our language and is one of us and you'll see more of the kind of partnerships and successes that you alluded to."

I think it's ironic that the banking system is, from stem to, stern built on a batch base. So you pretty much look at it, anything and from the old direct mail stuff that Capital One and so many of this have done over the years the whole way clearing works. And so really, while there are many, many aspects to the batch nature of this thing, right at the center is this dire need that, in a world that's increasingly is going toward pure electronic payments, there's a massive kind of, oh yes, lag in the end, to make those things fully happen. Most banks, pretty much all of those banks have built middleware layer to, in a sense, simulate realtime even in the context of reality that that's very much batch based. I'm not sure that realtime payments will actually transform banking as much as a lot of people think it will. But the reality of, when the world moves, if we pull up from realtime payments and clearly technically, to the larger point the world moving to such immediate interactivity and such a mobile world, the really dramatic transformation that's going to happen to banking is it's going to become realtime, far beyond kind of realtime payments. And I think that banks are so in a way, well-suited to drive to that destination yet the world will drive us back there. I think that you kind of put your finger on something even from a broader point of view that I think it's the heart of the whole reinvention of banking that is coming. It's just that for banks to get there, the banking system and for banks individually, there a lot that, that entails.

For the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2 per share and has an average return on tangible common equity of 15%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.97 per share.
Net income was up $154 million, driven by higher pre-provision earnings and lower provision expense versus the prior quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased by $69 million versus the prior quarter as lower revenue was more than offset by lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses decreased on a linked-quarter basis, driven by a smaller allowance build and lower charge-offs versus the previous quarter.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll briefly touch on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 24 basis points in the first quarter to 6.57%. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by 2 fewer days to recognize income and temporarily higher cash balances. We don't expect any incremental margin pressure to meet the LCR since we are already above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of March 31, 2015.
Turning to Slide 5, let me cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.5% as of March 31. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this ratio would be approximately 12.1%. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5.4 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions that began last April. Over the past year, we have reduced shares outstanding by $24.9 million or 4%.
We entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target. We were pleased with our 2015 CCAR results and believe they continue to demonstrate our strong commitment to return capital to shareholders.
Our approved submission include a planned increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per share. In addition, our plan authorizes the repurchase of up to 3.125 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016.
Our long-stated preference for the focus of capital return continues to be in the form of share repurchases. And while investors can expect an ongoing ability to generate strong returns and a commitment to return excess capital subject to regulatory approval, investors should not infer a long-term commitment from our recent payout ratios.
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year, and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see good opportunities",1401,"Thanks, Steve.
And I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year, and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see good opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 19% year-over-year. This growth was driven by the success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations across our card business and credit line increases.
Compared to the first quarter of 2014, revenues were up 7%, in line with average loan growth as revenue margin was stable. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue margin decreased seasonally to 16.9%. Year-over-year, noninterest expenses increased 2%, driven by a higher marketing consistent with our return to loan growth. As expected, noninterest expenses decreased about 6% from the linked quarter with seasonal declines in marketing.
Credit in the first quarter was stronger than expected. We experienced better-than-forecasted delinquency flow rates. The charge-off rate increased 16 basis points to 3.55%. The delinquency rate improved 35 basis points to 2.92%. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through the charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rates in the lower end of our previously communicated mid- to high 3% range, perhaps even getting into the low 3% range at the third quarter seasonal low point. The improvement in our outlook for Domestic Card credit drove a modest allowance release in the quarter. We also expect favorable credit to drive lower-than-expected past due fees, putting modest pressure on revenue.
Longer-term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate is modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. We still expect the growth math to drive quarter charge-off rate to be in the mid- to high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016.
In addition, while this quarter shows that we may not have allowance builds every quarter, we expect growth to drive allowance additions going forward. Our card business remains well-positioned to deliver growth with attractive and resilient returns.
Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were up about 1% from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 10% year-over-year, driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers.
Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continues to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto.
Provision for credit losses grew $66 million to $207 million, driven by a change in allowance. In the first quarter of last year, we had a modest allowance release. In the first quarter of this year, growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit drove an allowance build.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2015. 
In our auto business, we've been experiencing normalization of both credit and returns from once-in-a-lifetime levels coming out of the Great Recession. Credit performance is gradually worsening in the industry, and we see slightly higher losses on newer originations. We've been cautious on industry underwriting and competitive practices for some time. As a result, our subprime originations have been essentially flat for nearly 2 years.
In the first quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. And used vehicle values remain at historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results, but we assume lower prices in our underwriting so we remain comfortable with the resilience of the business.
Despite our heightened caution, we will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased about 10% year-over-year, with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I and CRE. As we've been signaling, our year-over-year growth is slowing compared to prior years in response to market conditions. Loan balances declined modestly from the linked quarter as we've seen some slippage in industry underwriting standards in pockets of the market.
Revenues increased 13% from the prior year, driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multifamily originations. These factors we're partially offset by loan yields, which declined 25 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition.
Noninterest expenses were up 7% from the prior year, as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $28 million in the quarter to $60 million. The provision in the quarter was primarily driven by an allowance build for our $3.6 billion of loans to the oil and gas industry, driven by the impact of lower oil prices.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. 96% of our loans are secured, and 73% are shared national credit. Our largest exposure is in exploration and production, in which we benefit from holding loans at the top of the capital structure and discount in collateral values. Many of our borrowers are at least partially hedged against falling oil and gas prices. Our second largest exposure is in oilfield services, in which our customers face greater downstream challenges as E&P companies cut back in response to lower asset prices. We're working through these issues on a customer-by-customer basis.
We are also a lender in the Taxi Medallion Finance industry, with a small portfolio of less than $1 billion in loans. Medallion values have softened because of increased competition from new entrants, like Uber. We continue to closely watch this sector.
Overall, commercial charge-offs, nonperforming loans and criticized loans remain strong. While we continue to closely manage credit risk, we don't expect these levels to be sustainable through the cycle.
Our Commercial Banking business remains well-positioned to navigate a challenging environment, in which intense competition continues to put pressure on growth, margin and returns.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. Capital One posted strong results in the first quarter. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today, and we expect that will continue. For the full year 2015, we expect growth in revenues, driven by growth in average loans. As you can see in our Domestic Card business, we are experiencing very strong growth. And in this window, we are likely to increase marketing to take advantage of the opportunities we see to help sustain the current trajectory. While growth opportunities would drive long-term value creation, the higher marketing and the higher operating expense of additional volumes will pressure -- will put pressure on efficiency ratio.
As a result, we are likely to be in the higher end or possibly modestly above the 53.5% to 54.5% efficiency ratio range, excluding nonrecurring items. We're managing cost very tightly across our businesses to stay within the range, but we will also strive to make the right business choices to drive long-term value as growth opportunities unfold through the year.
Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not change, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline and underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly, while we invest to grow, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry-regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.
And now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?"

So you have one piece of that already in the charge-off guidance. But that charge-off guidance, in and of itself, is also a contributor to what's likely to happen to allowances. So let me back up for a second, because I know this is a continuing question, and just give -- try and give a little bit more help. At the highest level, we build our card allowance and -- actually, it's not too different anywhere, but let's talk about our card allowance off of 3 different things: what the loan balance is at the end of the period; what our charge-off forecast would be over the next 12 months; and then their qualitative factors, which really cover the risk that are not captured by models. So if you're really trying to model the allowance in future quarters, you're going to need to make assumptions on all of those, a growth rate and the assumption for loans. And remember, if you're not doing a year-over-year growth rate, you've got to think about the seasonality because they can run off in different ways. Next, you also would need to -- however -- whenever you want to forecast that for the balances, look at what charge-offs are over the next 4 quarters after that. And then with regards to our qualitative factors, they've been about 10% to 15% in benign periods, but they can vary pretty significantly if you're entering or exiting a credit cycle. So I'm trying to give you a little bit of a picture of why small movements and assumptions can create swings in a quarter, which end up being meaningful. And the most impactful of the 3 assumptions is really the net charge-off rate. And just looking at this on a static basis with our current loan balances of $74 billion, a 15-basis point change in loss rate in the quarter, all other things being equal, will drive $100 million change in allowance. As Rich talked about in the first quarter, we experienced better-than-expected delinquencies in flow rates. So the starting point for our next 12 months loss forecast had shifted down. And as a result, we had allowance releases. Had that not happened, growth would have actually probably driven allowance builds. So going forward, it's a combination of growth and our expectations for loss, that suggest that we're going to need allowance builds. But it's really hard to go a lot further than that, given all of the factors that I've been through. So hopefully, that helps, Ryan, in the way you think about constructing what could happen to allowance."

It's interesting that -- you may remember last year, we flagged at this time, kind of a similar phenomena that we saw this year, that better-than-expected flow rates. And then just seeing those flow rates kind of mechanically, we put a -- given the 6-month window that we have, that we can watch delinquencies flow into charge-offs. You can see that we've adjusted our projections for that 6-month window. You may remember last year that this phenomenon that we saw around this time last year. In the latter part of the year, we said we saw most of it dissipate. So we are not assuming that this changes the outlook for the end of the year or beyond. And if that changes, obviously, we would -- if this phenomenon sustains itself, obviously, we would do adjust that. So we are here today with the same kind of outlook that we had last time we were talking to you. And it is just very clear that the growth math, and you can see the pretty dramatic growth numbers that we have, the growth math just pretty much have to carry the day. And that's why we're looking to the fourth quarter as still the mid- to high 3% range. And then we are saying -- and then 2016 would be up from there. And we're saying up from there just again by the vintage math of growth. And all of this is in the context of a kind of unique time in the industry and for Capital One, where most of our customers that we have right now on our book, they weathered the Great Recession and are very low risk and I think exceptionally resilient. So it's pretty much anything we book moves the numbers up from here. We feel great about the credit quality of what we're booking, but the growth math is just very inexorable in that sense. Now you asked the question when will this level off? We are reluctant to be predicting something that's going to be -- have a lot of factors driving that when we get there. But I think our point is that 2016 will be a year of rising charge-offs off of the trajectory with which we leave 2015 just because, again, the accumulated math of the vintages of the new business that we're booking."

Bill, first of all, I want to say that most of you may be aware that in both the U.K. and in Canada, there have been regulatory-based moves to lower interchange. The -- neither of our businesses, they are particularly our U.K. business, are highly dependent on purchase volume for the economics of the business. So I don't think this will have a big impact on our particular overall economics, even though it's an important move in the marketplace. They -- already, a number of issuers have come out in response to the lower interchange rates in the U.K. and have notified their customers that future reward -- rewards will be at a lower rate. I think that's pretty natural in a tight-margin business, and the rewards business is a very tight-margin business with the interchange and the high payment of reward benefits. That's pretty natural market phenomenon, and we already see that going on in the U.K. Interestingly, there's been some pushback and noise on the consumer side, because consumers really do like their rewards. And I think we should all take note that even in a country where the rewards rates are lower, there is some pushback there. And I think it's a reminder that in the U.S., consumers who are enjoying higher rates of rewards are a pretty vocal force for the preservation of these benefits."

But if -- that's the sense I've gotten from your commentary. But there are others in the space who are expressing a bit more of an optimistic view on partnership businesses and kind of taking -- talking about how the thing that they're most focused on is how their merchant partners are looking for them to help them drive incremental sales growth and they talk about how their pipelines are very strong.

First of all, I think in many ways, it's all relative, and relative to what? So as one who built this company initially on a direct-to-consumer model, one customer at the time, you have seen the long history and current performance of that business. And it a little bit spoils me relative to pretty much everything else in the banking business and I kind of start for -- there for my calibration. And frankly, the big difference between, as you said, between the regular direct-to-consumer credit card business and the partnership business is the holding of auctions that happens, on average, every 5 years. And that tends to, all other things being equal, be quite a mitigator in terms of some of the upside potential. So that -- many of my comments have been just that calibration. The partnership business is a very interesting and intriguing one to me and for a lot of the reasons that you cited others are talking about. As you know, the retailing business, for example, is in massive strategic turmoil, and the impact of digital and the need for retailers to reinvent themselves is an extraordinary, in many ways, kind of existential kind of imperative. And I think that companies, like Capital One, that are doing very significant investments in digital and in mobile and in not just the customer experience associated with that, but all the underlying infrastructure that is behind what it takes to actually innovate in digital. Companies like ours, I think, are in a very good position to partner with retailers and help them strategically and actually in terms of real product innovation and execution in that transformation. So we are also investing in that opportunity, and we have partners that are -- with whom we're working right now on some pretty cool digital innovations and -- so look, that's one reason I like this space a lot. It's also such a natural sibling to our regular-branded business and -- but what we're doing is we're -- how do we deal with sort of this overhang of the auctions, we just make sure that we never say we have to win no matter what. We go out there, we're selective relative to making sure these are great companies we're working with, companies that are in the partnership business with us for the right reason. We're just really motivated to build a franchise and not just for the making of near-term money that sometimes comes at the sacrifice of customer practices. And finally, selectively, where the -- ultimately, the price of the deal is something where both parties can win."

But that's really a small effect. I mean, mostly, what we're -- essentially, what we're talking about here is something that we've seen on -- not infrequently over the -- for me, the 20-year history of being in this business is that from time to time, we notice that all our flow rates, our delinquency flow rates, move in a similar direction all at one time. And usually, when this happens, there's not necessarily an explanation for it. Often, we're able to go back later and tie it back to economic data that comes out later and so on. Now this is not a huge effect. I don't want to get carried away, I've seen much bigger effects in other times. But because we have actually gone out to give sort of quarterly guidance, all we're saying is coming in better than the quarterly guidance in the relatively near term, relative to when we did it, just relates to better-than-expected flow rates without having a perfect explanation. There's probably some general economic effect that is going on. But then our most important point is that we don't necessarily see any evidence that this should change our longer-term view about the trajectory and magnitude of the charge-off we're talking about."

And we just been around long enough to know the key thing is we very much have a culture around here. Nobody is -- people don't live with growth targets at Capital One. We forecast growth when we think it's going to come. But people all know that job one is to raise your hand and flag when you see opportunities, and the most important thing is, that we go after resilient business. We are flagging some of the -- yes, it's -- we've ticked up a little bit our commentary on this, although we have been talking for quite a while about it. We talked, in many ways, take in 2 different perspectives. Partly, what we've said over time is just understand coming off once-in-a-lifetime unique situation of incredibly tight credit and incredibly conservative borrowers. Some of the kind of loosening that's going out there would be in the category of normal reversion to the main. Some of the stuff that we're flagging here would, I think, be on the other side of that. So -- but on the other hand, this is not something where we're saying, oh my gosh, this is -- you're going to see us just pull out of this thing. We still believe there is selectively very good opportunity for Capital One to go get the assets that we want and build the -- continue to build and even expand the number of dealer relationships that we have. But we wanted to just put the Street on increasingly -- on noticing the sense for this, the -- that we're very carefully watching the practices, and we're going to make the choices that we make for resilience. And we hope that there really, in many ways, 2 offsetting forces with respect to growth. We're clearly losing deals, one customer at a time sometime -- sometimes, that we might have won in the past because others have moved farther in their underwriting. On the other hand, some of the innovations we have and the really sustained success in building deeper dealer relationships, moving up and through their prime relationships and expanding dealer relationships is a force in the opposite direction that still generates growth. So the net effect of those 2 things will drive our results. You can see that. In general, subprime is where we have -- you don't see that much growth going on anymore, and most of it really has been in prime lately."

They -- well, the only seasoning that one would have on existing accounts. Well -- first of all, existing accounts always -- the outstanding's ebb and flow with people's spending and borrowing and just general kind of ambient activity. The only big mover on the existing file would be line increases. And having been in sort of a brownout period for a couple of years with respect to line increases, as we said, getting back in the line increases led to, if you will, sort of a surge of catching up for a second. We're on the slightly higher side of equilibrium, probably at the moment, I would say there. The seasoning of those is the difference seasoning dynamic with respect to new business. The line increases tend to -- all the economics of line increases have upfront. It's sort of upfront, very good things, doesn't cost much to get them. The -- there's no kind of spike of diabolical behaviors or anything. So what you tend to have is -- and for a while, people use their line to pay any obligations and so on. So what you have there is more of a steady, delayed sort of rise in charge-offs over time with that vantage. That is an important, but minority part of the overall growth right now. It's an important minority, shall we say. The majority of the growth is coming from the origination side of the business or from recent originations and the very immediate sort of credit line moves we might make relative to those. But I put that all in the category of originations. The vintage dynamics for that are very different. First of all, all the economics, they're upfront. You take all, you're paying. You've got your high cost to originate. The big allowance builds, the -- there's even sort of the peak of charge-offs comes pretty early. And then it moderates over time, so that sort of all the good-news aspect of that thing happens over time. Our -- the majority of our growth is coming on the origination side, but there's a sizable minority that is on the line increase side. And that's approaching an equilibrium now, it's on the high side of the equilibrium."

Well, Moshe, you're talking about a sector that, as long as I've been around it, has been pretty intensely competitive. Now it tends to be lopsided relative to a lot of competition from a small number of players and sort of modest involvement from everybody in the business. This rewards space is, certainly, is still very competitive. And the recent manifestation of extra competition there has been early spend bonuses have continued to rise. That's probably the most noteworthy thing. I think others, in general, have come out with products that are a little better than what they have for the existing books. So there's a little movement on product value and continued competition on early spend bonuses. So we have our eye on that. And of course, the other place for the competition, of course, is just in the amount of marketing. And people are stepping up the amount of marketing as well. So overall, I would say there has been modest, pretty, pretty modest -- now that, in the overall scheme of things, could sort of increase in the intensity of competition there. Now you talk about -- so in the context of all of that, as rates go up at some point, I think a sizable increase in interest rates will probably have a fair amount of impact on that. I wouldn't expect modest interest rate changes to impact that too much. But I know, Steve, you've spent a lot of time thinking about this, what were you going to say?"

So Bob, the -- let me talk about the -- how outstanding this growth to start with. That is being driven by -- somewhat by line increases and also by the success of origination programs on sort of across the various parts of -- across all of the parts of the business that we're investing in. So the line increases, I guess my description was we're on the higher side of equilibrium. But it's -- they're sort of approaching an equilibrium level, but we're probably on the bid on higher side of equilibrium there. The -- on the spend side, that is -- it -- that's driven by -- I mean, you were kind of right where you're going. In a sense, the spend is -- yes. Partly, the success we have in the rewards programs we have, it's also people filling up their lines in a sense, either coming from line increases or a lot of new originations where people are starting to ramp up their spending there. So there's a number of things that have come together to make really quite extraordinary spend growth. And all of that, I think, is reflective of -- if I kind of pull way up and just talk about our growth here for a second. The growth that you see here -- and Bob, you've known Capital One for a long, long time. Our strong growth is really driven by the investments we've made in the last few years and the current market dynamics that represent a window of opportunity. And we're continuing to invest to try to sustain this trajectory. And I've just been around long enough to know that life's about windows of opportunity. And the way Capital One works is when we see windows, we really do kind of go for it. We also, interestingly, if there's a reverse window, if you will, when we think market dynamics get in a kind of negative sense, we, a lot of times, exceed the market in the other direction, sometimes in pulling back. But this is one of those things where a number of things have come together and the byproduct of a lot of investment and opportunities, some digital innovation that going on and we're -- we'll capitalize on it as long as it lasts. We're reluctant to give a growth outlook because almost by definition, when you're growing at some of the kind of rates you've seen here, it's just hard to predict where things go from here. But we certainly are continuing to invest, and that's reflective in some of our comments about on the cost side."

We've done a number of acquisitions, like Adaptive Path, Level Money and things like that. We've done a number of -- a very large number of recruiting successes and including some pretty high-profile folks that we've brought in. One thing is absolutely clear and it's, and we believe this from the beginning, that every bank is going to need to transform itself. I mean the digital revolution is changing banking on just about every dimension that you can imagine, basically. It's changing what it takes to win in payments, in distribution, in marketing, in brand, foundational infrastructure, experience, design, if you will, the way information is used. And in the end, that really means that the role of talent is central to that kind of transformation. And so in the talent marketplace, in the partnership marketplace, I think these folks -- you can't just go out there with a checkbook and say, ""Here we are, we're here to bring you into the fold."" I think these folks look to see, and they come in and kick the tires to say, ""Is this a company that's bolting digital on to the side of a traditional bank? Or is this the company that is really, like in our case, really trying to build a really leading information-based technology company, in a sense?"" And the key manifestations of that are inside the company: are the leaders committed, are they digitally fluent, have they digitally reimagined their business, are they bringing technology talent not just into some like place in IT in a sense, but is it really being brought right into the heart of the business and become sort of who you are? So you -- when you've heard me talk a lot about digital, it's just that this reminds me a lot of 20 years ago sort of building an information-based company. I'm incredibly excited and sobered by the -- what it takes to actually really build an information-based technology company and I really like our chances. And along the way, as we go on that journey, the more success we have there will correlate also with a lot of people from the outside, saying, ""That is the kind of company that I think speaks our language and is one of us.""

It is ironic that the banking system is from stem to stern built on a batch basis. So you pretty much look at anything. I mean from the old direct mail stuff that Capital One and so many of us have done over the years, the whole way clearing works. And so -- and really, while there are many, many aspects to the batch nature of this thing, right at the center is this irony that in a world that increasingly is going toward pure electronic payments, there's a massive kind of, yes, lag, in the end, to make those things fully happen. Most banks, pretty much all of us banks have built middleware layer to, in a sense, simulate realtime, even in the context of a reality that very much batch based. I'm not sure that realtime payments will actually transform banking as much as a lot of people think it will. But the reality of when the world moves, if we pull up from realtime payments and clearing technically to the larger point of the world moving to such immediate interactivity and such a mobile world, the really dramatic transformation that's going to happen to banking is it's going to become realtime, far beyond kind of realtime payments. And I think that -- I think banks are so, in a way, ill-suited to drive to that destination. Yet the world will drive us banks there. I think that you kind of put your finger on something even -- from a broader point of view, that I think it's the heart of the whole reinvention of banking that is coming. It's just that for banks to get there, the banking system and for banks individually, there's a lot that, that entails.

For the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2 per share and had an average return on tangible common equity of 15%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.97 per share.Net income was up $154 million, driven by higher",396,"Thanks, Jeff. For the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2 per share and had an average return on tangible common equity of 15%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.97 per share.
Net income was up $154 million, driven by higher pre-provision earnings and lower provision expense versus the prior quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased by $69 million versus the prior quarter as lower revenue was more than offset by lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses decreased on a linked-quarter basis, driven by a smaller allowance build and lower charge-offs versus the previous quarter.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll briefly touch on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 24 basis points in the first quarter to 6.57%. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by 2 fewer days to recognize income and temporarily higher cash balances. We don't expect any incremental margin pressure to meet the LCR since we are already above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of March 31, 2015.
Turning to Slide 5, let me cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.5% as of March 31. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this ratio would be approximately 12.1%. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5.4 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions that began last April. Over the past year, we have reduced shares outstanding by $24.9 million or 4%.
We entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target. We were pleased with our 2015 CCAR results and believe they continue to demonstrate our strong commitment to return capital to shareholders.
Our approved submission include a planned increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per share. In addition, our plan authorizes the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016.
Our long-stated preference for the focus of capital return continues to be in the form of share repurchases. And while investors can expect an ongoing ability to generate strong returns and a commitment to return excess capital subject to regulatory approval, investors should not infer a long-term commitment from our recent payout ratios.
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."
336241,288884100,793893,"Capital One Financial Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Capital One Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve.And I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year, and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see good opportunities",1401,"Thanks, Steve.
And I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year, and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see good opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 19% year-over-year. This growth was driven by the success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations across our card business and credit line increases.
Compared to the first quarter of 2014, revenues were up 7%, in line with average loan growth as revenue margin was stable. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue margin decreased seasonally to 16.9%. Year-over-year, noninterest expenses increased 2%, driven by a higher marketing consistent with our return to loan growth. As expected, noninterest expenses decreased about 6% from the linked quarter with seasonal declines in marketing.
Credit in the first quarter was stronger than expected. We experienced better-than-forecasted delinquency flow rates. The charge-off rate increased 16 basis points to 3.55%. The delinquency rate improved 35 basis points to 2.92%. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through to charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rates in the lower end of our previously communicated mid- to high 3% range, perhaps even getting into the low 3% range at the third quarter seasonal low point. The improvement in our outlook for Domestic Card credit drove a modest allowance release in the quarter. We also expect favorable credit to drive lower-than-expected past due fees, putting modest pressure on revenue.
Longer-term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate is modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. We still expect the growth math to drive quarter charge-off rate to be in the mid- to high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016.
In addition, while this quarter shows that we may not have allowance builds every quarter, we expect growth to drive allowance additions going forward. Our card business remains well-positioned to deliver growth with attractive and resilient returns.
Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were up about 1% from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 10% year-over-year, driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers.
Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continues to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto.
Provision for credit losses grew $66 million to $207 million, driven by a change in allowance. In the first quarter of last year, we had a modest allowance release. In the first quarter of this year, growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit drove an allowance build.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2015. 
In our auto business, we've been experiencing normalization of both credit and returns from once-in-a-lifetime levels coming out of the Great Recession. Credit performance is gradually worsening in the industry, and we see slightly higher losses on newer originations. We've been cautious on industry underwriting and competitive practices for some time. As a result, our subprime originations have been essentially flat for nearly 2 years.
In the first quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. And used vehicle values remain at historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results, but we assume lower prices in our underwriting so we remain comfortable with the resilience of the business.
Despite our heightened caution, we will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased about 10% year-over-year, with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I and CRE. As we've been signaling, our year-over-year growth is slowing compared to prior years in response to market conditions. Loan balances declined modestly from the linked quarter as we've seen some slippage in industry underwriting standards in pockets of the market.
Revenues increased 13% from the prior year, driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multifamily originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields, which declined 25 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition.
Noninterest expenses were up 7% from the prior year, as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $28 million in the quarter to $60 million. The provision in the quarter was primarily driven by an allowance build for our $3.6 billion of loans to the oil and gas industry, driven by the impact of lower oil prices.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. 96% of our loans are secured, and 73% are shared national credit. Our largest exposure is in exploration and production, in which we benefit from holding loans at the top of the capital structure and discount in collateral values. Many of our borrowers are at least partially hedged against falling oil and gas prices. Our second largest exposure is in oilfield services, in which our customers face greater downstream challenges as E&P companies cut back in response to lower asset prices. We're working through these issues on a customer-by-customer basis.
We are also a lender in the Taxi Medallion Finance industry, with a small portfolio of less than $1 billion in loans. Medallion values have softened because of increased competition from new entrants, like Uber. We continue to closely watch this sector.
Overall, commercial charge-offs, nonperforming loans and criticized loans remain strong. While we continue to closely manage credit risk, we don't expect these levels to be sustainable through the cycle.
Our Commercial Banking business remains well-positioned to navigate a challenging environment, in which intense competition continues to put pressure on growth, margin and returns.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. Capital One posted strong results in the first quarter. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today, and we expect that will continue. For the full year 2015, we expect growth in revenues, driven by growth in average loans. As you can see in our Domestic Card business, we are experiencing very strong growth. And in this window, we are likely to increase marketing to take advantage of the opportunities we see to help sustain the current trajectory. While growth opportunities would drive long-term value creation, the higher marketing and the higher operating expense of additional volumes will pressure -- will put pressure on efficiency ratio.
As a result, we are likely to be in the higher end or possibly modestly above the 53.5% to 54.5% efficiency ratio range, excluding nonrecurring items. We're managing cost very tightly across our businesses to stay within the range, but we will also strive to make the right business choices to drive long-term value as growth opportunities unfold through the year.
Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not changed, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline and underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly, while we invest to grow, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry-regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.
And now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?"

So you have one piece of that already in the charge-off guidance. But that charge-off guidance, in and of itself, is also a contributor to what's likely to happen to allowances. So let me back up for a second, because I know this is a continuing question, and just give -- try and give a little bit more help. At the highest level, we build our card allowance and -- actually, it's not too different anywhere, but let's talk about our card allowance off of 3 different things: what the loan balance is at the end of the period; what our charge-off forecast would be over the next 12 months; and then there are qualitative factors, which really cover the risk that are not captured by models. So if you're really trying to model the allowance in future quarters, you're going to need to make assumptions on all of those, a growth rate and the assumption for loans. And remember, if you're not doing a year-over-year growth rate, you've got to think about the seasonality because they can run off in different ways. Next, you also would need to -- however -- whenever you want to forecast that for the balances, look at what charge-offs are over the next 4 quarters after that. And then with regards to our qualitative factors, they've been about 10% to 15% in benign periods, but they can vary pretty significantly if you're entering or exiting a credit cycle. So I'm trying to give you a little bit of a picture of why small movements and assumptions can create swings in a quarter, which end up being meaningful. And the most impactful of the 3 assumptions is really the net charge-off rate. And just looking at this on a static basis with our current loan balances of $74 billion, a 15-basis point change in loss rate in the quarter, all other things being equal, will drive $100 million change in allowance. As Rich talked about in the first quarter, we experienced better-than-expected delinquencies in flow rates. So the starting point for our next 12 months loss forecast had shifted down. And as a result, we had allowance releases. Had that not happened, growth would have actually probably driven allowance builds. So going forward, it's a combination of growth and our expectations for loss, that suggest that we're going to need allowance builds. But it's really hard to go a lot further than that, given all of the factors that I've been through. So hopefully, that helps, Ryan, in the way you think about constructing what could happen to allowance."

It's interesting that -- you may remember last year, we flagged at this time, kind of a similar phenomena that we saw this year, that better-than-expected flow rates. And then just seeing those flow rates kind of mechanically, we put a -- given the 6-month window that we have, that we can watch delinquencies flow into charge-offs. You can see that we've adjusted our projections for that 6-month window. You may remember last year that this phenomenon that we saw around this time last year. In the latter part of the year, we said we saw most of it dissipate. So we are not assuming that this changes the outlook for the end of the year or beyond. And if that changes, obviously, we would -- if this phenomenon sustains itself, obviously, we would do adjust that. So we are here today with the same kind of outlook that we had last time we were talking to you. And it is just very clear that the growth math, and you can see the pretty dramatic growth numbers that we have, the growth math just pretty much has to carry the day. And that's why we're looking to the fourth quarter as still the mid- to high 3% range. And then we are saying -- and then 2016 would be up from there. And we're saying up from there just again by the vintage math of growth. And all of this is in the context of a kind of unique time in the industry and for Capital One, where most of our customers that we have right now on our book, they weathered the Great Recession and are very low risk and I think exceptionally resilient. So it's pretty much anything we book moves the numbers up from here. We feel great about the credit quality of what we're booking, but the growth math is just very inexorable in that sense. Now you asked the question when will this level off? We are reluctant to be predicting something that's going to be -- have a lot of factors driving that when we get there. But I think our point is that 2016 will be a year of rising charge-offs off of the trajectory with which we leave 2015 just because, again, the accumulated math of the vintages of the new business that we're booking."

The -- neither of our businesses, they are particularly our U.K. business, are highly dependent on purchase volume for the economics of the business. So I don't think this will have a big impact on our particular overall economics, even though it's an important move in the marketplace. They -- already, a number of issuers have come out in response to the lower interchange rates in the U.K. and have notified their customers that future reward -- rewards will be at a lower rate. I think that's pretty natural in a tight-margin business, and the rewards business is a very tight-margin business with the interchange and the high payment of reward benefits. That's pretty natural market phenomenon, and we already see that going on in the U.K. Interestingly, there's been some pushback and noise on the consumer side, because consumers really do like their rewards. And I think we should all take note that even in a country where the rewards rates are lower, there is some pushback there. And I think it's a reminder that in the U.S., consumers who are enjoying higher rates of rewards are a pretty vocal force for the preservation of these benefits."

The view, I believe, I've heard you express in the past is that you like the partnership business, but that your optimism is somewhat tempered by the fact that contracts come up for renewal every 5 years or so and the potential exists for outsized profits to get competed away in that process, and I'm paraphrasing. But if -- that's the sense I've gotten from your commentary. But there are others in the space who are expressing a bit more of an optimistic view on partnership businesses and kind of taking -- talking about how the thing that they're most focused on is how their merchant partners are looking for them to help them drive incremental sales growth and they talk about how their pipelines are very strong. And so I guess the question then is what do you think is driving these differences and views that some folks and partnership -- in the partnership business are a little bit more optimistic in their outlook? And that's it."

First of all, I think in many ways, it's all relative, and relative to what? So as one who built this company initially on a direct-to-consumer model, one customer at the time, you have seen the long history and current performance of that business. And it a little bit spoils me relative to pretty much everything else in the banking business and I kind of start for -- there for my calibration. And frankly, the big difference between, as you said, between the regular direct-to-consumer credit card business and the partnership business is the holding of auctions that happens, on average, every 5 years. And that tends to, all other things being equal, be quite a mitigator in terms of some of the upside potential. So that -- many of my comments have been just that calibration. The partnership business is a very interesting and intriguing one to me and for a lot of the reasons that you cited others are talking about. As you know, the retailing business, for example, is in massive strategic turmoil, and the impact of digital and the need for retailers to reinvent themselves is an extraordinary, in many ways, kind of existential kind of imperative. And I think that companies, like Capital One, that are doing very significant investments in digital and in mobile and in not just the customer experience associated with that, but all the underlying infrastructure that is behind what it takes to actually innovate in digital. Companies like ours, I think, are in a very good position to partner with retailers and help them strategically and actually in terms of real product innovation and execution in that transformation. So we are also investing in that opportunity, and we have partners that are -- with whom we're working right now on some pretty cool digital innovations and -- so look, that's one reason I like this space a lot. It's also such a natural sibling to our regular-branded business and -- but what we're doing is we're -- how do we deal with sort of this overhang of the auctions, we just make sure that we never say we have to win no matter what. We go out there, we're selective relative to making sure these are great companies we're working with, companies that are in the partnership business with us for the right reason. Where it's really motivated to build a franchise and not just for the making of near-term money that sometimes comes at the sacrifice of customer practices. And finally, selectively, where the -- ultimately, the price of the deal is something where both parties can win."

But that's really a small effect. I mean, mostly, what we're -- essentially, what we're talking about here is something that we've seen on -- not infrequently over the -- for me, the 20-year history of being in this business is that from time to time, we notice that all our flow rates, our delinquency flow rates, move in a similar direction all at one time. And usually, when this happens, there's not necessarily an explanation for it. Often, we're able to go back later and tie it back to economic data that comes out later and so on. Now this is not a huge effect. I don't want to get carried away, I've seen much bigger effects in other times. But because we have actually gone out to give sort of quarterly guidance, all we're saying is coming in better than the quarterly guidance in the relatively near term, relative to when we did it, just relates to better-than-expected flow rates without having a perfect explanation. There's probably some general economic effect that is going on. But then our most important point is that we don't necessarily see any evidence that this should change our longer-term view about the trajectory and magnitude of the charge-off we're talking about."

So it's not like, well, there's a practice, we don't use that one, or when do we require this kind of collateral or this kind of information for a particular loan. It is the intersection of the particular practices as it relates to a particular customer and the credit risk of that customer, that has moved for some players. And that this is -- it is not a universal thing. There -- some players have been more aggressive than others. And we just been around long enough to know the key thing is we very much have a culture around here. Nobody is -- people don't live with growth targets at Capital One. We forecast growth when we think it's going to come. But people all know that job one is to raise your hand and flag when you see opportunities, and the most important thing is, that we go after resilient business. We are flagging some of the -- yes, it's -- we've ticked up a little bit our commentary on this, although we have been talking for quite a while about it. We talked, in many ways, taken 2 different perspectives. Partly, what we've said over time is just understand coming off once-in-a-lifetime unique situation of incredibly tight credit and incredibly conservative borrowers. Some of the kind of loosening that's going out there would be in the category of normal reversion to the main. Some of the stuff that we're flagging here would, I think, be on the other side of that. So -- but on the other hand, this is not something where we're saying, oh my gosh, this is -- you're going to see us just pull out of this thing. We still believe there is selectively very good opportunity for Capital One to go get the assets that we want and build the -- continue to build and even expand the number of dealer relationships that we have. But we wanted to just put the Street on increasingly -- on notice in the sense for this, the -- that we're very carefully watching the practices, and we're going to make the choices that we make for resilience. And we hope that there really, in many ways, 2 offsetting forces with respect to growth. We're clearly losing deals, one customer at a time sometime -- sometimes, that we might have won in the past because others have moved farther in their underwriting. On the other hand, some of the innovations we have and the really sustained success in building deeper dealer relationships, moving up and through their prime relationships and expanding dealer relationships is a force in the opposite direction that still generates growth. So the net effect of those 2 things will drive our results. You can see that. In general, subprime is where we have -- you don't see that much growth going on anymore, and most of it really has been in prime lately."

They -- well, the only seasoning that one would have on existing accounts. Well -- first of all, existing accounts always -- the outstanding's ebb and flow with people's spending and borrowing and just general kind of ambient activity. The only big mover on the existing file would be line increases. And having been in sort of a brownout period for a couple of years with respect to line increases, as we said, getting back in the line increases led to, if you will, sort of a surge of catching up for a second. We're on the slightly higher side of equilibrium, probably at the moment, I would say there. The seasoning of those is the difference seasoning dynamic with respect to new business. The line increases tend to -- all the economics of line increases have upfront. It's sort of upfront, very good things, doesn't cost much to get them. The -- there's no kind of spike of diabolical behaviors or anything. So what you tend to have is -- and for a while, people use their line to pay any obligations and so on. So what you have there is more of a steady, delayed sort of rise in charge-offs over time with that vantage. That is an important, but minority part of the overall growth right now. It's an important minority, shall we say. The majority of the growth is coming from the origination side of the business or from recent originations and the very immediate sort of credit line moves we might make relative to those. But I put that all in the category of originations. The vintage dynamics for that are very different. First of all, all the economics, they're upfront. You take all, you're paying. You've got your high cost to originate. The big allowance builds, the -- there's even sort of the peak of charge-offs comes pretty early. And then it moderates over time, so that sort of all the good-news aspect of that thing happens over time. Our -- the majority of our growth is coming on the origination side, but there's a sizable minority that is on the line increase side. And that's approaching an equilibrium now, it's on the high side of the equilibrium."

Well, Moshe, you're talking about a sector that, as long as I've been around it, has been pretty intensely competitive. Now it tends to be lopsided relative to a lot of competition from a small number of players and sort of modest involvement from everybody in the business. This rewards space is, certainly, is still very competitive. And the recent manifestation of extra competition there has been early spend bonuses have continued to rise. That's probably the most noteworthy thing. I think others, in general, have come out with products that are a little better than what they have for the existing books. So there's a little movement on product value and continued competition on early spend bonuses. So we have our eye on that. And of course, the other place for the competition, of course, is just in the amount of marketing. And people are stepping up the amount of marketing as well. So overall, I would say there has been modest, pretty, pretty modest -- now that, in the overall scheme of things, could sort of increase in the intensity of competition there. Now you talk about -- so in the context of all of that, as rates go up at some point, I think a sizable increase in interest rates will probably have a fair amount of impact on that.

You've had very strong growth, accelerating growth, as you said, helped by credit line increases as well as the -- your branded product. Are we done with the credit line increases? Is -- are we going to continue to see an acceleration in that business? And -- I mean your spend of growth in the U.S. is pretty amazing compared to the industry, and I guess that's credit line-driven as well. So outlook for growth and are we -- the -- which products and are you near the end of the credit line increases?"

So Bob, the -- let me talk about the -- how outstanding this growth to start with. That is being driven by -- somewhat by line increases and also by the success of origination programs on sort of across the various parts of -- across all of the parts",441,"Yes. So Bob, the -- let me talk about the -- how outstanding this growth to start with. That is being driven by -- somewhat by line increases and also by the success of origination programs on sort of across the various parts of -- across all of the parts of the business that we're investing in. So the line increases, I guess my description was we're on the higher side of equilibrium. But it's -- they're sort of approaching an equilibrium level, but we're probably on the bit on the higher side of equilibrium there. The -- on the spend side, that is -- it -- that's driven by -- I mean, you were kind of right where you're going. In a sense, the spend is -- yes. Partly, the success we have in the rewards programs we have, it's also people filling up their lines in a sense, either coming from line increases or a lot of new originations where people are starting to ramp up their spending there. So there's a number of things that have come together to make really quite extraordinary spend growth. And all of that, I think, is reflective of -- if I kind of pull way up and just talk about our growth here for a second. The growth that you see here -- and Bob, you've known Capital One for a long, long time. Our strong growth is really driven by the investments we've made in the last few years and the current market dynamics that represent a window of opportunity. And we're continuing to invest to try to sustain this trajectory. And I've just been around long enough to know that life's about windows of opportunity. And the way Capital One works is when we see windows, we really do kind of go for it. We also, interestingly, if there's a reverse window, if you will, when we think market dynamics get in a kind of negative sense, we, a lot of times, exceed the market in the other direction, sometimes in pulling back. But this is one of those things where a number of things have come together and the byproduct of a lot of investment and opportunities, some digital innovation that's going on and we're -- we'll capitalize on it as long as it lasts. We're reluctant to give a growth outlook because almost by definition, when you're growing at some of the kind of rates you've seen here, it's just hard to predict where things go from here. But we certainly are continuing to invest, and that's reflective in some of our comments about on the cost side."

And I mean every year, including, even the -- the other day, I was giving a presentation to our associates and just listing, within the last 12 years, a big long kind of list of things that have sort of raised the bar in the past year. But the approach that we're taking is to say let's try to seize this opportunity. Seize the regulatory moment, not just to fill out a checklist and get our -- all of our to-do requirements done, but to work backwards from what it takes to build a really dynamic, well-controlled company in the modern kind of era, if you will. And work backwards from that and make sure that what we're putting in is consistent with a dynamic company that can innovate and do a lot of things, and also embrace the spirit behind so many of the regulatory requirements.

So well, Betsy, first of all, we -- with respect to external digital parties, there's a lot of manifestations of Capital One's commitment to digital. We've done a number of partnerships. We've done a number of acquisitions, like Adaptive Path, Level Money and things like that. We've done a number of -- a very large number of recruiting successes and including some pretty high-profile folks that we've brought in. One thing is absolutely clear and it's, and we believe this from the beginning, that every bank is going to need to transform itself. I mean the digital revolution is changing banking on just about every dimension that you can imagine, basically. It's changing what it takes to win in payments, in distribution, in marketing, in brand, foundational infrastructure, experience, design, if you will, the way information is used. And in the end, that really means that the role of talent is central to that kind of transformation. And so in the talent marketplace, in the partnership marketplace, I think these folks -- you can't just go out there with a checkbook and say, ""Here we are, we're here to bring you into the fold."" I think these folks look to see, and they come in and kick the tires to say, ""Is this a company that's bolting digital on to the side of a traditional bank? Or is this the company that is really, like in our case, really trying to build a really leading information-based technology company, in a sense?"" And the key manifestations of that are inside the company: are the leaders committed, are they digitally fluent, have they digitally reimagined their business, are they bringing technology talent not just into some like place in IT in a sense, but is it really being brought right into the heart of the business and become sort of who you are? So you -- when you've heard me talk a lot about digital, it's just that this reminds me a lot of 20 years ago sort of building an information-based company. I'm incredibly excited and sobered by the -- what it takes to actually really build an information-based technology company and I really like our chances. And along the way, as we go on that journey, the more success we have there will correlate also with a lot of people from the outside, saying, ""That is the kind of company that I think speaks our language and is one of us."" And you'll see more of the kind of partnerships and successes that you alluded to."

It is ironic that the banking system is from stem to stern built on a batch basis. So you pretty much look at anything. I mean from the old direct mail stuff that Capital One and so many of us have done over the years, the whole way clearing works. And so -- and really, while there are many, many aspects to the batch nature of this thing, right at the center is this irony that in a world that increasingly is going toward pure electronic payments, there's a massive kind of, yes, lag, in the end, to make those things fully happen. Most banks, pretty much all of us banks have built middleware layer to, in a sense, simulate realtime, even in the context of a reality that very much batch based. I'm not sure that realtime payments will actually transform banking as much as a lot of people think it will. But the reality of when the world moves, if we pull up from realtime payments and clearing technically to the larger point of the world moving to such immediate interactivity and such a mobile world, the really dramatic transformation that's going to happen to banking is it's going to become realtime, far beyond kind of realtime payments. And I think that -- I think banks are so, in a way, ill-suited to drive to that destination. Yet the world will drive us banks there. I think that you kind of put your finger on something even -- from a broader point of view, that I think it's the heart of the whole reinvention of banking that is coming. It's just that for banks to get there, the banking system and for banks individually, there's a lot that, that entails.

For the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2 per share and had an average return on tangible common equity of 15%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.97 per share.Net income was up $154 million, driven by higher",396,"Thanks, Jeff. For the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2 per share and had an average return on tangible common equity of 15%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.97 per share.
Net income was up $154 million, driven by higher pre-provision earnings and lower provision expense versus the prior quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased by $69 million versus the prior quarter as lower revenue was more than offset by lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses decreased on a linked-quarter basis, driven by a smaller allowance build and lower charge-offs versus the previous quarter.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll briefly touch on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 24 basis points in the first quarter to 6.57%. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by 2 fewer days to recognize income and temporarily higher cash balances. We don't expect any incremental margin pressure to meet the LCR since we are already above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of March 31, 2015.
Turning to Slide 5, let me cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.5% as of March 31. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this ratio would be approximately 12.1%. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5.4 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions that began last April. Over the past year, we have reduced shares outstanding by $24.9 million or 4%.
We entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target. We were pleased with our 2015 CCAR results and believe they continue to demonstrate our strong commitment to return capital to shareholders.
Our approved submission include a planned increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per share. In addition, our plan authorizes the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016.
Our long-stated preference for the focus of capital return continues to be in the form of share repurchases. And while investors can expect an ongoing ability to generate strong returns and a commitment to return excess capital subject to regulatory approval, investors should not infer a long-term commitment from our recent payout ratios.
With that, let me turn it over to Rich."

Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year, and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see good opportunities",1401,"Thanks, Steve.
And I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year, and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see good opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 19% year-over-year. This growth was driven by the success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations across our card business and credit line increases.
Compared to the first quarter of 2014, revenues were up 7%, in line with average loan growth as revenue margin was stable. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue margin decreased seasonally to 16.9%. Year-over-year, noninterest expenses increased 2%, driven by a higher marketing consistent with our return to loan growth. As expected, noninterest expenses decreased about 6% from the linked quarter with seasonal declines in marketing.
Credit in the first quarter was stronger than expected. We experienced better-than-forecasted delinquency flow rates. The charge-off rate increased 16 basis points to 3.55%. The delinquency rate improved 35 basis points to 2.92%. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through to charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rates in the lower end of our previously communicated mid- to high 3% range, perhaps even getting into the low 3% range at the third quarter seasonal low point. The improvement in our outlook for Domestic Card credit drove a modest allowance release in the quarter. We also expect favorable credit to drive lower-than-expected past due fees, putting modest pressure on revenue.
Longer-term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate is modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. We still expect the growth math to drive quarter charge-off rate to be in the mid- to high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016.
In addition, while this quarter shows that we may not have allowance builds every quarter, we expect growth to drive allowance additions going forward. Our card business remains well-positioned to deliver growth with attractive and resilient returns.
Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were up about 1% from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 10% year-over-year, driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers.
Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continues to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto.
Provision for credit losses grew $66 million to $207 million, driven by a change in allowance. In the first quarter of last year, we had a modest allowance release. In the first quarter of this year, growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit drove an allowance build.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2015. 
In our auto business, we've been experiencing normalization of both credit and returns from once-in-a-lifetime levels coming out of the Great Recession. Credit performance is gradually worsening in the industry, and we see slightly higher losses on newer originations. We've been cautious on industry underwriting and competitive practices for some time. As a result, our subprime originations have been essentially flat for nearly 2 years.
In the first quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. And used vehicle values remain at historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results, but we assume lower prices in our underwriting so we remain comfortable with the resilience of the business.
Despite our heightened caution, we will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased about 10% year-over-year, with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I and CRE. As we've been signaling, our year-over-year growth is slowing compared to prior years in response to market conditions. Loan balances declined modestly from the linked quarter as we've seen some slippage in industry underwriting standards in pockets of the market.
Revenues increased 13% from the prior year, driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multifamily originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields, which declined 25 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition.
Noninterest expenses were up 7% from the prior year, as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $28 million in the quarter to $60 million. The provision in the quarter was primarily driven by an allowance build for our $3.6 billion of loans to the oil and gas industry, driven by the impact of lower oil prices.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. 96% of our loans are secured, and 73% are shared national credit. Our largest exposure is in exploration and production, in which we benefit from holding loans at the top of the capital structure and discount in collateral values. Many of our borrowers are at least partially hedged against falling oil and gas prices. Our second largest exposure is in oilfield services, in which our customers face greater downstream challenges as E&P companies cut back in response to lower asset prices. We're working through these issues on a customer-by-customer basis.
We are also a lender in the Taxi Medallion Finance industry, with a small portfolio of less than $1 billion in loans. Medallion values have softened because of increased competition from new entrants, like Uber. We continue to closely watch this sector.
Overall, commercial charge-offs, nonperforming loans and criticized loans remain strong. While we continue to closely manage credit risk, we don't expect these levels to be sustainable through the cycle.
Our Commercial Banking business remains well-positioned to navigate a challenging environment, in which intense competition continues to put pressure on growth, margin and returns.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. Capital One posted strong results in the first quarter. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today, and we expect that will continue. For the full year 2015, we expect growth in revenues, driven by growth in average loans. As you can see in our Domestic Card business, we are experiencing very strong growth. And in this window, we are likely to increase marketing to take advantage of the opportunities we see to help sustain the current trajectory. While growth opportunities would drive long-term value creation, the higher marketing and the higher operating expense of additional volumes will pressure -- will put pressure on efficiency ratio.
As a result, we are likely to be in the higher end or possibly modestly above the 53.5% to 54.5% efficiency ratio range, excluding nonrecurring items. We're managing cost very tightly across our businesses to stay within the range, but we will also strive to make the right business choices to drive long-term value as growth opportunities unfold through the year.
Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not changed, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline and underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly, while we invest to grow, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry-regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.
And now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?"

So you have one piece of that already in the charge-off guidance. But that charge-off guidance, in and of itself, is also a contributor to what's likely to happen to allowances. So let me back up for a second, because I know this is a continuing question, and just give -- try and give a little bit more help. At the highest level, we build our card allowance and -- actually, it's not too different anywhere, but let's talk about our card allowance off of 3 different things: what the loan balance is at the end of the period; what our charge-off forecast would be over the next 12 months; and then there are qualitative factors, which really cover the risk that are not captured by models. So if you're really trying to model the allowance in future quarters, you're going to need to make assumptions on all of those, a growth rate and the assumption for loans. And remember, if you're not doing a year-over-year growth rate, you've got to think about the seasonality because they can run off in different ways. Next, you also would need to -- however -- whenever you want to forecast that for the balances, look at what charge-offs are over the next 4 quarters after that. And then with regards to our qualitative factors, they've been about 10% to 15% in benign periods, but they can vary pretty significantly if you're entering or exiting a credit cycle. So I'm trying to give you a little bit of a picture of why small movements and assumptions can create swings in a quarter, which end up being meaningful. And the most impactful of the 3 assumptions is really the net charge-off rate. And just looking at this on a static basis with our current loan balances of $74 billion, a 15-basis point change in loss rate in the quarter, all other things being equal, will drive $100 million change in allowance. As Rich talked about in the first quarter, we experienced better-than-expected delinquencies in flow rates. So the starting point for our next 12 months loss forecast had shifted down. And as a result, we had allowance releases. Had that not happened, growth would have actually probably driven allowance builds. So going forward, it's a combination of growth and our expectations for loss, that suggest that we're going to need allowance builds. But it's really hard to go a lot further than that, given all of the factors that I've been through. So hopefully, that helps, Ryan, in the way you think about constructing what could happen to allowance."

It's interesting that -- you may remember last year, we flagged at this time, kind of a similar phenomena that we saw this year, that better-than-expected flow rates. And then just seeing those flow rates kind of mechanically, we put a -- given the 6-month window that we have, that we can watch delinquencies flow into charge-offs. You can see that we've adjusted our projections for that 6-month window. You may remember last year that this phenomenon that we saw around this time last year. In the latter part of the year, we said we saw most of it dissipate. So we are not assuming that this changes the outlook for the end of the year or beyond. And if that changes, obviously, we would -- if this phenomenon sustains itself, obviously, we would do adjust that. So we are here today with the same kind of outlook that we had last time we were talking to you. And it is just very clear that the growth math, and you can see the pretty dramatic growth numbers that we have, the growth math just pretty much has to carry the day. And that's why we're looking to the fourth quarter as still the mid- to high 3% range. And then we are saying -- and then 2016 would be up from there. And we're saying up from there just again by the vintage math of growth. And all of this is in the context of a kind of unique time in the industry and for Capital One, where most of our customers that we have right now on our book, they weathered the Great Recession and are very low risk and I think exceptionally resilient. So it's pretty much anything we book moves the numbers up from here. We feel great about the credit quality of what we're booking, but the growth math is just very inexorable in that sense. Now you asked the question when will this level off? We are reluctant to be predicting something that's going to be -- have a lot of factors driving that when we get there. But I think our point is that 2016 will be a year of rising charge-offs off of the trajectory with which we leave 2015 just because, again, the accumulated math of the vintages of the new business that we're booking."

Bill, first of all, I want to say that most of you may be aware that in both the U.K. and in Canada, there have been regulatory-based moves to lower interchange. The -- neither of our businesses, they are particularly our U.K. business, are highly dependent on purchase volume for the economics of the business. So I don't think this will have a big impact on our particular overall economics, even though it's an important move in the marketplace. They -- already, a number of issuers have come out in response to the lower interchange rates in the U.K. and have notified their customers that future reward -- rewards will be at a lower rate. I think that's pretty natural in a tight-margin business, and the rewards business is a very tight-margin business with the interchange and the high payment of reward benefits. That's pretty natural market phenomenon, and we already see that going on in the U.K. Interestingly, there's been some pushback and noise on the consumer side, because consumers really do like their rewards. And I think we should all take note that even in a country where the rewards rates are lower, there is some pushback there. And I think it's a reminder that in the U.S., consumers who are enjoying higher rates of rewards are a pretty vocal force for the preservation of these benefits."

But if -- that's the sense I've gotten from your commentary. But there are others in the space who are expressing a bit more of an optimistic view on partnership businesses and kind of taking -- talking about how the thing that they're most focused on is how their merchant partners are looking for them to help them drive incremental sales growth and they talk about how their pipelines are very strong.

First of all, I think in many ways, it's all relative, and relative to what? So as one who built this company initially on a direct-to-consumer model, one customer at the time, you have seen the long history and current performance of that business. And it a little bit spoils me relative to pretty much everything else in the banking business and I kind of start for -- there for my calibration. And frankly, the big difference between, as you said, between the regular direct-to-consumer credit card business and the partnership business is the holding of auctions that happens, on average, every 5 years. And that tends to, all other things being equal, be quite a mitigator in terms of some of the upside potential. So that -- many of my comments have been just that calibration. The partnership business is a very interesting and intriguing one to me and for a lot of the reasons that you cited others are talking about. As you know, the retailing business, for example, is in massive strategic turmoil, and the impact of digital and the need for retailers to reinvent themselves is an extraordinary, in many ways, kind of existential kind of imperative. And I think that companies, like Capital One, that are doing very significant investments in digital and in mobile and in not just the customer experience associated with that, but all the underlying infrastructure that is behind what it takes to actually innovate in digital. Companies like ours, I think, are in a very good position to partner with retailers and help them strategically and actually in terms of real product innovation and execution in that transformation. So we are also investing in that opportunity, and we have partners that are -- with whom we're working right now on some pretty cool digital innovations and -- so look, that's one reason I like this space a lot. It's also such a natural sibling to our regular-branded business and -- but what we're doing is we're -- how do we deal with sort of this overhang of the auctions, we just make sure that we never say we have to win no matter what. We go out there, we're selective relative to making sure these are great companies we're working with, companies that are in the partnership business with us for the right reason. Where it's really motivated to build a franchise and not just for the making of near-term money that sometimes comes at the sacrifice of customer practices. And finally, selectively, where the -- ultimately, the price of the deal is something where both parties can win."

But that's really a small effect. I mean, mostly, what we're -- essentially, what we're talking about here is something that we've seen on -- not infrequently over the -- for me, the 20-year history of being in this business is that from time to time, we notice that all our flow rates, our delinquency flow rates, move in a similar direction all at one time. And usually, when this happens, there's not necessarily an explanation for it. Often, we're able to go back later and tie it back to economic data that comes out later and so on. Now this is not a huge effect. I don't want to get carried away, I've seen much bigger effects in other times. But because we have actually gone out to give sort of quarterly guidance, all we're saying is coming in better than the quarterly guidance in the relatively near term, relative to when we did it, just relates to better-than-expected flow rates without having a perfect explanation. There's probably some general economic effect that is going on. But then our most important point is that we don't necessarily see any evidence that this should change our longer-term view about the trajectory and magnitude of the charge-off we're talking about."

Partly, what we've said over time is just understand coming off once-in-a-lifetime unique situation of incredibly tight credit and incredibly conservative borrowers. Some of the kind of loosening that's going out there would be in the category of normal reversion to the main. Some of the stuff that we're flagging here would, I think, be on the other side of that. So -- but on the other hand, this is not something where we're saying, oh my gosh, this is -- you're going to see us just pull out of this thing. We still believe there is selectively very good opportunity for Capital One to go get the assets that we want and build the -- continue to build and even expand the number of dealer relationships that we have. But we wanted to just put the Street on increasingly -- on notice in the sense for this, the -- that we're very carefully watching the practices, and we're going to make the choices that we make for resilience. And we hope that there really, in many ways, 2 offsetting forces with respect to growth. We're clearly losing deals, one customer at a time sometime -- sometimes, that we might have won in the past because others have moved farther in their underwriting. On the other hand, some of the innovations we have and the really sustained success in building deeper dealer relationships, moving up and through their prime relationships and expanding dealer relationships is a force in the opposite direction that still generates growth. So the net effect of those 2 things will drive our results. You can see that. In general, subprime is where we have -- you don't see that much growth going on anymore, and most of it really has been in prime lately."

They -- well, the only seasoning that one would have on existing accounts. Well -- first of all, existing accounts always -- the outstanding's ebb and flow with people's spending and borrowing and just general kind of ambient activity. The only big mover on the existing file would be line increases. And having been in sort of a brownout period for a couple of years with respect to line increases, as we said, getting back in the line increases led to, if you will, sort of a surge of catching up for a second. We're on the slightly higher side of equilibrium, probably at the moment, I would say there. The seasoning of those is the difference seasoning dynamic with respect to new business. The line increases tend to -- all the economics of line increases have upfront. It's sort of upfront, very good things, doesn't cost much to get them. The -- there's no kind of spike of diabolical behaviors or anything. So what you tend to have is -- and for a while, people use their line to pay any obligations and so on. So what you have there is more of a steady, delayed sort of rise in charge-offs over time with that vantage. That is an important, but minority part of the overall growth right now. It's an important minority, shall we say. The majority of the growth is coming from the origination side of the business or from recent originations and the very immediate sort of credit line moves we might make relative to those. But I put that all in the category of originations. The vintage dynamics for that are very different. First of all, all the economics, they're upfront. You take all, you're paying. You've got your high cost to originate. The big allowance builds, the -- there's even sort of the peak of charge-offs comes pretty early. And then it moderates over time, so that sort of all the good-news aspect of that thing happens over time. Our -- the majority of our growth is coming on the origination side, but there's a sizable minority that is on the line increase side. And that's approaching an equilibrium now, it's on the high side of the equilibrium."

Well, Moshe, you're talking about a sector that, as long as I've been around it, has been pretty intensely competitive. Now it tends to be lopsided relative to a lot of competition from a small number of players and sort of modest involvement from everybody in the business. This rewards space is, certainly, is still very competitive. And the recent manifestation of extra competition there has been early spend bonuses have continued to rise. That's probably the most noteworthy thing. I think others, in general, have come out with products that are a little better than what they have for the existing books. So there's a little movement on product value and continued competition on early spend bonuses. So we have our eye on that. And of course, the other place for the competition, of course, is just in the amount of marketing. And people are stepping up the amount of marketing as well. So overall, I would say there has been modest, pretty, pretty modest -- now that, in the overall scheme of things, could sort of increase in the intensity of competition there. Now you talk about -- so in the context of all of that, as rates go up at some point, I think a sizable increase in interest rates will probably have a fair amount of impact on that. I wouldn't expect modest interest rate changes to impact that too much. But I know, Steve, you've spent a lot of time thinking about this, what were you going to say?"

So Bob, the -- let me talk about the -- how outstanding this growth to start with. That is being driven by -- somewhat by line increases and also by the success of origination programs on sort of across the various parts of -- across all of the parts of the business that we're investing in. So the line increases, I guess my description was we're on the higher side of equilibrium. But it's -- they're sort of approaching an equilibrium level, but we're probably on the bit on the higher side of equilibrium there. The -- on the spend side, that is -- it -- that's driven by -- I mean, you were kind of right where you're going. In a sense, the spend is -- yes. Partly, the success we have in the rewards programs we have, it's also people filling up their lines in a sense, either coming from line increases or a lot of new originations where people are starting to ramp up their spending there. So there's a number of things that have come together to make really quite extraordinary spend growth. And all of that, I think, is reflective of -- if I kind of pull way up and just talk about our growth here for a second. The growth that you see here -- and Bob, you've known Capital One for a long, long time. Our strong growth is really driven by the investments we've made in the last few years and the current market dynamics that represent a window of opportunity. And we're continuing to invest to try to sustain this trajectory. And I've just been around long enough to know that life's about windows of opportunity. And the way Capital One works is when we see windows, we really do kind of go for it. We also, interestingly, if there's a reverse window, if you will, when we think market dynamics get in a kind of negative sense, we, a lot of times, exceed the market in the other direction, sometimes in pulling back. But this is one of those things where a number of things have come together and the byproduct of a lot of investment and opportunities, some digital innovation that's going on and we're -- we'll capitalize on it as long as it lasts. We're reluctant to give a growth outlook because almost by definition, when you're growing at some of the kind of rates you've seen here, it's just hard to predict where things go from here. But we certainly are continuing to invest, and that's reflective in some of our comments about on the cost side."

But the approach that we're taking is to say let's try to seize this opportunity. Seize the regulatory moment, not just to fill out a checklist and get our -- all of our to-do requirements done, but to work backwards from what it takes to build a really dynamic, well-controlled company in the modern kind of era, if you will.

We've done a number of acquisitions, like Adaptive Path, Level Money and things like that. We've done a number of -- a very large number of recruiting successes and including some pretty high-profile folks that we've brought in. One thing is absolutely clear and it's, and we believe this from the beginning, that every bank is going to need to transform itself. I mean the digital revolution is changing banking on just about every dimension that you can imagine, basically. It's changing what it takes to win in payments, in distribution, in marketing, in brand, foundational infrastructure, experience, design, if you will, the way information is used. And in the end, that really means that the role of talent is central to that kind of transformation. And so in the talent marketplace, in the partnership marketplace, I think these folks -- you can't just go out there with a checkbook and say, ""Here we are, we're here to bring you into the fold."" I think these folks look to see, and they come in and kick the tires to say, ""Is this a company that's bolting digital on to the side of a traditional bank? Or is this the company that is really, like in our case, really trying to build a really leading information-based technology company, in a sense?"" And the key manifestations of that are inside the company: are the leaders committed, are they digitally fluent, have they digitally reimagined their business, are they bringing technology talent not just into some like place in IT in a sense, but is it really being brought right into the heart of the business and become sort of who you are? So you -- when you've heard me talk a lot about digital, it's just that this reminds me a lot of 20 years ago sort of building an information-based company. I'm incredibly excited and sobered by the -- what it takes to actually really build an information-based technology company and I really like our chances. And along the way, as we go on that journey, the more success we have there will correlate also with a lot of people from the outside, saying, ""That is the kind of company that I think speaks our language and is one of us.""

It is ironic that the banking system is from stem to stern built on a batch basis. So you pretty much look at anything. I mean from the old direct mail stuff that Capital One and so many of us have done over the years, the whole way clearing works. And so -- and really, while there are many, many aspects to the batch nature of this thing, right at the center is this irony that in a world that increasingly is going toward pure electronic payments, there's a massive kind of, yes, lag, in the end, to make those things fully happen. Most banks, pretty much all of us banks have built middleware layer to, in a sense, simulate real time, even in the context of a reality that very much batch based. I'm not sure that real-time payments will actually transform banking as much as a lot of people think it will. But the reality of when the world moves, if we pull up from real-time payments and clearing technically to the larger point of the world moving to such immediate interactivity and such a mobile world, the really dramatic transformation that's going to happen to banking is it's going to become real time, far beyond kind of real-time payments. And I think that -- I think banks are so, in a way, ill-suited to drive to that destination. Yet the world will drive us banks there. I think that you kind of put your finger on something even -- from a broader point of view, that I think it's the heart of the whole reinvention of banking that is coming. It's just that for banks to get there, the banking system and for banks individually, there's a lot that, that entails.

For the second quarter, Capital One earned $830 million or $1.50 per share, and had a return on average tangible common equity of 11%.

For the second quarter, Capital One earned $830 million or $1.50 per share, and had a return on average tangible common equity of 11%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.48 per share.
Net income was down $285 million, driven by lower linked-quarter reposition earnings and higher provision expense.
Preprovision earnings decreased by $233 million versus the prior quarter, and higher revenue was more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses.
Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as lower charge-offs were offset by a larger allowance build.
We had nonrecurring cost of $225 million in the quarter. We have included an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website, illustrating the impacts from these items, the key line items and ratios in the quarter.
Nonrecurring charges include: restructuring expense of $147 million related to the realignment of our workforce that we recently announced internally. We expect the modest amount of incremental nonrecurring charges later this year from site closures related to this activity.
We also added $78 million to our U.K. PPI reserve of which $37 million was captured as a contrarevenue line item and $41 million was captured in noninterest expense.
The increase in our U.K. PPI reserve is driven by complaint volumes declining more slowly than we have previously estimated. The refund of PPI fee as an interest is an industrywide issue, and there continues to be uncertainty as to how these exposures will play out. Estimating future complaint levels is difficult and there is the potential that more complaints will be filed in the future than we are currently estimating.
As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve.
Excluding the impact from the restructuring charges and the building U.K. PPA reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $1.78, and our efficiency ratio was 54.6%.
Turning to another legal matter. In the quarter, we recorded a $36 million benefit from reducing our reserve for representation and warranty claims. This reduction was driven by our recent High Court ruling in New York regarding the application of statute of limitations mutations. We also expect that the ruling will result in a decrease to our reasonably possible warranty exposure by approximately $500 million from the level reported in March of 2015. But that calculation will not be finalized until the 10-Q is filed next month.
As outlined on the slide 4, reported NIM decreased 1 basis point in the second quarter to 6.56% as lower investment securities and loan yields were partially offset by lower cash balances and additional day to recognize revenue in the second quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of June 30, 2015.
On Slide 5, you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this ratio would be approximately at least 11.8%.
We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions.
We entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target.
Let me now turn the call over to Rich."

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter. Ending loans were up 11% year-over-year and average loans grew 9%. We continue to see attractive opportunities in the parts of the market we",1705,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter. Ending loans were up 11% year-over-year and average loans grew 9%. We continue to see attractive opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue grew 20% year-over-year. The success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations and credit line increases continue to drive purchase volume growth.
Revenue increased 8% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue margin decreased 12 basis points, driven by the change in our finance charge and fee reserve, which swung from a modest credit-driven release in the first quarter to a modest growth-related build in the second quarter. The Domestic Card revenue margin remain healthy at 16.8%.
As you know, we stopped selling Payment Protection to new customers in the U.S. in 2012, but we allowed existing customers to keep the product. Since then, our revenue margin has absorbed a small drag at the back book of Payment Protection has been gradually running off as a result of account attrition, charge offs and cancellations. Payment Protection is expected to contribute about 25 basis points to the full year 2015 revenue margin and has been declining by an average of about 10 basis points a year. As we continue to simplify our operations to focus on our core offerings, we believe it is the right time to fully exit the back book, which we expect to largely complete in the first  quarter of 2016. We expect the contribution to revenue margin to essentially go to 0 by the second quarter of 2016. 
Year-over-year, noninterest expense increased 7%, driven by higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. Credit in the second quarter was driven by expected seasonal improvement. The charge-off rate improved 13 basis points to 3.42%. The delinquency rate improved 8 basis points to 2.84%. Recall that last quarter, we experienced better than forecasted delinquency flow rates. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through the charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rate to be around 3% at the third quarter seasonal low point.
Longer-term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. We still expect growth math to drive quarter charge-off rate to be in the mid- to high 3% range in the fourth quarter, and higher from there in 2016.
Loan growth coupled with expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter and we expect the same factors to drive allowance additions going forward.
Slide 8 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 1% year-over-year and 5% from the linked-quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continued to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Noninterest expense increased 6% year-over-year, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses and retail banking and growth in auto loans.
Provision for credit losses grew $42 million year-over-year to $185 million.
Growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit resulted in higher year-over-year charge-off trends.
In our auto business, used vehicle values have softened, although they remain near historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results. We discussed increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. In the second quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some of our competitors, particularly in subprime. We're losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. As a result of a subprime originations decline modestly compared to the prior year.
We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers, and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2015. Planned home loans runoff continues and auto loan growth is slowing and margins are compressing from once-in-a-lifetime levels. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio in the second half of 2015 and 2016.
Moving to Slide 9. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 6% year-over-year and 1% from the linked-quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I. Average loan balances were up 8% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our growth is slowing compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition, pressuring loan terms and pricing in CRE and plain vanilla C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty verticals in C&I.
Revenues increased 8% from the prior year, driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multifamily originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields, which declined 24 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition. Loan yields increased modestly from the linked-quarter. Provision for credit losses increased $37 million from the prior year to $49 million, driven by allowance build. We built allowance over the last 3 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. In the second quarter, criticize nonperforming loans were up $282 million from the prior year to $463 million, and the NPL rate increased about 50 basis points to 0.90%. These trends we're driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans, and to a lesser extent, downgrades of taxi medallion loans. Second quarter credit results include the final result of the shared national credits exam. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. About approximately $3.4 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans. Our largest exposure is in exploration and production, and our second largest exposure is in oilfield services.
Our taxi medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, taxi medallion values continue to decline, and we're closely watching this sector.
I'll conclude tonight on Slide 10. Capital One posted solid results in the second quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today and investing to sustain growth and returns over the long term. We remain compelled by the opportunity, need and urgency of digital transformation. We are entering a mobile on-demand realtime world. Digital has already disrupted many businesses and it created entirely new industries. The pace of disruption is sweeping, breathtaking and accelerating. Banking is inherently a digital business and is ripe for transformation. To win in the digital world, we can't simply bulk digital on the side of our existing business or port analog banking services through digital channels. Technology and information will fundamentally change how banking works and unlock new capabilities and the ability to deliver entirely new experiences. To fully capture these benefits, we're deeply embedding digital to our businesses. We're becoming a definition for great digital talent, product managers, designers, engineers and data scientists. We're simplifying and modernizing our infrastructure to drive agility across the company. We're building foundational capabilities around software development design and information, and we are transforming the way we work to unleash the power of modern technology and great talent to drive innovation. We are making significant investments in our digital future. We don't build technology for technology's sake. We are working backwards from a future where the vast majority of interactions with our customers will be digital. We are already seeing the payoff. Our digital investments are creating a compelling customer experience, delivering data-driven insights and are a key enabler of the strong growth we are delivering. We continue to see strong growth opportunities across our Domestic Card business. We believe that the right choice to drive long-term value is to spend marketing and operating expense to capitalize on this window of opportunity. 
Taken together, digital transformation, Domestic Card growth opportunities and rising industry regulatory requirements drive our investment levels. And we believe all 3 are strategic imperatives that are critical to long-term value creation.
Last quarter, we indicated that full year 2015 efficiency ratio could be modestly above 54.5%, driven by incremental marketing and growth-related operating expenses. With strong Domestic Card growth opportunities continuing, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be around 55%, excluding nonrecurring items.
While it's difficult to predict next year's efficiency ratio 18 months in advance, we can see a number of factors which will affect it. We expect the 2016 efficiency ratio will benefit from recent card growth and recent cost moves. But the continuing investments in growth, digital and regulatory as well as the revenue pressures in auto and retail banking are expected to put upward pressure on efficiency ratio. Net net, and excluding nonrecurring items, we don't expect much improvement in 2016 efficiency ratio relative to full year 2015.
We're managing expenses tightly read the goal of offsetting digital investments, growth and regulatory expenditures as best we can with savings in other areas. One example, in the second quarter is the choice we made to restructure our workforce as we become a more digital company. 
Pulling up, Capital One is well positioned to sustain attractive shareholder return. Over the near-term, we position Capital One to deliver financial performance with the following characteristics: strong revenue growth driven by growth in loans; preprovisions earnings growth, more or less in line with revenue growth; higher provision for credit losses, creating headwinds for net income; and significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval with share repurchases, reducing share count and aiding earnings per share.
Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

So let me talk in particular because most of this is driven by card and focus there. As we've mentioned, our allowances built off of 3 components: the loan balances at the end of the period, our 12 month forecast going forward and qualitative factors for risks that aren't covered in the models. As mentioned, and we've talked about this for a while, we're in a growth period for card. So that growth, all else equal, is going to be pushing up the allowance. And even more precisely, we've given you a sense for what's going to happen to charge-offs. Our current allowance right now includes the, if you think about it, there's a rotation that happens every quarter. Our current allowance includes expectations for low make or losses in the third quarter of 2015. We talked in our guidance of around 3%. And if you think about it, at the end of next quarter, we will replace the third quarter of 2015 with the third quarter of 2016. Remember, we have guided now consistently. There's not been a change in outlook for our loss content in card. We've guided consistently, over the last couple of quarters, that we're going to be in the mid- to high 3% in the fourth quarter of '15, and higher from there. So all else equal, even before loan growth, just the quarter swap would mean an allowance build next quarter. And the same thing happen, you can talk about this quarter. Now I always have to put in that qualifier of all else equal, changes to our underlying loss expectations can have a real impact on allowance build. Because it happens over the next kind of 4 quarters. So it's really the combination of growth and our outlook for charge-offs that's going to ultimately work its way into changes in allowance."

Let me say a few things about the efficiency ratio. As you know and probably looking at our own conversation over the course of this year, it's hard to precisely predict efficiency ratio, but we wanted to give investors a sense that there really are tailwinds and headwinds that are competing pretty strongly with each other. And the recent growth that we've done in the card business, for example, is certainly a positive force. Offsetting that, of course, is what we'll do in terms of investing in card growth during the year, next year and a pretty big component is the digital investment as well as in some of the other things that I've mentioned. In terms of how these play out the card growth in will ultimately be beneficial to efficiency ratio as growth moderates and the investment in digital, a lot of banks are talking about digital in the language of whether the expenditure -- how the investment in digital compares to the cost saves. We are not primarily motivated by cost saving with digital because I think that's about fourth on the list of things that the power that digital provides. Right now, it is still a net negative and probably for an extended period of time measured purely by cost, digital will probably be a net negative. But even then, on the cost side, we're seeing benefits already in statement and payment processing, telephone servicing cost, workforce restructuring that you saw, branch efficiency, data storage, a lot of things. But the bigger benefits are things beyond that and that show up in terms of better credit risk management, faster product development and ultimately, the kind of growth that you're seeing. So the reason that we took the time here to lay out efficiency ratio guidance was just to give you a sense of the commitment that we have to investing on the digital side and the commitment that we have to seizing the opportunity on the card growth side, and I think both of those factors are going to be significant enough that we don't see a lot of opportunity for the efficiency ratio to go down in the near-term. All of -- during the same time, we are working incredibly hard to save cost in 1 minus those 2 areas, and I think today's announcement is a manifestation of some of those efforts."

Let me start with the interchange. The net interchange metric can have quite a bit of quarter-to-quarter variability because it includes partnership, contractual payments, it includes international card and we periodically adjust our rewards and liability based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. So as such in any particular quarter, there tends to be a lot of noise around that, but if you sort of pull-up beyond the quarterly noise, you're absolutely right in pointing out that net interchange growth has generally lagged general-purpose credit card interchange growth. And purchase volume growth and we would expect this trend to continue. In many ways, it's really the byproduct of the success that we're seeing. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be enjoying a lot of growth. We are making the choice to upgrade a lot of our customers to these products, and we're also extending reward products to existing customers who don't have rewards. So if you look at the effect of all of those together, that's why interchange growth is lags purchase volume growth. And I think that while that will bounce around from quarter to quarter, I think over the longer run, those 2 metrics will converge. I think it still will be some time before they fully converge. And with respect to the alternative lenders. For example, small business lenders. Look, we're very intrigued with some of these startup companies. I think that they have demonstrated a lot of innovation that, from which, I think we can learn a lot about Capital One. The way that they do their underwriting, they're obviously -- the digital capabilities that they have in a number of cases, they're using very sophisticated and interesting data analytics, the way that they do cash flow based on their writing, the way that they sort of do the daily collections kind of thing. There's a lot of very creative activities going on in that particular space. We're watching it carefully, and we'll continue to see and learn from the people that are leading in this space."

So I guess I'm just curious, given that you haven't really changed your outlook for credit losses over the next few quarters, what do you need to see?

While overall, generally, the mix is about the same. There has been a very small increase in the subprime mix.

And the price I'd say, the more things change, the more they stay the same in terms of how the opportunities we're pursuing and the nature of the growth that we're getting. When you asked a question what is the canary in the coal mine with respect to this business, obviously, we look incredibly carefully at the metrics that begin on the origination side. So we look at the nature of the mix of applicants that we get, and that tends to be an indicator of whether there's positive or negative selection. And then we track very closely every single month all of the metrics and early indicators of whether there are any issues. In Capital One, we predict outcomes before, during and after every single originations. So we monitor these incredibly closely. You often note that in things like the subprime space, we have about more than 15 or approaching 20 years experience in this particular space. So what I would say for it would be the same as I would say for any part of the card business. We watch very carefully for adverse selection. We monitor the metrics extremely closely, and we stay mobilized to move, and also to let our investors know when things change relative to our own expectations. But all that said, we continue to see really across the card business, the stability in the competitive environment, the stability in the origination environment and stability in the consumer and their own behavior, and really a stability in the vintages of our originations."

One of the benefits of the upstream oil and gas business is the ability to do the borrowing base redetermination. So loan balances were down 6% from the prior quarter as a result of the spring borrowing base redetermination. And our EMP borrowers decreased their balances to conform to their lower commodity prices and oilfield services companies reduced their balance sheet. So we've seemed particularly in the -- while we're pretty much lean across the energy business, a pretty darn quick reaction by reducing expenses, particularly capital expenditures and taking advantage of the receptive capital markets. So all of that said, obviously, you don't have to look very far to notice what's happening in oil prices and the volatility and risks there. So the allowance build that we have had for several quarters now have been significantly driven by energy as well as in the taxi business as well. But that one, we really have to monitor carefully.

So we have a very healthy revenue margin. We have great things going on in the business, but we are not intervening to do something on the revenue side to offset this. What we're doing is really just accelerating and getting over with something that was going to happen anyway over the next couple of years."

Originations and the very natural early balance growth associated with that, and a sizable minority is coming from credit line increases on more seasoned book. But we are approaching an equilibrium with respect to those effects. I flagged several quarters ago that we had a bit of an outside credit line increase going on because we had, had a brownout for the period preceding that, and we are pretty close to an equilibrium now maybe just a little bit still residual from on that credit line increase side, but what you see is approaching an equilibrium with respect to the mechanics of how growth works."

Digital is becoming so all-encompassing into how life works and how the business works. It's increasingly difficult to even, in a sense, technically answer your question. But the thing, so but we don't start with a thing that says",897,"Well, thank you, Sameer. Digital is becoming so all-encompassing into how life works and how the business works. It's increasingly difficult to even, in a sense, technically answer your question. But the thing, so but we don't start with a thing that says, ""Okay, we have X million dollars to spend on digital and that is it."" So what we do is, we start strategically with the environment and say, where is the world going and what does winning entail as the world goes there. And we work backwards and then develop a strategy and we figure out, where we need to go as a company. And along the way, you can imagine that digital is a centerpiece of that entire strategic agenda. And so, everybody from the bottom up builds the economics of their business, working backwards from where they're trying to go as a business. And all of that adds up to our overall economics. We see if it makes sense, we drive incredibly hard to wring out costs that are not directly related to digital innovation and growth. I know you can't necessarily see those effects, but they are very significant as are the digital investments on the other side. But I'd think that I'd just like to stop and reflect a little bit on, what is it that we're investing in? Because I think a lot of banks say, and I've heard several of them say it, we're going to self-fund this digital investment. And so, you tell me how much you can save and that's how much we can invest. That is a really, really tough way to take any institution I think to where it needs to go because the marketplace isn't waiting for us to do that on those terms. But on the other hand, we're not just investing in science experience -- experiments or seeing what's new and shiny objects. When we talk about digital investment, it starts with talent. We're talking about bringing in top engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists often from tech companies and startups outside of financial services. And this is a very important thing, and obviously, it cost money to do that, but that's a foundational thing. We're talking about providing the digital workspaces and the most modern tools for these folks, that's essential in terms of recruiting, I mean in essential in terms of leveraging in. So often I think banks when they think about digital, they think I've got to go build apps. We've got to get customer-facing or associate-facing apps. Most of the leverage is really in infrastructure in terms of things like a rationalized and simplified core infrastructure, increasingly, we're focusing on cloud computing and building the underlying capabilities such that product development will be faster and faster and more effective over time. We're obviously investing in terms of product development itself, and we're on an accelerating basis, shipping product, and you can go to the App Store and take a look at some of this stuff, it's pretty highly rated. We're investing in cybersecurity. This is an incredibly important area, and we are putting a lot of very top talent and a lot of energy and investment into that. So -- but the key thing is, this is not because we think this digital thing is cool and there's opportunity someday. These are delivering benefits right now on many fronts. While you can't necessarily see it in the numbers in the UC, but the enhancements to productivity, the power of innovation, the dramatically growing customer experience benefits and it's inextricably linked to the growth that we are generating right now. So pulling way up from that, it doesn't really start with, this is the number. It's really increasingly sort of defining who we are and how we think about the business. But the key to pulling way up, what we are so focused on is making sure that we can generate very strong returns for our shareholders and continue to invest in a future that has very strong returns for our shareholders over time. And right now, we are -- we see right in front of us 2 very, very big opportunities. One of them is card growth and the other one is this digital opportunity. Both of them involve spending money to make more money later. But at the end of the day, I go back to the thing that we focus on every single day. How can we create value for our shareholders today and ensure that we can create value for them tomorrow? And the way to do that is to generate well above hurdle rate returns to make sure that our investments are very disciplined and driven by a net present value framework to the absolute most rigorous extent possible, and be sure that we are really obsessive guardians of capital. And in the end, distributing capital to our shareholders. So that's a long answer to your question, but I'm glad you asked because increasingly, digital is who we are and it's where the leverage is. Thanks, Sameer, and thank you, everybody for joining us on this conference call tonight. We thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One.

For the second quarter, Capital One earned $830 million or $1.50 per share, and had a return on average tangible common equity of 11%.

For the second quarter, Capital One earned $830 million or $1.50 per share, and had a return on average tangible common equity of 11%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.48 per share.
Net income was down $285 million, driven by lower linked-quarter pre-provision earnings and higher provision expense.
Pre-provision earnings decreased by $233 million versus the prior quarter, and higher revenue was more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses.
Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as lower charge-offs were offset by a larger allowance build.
We had nonrecurring cost of $225 million in the quarter. We have included an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website, illustrating the impacts from these items, the key line items and ratios in the quarter.
Nonrecurring charges include: restructuring expense of $147 million related to the realignment of our workforce that we recently announced internally. We expect a modest amount of incremental nonrecurring charges later this year from site closures related to this activity.
We also added $78 million to our U.K. PPI reserve of which $37 million was captured as a contra-revenue item and $41 million was captured in noninterest expense.
The increase in our U.K. PPI reserve is driven by complaint volumes declining more slowly than we have previously estimated. The refund of PPI fee as an interest is an industry-wide issue and there continues to be uncertainty as to how these exposures will play out. Estimating future complaint levels is difficult and there is the potential that more complaints will be filed in the future than we are currently estimating.
As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve.
Excluding the impact from the restructuring charges and the building U.K. PPA reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $1.78, and our efficiency ratio was 54.6%.
Turning to another legal matter. In the quarter, we recorded a $36 million benefit from reducing our reserve for representation and warranty claims. This reduction was driven by our recent High Court ruling in New York regarding the application of statute of limitations. We also expect that the ruling will result in a decrease to our reasonably possible rep and warranty exposure by approximately $500 million from the level reported in March of 2015. But that calculation will not be finalized until the 10-Q is filed next month.
As outlined on the slide 4, reported NIM decreased 1 basis point in the second quarter to 6.56% as lower investment securities and loan yields were partially offset by lower cash balances and additional day to recognize revenue in the second quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of June 30, 2015.
On Slide 5, you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this ratio would be approximately 11.8%.
We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions.
We entered parallel runs for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1 and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target.
Let me now turn the call over to Rich."

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter. Ending loans were up 11% year-over-year and average loans grew 9%. We continue to see attractive opportunities in the parts of the market we",1703,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter. Ending loans were up 11% year-over-year and average loans grew 9%. We continue to see attractive opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue grew 20% year-over-year. The success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations and credit line increases continue to drive purchase volume growth.
Revenue increased 8% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue margin decreased 12 basis points, driven by the change in our finance charge and fee reserve which swung from a modest credit-driven release in the first quarter to a modest growth-related build in the second quarter. The Domestic Card revenue margin remains healthy at 16.8%.
As you know, we stopped selling Payment Protection to new customers in the U.S. in 2012, but we allowed existing customers to keep the product. Since then, our revenue margin has absorbed a small drag as the back book of Payment Protection has been gradually running off as a result of account attrition, charge offs and cancellations. Payment Protection is expected to contribute about 25 basis points to the full year 2015 revenue margin and has been declining by an average of about 10 basis points a year. As we continue to simplify our operations to focus on our core offerings, we believe it is the right time to fully exit the back book which we expect to largely complete in the first quarter of 2016. We expect the contribution to revenue margin to essentially go to 0 by the second quarter of 2016. 
Year-over-year, noninterest expense increased 7%, driven by higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. Credit in the second quarter was driven by expected seasonal improvement. The charge-off rate improved 13 basis points to 3.42%. The delinquency rate improved 8 basis points to 2.84%. Recall that last quarter, we experienced better than forecasted delinquency flow rates. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through the charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rate to be around 3% at the third quarter seasonal low point.
Longer-term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. We still expect growth math to drive quarterly charge-off rates to be in the mid to high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016.
Loan growth coupled with expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter and we expect the same factors to drive allowance additions going forward.
Slide 8 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoffs. Auto originations increased about 1% year-over-year and 5% from the linked-quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continued to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Noninterest expense increased 6% year-over-year, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses and retail banking and growth in auto loans.
Provision for credit losses grew $42 million year-over-year to $185 million.
Growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit resulted in higher year-over-year charge-off expense.
In our auto business, used vehicle values have softened, although they remain near historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results. We discussed increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. In the second quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some of our competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. As a result, subprime originations declined modestly compared to the prior year.
We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2015. Planned home loans runoffs continues and auto loan growth is slowing and margins are compressing from once-in-a-lifetime levels. We expect these trends will negatively effect revenues and efficiency ratio in the second half of 2015 and 2016.
Moving to Slide 9. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 6% year-over-year and 1% from the linked-quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I. Average loan balances were up 8% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our growth is slowing compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition, pressuring loan terms and pricing in CRE and plain vanilla C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty verticals in C&I.
Revenues increased 8% from the prior year, driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multifamily originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields which declined 24 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition. Loan yields increased modestly from the linked-quarter. Provision for credit losses increased $37 million from the prior year to $49 million, driven by allowance build. We built allowance over the last 3 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. In the second quarter, criticized nonperforming loans were up $282 million from the prior year to $463 million, and the NPL rate increased about 50 basis points to 0.90%. These trends we're driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans and to a lesser extent, downgrades of Taxi Medallion loans. Second quarter credit results include the final result of the shared national credits exam. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. Of our approximately $3.4 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, our largest exposure is in exploration and production and our second largest exposure is in oilfield services.
Our taxi medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, Taxi Medallion values continue to decline and we're closely watching this sector.
I'll conclude tonight on Slide 10. Capital One posted solid results in the second quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today and investing to sustain growth and returns over the long term. We remain compelled by the opportunity, need and urgency of digital transformation. We are entering a mobile on-demand realtime world. Digital has already disrupted many businesses and has created entirely new industries. The pace of disruption is sweeping, breathtaking and accelerating. Banking is inherently a digital business and is ripe for transformation. To win in the digital world, we can't simply bulk digital onto the side of our existing business or port analog banking services to digital channels. Technology and information will fundamentally change how banking works and unlock new capabilities and the ability to deliver entirely new experiences. To fully capture these benefits, we're deeply embedding digital into our businesses. We're becoming a definition for great digital talent, product managers, designers, engineers and data scientists. We're simplifying and modernizing our infrastructure to drive agility across the company. We're building foundational capabilities around software development, design and information and we're transforming the way we work to unleash the power of modern technology and great talent to drive innovation. We are making significant investments in our digital future. We don't build technology for technology's sake. We are working backwards from a future where the vast majority of interactions with our customers will be digital. We are already seeing the payoff. Our digital investments are creating a compelling customer experience, delivering data-driven insights and are a key enabler of the strong growth we are delivering. We continue to see strong growth opportunities across our Domestic Card business. We believe that the right choice to drive long-term value is to spend marketing and operating expense to capitalize on this window of opportunity. 
Taken together, digital transformation, Domestic Card growth opportunities and rising industry regulatory requirements drive our investment levels. And we believe all 3 are strategic imperatives that are critical to long-term value creation.
Last quarter, we indicated that full year 2015 efficiency ratio could be modestly above 54.5%, driven by incremental marketing and growth-related operating expenses. With strong Domestic Card growth opportunities continuing, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be around 55%, excluding nonrecurring items.
While it's difficult to predict next year's efficiency ratio 18 months in advance, we can see a number of factors which will affect it. We expect the 2016 efficiency ratio will benefit from recent card growth and recent cost moves. But the continuing investments in growth, digital and regulatory as well as the revenue pressures in auto and retail banking are expected to put upward pressure on efficiency ratio. Net-net and excluding nonrecurring items, we don't expect much improvement in 2016 efficiency ratio relative to full year 2015.
We're managing expenses tightly with the goal of offsetting digital investments, growth and regulatory expenditures as best we can with savings in other areas. One example in the second quarter is the choice we made to restructure our workforce as we become a more digital company. 
Pulling up, Capital One is well positioned to sustain attractive shareholder return. Over the near-term, we position Capital One to deliver financial performance with the following characteristics: strong revenue growth driven by growth in loans; pre-provision earnings growth, more or less in line with revenue growth; higher provision for credit losses, creating headwinds for net income; and significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval with share repurchases, reducing share count and aiding earnings per share.
Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

So let me talk in particular because most of this is driven by card and focus there. As we've mentioned, our allowance is built off of 3 components: the loan balances at the end of the period, our 12 month forecast going forward and qualitative factors for risks that aren't covered in the models. As mentioned, and we've talked about this for a while, we're in a growth period for card. So that growth, all else equal, is going to be pushing up the allowance. And even more precisely, we've given you a sense for what's going to happen to charge-offs. Our current allowance right now includes the -- if you think about it, there's a rotation that happens every quarter. Our current allowance includes expectations for low make or losses. In the third quarter of 2015, we talked in our guidance of around 3%. And if you think about it at the end of next quarter, we will replace the third quarter of 2015 with the third quarter of 2016. Remember, we have guided now consistently. There's not been a change in outlook for our loss content in card. We've guided consistently over the last couple of quarters that we are going to be in the mid to high 3% in the fourth quarter of '15 and higher from there. So all else equal, even before loan growth, just the quarter swap would mean an allowance build next quarter. And the same thing happen, you can talk about this quarter. Now I always have to put in that qualifier of all else equal, changes to our underlying loss expectations can have a real impact on allowance build. Because it happens over the next kind of 4 quarters. So it's really the combination of growth and our outlook for charge-offs that's going to ultimately work its way into changes in allowance."

Let me say a few things about the efficiency ratio. As you know and probably looking at our own conversation over the course of this year, it's hard to precisely predict efficiency ratio but we wanted to give investors a sense that there really are tailwinds and headwinds that are competing pretty strongly with each other. And the recent growth that we've done in the card business, for example, is certainly a positive force. Offsetting that, of course, is what we'll do in terms of investing in card growth during the year, next year and a pretty big component is the digital investment as well as in some of the other things that I've mentioned. In terms of how these play out, the card growth, it will ultimately be beneficial to efficiency ratio as growth moderates and the investment in digital, a lot of banks are talking about digital in the language of whether the expenditure -- how the investment in digital compares to the cost saves. We are not primarily motivated by cost saving with digital because I think that's about fourth on the list of things that the power that digital provides. Right now, it is still a net negative. And probably for an extended period of time measured purely by cost, digital will probably be a net negative. But even then, on the cost side, we're seeing benefits already in statement and payment processing, telephone servicing cost, workforce restructuring that you saw, branch efficiency, data storage, a lot of things. But the bigger benefits are things beyond that and that show up in terms of better credit risk management, faster product development and ultimately, the kind of growth that you're seeing. So the reason that we took the time here to lay out efficiency ratio guidance was just to give you a sense of the commitment that we have to investing on the digital side and the commitment that we have to seizing the opportunity on the card growth side. And I think both of those factors are going to be significant enough that we don't see a lot of opportunity for the efficiency ratio to go down in the near-term. All of -- during the same time, we are working incredibly hard to save cost in 1 minus those 2 areas, and I think today's announcement is a manifestation of some of those efforts."

Yes, let me start with the interchange. The net interchange metric can have quite a bit of quarter-to-quarter variability because it includes partnership, contractual payments, it includes international card and we periodically adjust our rewards and liability based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. So as such in any particular quarter, there tends to be a lot of noise around that but if you sort of pull-up beyond the quarterly noise, you're absolutely right in pointing out that net interchange growth has generally lagged general-purpose credit card interchange growth or purchase volume growth and we would expect this trend to continue. In many ways, it's really a byproduct of the success that we're seeing. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be enjoying a lot of growth. We are making the choice to upgrade a lot of our customers to these products, and we're also extending reward products to existing customers who don't have rewards. So if you look at the effect of all of those together, that's why interchange growth lags purchase volume growth. And I think that while that will bounce around from quarter to quarter, I think over the longer run, those 2 metrics will converge. I think it still will be some time before they fully converge. And with respect to the alternative lenders, for example, small business lenders. Look, we're very intrigued with some of these startup companies. I think that they have demonstrated a lot of innovation that from which I think we can learn a lot at Capital One. The way that they do their underwriting, obviously, the digital capabilities that they have. In a number of cases, they're using very sophisticated and interesting data analytics. The way that they do cash flow-based underwriting, the way that they sort of do the daily collections kind of thing. There's a lot of very creative activities going on in that particular space. We're watching it carefully and we'll continue to see and learn from the people that are leading in this space."

And the price I'd say, sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same in terms of how the opportunities we're pursuing and the nature of the growth that we're getting. When you asked a question on what is the canary in the coal mine with respect to this business, obviously, we look incredibly carefully at the metrics that begin on the origination side. So we look at the nature of the mix of applicants that we get, and that tends to be an indicator of whether there's positive or negative selection. And then we track very closely every single month, all of the metrics and early indicators of whether there are any issues. And in Capital One, we predict outcomes before, during and after every single origination. So we monitor this incredibly closely. You also know that in things like the subprime space, we have about more than 15 or approaching 20 years experience in this particular space. So what I would say for it would be the same as I would say for any part of the card business. We watch it very carefully for adverse selection, we monitor the metrics extremely closely, and we stay mobilized to move and also to let our investors know when things change relative to our own expectations. But all that said, we continue to see really across the card business, the stability in the competitive environment, a stability in the origination environment, a stability in the consumer and their own behavior and really, a stability in the vintages of our originations."

One of the benefits of the upstream oil and gas business is the ability to do the borrowing base redetermination.

And our E&P borrowers decreased their balances to conform to their lower commodity prices, and oilfield services companies reduced their balance sheets. So we've seemed particularly in the -- well, we're pretty much seeing across the energy business, a pretty darn quick reaction by reducing expenses, particularly capital expenditures and taking advantage of the receptive capital markets. So all of that said, obviously, you don't have to look very far to notice what's happening in oil prices and the volatility and risks there. So the allowance builds that we have had for several quarters now have been significantly driven by energy as well as in the taxi business as well. But that one, we really have to monitor carefully.

We are not -- I wouldn't look for any specific thing to offset that. It's one of many, many things that affect revenue over time. Our point is, other things being equal, that would take down the revenue margin by 25 basis points.

I think the best way to think of this is that the majority of our originations and growth is from new account acquisitions, so just a general observation. The majority is coming from the account originations and the very natural early balance growth associated with that, and a sizable minority is coming from credit line increases on more seasoned books. But we are approaching an equilibrium with respect to those effects. I flagged several quarters ago that we had a bit of an outside credit line increase going on because we had a brownout for the period preceding that.

Digital is becoming so all-encompassing into how life works and how the business works. It's increasingly difficult to even, in a sense, technically answer your question. But the thing -- but we don't start with a thing that says,",841,"Well, thank you, Sameer. Digital is becoming so all-encompassing into how life works and how the business works. It's increasingly difficult to even, in a sense, technically answer your question. But the thing -- but we don't start with a thing that says, okay, we have X million dollars to spend on digital and that is it. So what we do is, we start strategically with the environment and say, where is the world going and what does winning entail as the world goes there? And we work backwards and then develop a strategy and we figure out where we need to go as a company. And along the way, you can imagine that digital is a centerpiece of that entire strategic agenda. And so, everybody from the bottom up builds the economics of their business, working backwards from where they're trying to go as a business. And all of that adds up to our overall economics. We see if it makes sense, we drive incredibly hard to wring out costs that are not directly related to digital innovation and growth. I know you can't necessarily see those effects, but they are very significant, as are the digital investments on the other side. But I think that I'd just like to stop and reflect a little bit on what is it that we're investing in? Because I think a lot of banks say, and I've heard several of them say it, we're going to self-fund this digital investment. And so, you tell me how much you can save and that's how much we can invest. That is a really, really tough way to take any institution, I think, to where it needs to go because the marketplace isn't waiting for us to do that on those terms. But on the other hand, we're not just investing in science experiments or seeing what's the new and shiny objects. When we talk about digital investment, it starts with talent. We're talking about bringing in top engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists that's often from tech companies and startups outside of financial services. And this is a very important thing and obviously, it costs money to do that, but that's a foundational thing. We're talking about providing the digital workspaces and the most modern tools for these folks that's essential in terms of recruiting them and essential in terms of leveraging. So often, I think banks, when they think about digital, they think I've got to go build apps, we've got to get customer-facing or associate-facing apps. Most of the leverage is really in infrastructure in terms of things like a rationalized and simplified core infrastructure. Increasingly, we're focusing on cloud computing and building the underlying capabilities such that product development will be faster and faster and more effective over time. We're obviously investing in terms of product development itself and we're on an accelerating basis, shipping product and you can go to the App Store and take a look at some of this stuff, it's pretty highly rated. We're investing in cyber security. This is an incredibly important area and we are putting a lot of very top talent and a lot of energy and investment into that. But the key thing is, this is not because we think this digital thing is cool and there's opportunity someday. These are delivering benefits right now on many fronts. While you can't necessarily see it in the numbers that you see but the enhancements to productivity, the power of innovation, the dramatically growing customer experience benefits, and it's inextricably linked to the growth that we are generating right now. So pulling way up from that, it doesn't really start with, this is the number. It's really increasingly sort of who we are and how we think about the business. But the key to pulling way up, what we are so focused on is making sure that we can generate very strong returns for our shareholders and continue to invest in a future that has very strong returns for our shareholders over time. And right now, we see right in front of us 2 very, very big opportunities. One of them is card growth and the other one is this digital opportunity. Both of them involve spending money to make more money later. But at the end of the day, I go back to the thing that we focus on every single day. How can we create value for our shareholders today and ensure that we can create value for them tomorrow? And the way to do that is to generate well above hurdle rate returns to make sure that our investments are very disciplined and driven by a net present value framework to the absolute most rigorous extent possible, and be sure that we are really obsessive guardians of capital. And in the end, distributing capital to our shareholders. So that's a long answer to your question but I'm glad you asked because increasingly, digital is who we are and it's where the leverage is."

For the second quarter, Capital One earned $830 million or $1.50 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 11%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.48 per share.
Net income was down $285 million, driven by lower linked-quarter pre-provision earnings and higher provision expense.
Pre-provision earnings decreased by $233 million versus the prior quarter, and higher revenue was more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses.
Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as lower charge-offs were offset by a larger allowance build.
We had nonrecurring costs of $225 million in the quarter. We have included an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website illustrating the impacts from these items, the key line items and ratios in the quarter.
Nonrecurring charges include restructuring expense of $147 million related to the realignment of our workforce that we recently announced internally. We expect a modest amount of incremental nonrecurring charges later this year from site closures related to this activity.
We also added $78 million to our U.K. PPI reserve, of which $37 million was captured as a contra-revenue item and $41 million was captured in noninterest expense.
The increase in our U.K. PPI reserve is driven by complaint volumes declining more slowly than we have previously estimated. The refund of PPI fees and interest is an industry-wide issue, and there continues to be uncertainty as to how these exposures will play out. Estimating future complaint levels is difficult, and there is the potential that more complaints will be filed in the future than we are currently estimating.
As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve.
Excluding the impact from the restructuring charges and the build in U.K. PPI reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $1.78, and our efficiency ratio was 54.6%.
Turning to another legal matter. In the quarter, we recorded a $36 million benefit from reducing our reserve for representation and warranty claims. This reduction was driven by a recent High Court ruling in New York regarding the application of statute of limitations. We also expect that the ruling will result in a decrease to our reasonably possible rep and warranty exposure by approximately $500 million from the level reported in March of 2015. But that calculation will not be finalized until the 10-Q is filed next month.
As outlined on Slide 4, reported NIM decreased 1 basis point in the second quarter to 6.56% as lower investment securities and loan yields were partially offset by lower cash balances and additional day to recognize revenue in the second quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of June 30, 2015.
On Slide 5, you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this ratio would be approximately 11.8%.
We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions.
We entered parallel runs for Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target.
Let me now turn the call over to Rich."
336241,304828870,837933,"Capital One Financial Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Capital One Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter. Ending loans were up 11% year-over-year and average loans grew 9%. We continue to see attractive opportunities in the parts of the market we",1705,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter. Ending loans were up 11% year-over-year and average loans grew 9%. We continue to see attractive opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time.
Purchase volume on general-purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew 20% year-over-year. The success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations and credit line increases continue to drive purchase volume growth.
Revenue increased 8% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue margin decreased 12 basis points driven by the change in our finance charge and fee reserve, which swung from a modest credit-driven release in the first quarter to a modest growth-related build in the second quarter. The Domestic Card revenue margin remains healthy at 16.8%.
As you know, we stopped selling Payment Protection to new customers in the U.S. in 2012, but we allowed existing customers to keep the product. Since then, our revenue margin has absorbed a small drag as the back book of Payment Protection has been gradually running off as a result of account attrition, charge-offs and cancellations. Payment Protection is expected to contribute about 25 basis points to the full year 2015 revenue margin and has been declining by an average of about 10 basis points a year. As we continue to simplify our operations to focus on our core offerings, we believe it is the right time to fully exit the back book, which we expect to largely complete in the first quarter of 2016. We expect the contribution to revenue margin to essentially go to 0 by the second quarter of 2016. 
Year-over-year noninterest expense increased 7%, driven by higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. Credit in the second quarter was driven by expected seasonal improvements. The charge-off rate improved 13 basis points to 3.42%. The delinquency rate improved 8 basis points to 2.84%. Recall that last quarter, we experienced better-than-forecasted delinquency flow rates. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through the charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rates to be around 3% at the third quarter seasonal low point.
Longer term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. We still expect growth math to drive quarterly charge-off rates to be in the mid to high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016.
Loan growth, coupled with expectations for rising charge-off rate, drove an allowance build in the quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward.
Slide 8 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 1% year-over-year and 5% from the linked quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continued to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Noninterest expense increased 6% year-over-year, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans.
Provision for credit losses grew $42 million year-over-year to $185 million.
Growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit resulted in higher year-over-year charge-off expense.
In our auto business, used vehicle values have softened, although they remain near historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results. We've discussed increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. In the second quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some of our competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. As a result, subprime originations declined modestly compared to the prior year.
We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will pressure returns in our deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2015. Planned home loans runoff continues, and auto loan growth is slowing and margins are compressing from once-in-a-lifetime levels. We expect these trends will negatively effect revenues and efficiency ratio in the second half of 2015 and 2016.
Moving to Slide 9. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 6% year-over-year and 1% from the linked quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I. Average loan balances were up 8% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our growth is slowing compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition pressuring loan terms and pricing in CRE and plain vanilla C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty verticals in C&I.
Revenues increased 8% from the prior year, driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multifamily originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields, which declined 24 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition. Loan yields increased modestly from the linked quarter. Provision for credit losses increased $37 million from the prior year to $49 million, driven by allowance build. We built allowance over the last 3 quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. In the second quarter, criticized nonperforming loans were up $282 million from the prior year to $463 million, and the NPL rate increased about 50 basis points to 0.90%. These trends were driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans and, to a lesser extent, downgrades of Taxi Medallion loans. Second quarter credit results include the final result of the Shared National Credit's exam. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. Of our approximately $3.4 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, our largest exposure is in exploration and production and our second largest exposure is in oilfield services.
Our Taxi Medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, Taxi Medallion values continue to decline, and we're closely watching this sector.
I'll conclude tonight on Slide 10. Capital One posted solid results in the second quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today and investing to sustain growth and returns over the long term. We remain compelled by the opportunity, need and urgency of digital transformation. We are entering a mobile on-demand realtime world. Digital has already disrupted many businesses and has created entirely new industries. The pace of disruption is sweeping, breathtaking and accelerating. Banking is inherently a digital business and is ripe for transformation. To win in the digital world, we can't simply bolt digital onto the side of our existing business or port analog banking services to digital channels. Technology and information will fundamentally change how banking works and unlock new capabilities and the ability to deliver entirely new experiences. To fully capture these benefits, we're deeply embedding digital into our businesses. We're becoming a destination for great digital talent, product managers, designers, engineers and data scientists. We're simplifying and modernizing our infrastructure to drive agility across the company. We're building foundational capabilities around software development, design and information. And we're transforming the way we work to unleash the power of modern technology and great talent to drive innovation. We are making significant investments in our digital future. We don't build technology for technology's sake. We are working backwards from a future where the vast majority of interactions with our customers will be digital. We are already seeing the payoff. Our digital investments are creating a compelling customer experience delivering data-driven insights and are a key enabler of the strong growth we are delivering. We continue to see strong growth opportunities across our Domestic Card business. We believe that the right choice to drive long-term value is to spend marketing and operating expense to capitalize on this window of opportunity. 
Taken together, digital transformation, Domestic Card growth opportunities and rising industry regulatory requirements drive our investment levels. And we believe all 3 are strategic imperatives that are critical to long-term value creation.
Last quarter, we indicated that full year 2015 efficiency ratio could be modestly above 54.5%, driven by incremental marketing and growth-related operating expenses. With strong Domestic Card growth opportunities continuing, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be around 55%, excluding nonrecurring items.
While it's difficult to predict next year's efficiency ratio 18 months in advance, we can see a number of factors which will affect it. We expect the 2016 efficiency ratio will benefit from recent card growth and recent cost moves. But the continuing investments in growth, digital and regulatory, as well as the revenue pressures in auto and retail banking, are expected to put upward pressure on efficiency ratio. Net-net and excluding nonrecurring items, we don't expect much improvement in 2016 efficiency ratio relative to full year 2015.
We're managing expenses tightly with the goal of offsetting digital investments, growth and regulatory expenditures as best we can with savings in other areas. One example in the second quarter is the choice we made to restructure our workforce as we become a more digital company. 
Pulling up, Capital One is well positioned to sustain attractive shareholder return. Over the near term, we've positioned Capital One to deliver financial performance with the following characteristics: strong revenue growth driven by growth in loans; pre-provision earnings growth more or less in line with revenue growth; higher provision for credit losses, creating headwinds for net income; and significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory, approval with share repurchases reducing share count and aiding earnings per share.

So let me talk in particular because most of this is driven by card and focus there. As we've mentioned, our allowance is built off of 3 components: the loan balances at the end of the period, our 12-month forecast going forward and qualitative factors for risks that aren't covered in the models. As mentioned, and we've talked about this for a while, we're in a growth period for card. So that growth, all else equal, is going to be pushing up the allowance. And even more precisely, we've given you a sense for what's going to happen to charge-offs. Our current allowance right now includes the -- if you think about it, there's a rotation that happens every quarter. Our current allowance includes expectations for low NACO losses in the third quarter of 2015. We talked in our guidance of around 3%. And if you think about it, at the end of next quarter, we will replace the third quarter of 2015 with the third quarter of 2016. Remember, we have guided now consistently. There's not been a change in outlook for our loss content in card. We've guided consistently over the last couple of quarters that we are going to be in the mid to high 3% in the fourth quarter of '15 and higher from there. So all else equal, even before loan growth, just a quarter swap would mean an allowance build next quarter. And the same thing happened, you can talk about this quarter. Now I always have to put in that qualifier of all else equal. Changes to our underlying loss expectations can have a real impact on allowance build because it happens over the next kind of 4 quarters. So it's really the combination of growth and our outlook for charge-offs that's going to ultimately work its way into changes in allowance."

As you know and probably looking at our own conversation over the course of this year, it's hard to precisely predict efficiency ratio. But what we wanted to give investors a sense of is that there really are tailwinds and headwinds that are competing pretty strongly with each other. And the recent growth that we've done in the card business, for example, is certainly a positive force. Offsetting that, of course, is what we'll do in terms of investing in card growth during the year next year, and a pretty big component is the digital investment as well and some of the other things that I've mentioned. In terms of how these play out, the card growth, it will ultimately be beneficial to efficiency ratio as growth moderates. And the investment in digital, a lot of banks are talking about digital in the language of what is the expenditure -- how the investment in digital compares to the cost saves. We are not primarily motivated by cost saving with digital because I think that's about fourth on the list of things that -- the power that digital provides. Right now, it is still a net negative. And probably for an extended period of time, measured purely by cost, digital will probably be a net negative. But even then, on the cost side, we're seeing benefits already in statement and payment processing, telephone servicing cost, workforce restructuring that you saw, branch efficiency, data storage, a lot of things. But the bigger benefits are things beyond that that show up in terms of better credit risk management, faster product development and ultimately the kind of growth that you're seeing. So the reason that we took the time here to lay out efficiency ratio guidance was just to give you a sense of the commitment that we have to investing on the digital side and the commitment that we have to seizing the opportunity on the card growth side. And I think both of those factors are going to be significant enough that we don't see a lot of opportunity for the efficiency ratio to go down in the near term. All of -- during the same time, we are working incredibly hard to save cost in 1 minus those 2 areas, and I think today's announcement is a manifestation of some of those efforts."

Yes, let me start with the interchange. The net interchange metric can have quite a bit of quarter-to-quarter variability because it includes partnership contractual payments, it includes international card, and we periodically adjust our rewards liability based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. So as such, in any particular quarter, there tends to be a lot of noise around that. But if you sort of pull-up beyond the quarterly noise, you're absolutely right in pointing out that net interchange growth has generally lagged general-purpose credit card interchange growth or purchase volume growth, and we would expect this trend to continue. In many ways, it's really a byproduct of the success that we're seeing. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be enjoying a lot of growth. We are making the choice to upgrade a lot of our customers to these products, and we're also extending reward products to existing customers who don't have rewards. So if you look at the effect of all of those together, that's why interchange growth lags purchase volume growth. And I think that, while that will bounce around from quarter to quarter, and I think over the longer run those 2 metrics will converge, I think it still will be some time before they fully converge. And with respect to the alternative lenders, for example, small business lenders, look, we're very intrigued with some of these startup companies. I think that they have demonstrated a lot of innovation that -- from which I think we can learn a lot at Capital One. The way that they do their underwriting, obviously, the digital capabilities that they have. In a number of cases, they're using very sophisticated and interesting data analytics. The way that they do cash flow-based underwriting, the way that they sort of do the daily collections kind of things, there's a lot of very creative activities going on in that particular space. We're watching it carefully, and we'll continue to see and learn from the people that are leading in this space."

When you asked the question what is the canary in the coal mine with respect to this business, obviously, we look incredibly carefully at the metrics that begin on the origination side.

You also know that, in things like the subprime space, we have about more than 15, approaching 20 years experience in this particular space. So what I would say for it would be the same as I would say for any part of the card business. We watch very carefully for adverse selection, we monitor the metrics extremely closely, and we stay mobilized to move and also to let our investors know when things change relative to our own expectations. But all that said, we continue to see really, across the card business, a stability in the competitive environment, a stability in the origination environment, a stability in the consumer and their own behavior, and really a stability in the vintages of our originations."

One of the benefits of the upstream oil and gas business is the ability to do the borrowing base redetermination. So loan balances were down 6% from the prior quarter as a result of the spring borrowing base redetermination. And our E&P borrowers decreased their balances to conform to the lower commodity prices, and oilfield services companies reduced their balance sheets. So we've seen, particularly in the -- well, we've pretty much seen, across the energy business, a pretty darn quick reaction by reducing expenses, particularly capital expenditures, and taking advantage of the receptive capital markets. So all of that said, obviously, you don't have to look very far to notice what's happening in oil prices and the volatility and risks there. So the allowance builds that we have had for several quarters now have been significantly driven by energy as well as in the taxi business as well. But that one, we'll really have to monitor carefully. But we do like some of the inherent resilience dynamics that exist particularly in the upstream part of the business as they move quickly to adapt to the oil pricing pressure."

Digital is becoming so all-encompassing into how life works and how the business works, it's increasingly difficult to even, in a sense, technically answer your question. But the thing -- but we don't start with a thing that says,",842,"Well, thank you, Sameer. Digital is becoming so all-encompassing into how life works and how the business works, it's increasingly difficult to even, in a sense, technically answer your question. But the thing -- but we don't start with a thing that says, okay, we have x million dollars to spend on digital, and that is it. So what we do is, we start strategically with the environment and say, where is the world going and what does winning entail as the world goes there? And we work backwards and then develop a strategy, and we figure out where we need to go as a company. And along the way, you can imagine that digital is a centerpiece of that entire strategic agenda. And so everybody from the bottom up builds the economics of their business, working backwards from where they're trying to go as a business. And all of that adds up to our overall economics. We see if it makes sense, we drive incredibly hard to wring out costs that are not directly related to digital innovation and growth. I know you can't necessarily see those effects, but they are very significant, as are the digital investments on the other side. But I think that I'd just like to stop and reflect a little bit on what is it that we're investing in? Because I think a lot of banks say, and I've heard several of them say it, we're going to self-fund this digital investment. And so you tell me how much you can save, and that's how much we can invest. That is a really, really tough way to take any institution, I think, to where it needs to go because the marketplace isn't waiting for us to do that on those terms. But on the other hand, we're not just investing in science experiments or seeing what's a new and shiny object. When we talk about digital investment, it starts with talent. We're talking about bringing in top engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists, often from tech companies and startups outside of financial services. And this is a very important thing. And obviously, it costs money to do that, but that's a foundational thing. We're talking about providing the digital workspaces and the most modern tools for these folks. That's essential in terms of recruiting them and essential in terms of leveraging them. So often, I think banks, when they think about digital, they think I've got to go build apps, we've got to get customer-facing or associate-facing apps. Most of the leverage is really in infrastructure in terms of things like a rationalized and simplified core infrastructure. Increasingly, we're focusing on cloud computing and building the underlying capability such that product development will be faster and faster and more effective over time. We're obviously investing in terms of product development itself, and we're on an accelerating basis shipping product. And you can go to the App Store and take a look at some of this stuff. It's pretty highly rated. We're investing in cyber security. This is an incredibly important area, and we are putting a lot of very top talent and a lot of energy and investment into that. But the key thing is, this is not because we think this digital thing is cool and there's opportunity someday. These are delivering benefits right now on many fronts. While you can't necessarily see it in the numbers that you see, but the enhancements to productivity, the power of innovation, the dramatically growing customer experience have benefits, and it's inextricably linked to the growth that we are generating right now. So pulling way up from that, it doesn't really start with this is the number. It's really increasingly sort of who we are and how we think about the business. But the key to pulling way up, what we are so focused on is making sure that we can generate very strong returns for our shareholders and continue to invest in a future that has very strong returns for our shareholders over time. And right now, we see right in front of us 2 very, very big opportunities. One of them is card growth and the other one is this digital opportunity. Both of them involve spending money to make more money later. But at the end of the day, I go back to the thing that we focus on every single day. How can we create value for our shareholders today and ensure that we can create value for them tomorrow? And the way to do that is to generate well above hurdle rate returns; to make sure that our investments are very disciplined and driven by a net present value framework to the absolute most rigorous extent possible and be sure that we are really obsessive guardians of capital; and in the end, distributing capital to our shareholders. So that's a long answer to your question, but I'm glad you asked because increasingly, digital is who we are and it's where the leverage is."

For the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $1.98 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 14.3%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.99 per share. Net income was up $251 million versus the prior quarter, driven by higher linked quarter pre-provision earnings and slightly lower provision expense. Pre-provision earnings increased by $375 million versus the prior quarter as we had higher revenue and lower noninterest expenses. As a reminder, we had $188 million of nonrecurring operating expenses in the second quarter. Excluding nonrecurring expenses, operating expenses were relatively flat versus the prior year. 
Provision for credit losses decreased 3% on a linked quarter basis driven by a smaller allowance build. During the quarter, we added $69 million to our U.K. PPI reserve with $49 million of the contra revenue and $20 million in operating expense. We have included an appendix slide in our earnings presentation, available on our website, illustrating the impacts from nonrecurring items to key line items and ratios in both the quarter and year-to-date. 
The increase in our U.K. PPI reserve is driven by proposed new rules announced by the FCA in early October. As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve. Excluding the impact from the build in U.K. PPI reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $2.10 per share. 
Turning now to net interest margin is outlined on Slide 4, reported NIM increased 17 basis points in the third quarter to 6.73%, primarily driven by higher loan yields in Domestic Card and an additional data recognized revenue in the third quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of September 30, 2015. 
On Slide 5, you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on Basel III standardized basis was 12.1% as of September 30, 2015. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate the standardized ratio would be approximately 11.8%. This fully phased-in ratio is subject to change once we exit parallel run and we expect it to be lower. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 7.6 million shares primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1, 2015 and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target.
Let me now turn the call over to Rich."

I will begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Year-over-year ending loans and average loans were both up 12% and purchase volume was up about 19%.

Year-over-year ending loans and average loans were both up 12% and purchase volume was up about 19%. We continue to see attractive and resilient growth opportunities in the Domestic Card business. Revenue increased 10% year-over-year slightly lagging average loan growth. Revenue margin declined year-over-year and remained healthy at 17%. Year-over-year noninterest expenses increased 7% with higher marketing and growth related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. Credit continues to perform inline with our expectations in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. Two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth map, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies in charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. 
The second is seasonality. The third quarter has always been our seasonal low point. As a reminder, all has equal seasonality results in increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter rising the peak charge-off rates in the first quarter. This pattern has been particularly pronounced for the last couple of years and we expect that to continue. 
In the third quarter, the charge-off rate improved 34 basis points from the linked quarter to 3.08% driven by seasonality. Year-over-year, the charge-off rate increased 25 basis points primarily as the result of expected growth math impact. We still expect the quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high 3% range in the fourth quarter. 
And in 2016, we expect the full year charge-off rates to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates drove an allowance build in the quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward. 
Slide 8 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto loan growth is predominantly prime as subprime auto originations have been essentially flat for several quarters. As a result, the mix of our auto loans is shifting toward prawn. Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year, higher revenues from growth in auto loans was largely offset by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. 
Noninterest expense increased 5% year-over-year, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses was relatively flat compared to the prior year at $188 million. Auto originations increased about 3% year-over-year and from the linked quarter. We discussed increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. 
In the third quarter, we continued to see aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We continue to loose some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. We have also seen some softening in used vehicle values although they remain near historically high level. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers. 
Our Consumer Banking businesses face continuing headwinds, persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2016. 
Planned mortgage runoff continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the makeshift toward prime and continuing competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively effect revenues and efficiency ratio for the remainder of 2015 and in 2016. 
Moving to Slide 9, I will discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 5% year-over-year and 2% from the linked quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in CRE and C&I. Average loan balances were up 6% year-over-year. As we have been signaling, our growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we are making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in plain vanilla CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Revenues for the quarter were essentially flat compared to the prior year and down 5% from the linked quarter. Continuing spread compression drove the quarterly revenue trends. Year-to-date revenues are up 7% with 9% growth in average loans partially offset by the 22-basis-point decline in loan yields. 
Credit performance remains strong for the majority of our commercial businesses. The credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $66 million from the prior year to $75 million with higher charge-offs and allowance build. The charge-off rate of 26 basis points was up from both the prior year and the linked quarter driven by charge-offs of Taxi Medallion loans. We have built allowance over the last four quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. 
In the third quarter, nonperforming loans were up $292 million from the prior year to $453 million and the NPL rate was up 55 basis points to 0.87%. These trends resulted from downgrades of oil and gas loans and to a lesser extent downgrades of Taxi Medallion loans. On a linked quarter basis, NPL rates improved 3 basis points. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we have been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles about approximately $3.2 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans around half is in exploration and production. In this part of the business, loan structures provide some protection against the oil price cyclicality. Around the third of our energy loans are in oilfield services. We expect this part of the business will continue to present challenges and we have been building reserves to reflect that concern. 
Our Taxi Medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the phase of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, Taxi Medallion values continue to be under pressure and we continue to closely manage risk in this sector. Finally, in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business, which will add approximately $8.5 billion in loans to our existing healthcare specialty business. We're thrilled to welcome GE Healthcare's outstanding leadership and talented associates to Capital One. The acquisition cater polls us to a leading position in an industry with strong growth potential. 
We expect to complete the acquisition by the end of the fourth quarter. Capital One posted solid results in the third quarter highlighted once again by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We are delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today and investing to grow and sustain returns in the future. We continue to expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio will be around 55% excluding nonrecurring items. Our expectation for full year efficiency ratio implies a significant increase in fourth quarter noninterest expense and fourth quarter efficiency ratio: both efficiency ratio and NIE are subject to potentially significant quarter-to-quarter variability; both typically increase in the fourth quarter; and growth related operating and marketing cost will likely accentuate the fourth quarter increase this year. Given these 3 factors we're still estimating full year efficiency ratio will be around 55% even though the third quarter efficiency ratio is meaningfully lower. 
In July, we said that we didn't expect much improvement in full year 2016 efficiency ratio compared to full year 2015. Since we gave that guidance just 1 quarter ago, the outlook for interest rates has reduced 2016 forecasted revenues. However, we remain optimistic about our progress and the trajectory of the underlying operating drivers of efficiency ratio. We are managing cost tightly across our business. Our card growth will create positive operating leverage and while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in service act that these savings will grow and will help operating leverage overtime. 
As we move 3 months closer to 2016, we expect modest improvement in full year efficiency ratio in 2016, excluding nonrecurring items. Pulling up, Capital One is well-positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long-term with growth potential and sustained returns at the higher of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. 
And now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

And how the losses play out. If we just -- let's talk about that growth math for a bit. If you just looked at our back book, you would see exceptionally low and still improving credit loans. And that's because the back book is made up mostly of customers who whether the Great Recession. And it's also exceptionally seasoned as a result of low levels of originations over many years. So from the starting point of that back book, now almost any new business that we originate, of course, we'll have higher losses. And as a general rule of thumb losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years and then peak and gradually come down. So when we accelerate growth the majority of the loss affects are felt over the subsequent 2 years. And this is the dynamic we have been calling growth math and as we and things are continuing very much consistently with our own expectations with respect to have the credit is manifesting itself on the early vintages. And so what we have done as we get another quarter end of this and another quarter quick closure is to give you a bit of an extended window into the basically the same growth math phenomenon that we have been talking about for several quarters."

Moshe, my overall comment I would say about the competitive environment is that it's fairly consistent. It's pretty intensely competitive, but, overall, relatively consistent, again relative to some of the things that we see in some of the other banking businesses that we're in. But taking the different components of what we're seeing here, starting with balances just -- industry balances as you know, of course, have been relatively flat for quite a while. But now, industry-wide those are certainly moving up. So industry revolving debt held steady at about 1% for most of 2012 and '13. But -- since July of 2014, it's been over 3% growth and with over 4% growth in recent months. And bank card outstanding are up about 4% year-over-year. So the first factor that we see is that there is a return to just -- ambient levels of kind of balanced growth in the industry. Pricing has been stable in the segments that we play in. Competition continues to be very intense especially in rewards but generally stable. The 1 place that we would flag as where the partner -- the competition has really increased substantially and to it point of concern is in the partnership side. The bidding has become very intense in this auction-based market. And there have been some very aggressive deals which we have -- we're not going pay whatever it takes in that space. But that to me is the most striking kind of thing that is in motion. Specifically with respect to rewards competition -- one thing I want to say is well -- well it has some stability to it. It is intensely competitive and it has been that way for a lot of years. So I think the major players who are in it are very invested in it and sort of take years to build the brand and the market position to be able to fix it in that space. I see the players in that space being generally intense -- investing intensely relatively consistent with what we have seen in the past, but certainly that's very competitive."

Overlaid on top of that is another very important thing, which is the growth math of the acceleration that we have had in our business. And that actually picks up steam overtime. So for example, we had pointed to sort of in the second half of 2015 that you will start seeing the net affects of growth. In fact, growth very early on when you start to accelerate growth, the loss is actually in a sense have a movement in the other direction because you get a build of a denominator before the numerator picks up steam. But anyway, it's around this time the third quarter of this year that the growth math is starting to play an increasingly important role. That's why this is you are now starting to see year-over-year growth in our charge-off numbers. So the guidance for the full year, 2016, we don't give -- we're not giving quarterly guidance, but it will have seasonal effects and then the increasing growth math affects.

So all of this is the math of something going and after they -- so for example, as we get toward the later part of 2016 and into 2017, some of the early growth vintages will be starting to settle out.

Those would be the primary areas of focus, the partnerships -- in many ways we've not been the market clearing price on some of the recent partnership bids. And I think our actions and discipline kind of speak for itself. But with respect to asset businesses, we're really excited about the unique opportunities. It's very unusual thing to be able to in an acquisition at an attractive price get someone that is like the leading and just absolute amazing performers that somebody like GE Healthcare business is. So a lot of plan its aligned for us to get that. It is a byproduct as I've said -- we watch the marketplace and look for opportunities. But as you can see over the last number of years, we've done more looking then we have buying anything. But I think the GE business represents a very special opportunity that arises, but it is a very unique thing. I mean, I don't think I think it is you could probably measure in decades the number of times a business comes along with such a good business and market leading position that where that can be obtained at a reasonable price. So we're happy about that, but that's not an indication that we're moving in the big acquisition mode in the place."

And the biggest reason that we put so much focus on it if you look back in a historical context, we are at record levels in terms of where option prices are and they have sustained at record levels for a long period of time. And now there are arguments before that cards are lasting longer and they are a lot of things about that, but the thing that matters from an underwriting point of view is not how long a card last or it's value on the other end. It's what its value is relative to what you underwrite expecting it. So I just think in general there is a symmetrical risk in the auto finance industry if when option prices sustain as they have for a significant number of years at record levels. And -- probably although we underwrite to a decline in prices at some point I think there is just a risk that the industry gets a little to use to that. So that's in general what we have been flagging here. Now if you look at the demand index, it is you could go bowling on that flat index. Our own index that we see in the marketplace that measured a little bit differently actually has shown recent declines relative to that, but the main thing it's not so much what is happened. And now it's really not a seasonal point. The main thing is just when we see small effects happening, we just talk little bit louder to remind everyone that there is a symmetrical risk at the moment with respect to where auction prices are, but I have been saying that for several years and I just keep on being high but that's what I wanted to flag on that."

And it has been going on for a few years now, and it will continue although at some point that these numbers will converge. But the difference between the purchase volume, the GPCC purchase volume versus the interchange growth rates. And it isn't just I mean, yes, so we are out with attractive rewards proposition you can see them advertised on television, for example, that is a factor. We are also upgrading rewards products for existing rewards customers. We're also extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And a higher mix of kind of all the originations that happened out there in the marketplace now have rewards than they had before. So and really this phenomenon every players I think is seeing the same phenomenon. There are differences in degrees depending on strategies and how they are -- especially the choices people make on do you want to go into your existing portfolio how much are you going to take some cannibalization impact or not. But this I think the main point is we're still having solid growth interchange. It's well-below purchase volume. That effect will continue over time, but in the longer run these things will converge. In the meantime, we feel really good about the economics reward products. I meant in the choices that we're making in the customers that we're originating, Steve, did you want anything to that?"

And we talked all about running off high balance revolvers. We kind of stopped talking all the time about that, but that's a phenomenon. So we have -- had an exceptionally seasoned book and then now as we're sort of on the leading side of the industry with respect to our growth then you're also going to see our metrics will move in ways that will diverge from competitors in striking ways.

For the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $1.98 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 14.3%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.99 per share. Net income was up $251 million versus the pri",406,"Thanks, Jeff. For the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $1.98 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 14.3%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.99 per share. Net income was up $251 million versus the prior quarter, driven by higher linked quarter pre-provision earnings and slightly lower provision expense.
Pre-provision earnings increased by $375 million versus the prior quarter as we had higher revenue and lower non-interest expenses. As a reminder, we had $188 million of non-recurring operating expenses in the second quarter. Excluding non-recurring expenses, operating expenses were relatively flat versus the prior year. Provision for credit losses decreased 3% on a linked quarter basis, driven by a smaller allowance build.
During the quarter, we added $69 million to our U.K. PPI reserve, with $49 million as a contra revenue and $20 million in operating expense. We have included an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website, illustrating the impacts from non-recurring items to key line items and ratios in both the quarter and year-to-date. 
The increase in our U.K. PPI reserve is driven by proposed new rules announced by the FCA in early October. As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve. Excluding the impact from the build in U.K. PPI reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $2.10 per share. 
Turning now to net interest margin that's outlined on Slide 4. Reported NIM increased 17 basis points in the third quarter to 6.73%, primarily driven by higher loan yields in Domestic Card and an additional day to recognize revenue in the third quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of September 30, 2015. 
On Slide 5, you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.1% as of September 30, 2015. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this standardized ratio would be approximately 11.8%. This fully phased-in ratio is subject to change once we exit parallel run, and we expect it to be lower.
We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 7.6 million shares, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1, 2015, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target.
Let me now turn the call over to Rich."

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Year-over-year ending loans and average loans were both up 12% and purchase volume was up about 19%. We continue to see attractive and resilient",1423,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Year-over-year ending loans and average loans were both up 12% and purchase volume was up about 19%. We continue to see attractive and resilient growth opportunities in the Domestic Card business.
Revenue increased 10% year-over-year, slightly lagging average loan growth. Revenue margin declined year-over-year and remained healthy at 17%. Year-over-year non-interest expenses increased 7% with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. Two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies in charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. 
The second is seasonality. The third quarter has always been our seasonal low point. As a reminder, all else equal, seasonality results in increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter rising the peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. This pattern has been particularly pronounced for the last couple of years, and we expect that to continue. 
In the third quarter, the charge-off rate improved 34 basis points from the linked quarter to 3.08% driven by seasonality. Year-over-year, the charge-off rate increased 25 basis points primarily as the result of expected growth math impact. We still expect the quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high 3% range in the fourth quarter. 
And in 2016, we expect the full year charge-off rates to be around 4%, with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates drove an allowance build in the quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward. 
Slide 8 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto loan growth is predominantly prime as subprime auto originations have been essentially flat for several quarters. As a result, the mix of our auto loans is shifting toward prime.
Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Higher revenues from growth in auto loans was largely offset by the impacts of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. 
Non-interest expense increased 5% year-over-year, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses was relatively flat compared to the prior year at $188 million. Auto originations increased about 3% year-over-year and from the linked quarter. We discussed the increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. 
In the third quarter, we continued to see aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We continue to lose some contracts to competitors, who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. We've also seen some softening in used vehicle values, although they remain near historically high levels. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers. 
Our Consumer Banking businesses face continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2016. 
Planned mortgage runoff continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and continuing competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively effect revenues and efficiency ratio for the remainder of 2015 and in 2016. 
Moving to Slide 9, I will discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 5% year-over-year and 2% from the linked quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in CRE and C&I. Average loan balances were up 6% year-over-year.
As we've been signaling, our growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in plain vanilla CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals.
Revenues for the quarter were essentially flat compared to the prior year and down 5% from the linked quarter. Continuing spread compression drove the quarterly revenue trends. Year-to-date revenues are up 7% with 9% growth in average loans partially offset by the 22 basis point decline in loan yields. 
Credit performance remains strong for the majority of our commercial businesses, but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $66 million from the prior year to $75 million with higher charge-offs and allowance build. The charge-off rate of 26 basis points was up from both the prior year and the linked quarter driven by charge-offs of Taxi Medallion loans. We've built allowance over the last four quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. 
In the third quarter, non-performing loans were up $292 million from the prior year to $453 million, and the NPL rate was up 55 basis points to 0.87%. These trends resulted from downgrades of oil and gas loans and to a lesser extent downgrades of Taxi Medallion loans. On a linked quarter basis, NPL rates improved 3 basis points.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. About approximately $3.2 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production. In this part of the business, loan structures provide some protection against the oil price cyclicality. Around 1/3 of our energy loans are in oilfield services. We expect this part of the business will continue to present challenges, and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. 
Our Taxi Medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, Taxi Medallion values continue to be under pressure, and we continue to closely manage risk in this sector.
Finally, in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of the GE Healthcare Finance business, which will add approximately $8.5 billion in loans to our existing health care specialty business. We're thrilled to welcome GE Healthcare's outstanding leadership and talented associates to Capital One. The acquisition catapults us to a leading position in an industry with strong growth potential. We expect to complete the acquisition by the end of the fourth quarter.
Capital One posted solid results in the third quarter, highlighted once again by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today and investing to grow and sustain returns in the future. We continue to expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio will be around 55% excluding non-recurring items. Our expectation for full year efficiency ratio implies a significant increase in fourth quarter non-interest expense and fourth quarter efficiency ratio. Both efficiency ratio and NIE are subject to potentially significant quarter-to-quarter variability; both typically increase in the fourth quarter. And growth-related operating and marketing costs will likely accentuate the fourth quarter increase this year. Given these 3 factors, we're still estimating full year efficiency ratio will be around 55% even though the third quarter efficiency ratio is meaningfully lower. 
In July, we said that we didn't expect much improvement in full year 2016 efficiency ratio compared to full year 2015. Since we gave that guidance just one quarter ago, the outlook for interest rates has reduced 2016 forecasted revenues. However, we remain optimistic about our progress and the trajectory of the underlying operating drivers of efficiency ratio.
 We are managing cost tightly across our business. Our card growth will create positive operating leverage. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing core infrastructure and our legacy operations. We expect that these savings will grow and will help operating leverage over time. As we move 3 months closer to 2016, we expect modest improvement in full year efficiency ratio in 2016, excluding non-recurring items.
Pulling up, Capital One is well-positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long term, with growth potential and sustained returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval. 
And now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

We noted, Betsy, of course, that we were predicting a volatile number 15 months in advance. We also said the investments that will pressure our efficiency ratio would over time contribute to positive operating leverage. And most notably, of course, those are our investment in card growth and our digital investment. We're now 3 months closer, which helps reduce uncertainty somewhat, and we have 3 more months of card revenue growth baking in the oven. We also continue to drive hard for cost savings, and we've seen some solid tangible evidence of cost savings arising from our digital investments. And we know these savings will increase over time. And we have identified more contingent cost levers to manage some of the revenue uncertainty. And while we are, of course, still 1.25 years away from the end of 2016, we have enough confidence to say that we expect modest improvement in full year efficiency ratio in 2016 excluding non-recurring items."

Maybe you could just tease that out a little bit."

If we just -- let's talk about that growth math for a bit. If you just looked at our back book, you'd see exceptionally low and still improving credit loss. And that's because the back book is made up mostly of customers who weathered the Great Recession. And it's also exceptionally seasoned as a result of low levels of originations over many years. So from the starting point of that back book, now almost any new business that we originate, of course, we'll have higher losses. And as a general rule of thumb, losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years and then peak and gradually come down. So when we accelerate growth, the majority of the loss effects are felt over the subsequent 2 years. And this is the dynamic we've been calling growth math. And as we -- and things are continuing very much consistently with our own expectations with respect to how the credit is manifesting itself on the early vintages. And so what we have done as we get another quarter into this and another quarter closer is to give you a bit of an extended window into the basically the same growth math phenomenon that we've been talking about for several quarters."

Moshe, my overall comment I would say about the competitive environment is that it's fairly consistent. It's pretty intensely competitive but overall, relatively consistent, again relative to some of the things that we see in some of the other banking businesses that we're in. But taking the different components of what we're seeing here, starting with balances just -- industry balances as you know, Moshe, of course, had been relatively flat for quite a while. But now, industry-wide, those are certainly moving up. So industry revolving debt held steady at about 1% for most of 2012 and '13. But -- since July of 2014, it's been over 3% growth and over 4% growth in recent months. And bank card outstandings are up about 4% year-over-year. So the first factor that we see is that there is a return to just -- ambient levels of kind of balance growth in the industry. Pricing has been stable in the segments that we play in. Competition continues to be very intense especially in rewards but generally stable. The one place that we would flag as where the partner -- the competition has really increased substantially and to a point of concern is in the partnership side. The bidding has become very intense in this auction-based market. And there have been some very aggressive deals which we have -- we're not going pay whatever it takes in that space. But that to me is the most striking kind of thing that is in motion. Specifically with respect to rewards competition, one thing I want to say is while it has some stability to it, it is intensely competitive, and it has been that way for a lot of years. So I think the major players who are in it are very invested in it and it sort of take years to build the brand and the market position to be able to succeed in that space. I see the players in that space being generally intense -- investing intensely, relatively consistent with what we've seen in the past, but certainly that's very competitive."

There's 2 different effects going on. One is the seasonal effect. And if you allow yourself to just say if everything else were equal, here are the seasonal patterns, and I described those in the -- several minutes ago. And that has the characteristic of peaking as you described. Overlaid on top of that is another very important thing, which is the growth math of the acceleration that we have had in our business. And that actually picks up steam over time. So for example, we had pointed to sort of in the second half of 2015 that you will start seeing the net effects of growth. In fact, growth, very early on when you start to accelerate growth, the loss is actually in essence have a movement in the other direction because you get a build of a denominator before the numerator picks up steam. But anyway, it's around this time the third quarter of this year that the growth math is starting to play an increasingly important role. That's why this is -- you're now starting to see year-over-year growth in our charge-off numbers. So the guidance for the full year 2016, we don't give -- we're not giving quarterly guidance, but it will have seasonal effects and then the increasing growth math affects. And they will combined in our view to generate a full year average loss rate of around 4%."

But I think that the main point that I wanted to make is just the way growth math works, it's in the first 2 years after for any vintage of growth where the losses are climbing, and then they settle out and actually ultimately go down in any one sort of vintage of growth. So all of this is the math of something is going and after they -- so for example, as we get toward the latter part of 2016 and into 2017, some of the early growth vintages will be starting to settle out. And you'll still have the effects, of course, of some of the more recent growth that we hope happens over the course of next year, for example. But I think that keeping in mind this general effect of what happens over the 2-year period following a surge in growth and then understanding it's the blend of all the different vintages and the timing of that, I think that's pretty much how we would guide you at this point. Obviously, collectively, things eventually stabilize and just the math of when accelerated growth happens for a period of time and settles out."

And the biggest reason that we put so much focus on it, if you look back in a historical context, we are at record levels in terms of where auction prices are, and they have sustained at record levels for a long period of time. And now there are arguments for that. Cars are lasting longer, and they're -- a lot of things about that, but the thing that matters from an underwriting point of view is not how long a car lasts or its value on the other end. It's what its value is relative to what you underwrite, wrote [ph] it, expecting it. So I just think, in general, there's a symmetrical risk in the auto finance industry when auction prices sustain as they have for a significant number of years at record levels. And probably although we underwrite to a decline in prices, at some point, I think there's just a risk that the industry gets a little too used to that. So that's, in general, what we have been flagging here. Now if you look at the Manheim index, it is -- you could go bowling on that flat index. Our own index that we see in the marketplace that measured a little bit differently actually has shown recent declines relative to that, but the main thing is not so much what has happened. And no, it's really not a seasonal point. The main thing is just when we see small effects happening, we just talk little bit louder to remind everyone that there's a symmetrical risk at the moment with respect to where auction prices are. But I have been saying that for several years, and they just keep on being high. But that's what I wanted to flag on that."

And it has been going on for a few years now, and it will continue although at some point, these numbers will converge but the difference between the purchase volume -- the GPCC purchase volume versus the interchange growth rates. And it isn't just -- I mean, yes, so we are out with attractive rewards proposition. You can see them advertised on television, for example. That is a factor. We are also upgrading rewards products for existing rewards customers. We're also extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And a higher mix of kind of all the originations that happened out there in the marketplace now have rewards than they had before. So -- and really, this phenomenon -- every player, I think, is seeing the same phenomenon. There are differences in degrees, depending on strategies and how they're -- especially the choices people make on do you want to go into your existing portfolio, how much are you going to take some cannibalization impact or not. But this -- I think the main point is we're still having solid growth in interchange. It's well below purchase volume.

I guess, I was just trying to build off of the thought process that you guys described so well surrounding the growth math and just the idea that you have peak losses somewhere around 18 to 30 months. So if we just draw a line in the sand, that looks, say, 36 months, that anything older than that is past peak losses and you have declining charge-off rates relating to anything that's older than 36 months. And anything younger than that is experiencing arguably rising charge-offs and then -- so to the extent that you guys kind of stop growing post the great recession and more of your book was comprised of the back book, that was a larger percentage of your book. But now as you've been growing and kind of stepping on the gas, some of the newer vintages are representing a greater proportion of your overall book and, therefore, that's creating some of the growth math headwind. And so I was just looking for a little bit of color around that -- the interplay of those moving parts. But if you can't share that, I'd love to either -- if you have some more color you can share on that, that'd be great. Otherwise, I have a follow-up I'd like to ask."

And so if you have specific questions, we'll try to answer them. But I think that if you look at Capital One right now, we're in kind of a striking position if you look at our metrics relative to a number of players. First of all, you may remember that in the period preceding this, Capital One was actually near the bottom of the league tables in terms of growth. And we talked all about running off high balance revolvers. We kind of stopped talking all the time about that, but that's a phenomenon. So we have had an exceptionally seasoned book. And then now as we're sort of on the leading side of the industry with respect to our growth, then you're also going to see our metrics will move in ways that will diverge from competitors in striking ways. And that's why it's really important that we all communicate as clearly as we can about growth math and separating what's the difference between just natural maturation of businesses and customers behaving exactly as we expect versus changes in underlying credit performance or things like that. So at this time, we're -- we are diverging from certainly some of the other players with respect to our credit performance. I, again, want to reiterate that things are coming in very consistent with our own expectations both on the front book and on the back book."

For the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $1.98 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 14.3%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.99 per share.

For the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $1.98 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 14.3%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.99 per share. Net income was up $251 million versus the prior quarter, driven by higher linked quarter pre-provision earnings and slightly lower provision expense.
Pre-provision earnings increased by $375 million versus the prior quarter as we had higher revenue and lower non-interest expenses. As a reminder, we had $188 million of non-recurring operating expenses in the second quarter. Excluding non-recurring expenses, operating expenses were relatively flat versus the prior year. Provision for credit losses decreased 3% on a linked quarter basis, driven by a smaller allowance build.
During the quarter, we added $69 million to our U.K. PPI reserve, with $49 million as a contra revenue and $20 million in operating expense. We have included an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website, illustrating the impacts from non-recurring items to key line items and ratios in both the quarter and year-to-date. 
The increase in our U.K. PPI reserve is driven by proposed new rules announced by the FCA in early October. As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve. Excluding the impact from the build in U.K. PPI reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $2.10 per share. 
Turning now to net interest margin that's outlined on Slide 4. Reported NIM increased 17 basis points in the third quarter to 6.73%, primarily driven by higher loan yields in Domestic Card and an additional day to recognize revenue in the third quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased-in LCR requirements as of September 30, 2015. 
On Slide 5, you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.1% as of September 30, 2015. On a fully phased-in basis, we estimate this standardized ratio would be approximately 11.8%. This fully phased-in ratio is subject to change once we exit parallel run, and we expect it to be lower.
We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 7.6 million shares, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches on January 1, 2015, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target.
Let me now turn the call over to Rich."

I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Year-over-year ending loans and average loans were both up 12% and purchase volume was up about 19%. We continue to see attractive and resilient",1423,"Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Year-over-year ending loans and average loans were both up 12% and purchase volume was up about 19%. We continue to see attractive and resilient growth opportunities in the Domestic Card business.
Revenue increased 10% year-over-year, slightly lagging average loan growth. Revenue margin declined year-over-year and remained healthy at 17%. Year-over-year non-interest expenses increased 7% with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. Two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies in charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. 
The second is seasonality. The third quarter has always been our seasonal low point. As a reminder, all else equal, seasonality results in increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter rising the peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. This pattern has been particularly pronounced for the last couple of years, and we expect that to continue. 
In the third quarter, the charge-off rate improved 34 basis points from the linked quarter to 3.08% driven by seasonality. Year-over-year, the charge-off rate increased 25 basis points primarily as the result of expected growth math impact. We still expect the quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high 3% range in the fourth quarter. 
And in 2016, we expect the full year charge-off rates to be around 4%, with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates drove an allowance build in the quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward. 
Slide 8 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto loan growth is predominantly prime as subprime auto originations have been essentially flat for several quarters. As a result, the mix of our auto loans is shifting toward prime.
Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Higher revenues from growth in auto loans was largely offset by the impacts of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. 
Non-interest expense increased 5% year-over-year, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses was relatively flat compared to the prior year at $188 million. Auto originations increased about 3% year-over-year and from the linked quarter. We discussed the increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. 
In the third quarter, we continued to see aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We continue to lose some contracts to competitors, who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. We've also seen some softening in used vehicle values, although they remain near historically high levels. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers. 
Our Consumer Banking businesses face continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2016. 
Planned mortgage runoff continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and continuing competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio for the remainder of 2015 and in 2016. 
Moving to Slide 9, I will discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 5% year-over-year and 2% from the linked quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in CRE and C&I. Average loan balances were up 6% year-over-year.
As we've been signaling, our growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in plain vanilla CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals.
Revenues for the quarter were essentially flat compared to the prior year and down 5% from the linked quarter. Continuing spread compression drove the quarterly revenue trends. Year-to-date revenues are up 7% with 9% growth in average loans partially offset by the 22 basis point decline in loan yields. 
Credit performance remains strong for the majority of our commercial businesses, but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $66 million from the prior year to $75 million with higher charge-offs and allowance build. The charge-off rate of 26 basis points was up from both the prior year and the linked quarter driven by charge-offs of Taxi Medallion loans. We've built allowance over the last four quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. 
In the third quarter, non-performing loans were up $292 million from the prior year to $453 million, and the NPL rate was up 55 basis points to 0.87%. These trends resulted from downgrades of oil and gas loans and to a lesser extent downgrades of Taxi Medallion loans. On a linked quarter basis, NPL rates improved 3 basis points.
We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. About approximately $3.2 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production. In this part of the business, loan structures provide some protection against the oil price cyclicality. Around 1/3 of our energy loans are in oilfield services. We expect this part of the business will continue to present challenges, and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. 
Our Taxi Medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, Taxi Medallion values continue to be under pressure, and we continue to closely manage risk in this sector.
Finally, in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of the GE Healthcare Finance business, which will add approximately $8.5 billion in loans to our existing health care specialty business. We're thrilled to welcome GE Healthcare's outstanding leadership and talented associates to Capital One. The acquisition catapults us to a leading position in an industry with strong growth potential. We expect to complete the acquisition by the end of the fourth quarter.
Capital One posted solid results in the third quarter, highlighted once again by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We're delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today and investing to grow and sustain returns in the future. We continue to expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio will be around 55% excluding non-recurring items. Our expectation for full year efficiency ratio implies a significant increase in fourth quarter non-interest expense and fourth quarter efficiency ratio. Both efficiency ratio and NIE are subject to potentially significant quarter-to-quarter variability; both typically increase in the fourth quarter. And growth-related operating and marketing costs will likely accentuate the fourth quarter increase this year. Given these 3 factors, we're still estimating full year efficiency ratio will be around 55% even though the third quarter efficiency ratio is meaningfully lower. 
In July, we said that we didn't expect much improvement in full year 2016 efficiency ratio compared to full year 2015. Since we gave that guidance just one quarter ago, the outlook for interest rates has reduced 2016 forecasted revenues. However, we remain optimistic about our progress and the trajectory of the underlying operating drivers of efficiency ratio.
 We are managing cost tightly across our business. Our card growth will create positive operating leverage. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing core infrastructure and our legacy operations. We expect that these savings will grow and will help operating leverage over time. As we move 3 months closer to 2016, we expect modest improvement in full year efficiency ratio in 2016, excluding non-recurring items.
Pulling up, Capital One is well-positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long term, with growth potential and sustained returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval. 
And now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

If we just -- let's talk about that growth math for a bit. If you just looked at our back book, you'd see exceptionally low and still improving credit loss. And that's because the back book is made up mostly of customers who weathered the Great Recession. And it's also exceptionally seasoned as a result of low levels of originations over many years. So from the starting point of that back book, now almost any new business that we originate, of course, we'll have higher losses. And as a general rule of thumb, losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years and then peak and gradually come down. So when we accelerate growth, the majority of the loss effects are felt over the subsequent 2 years. And this is the dynamic we've been calling growth math. And as we -- and things are continuing very much consistently with our own expectations with respect to how the credit is manifesting itself on the early vintages. And so what we have done as we get another quarter into this and another quarter closer is to give you a bit of an extended window into the basically the same growth math phenomenon that we've been talking about for several quarters."

Moshe, my overall comment I would say about the competitive environment is that it's fairly consistent. It's pretty intensely competitive but overall, relatively consistent, again relative to some of the things that we see in some of the other banking businesses that we're in. But taking the different components of what we're seeing here, starting with balances just -- industry balances as you know, Moshe, of course, had been relatively flat for quite a while. But now, industry-wide, those are certainly moving up. So industry revolving debt held steady at about 1% for most of 2012 and '13. But -- since July of 2014, it's been over 3% growth and over 4% growth in recent months. And bank card outstandings are up about 4% year-over-year. So the first factor that we see is that there is a return to just -- ambient levels of kind of balance growth in the industry. Pricing has been stable in the segments that we play in. Competition continues to be very intense especially in rewards but generally stable. The one place that we would flag as where the partner -- the competition has really increased substantially and to a point of concern is in the partnership side. The bidding has become very intense in this auction-based market. And there have been some very aggressive deals which we have -- we're not going pay whatever it takes in that space. But that to me is the most striking kind of thing that is in motion. Specifically with respect to rewards competition, one thing I want to say is while it has some stability to it, it is intensely competitive, and it has been that way for a lot of years. So I think the major players who are in it are very invested in it and it sort of take years to build the brand and the market position to be able to succeed in that space. I see the players in that space being generally intense -- investing intensely, relatively consistent with what we've seen in the past, but certainly that's very competitive."

And that has the characteristic of peaking as you described. Overlaid on top of that is another very important thing, which is the growth math of the acceleration that we have had in our business. And that actually picks up steam over time. So for example, we had pointed to sort of in the second half of 2015 that you will start seeing the net effects of growth. In fact, growth, very early on when you start to accelerate growth, the loss is actually in a sense have a movement in the other direction because you get a build of a denominator before the numerator picks up steam. But anyway, it's around this time the third quarter of this year that the growth math is starting to play an increasingly important role. That's why this is -- you're now starting to see year-over-year growth in our charge-off numbers. So the guidance for the full year 2016, we don't give -- we're not giving quarterly guidance, but it will have seasonal effects and then the increasing growth math affects.

But I think that the main point that I wanted to make is just the way growth math works, it's in the first 2 years after for any vintage of growth where the losses are climbing, and then they settle out and actually ultimately go down in any one sort of vintage of growth. So all of this is the math of something is going and after they -- so for example, as we get toward the latter part of 2016 and into 2017, some of the early growth vintages will be starting to settle out. And you'll still have the effects, of course, of some of the more recent growth that we hope happens over the course of next year, for example. But I think that keeping in mind this general effect of what happens over the 2-year period following a surge in growth and then understanding it's the blend of all the different vintages and the timing of that, I think that's pretty much how we would guide you at this point.

And the biggest reason that we put so much focus on it, if you look back in a historical context, we are at record levels in terms of where auction prices are, and they have sustained at record levels for a long period of time.

It's what its value is relative to what you underwrite, wrote [ph] it, expecting it. So I just think, in general, there's a symmetrical risk in the auto finance industry when auction prices sustain as they have for a significant number of years at record levels. And probably although we underwrite to a decline in prices, at some point, I think there's just a risk that the industry gets a little too used to that. So that's, in general, what we have been flagging here. Now if you look at the Manheim index, it is -- you could go bowling on that flat index. Our own index that we see in the marketplace that measured a little bit differently actually has shown recent declines relative to that, but the main thing is not so much what has happened. And no, it's really not a seasonal point. The main thing is just when we see small effects happening, we just talk little bit louder to remind everyone that there's a symmetrical risk at the moment with respect to where auction prices are. But I have been saying that for several years, and they just keep on being high. But that's what I wanted to flag on that."

The line -- I focus on last quarter net interchange revenue growth at only 6% last quarter, again, this quarter, 6% relatively flat. Steve, I thought you indicated last quarter that, that can bounce around and there's looks  like a natural growth rate of interchange. When you're growing volume at 19%, they'll be a little higher than that. So are there any onetime items that are weighing interchange growth? Or is it just simply a function of all the high rewards costs products that you're having success with in the marketplace?"

Interchange revenue for Capital One has been -- has grown at 8%, for example. The -- but just -- I want to get a little bit behind why there is this disconnect. And it has been going on for a few years now, and it will continue although at some point, these numbers will converge but the difference between the purchase volume -- the GPCC purchase volume versus the interchange growth rates. And it isn't just -- I mean, yes, so we are out with attractive rewards proposition. You can see them advertised on television, for example. That is a factor. We are also upgrading rewards products for existing rewards customers. We're also extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And a higher mix of kind of all the originations that happened out there in the marketplace now have rewards than they had before. So -- and really, this phenomenon -- every player, I think, is seeing the same phenomenon. There are differences in degrees, depending on strategies and how they're -- especially the choices people make on do you want to go into your existing portfolio, how much are you going to take some cannibalization impact or not. But this -- I think the main point is we're still having solid growth in interchange. It's well below purchase volume. That effect will continue over time, but in the longer run, these things will converge. In the meantime, we feel really good about the economics of reward products. I mean, and the choices that we're making and the customers that we're originating. Steve, did you want to add anything to that?"

It is a general descriptive method that we use to say that the metrics that you're seeing on our portfolio are driven way disproportionately by the changes at the margin in -- especially in originations, but also in terms of things like line increases as well. So that it is -- the effects are so dramatic, particularly on a highly seasoned portfolio with just incredibly low losses like we have here.

I guess, I was just trying to build off of the thought process that you guys described so well surrounding the growth math and just the idea that you have peak losses somewhere around 18 to 30 months. So if we just draw a line in the sand, that looks, say, 36 months, that anything older than that is past peak losses and you have declining charge-off rates relating to anything that's older than 36 months. And anything younger than that is experiencing arguably rising charge-offs and then -- so to the extent that you guys kind of stop growing post the great recession and more of your book was comprised of the back book, that was a larger percentage of your book. But now as you've been growing and kind of stepping on the gas, some of the newer vintages are representing a greater proportion of your overall book and, therefore, that's creating some of the growth math headwind. And so I was just looking for a little bit of color around that -- the interplay of those moving parts. But if you can't share that, I'd love to either -- if you have some more color you can share on that, that'd be great. Otherwise, I have a follow-up I'd like to ask."

And so if you have specific questions, we'll try to answer them. But I think that if you look at Capital One right now, we're in kind of a striking position if you look at our metrics relative to a number of players. First of all, you may remember that in the period preceding this, Capital One was actually near the bottom of the league tables in terms of growth. And we talked all about running off high balance revolvers. We kind of stopped talking all the time about that, but that's a phenomenon. So we have had an exceptionally seasoned book. And then now as we're sort of on the leading side of the industry with respect to our growth, then you're also going to see our metrics will move in ways that will diverge from competitors in striking ways. And that's why it's really important that we all communicate as clearly as we can about growth math and separating what's the difference between just natural maturation of businesses and customers behaving exactly as we expect versus changes in underlying credit performance or things like that. So at this time, we're -- we are diverging from certainly some of the other players with respect to our credit performance. I, again, want to reiterate that things are coming in very consistent with our own expectations both on the front book and on the back book."
