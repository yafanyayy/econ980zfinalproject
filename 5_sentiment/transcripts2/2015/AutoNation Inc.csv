Thank you for joining us. Today, we reported an all-time record quarterly earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.02 for the fourth quarter, a 23% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.83 for the same period in the prior year. 
This is our 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in quarterly EPS from continuing operations. 
For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.49 was also an all-time record, up 17% over prior year. 
Fourth quarter 2014 revenue totaled $5 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by stronger performance in all our major business sectors. 
We also reported an increase of 12% in operating income to $227 million. 
Revenue for the full year was $19.1 billion, up 9% over the prior year. Operating income for the full year was $821 million, an increase of 11% over prior year. 
During 2014, AutoNation repurchased 9.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $485 million. As of February 2, 2015, AutoNation has approximately 113 million shares outstanding. 
Our planning assumption for 2015 industry new vehicle unit sales is above 17 million for the year. We believe that replacement demand, attractive products and great consumer credit will continue to support sales. 
2015, we will continue to invest in our digital storefront called AutoNation Express. We successfully began our launch in December 2014, and we'll continue to roll out AutoNation Express from coast-to-coast. 
I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Scully."

For the fourth quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $117 million or $1.02 per share versus adjusted net income of $102 million or $0.83 per share during the fourth quarter of 2013, a 23% improvement on a per-share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjustments in net income in prior periods are included in the reconciliation provided in our press release. 
In the fourth quarter, revenue increased $524 million or 12% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $80 million or 11%. 
SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 67.9% for the quarter, which represents a 70 basis-point decrease compared to the year-ago period. 
In addition to solid cost control, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit benefited from seasonally strong Premium Luxury vehicle sales, which supports new vehicle gross profit dollars, as well as our expense leverage. 
Net new vehicle floor plans was a benefit of $15.2 million, an increase of $3.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance. 
Floorplan assistance increased, primarily due to higher new vehicle sales. Floorplan debt increased sequentially, approximately $323 million during the fourth quarter to $3.1 billion at quarter end due to increased inventory balances. 
In December, we amended our unsecured credit agreement by extending our maturity 3 years, lowering our borrowing costs by 25 basis points, increasing our revolving credit facility to $1.8 billion and eliminating the term loan. 
In the amended facility, the maximum leverage ratio remains at 3.75x and the maximum capitalization ratio increased from 65% to 70%. 
We continue to secure financing at favorable terms due to our strong operational results, in addition to our investment-grade debt profile, disciplined financial management and robust cash flow generation. 
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $22.1 million compared to $21.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher debt balances. 
At the end of December, we had $1.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and a total non-vehicle debt balance of $2.1 billion. This was an increase of $195 million compared to September 30, 2014.  The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71.6 million or 38%. 
From October 1, 2014 through February 2, 2015, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $69 million at an average price of $49.35 per share. AutoNation has approximately $281 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. 
As of February 2, there are approximately 113 million shares outstanding and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. 
Our leverage ratio increased to 2.3x at the end of Q4 compared to 2.2x at the end of Q3. The leverage ratio was 2.2x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $52 million for the quarter and $192 million for the full year 2014. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis and exclude operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $75 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $770 million at the end of December. 
In 2014, we continue to demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business. During the year, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $485 million and announced acquisition and ad points with $550 million in expected future annual revenues. 
Looking forward, we remain committed to driving shareholder returns through strong operational execution, as well as investment in strategic initiatives, acquisitions and share repurchase. 
Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."

We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter performance, where we delivered revenue and gross profit growth across the business, an exceptional 4.5% operating margin, an all-time record quarterly and annual EPS and the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
As I continue, my comments will be in a same-store basis compared to the period a year ago. 
Starting with sales. Total gross profit for variable operations was up 10%. On a per vehicle basis, total variable gross was $3450 per vehicle, an increase of $71 or 2%, driven by solid contributions from used vehicles and customer financial services.  Combined, new and used same-store unit volume was up 8%. 
In the quarter, we've retailed 80,800 new vehicles, an increase of 6,700 units or 9%, generating new vehicle revenue of $2.9 billion, up $277 million or 11%. 
New vehicle gross profit of $179 million grew by $10 million or 6%. Gross profit per new vehicle retails at $2220 was off $67 or 3% compared to a year ago, attributable in part to continued pressure in the Import segment, as well as the introduction of several new Premium Luxury models in the quarter a year ago that commanded higher margins at launch. 
Sequentially, compared to Q3, 2014, gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $344 due to the seasonal lift in Premium Luxury, an achievement of several manufacturer year-end volume-based incentives, which were higher in the quarter than anticipated. 
Looking ahead, we expect gross profit per new vehicle retail to return to normalized levels, in sync with typical seasonality subject to market conditions. 
Year-end, our new vehicle inventory was 54 days compared to 62 days a year ago. 
Turning to used vehicles. We had another solid performance in the quarter at $984 million, retail used vehicle revenue increased $75 million or 8% on sale of 52,500 used vehicles, an increase of 3,500 units or 7%. 
Retail used vehicle gross profit of $88 million was up $11 million or 14% and gross profit per used vehicle retail was $1,679, an increase of $97 or 6%. 
We are focused on maximizing the used inventory, as well as pricing our used vehicles to market. We continue to see opportunity in used due to the increasing supply of used vehicles, both from new vehicle trades and off-lease and feel we are well-positioned looking forward. 
At December 31, our used base supply was 38 days compared to 35 a year ago, aligning with our intent to build inventory for Q1. 
Rounding up the variable side of the business is customer financial services, where in the quarter, we achieved a record gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,444, an increase of $71 or 5%. 
Total gross profit for CFS of $193 million was up $24 million or 14% compared to the period a year ago. 
We continue to be extremely pleased with our performance here and remain focused on the overall customer experience, continuous improvement and store level of execution and growing long-term customer retention through value-added product offerings. 
Next, customer care, which encompasses our service parts and collision business. In the quarter, customer care revenue of $713 million increased by impressive 10% or $65 million and customer care gross profit of $298 million grew 8% or $23 million. 
Expanding on gross, warranty gross increased 24%, supported by continued strong retail activity, which represented just over 5% of our total customer care gross. 
Customer pay gross were 3% in the quarter and accounted for nearly 40% of the total customer care gross. 
This also marked our 18th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross as we continue to focus on growing our customer pay business while ensuring we address recalls for our customers. 
And finally, collision gross was up 11% in the quarter. 
I'll note that looking ahead, we maintain our outlook that customer care gross comps will be in the mid-single-digit range as we previously discussed asset elevated recall activity. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our 24,000 associates for their contributions to an outstanding quarter and year, as well as their commitment to delivering a peerless customer experience. 
As was announced on January 15, I'll be retiring from AutoNation on April 1. As that transition begins, I'll share that it's been a privilege to serve the company for the past 18 years. I am proud of our accomplishments and confidence about the company's succession plan, including Bill taking on the Chief Operating Officer position. 
I'm very optimistic about the future of AutoNation, where my family remains significant shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon Ferrando."

Mike Jackson, if I may, on a higher level, just in terms of how important you think consolidation is to the trajectory of AutoNation going forward. And quite frankly, if you can opine some of the bigger acquisitions that have been announced recently among sort of the outsiders, if you will. So with Berkshire entering the fray, there are some conversation around the source of management, looking at an acquisition and the dealer space as well. So what does that say about the bigger picture dealer outlook long-term? What it does it do for purchase multiples? And why do you think -- Buffet, at least, targeted a private group versus a public group?"

It's not a new experience for the auto industry, particularly not for AutoNation. I would observe that Eddy Lambert invested in us 15 years ago and owns 20% of the company today. And Bill Gates through his fun cascade and Michael Larson have been with us for over a decade and own 15% of the company. So having astute, sophisticated, long-term investors is not new to us and I welcome more to auto retail. I think it's absolutely a validation of the attractiveness and sustainability of auto retail. Now as far as the fees for consolidation, I see no change. There'll be a gradual evolutionary consolidation into larger entity's hands whether they're public or private. If I look at it right now, the publics are at 7% to 8%. And if I take the top 100 retailers in America, it's around 20%. And if I go back a decade ago, that was maybe 15%. And why the consolidation gradual and evolutionary? It's because you need willing sellers to come to a reasonable price, a fair price as to what to acquire the business for. There's a lot of emotion invested in independent entrepreneurial family businesses that many cases have existed for over a generation. And if you try to preemptively buy that strictly on price, the only way you can get that deal done is to dramatically overpay. And certainly, the industry for over a decade has shown an understanding of this fact and the discipline around price. And certainly, they knew entities that you called out have all built their enterprise based on paying a fair value price, not overpaying. So I don't think there's any change there. I think it will be a gradual evolution. I think though having larger players in the future is inevitable, that as private entrepreneurs build up bigger entities, you need more financial muscle and a bigger balance sheet to go to the next level of consolidation. But again, it will be a gradual evolution. Now whether those entities are public or private, I think that's a separate story. The big story is the top 100 is approaching 20%. And where that line gets drawn between public and private, we'll move over time. As far as why Warren Buffett buys what he buys, that's a question you should address to Mr. Buffett. I met him years ago at Bill Gates' home, he asked me question about auto retail and the auto industry, so I'm not surprised that he's in the space, but as to why Warren finally does what he does, it's far beyond my pay grade and I can't give you any insight there."

The American consumer has approximately $12 trillion of all forms of debt outstanding, of which auto loans are less than $1 trillion, let's say, $900 billion with the lowest default rate of any form of credit. So whether it's mortgages, credit cards, student loans, whatever form of credit you want to point  to, people pay their car loans. And by the way, that $900 billion is secured. It's not unsecured like credit cards or student loans, it's secured. And the industry had never bought into the folly that a car is an appreciating asset like the financial service industry said about, houses, but they would always go up. Now the mindset of lending in automotive is, is it a depreciating asset, it always goes down and structures loan accordingly. So I watch the lending. Now there is some risk on residuals and leasing, particularly around the price of gasoline because as the price of gasoline moves with a lot of volatility, it really affects the retail value of whatever is coming back into that market. So if you have very high gasoline prices and your preses have coming off-lease, you're going to do very well. If you have very low gasoline prices, and you have trucks coming off-lease, you're going to do very well. So that's the only wildcard that lenders need to watch for. As far as subprime for us as a company, when we retail 100 vehicles, 8 our them are financed by a sub-prime loan. So it's a small part of the business for us at our level. That's not to say you can't find further out on the price spectrum subprime business that is different, but for AutoNation that's not an issue. As far as the overall interest rates, we expect gradual increases to start in 2015. We're thinking like 50 basis points in the course of the year and a bit more in 2016. But all that looks very manageable. So as far as 2015 is concerned, I think the space prediction I ever made about industry unit volume breaking through 17 million or being above 17 million is one of the lowest risk predictions I've ever made. 17 million will happen in 2015. We're very confident about that. And if I look at the pent-up demands, economies moving at a better rate, there'll be good years after that. Too soon to say what the actual number would be."

Although I think branding AutoNation that was part of this, that's been a tremendous benefit to our associates after 2 years to attract talent, retain talent. As far as awareness in the marketplace of the name AutoNation within our markets, Mike, you might have the exact numbers. It already surpassed our legacy name, think about that. Some legacy names, we've been pounding on for 100 years and in 2 years, the name AutoNation has surpassed it in awareness and consideration. The next piece of the puzzle is transactional websites and traffic to our website. Traffics to our website is growing at double-digit, significant double-digit rates. Our own websites now generates more business than all the third parties combined. So there's significant progress, but if I look at the level of investment relative to those factors, I would say we're still very much in investment period and I would say that we'll certainly be for all of 2015. As far as my conviction, are we on the right course or not? I'm 100% convinced. 100% convinced that the strategy we are pursuing over time will be a sustainable competitive advantage for AutoNation, which is one of the hardest things to do in business.

I think we're really at the point where we can succeed either way. Now could there be an adjustment period if it moves a lot of volatility quickly? Well, of course. There could be a quarter where that happens. But then on a new level and I have more space between -- I have more margins base between used cars and new cars.

Thank you for joining us. Today, we reported an all-time record quarterly earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.02 for the fourth quarter, a 23% increase on a per share basis as compared to $0.83 for the same period in the prior year. This is our 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in quarterly EPS from continuing operations. 
For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.49 was also an all-time record, up 17% over prior year.
Fourth quarter 2014 revenue totaled $5 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by stronger performance in all our major business sectors. We also reported an increase of 12% in operating income to $227 million. Revenue for the full year was $19.1 billion, up 9% over prior year. Our operating income for the full year was $821 million, an increase of 11% over prior year.
During 2014, AutoNation repurchased 9.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $485 million. As of February 2, 2015, AutoNation has approximately 113 million shares outstanding.
Our planning assumption for 2015 industry new vehicle unit sales is above 17 million for the year. We believe that replacement demand, attractive products and great consumer credit will continue to support sales.
2015, we will continue to invest in our digital storefront called AutoNation Express. We successfully began our launch in December 2014, and we'll continue to roll out AutoNation Express from coast-to-coast.

There were no adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjustments in net income in prior periods are included in the reconciliation provided in our press release. 
In the fourth quarter, revenue increased $524 million or 12% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $80 million or 11%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 67.9% for the quarter, which represents a 70 basis point decrease compared to the year ago period. 
In addition to solid cost control, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit, benefited from seasonally strong premium luxury vehicle sales, which supports new vehicle gross profit dollars as well as our expense leverage.
Net new vehicle floor plans was a benefit of $15.2 million, an increase of $3.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance. 
Floorplan assistance increased primarily due to higher new vehicle sales. Floorplan debt increased sequentially, approximately $323 million during the fourth quarter to $3.1 billion at quarter end due to increased inventory balances.
In December, we amended our unsecured credit agreement by extending our maturity 3 years, lowering our borrowing costs by 25 basis points, increasing our revolving credit facility to $1.8 billion and eliminating the term loan.
In the amended facility, the maximum leverage ratio remains at 3.75x and the maximum capitalization ratio increased from 65% to 70%.
We continue to secure financing at favorable terms due to our strong operational results, in addition to our investment-grade debt profile, disciplined financial management and robust cash flow generation.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $22.1 million compared to $21.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher debt balances.
At the end of December, we had $1.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and a total non-vehicle debt balance of $2.1 billion. This was an increase of $195 million compared to September 30, 2014. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71.6 million or 38%.
From October 1, 2014 through February 2, 2015, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $69 million at an average price of $49.35 per share. AutoNation has approximately $281 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. As of February 2, there are approximately 113 million shares outstanding and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased to 2.3x at the end of Q4 compared to 2.2x at the end of Q3. The leverage ratio was 2.2x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $52 million for the quarter and $192 million for the full year 2014. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis and exclude operating lease buyouts and related asset sales.
Our quarter end cash balance was $75 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $770 million at the end of December.
In 2014, we continue to demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business. During the year, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $485 million and announced acquisition and add points with $550 million in expected future annual revenues.
Looking forward, we remain committed to driving shareholder returns through strong operational execution as well as investments in strategic initiatives, acquisitions and share repurchase.
Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."

We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter performance, where we delivered revenue and gross profit growth across the business, an exceptional 4.5% operating margin, an all-time record quarterly and annual EPS and the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.
As I continue, my comments will be in a same-store basis compared to the period a year ago. 
Starting with sales. Total gross profit for variable operations was up 10%. On a per vehicle basis, total variable gross was $3,450 per vehicle, an increase of $71 or 2%, driven by solid contributions from used vehicles and customer financial services.  Combined, new and used same-store unit volume was up 8%.
In the quarter, we've retailed 80,800 new vehicles, an increase of 6,700 units, or 9%, generating new vehicle revenue of $2.9 billion, up $277 million or 11%. New vehicle gross profit of $179 million grew by $10 million or 6%. Gross profit per new vehicle retails at $2,220, it was off $67, or 3%, compared to a year ago, attributable in part to continued pressure in the Import segment as well as the introduction of several new premium luxury models in the quarter a year ago that commanded higher margins at launch. Sequentially, compared to Q3 2014, gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $344 due to the seasonal lift in Premium Luxury, an achievement of several manufacturer year-end volume-based incentives, which were higher in the quarter than anticipated.
Looking ahead, we expect gross profit per new vehicle retail to return to normalized levels, in sync with typical seasonality and subject to market conditions. At year-end, our new vehicle inventory was 54 days compared to 62 days a year ago.
Turning to used vehicles. We had another solid performance in the quarter at $984 million, retail used vehicle revenue increased $75 million, or 8%, on the sale of 52,500 used vehicles, an increase of 3,500 units or 7%. Retail used vehicle gross profit of $88 million was up $11 million, or 14%, and gross profit per used vehicle retail was $1,679, an increase of $97 or 6%. 
We are focused on optimizing the acquisition of used inventory as well as pricing our used vehicles to market. We continue to see opportunity in used due to the increasing supply of used vehicles, both from new vehicle trades and off lease and feel we are well-positioned looking forward. 
At December 31, our used base supply was 38 days compared to 35 a year ago, aligning with our intent to build inventory for Q1.
Rounding up the variable side of the business is customer financial services, where in the quarter, we achieved a record gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,444, an increase of $71 or 5%. Total gross profit for CFS of $193 million was up $24 million, or 14%, compared to the period a year ago. 
We continue to be extremely pleased with our performance here and regain focus on the overall customer experience, continuous improvement in store level of execution and growing long-term customer retention through value-added product offerings.
Next, customer care, which encompasses our service parts and collision business. In the quarter, customer care revenue of $713 million increased by an impressive 10%, or $65 million, and customer care gross profit of $298 million grew 8% or $23 million.
Expanding on gross, warranty gross increased 24%, supported by continued strong retail activity, which represented just over 5% of our total customer care gross. Customer pay gross were 3% in the quarter and accounted for nearly 40% of the total customer care gross.
This also marked our 18th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross as we continue to focus on growing our customer pay business while ensuring we address recalls for our customers.
And finally, collision gross was up 11% in the quarter.
I'll note that looking ahead, we maintain our outlook that customer care gross comps will be in the mid-single-digit range as we previously discussed asset elevated recall activity.
In closing, I'd like to thank our 24,000 associates for their contributions to an outstanding quarter and year as well as their commitment to delivering a peerless customer experience.
As was announced on January 15, I'll be retiring from AutoNation on April 1. As that transition begins, I'll share that it's been a privilege to serve the company for the past 18 years. I am proud of our accomplishments and confident about the company's succession plan, including Bill Berman taking on the Chief Operating Officer position.
I'm very optimistic about the future of AutoNation, where my family remains significant shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon Ferrando."

We completed 2 acquisitions since year-end, Mercedes-Benz of Reno in Nevada and a Volkswagen store in the Atlanta market that will operate as AutoNation Volkswagen Mall of Georgia.
In 2014, these stores collectively generated approximately $120 million in revenue and sold approximately 3,400 new and used retail units.
Both franchises are located in attractive auto retail locations and facilities. We are excited about adding our 21st Mercedes-Benz franchise to the AutoNation family. It's a great way to enter Reno, Lake Tahoe, an attractive auto retail market with good demographics.
As of today, our store portfolio number is 284 franchises and 234 stores in 15 states, representing 34 manufactured brands.
Looking forward, we will continue our strategy of pursuing acquisitions and add points that enhance brand representation within our auto retail markets as well as markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

Mike Jackson, if I may, on a higher level, just in terms of how important you think consolidation is to the trajectory of AutoNation going forward. And quite frankly, if you can opine on some of the bigger acquisitions that have been announced recently among sort of the outsiders, if you will. So with Berkshire entering the fray, there's some conversation now around source fund management, looking at an acquisition in the dealer space as well. So what does that say about the bigger picture dealer outlook long-term? What it does it do for purchase multiples? And why do you think their -- or Buffett, at least, targeted a private group versus a public group?"

It's not a new experience for the auto industry, particularly not for AutoNation. I would observe that Eddie Lampert invested in us 15 years ago and owns 20% of the company today. And Bill Gates, through his fund, Cascade, and Michael Larson have been with us for over a decade and own 15% of the company. So having astute, sophisticated, long-term investors is not new to us, and I welcome more to auto retail. I think it's absolutely a validation of the attractiveness and sustainability of auto retail. Now as far as the pace of consolidation, I see no change. There'll be a gradual evolutionary consolidation into larger  entities' hands whether they're public or private. If I look at it right now, the publics are at 7% to 8%. And if I take the top 100 retailers in America, it's around 20%. And if I go back a decade ago, that was maybe 15%. So -- and why is the consolidation gradual and evolutionary? It's because you need willing sellers to come to a reasonable price, a fair price as to what to acquire the business for. There's a lot of emotion invested in independent entrepreneurial family businesses that many cases have existed for over a generation. And if you try to preemptively buy that strictly on price, the only way you can get that deal done is to dramatically overpay. And certainly, the industry, for over a decade, has shown an understanding of this fact and the discipline around price. And certainly, they knew entities that you called out have all built their enterprise based on paying a fair value price, not overpaying. So I don't think there's any change there. I think it will be a gradual evolution. I think though having larger players in the future is inevitable, that as private entrepreneurs build up bigger entities, you need more financial muscle and a bigger balance sheet to go to the next level of consolidation. But again, it will be a gradual evolution. Now whether those entities are public or private, I think that's a separate story. The big story is the top 100 is approaching 20%. And where that line gets drawn between public and private, we'll move over time. As far as why Warren Buffett buys what he buys, that's a question you should address to Mr. Buffett. I met him years ago at Bill Gates' home, he asked me questions about auto retail and the auto industry, so I'm not surprised that he's in the space, but as to why Warren finally does what he does, it's far beyond my pay grade and I can't give you any insight there."

There's -- the American consumer has approximately $12 trillion of all forms of debt outstanding, of which auto loans are less than $1 trillion, let's say, $900 billion with the lowest default rate of any form of credit. Lower than mortgages, credit cards, student loans, whatever form of credit you want to point to. People pay their car loans. And by the way, that $900 billion is secured. It's not unsecured like credit cards or student loans, it's secured. And the industry had never bought into the folly that a car is an appreciating asset like the financial service industry said about houses, that they would always go up. Now the mindset of lending in automotive is it's a depreciating asset, it always goes down and structure the loan accordingly. So I watch the lending. Now there is some risk on residuals and leasing, particularly around the price of gasoline because as the price of gasoline moves with a lot of volatility, it really affects the retail value of whatever's coming back into that market. So if you have very high gasoline prices and your preses [ph] are coming off lease, you're going to do very well. If you have very low gasoline prices, and you have trucks coming off lease, you're going to do very well. So that's the only wildcard that lenders need to watch for. As far as subprime, for us as a company, when we retail 100 vehicles, 8 our them are financed by a subprime loan. So it's a small part of the business for us at our level. That's not to say you can't find further out on the price spectrum a subprime business that is different, but for AutoNation, that's not an issue. As far as the overall interest rates, we expect gradual increases to start in 2015. We're thinking like 50 basis points in the course of the year and a bit more in 2016. But all that looks very manageable. So as far as 2015 is concerned, I think the safest prediction I ever made about industry unit volume breaking through 17 million or being above 17 million is one of the lowest risk predictions I've ever made. 17 million will happen in 2015. We're very confident about that. And if I look at the pent-up demands, economies moving at a better rate, there'll be good years after that. Too soon to say what the actual number will be."

Although I think branding AutoNation, that was part of this, that's been a tremendous benefit to our associates after 2 years to attract talent, retain talent. As far as awareness in the marketplace of the name AutoNation within our markets -- Mike, you might have the exact numbers -- it has already surpassed our legacy name, think about that. Some legacy names, we've been pounding on for 100 years and in 2 years, the name AutoNation has surpassed it in awareness and consideration. The next piece of the puzzle is transactional websites and traffic to our website. Traffics to our website is growing at double digit, significant double-digit rates. Our own websites now generate more business than all the third parties combined. So there's significant progress, but if I look at the level of investment relative to those factors, I would say we're still very much in investment period and I would say that we'll certainly be for all of 2015. As far as my conviction, are we on the right course or not? I'm 100% convinced. 100% convinced that the strategy we are pursuing over time will be a sustainable competitive advantage for AutoNation, which is one of the hardest things to do in business. Mike, do you have any marketing awareness numbers for us?"

If I look out 5 years from now, I'm convinced we'll be looking back on this investment phase and say, ""That was great money that we invested. "" I'm convinced of it. But we have to go through an investment phase. And it's -- I should be clear, it's not cheap. I've been very straightforward, it's over $100 million, well over $100 million if you combine what we're investing in the brand, and you combine what we're investing in technology to make our website attractive and transactional, plus the processes that have to change in the store. But this total integrated technology solution where a customer can seamlessly move back and forth between an online experience and in-store experience, we are convinced is the Holy Grail for automotive retail. And you combine that with the brand where you control and know your own website, and you have a fulfillment footprint with a customer care to cover your fixed cost. This is a winning combination."

My acquisition cost is going down and I have more of them to buy. If I look at our used car capabilities that we've developed, that makes me even more optimistic about the used car business. I think we're really at a point where we can succeed either way. Now could there be an adjustment period if it moves with a lot of volatility quickly? Well, of course. There could be a quarter where that happens. But then on a new level and I have more space between -- I have more margins space between used cars and new cars. So we're optimistic about used cars business and we think whatever is coming will be -- there won't be extreme volatility to it. I think that's the most important point, and we'll be able to adjust to whatever the new circumstances are.

But my view is every time I spend $1 on the AutoNation brand, it's a double win. I sell a car today and I build awareness for the future. Whereas, when I spend money with third-party lead providers, yes, I get to sell a car today, but they take that money and build their brand and get the future sale. And maybe I get a shot at that, maybe I don't and most likely I have to compete on price to get to the next one. So this is -- over time, when we successfully execute this shift of resources from third-party lead providers to AutoNation, I think, over time, it makes the company stronger and stronger.

Thank you for joining us. Today, we reported an all-time record quarterly earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.02 for the fourth quarter, a 23% increase on a per share basis as compared to $0.83 for the same period in the prior year. This is our 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in quarterly EPS from continuing operations. 
For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.49 was also an all-time record, up 17% over prior year.
Fourth quarter 2014 revenue totaled $5 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by stronger performance in all our major business sectors. We also reported an increase of 12% in operating income to $227 million. Revenue for the full year was $19.1 billion, up 9% over prior year. Our operating income for the full year was $821 million, an increase of 11% over prior year.
During 2014, AutoNation repurchased 9.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $485 million. As of February 2, 2015, AutoNation has approximately 113 million shares outstanding.
Our planning assumption for 2015 industry new vehicle unit sales is above 17 million for the year. We believe that replacement demand, attractive products and great consumer credit will continue to support sales.
2015, we will continue to invest in our digital storefront called AutoNation Express. We successfully began our launch in December 2014, and we'll continue to roll out AutoNation Express from coast-to-coast.

There were no adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjustments in net income in prior periods are included in the reconciliation provided in our press release. 
In the fourth quarter, revenue increased $524 million or 12% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $80 million or 11%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 67.9% for the quarter, which represents a 70 basis point decrease compared to the year ago period. 
In addition to solid cost control, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit benefited from seasonally strong premium luxury vehicle sales, which supports new vehicle gross profit dollars as well as our expense leverage.
Net new vehicle floor plans was a benefit of $15.2 million, an increase of $3.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance. 
Floorplan assistance increased primarily due to higher new vehicle sales. Floorplan debt increased sequentially, approximately $323 million during the fourth quarter to $3.1 billion at quarter end due to increased inventory balances.
In December, we amended our unsecured credit agreement by extending our maturity 3 years, lowering our borrowing costs by 25 basis points, increasing our revolving credit facility to $1.8 billion and eliminating the term loan.
In the amended facility, the maximum leverage ratio remains at 3.75x and the maximum capitalization ratio increased from 65% to 70%.
We continue to secure financing at favorable terms due to our strong operational results, in addition to our investment-grade debt profile, disciplined financial management and robust cash flow generation.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $22.1 million compared to $21.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher debt balances.
At the end of December, we had $1.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and a total non-vehicle debt balance of $2.1 billion. This was an increase of $195 million compared to September 30, 2014. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71.6 million or 38%.
From October 1, 2014 through February 2, 2015, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $69 million at an average price of $49.35 per share. AutoNation has approximately $281 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. As of February 2, there are approximately 113 million shares outstanding and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased to 2.3x at the end of Q4 compared to 2.2x at the end of Q3. The leverage ratio was 2.2x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $52 million for the quarter and $192 million for the full year 2014. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis and exclude operating lease buyouts and related asset sales.
Our quarter end cash balance was $75 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $770 million at the end of December.
In 2014, we continue to demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business. During the year, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $485 million and announced acquisition and add points with $550 million in expected future annual revenues.
Looking forward, we remain committed to driving shareholder returns through strong operational execution as well as investments in strategic initiatives, acquisitions and share repurchase.
Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."

We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter performance, where we delivered revenue and gross profit growth across the business, an exceptional 4.5% operating margin, an all-time record quarterly and annual EPS and the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.
As I continue, my comments will be in a same-store basis compared to the period a year ago. 
Starting with sales. Total gross profit for variable operations was up 10%. On a per vehicle basis, total variable gross was $3,450 per vehicle, an increase of $71 or 2%, driven by solid contributions from used vehicles and customer financial services.  Combined, new and used same-store unit volume was up 8%.
In the quarter, we've retailed 80,800 new vehicles, an increase of 6,700 units, or 9%, generating new vehicle revenue of $2.9 billion, up $277 million or 11%. New vehicle gross profit of $179 million grew by $10 million or 6%. Gross profit per new vehicle retails at $2,220, it was off $67, or 3%, compared to a year ago, attributable in part to continued pressure in the Import segment as well as the introduction of several new premium luxury models in the quarter a year ago that commanded higher margins at launch. Sequentially, compared to Q3 2014, gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $344 due to the seasonal lift in Premium Luxury, an achievement of several manufacturer year-end volume-based incentives, which were higher in the quarter than anticipated.
Looking ahead, we expect gross profit per new vehicle retail to return to normalized levels, in sync with typical seasonality and subject to market conditions. At year-end, our new vehicle inventory was 54 days compared to 62 days a year ago.
Turning to used vehicles. We had another solid performance in the quarter at $984 million, retail used vehicle revenue increased $75 million, or 8%, on the sale of 52,500 used vehicles, an increase of 3,500 units or 7%. Retail used vehicle gross profit of $88 million was up $11 million, or 14%, and gross profit per used vehicle retail was $1,679, an increase of $97 or 6%. 
We are focused on optimizing the acquisition of used inventory as well as pricing our used vehicles to market. We continue to see opportunity in used due to the increasing supply of used vehicles, both from new vehicle trades and off lease and feel we are well-positioned looking forward. 
At December 31, our used base supply was 38 days compared to 35 a year ago, aligning with our intent to build inventory for Q1.
Rounding up the variable side of the business is customer financial services, where in the quarter, we achieved a record gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,444, an increase of $71 or 5%. Total gross profit for CFS of $193 million was up $24 million, or 14%, compared to the period a year ago. 
We continue to be extremely pleased with our performance here and regain focus on the overall customer experience, continuous improvement in store level of execution and growing long-term customer retention through value-added product offerings.
Next, customer care, which encompasses our service parts and collision business. In the quarter, customer care revenue of $713 million increased by an impressive 10%, or $65 million, and customer care gross profit of $298 million grew 8% or $23 million.
Expanding on gross, warranty gross increased 24%, supported by continued strong retail activity, which represented just over 5% of our total customer care gross. Customer pay gross were 3% in the quarter and accounted for nearly 40% of the total customer care gross.
This also marked our 18th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross as we continue to focus on growing our customer pay business while ensuring we address recalls for our customers.
And finally, collision gross was up 11% in the quarter.
I'll note that looking ahead, we maintain our outlook that customer care gross comps will be in the mid-single-digit range as we previously discussed asset elevated recall activity.
In closing, I'd like to thank our 24,000 associates for their contributions to an outstanding quarter and year as well as their commitment to delivering a peerless customer experience.
As was announced on January 15, I'll be retiring from AutoNation on April 1. As that transition begins, I'll share that it's been a privilege to serve the company for the past 18 years. I am proud of our accomplishments and confident about the company's succession plan, including Bill Berman taking on the Chief Operating Officer position.
I'm very optimistic about the future of AutoNation, where my family remains significant shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon Ferrando."

We completed 2 acquisitions since year-end, Mercedes-Benz of Reno in Nevada and a Volkswagen store in the Atlanta market that will operate as AutoNation Volkswagen Mall of Georgia.
In 2014, these stores collectively generated approximately $120 million in revenue and sold approximately 3,400 new and used retail units.
Both franchises are located in attractive auto retail locations and facilities. We are excited about adding our 21st Mercedes-Benz franchise to the AutoNation family. It's a great way to enter Reno, Lake Tahoe, an attractive auto retail market with good demographics.
As of today, our store portfolio number is 284 franchises and 234 stores in 15 states, representing 34 manufactured brands.
Looking forward, we will continue our strategy of pursuing acquisitions and add points that enhance brand representation within our auto retail markets as well as markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

Mike Jackson, if I may, on a higher level, just in terms of how important you think consolidation is to the trajectory of AutoNation going forward. And quite frankly, if you can opine on some of the bigger acquisitions that have been announced recently among sort of the outsiders, if you will. So with Berkshire entering the fray, there's some conversation now around source fund management, looking at an acquisition in the dealer space as well. So what does that say about the bigger picture dealer outlook long-term? What it does it do for purchase multiples? And why do you think their -- or Buffett, at least, targeted a private group versus a public group?"

It's not a new experience for the auto industry, particularly not for AutoNation. I would observe that Eddie Lampert invested in us 15 years ago and owns 20% of the company today. And Bill Gates, through his fund, Cascade, and Michael Larson have been with us for over a decade and own 15% of the company. So having astute, sophisticated, long-term investors is not new to us, and I welcome more to auto retail. I think it's absolutely a validation of the attractiveness and sustainability of auto retail. Now as far as the pace of consolidation, I see no change. There'll be a gradual evolutionary consolidation into larger  entities' hands, whether they're public or private. If I look at it right now, the publics are at 7% to 8%. And if I take the top 100 retailers in America, it's around 20%. And if I go back a decade ago, that was maybe 15%. So -- and why is the consolidation gradual and evolutionary? It's because you need willing sellers to come to a reasonable price, a fair price as to what to acquire the business for. There's a lot of emotion invested in independent entrepreneurial family businesses that many cases have existed for over a generation. And if you try to preemptively buy that strictly on price, the only way you can get that deal done is to dramatically overpay. And certainly, the industry, for over a decade, has shown an understanding of this fact and the discipline around price. And certainly, they knew entities that you called out have all built their enterprise based on paying a fair value price, not overpaying. So I don't think there's any change there. I think it will be a gradual evolution. I think, though, having larger players in the future is inevitable, that as private entrepreneurs build up bigger entities, you need more financial muscle and a bigger balance sheet to go to the next level of consolidation. But again, it will be a gradual evolution. Now whether those entities are public or private, I think that's a separate story. The big story is the top 100 is approaching 20%. And where that line gets drawn between public and private, we'll move over time. As far as why Warren Buffett buys what he buys, that's a question you should address to Mr. Buffett. I met him years ago at Bill Gates' home, he asked me questions about auto retail and the auto industry, so I'm not surprised that he's in the space, but as to why Warren finally does what he does, it's far beyond my pay grade and I can't give you any insight there."

Is there something out there that you're looking for that would make you incrementally negative? Because it doesn't sound like the credit market has tightened up.  It sounds like it's just as available and supportive of a strong SAAR in 2015, at least early 2015."

There's -- the American consumer has approximately $12 trillion of all forms of debt outstanding, of which auto loans are less than $1 trillion, let's say, $900 billion with the lowest default rate of any form of credit. Lower than mortgages, credit cards, student loans, whatever form of credit you want to point to. People pay their car loans. And by the way, that $900 billion is secured. It's not unsecured like credit cards or student loans, it's secured. And the industry had never bought into the folly that a car is an appreciating asset like the financial service industry said about houses, that they would always go up. Now the mindset of lending in automotive is it's a depreciating asset, it always goes down and structure the loan accordingly. So I'd watch the lending. Now there is some risk on residuals and leasing, particularly around the price of gasoline because as the price of gasoline moves with a lot of volatility, it really affects the retail value of whatever's coming back into that market. So if you have very high gasoline prices and your Priuses are coming off lease, you're going to do very well. If you have very low gasoline prices, and you have trucks coming off lease, you're going to do very well. So that's the only wildcard that lenders need to watch for. As far as subprime, for us as a company, when we retail 100 vehicles, 8 of them are financed by a subprime loan. So it's a small part of the business for us at our level. That's not to say you can't find further out on the price spectrum a subprime business that is different, but for AutoNation, that's not an issue. As far as the overall interest rates, we expect gradual increases to start in 2015. We're thinking like 50 basis points in the course of the year and a bit more in 2016. But all that looks very manageable. So as far as 2015 is concerned, I think the safest prediction I ever made about industry unit volume breaking through 17 million or being above 17 million is one of the lowest risk predictions I've ever made. 17 million will happen in 2015. We're very confident about that. And if I look at the pent-up demands, economy's moving at a better rate, there'll be good years after that. Too soon to say what the actual number will be."

Although I think branding AutoNation, that was part of this, that's been a tremendous benefit to our associates after 2 years to attract talent, retain talent. As far as awareness in the marketplace of the name AutoNation within our markets -- Mike, you might have the exact numbers -- it has already surpassed our legacy name, think about that. Some legacy names, we've been pounding on for 100 years and in 2 years, the name AutoNation has surpassed it in awareness and consideration. The next piece of the puzzle is transactional websites and traffic to our website. Traffics to our website is growing at double digit, significant double-digit rates. Our own websites now generate more business than all the third parties combined. So there's significant progress, but if I look at the level of investment relative to those factors, I would say we're still very much in investment period and I would say that we'll certainly be for all of 2015. As far as my conviction, are we on the right course or not? I'm 100% convinced. 100% convinced that the strategy we are pursuing over time will be a sustainable competitive advantage for AutoNation, which is one of the hardest things to do in business. Mike, do you have any marketing awareness numbers for us?"

But we have to go through an investment phase. And it's -- I should be clear, it's not cheap. I've been very straightforward, it's over $100 million, well over $100 million if you combine what we're investing in the brand, and you combine what we're investing in technology to make our website attractive and transactional, plus the processes that have to change in the store. But this total integrated technology solution where a customer can seamlessly move back and forth between an online experience and in-store experience, we are convinced is the Holy Grail for automotive retail. And you combine that with the brand where you control and know your own website, and you have a fulfillment footprint with a customer care to cover your fixed cost. This is a winning combination."

My acquisition cost has gone down and I have more of them to buy. If I look at our used car capabilities that we've developed, that makes me even more optimistic about the used car business. I think we're really at a point where we can succeed either way. Now could there be an adjustment period if it moves with a lot of volatility quickly? Well, of course. There could be a quarter where that happens. But then on a new level and I have more space between -- I have more margin space between used cars and new cars.

Whereas, when I spend money with third-party lead providers, yes, I get to sell a car today, but they take that money and build their brand and get the future sale.

We did see a small -- some small pressure in the customer care margin, but it's really about a change we made and how we calculated our reconditioning rates and some of that moved to used vehicle margin. When we look at the core service business of customer pay and warranty, our margins were actually up slightly. So the margins that are subject to the marketplace were up and the ones we controlled internally, we made some tweaks to and created that margin compression.

This is our 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth and EPS from continuing operation. 
First quarter 2015 revenue totaled $4.9 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%, driven by stronger performance in all of our business sectors. 
In the first quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 10% or 9% on same-store basis. 
AutoNation continue to report during this recovery with an optimal brand and market, mix and disciplined cost structure. We continue to drive solid results across all our business sectors.

For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $112 million or $0.97 per share versus adjusted net income of $91 million or $0.75 per share during the first quarter of 2014, a 29% improvement on a per-share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in the first quarter of 2015.  Adjustments in net income in prior periods are included in the reconciliation provided in our press release. 
In the first quarter, revenue increased $581 million or 13% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $93 million or 13%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.7% for the quarter, which represents 110 basis-point decrease compared to the year-ago period. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $14.2 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance which increased due to higher new vehicle sales. 
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $95 million during the first quarter to $3 billion at quarter end, primarily due to decreased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities. 
Non-vehicle interest expense decreased slightly to $21.4 million compared to $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to improved pricing from our credit facility refinancing that was completed in December of 2014. 
At the end of March, we had $1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and a total non-vehicle debt balance of $2.1 billion. This was a decrease of $73 million compared to December 31, 2014.  The provision for income tax in the quarter was $69.8 million or 38.5%. 
From January 1 through April 20, 2015, we repurchased 150,000 shares for $9 million at an average price of $60.46 per share. AutoNation has approximately $272 million of remaining Board authorization for share repurchase. 
As of April 20, there were approximately 114 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. 
Our leverage ratio decreased to 2.2x at the end of Q1 as compared to 2.3x at the end of Q4. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net debt basis and includes used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $63 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $74 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $900 million at the end of March. 
The finance team remains committed to supporting our operational partners with the unified focus on driving long-term shareholder value. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

This marked our 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis and compared to the tier a year ago unless noted otherwise. 
Total gross profit for variable operations was $459 million, up 12%. Total variable growth was $3,406 on a per vehicle retailed basis, an increase of $67 or 2%.  New same-store sales unit volume was up 10%. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, an increase of $277 million or 11%. 
We retailed 72,900 units, an increase of 9%. New vehicle gross profit was $2,005 on a per vehicle retail basis, off slightly due to continued pressure on Import segment, as well as growth in volume of entry-level Premium Luxury models. 
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $121 million or 13%. Used vehicle retail for $57,400, up 11%.  Used vehicle gross profit was $1,738 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $42 or 2%. 
As you might remember in Q1, 2014,  we focused on maximizing margin due to our tight inventory supply. We are well positioned with our used inventory for the second quarter. We increased our total store used unit by 26% compared to last year and our current total store used vehicle inventory levels at 34 days. 
Customer financial services gross profit had an all-time record at $1,515 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $114 or 8%. 
Approximately 2/3 of our gross profit per vehicle retail was related to customer financial service products and approximately 1/3 was related to finance. 
Total gross profit per customer financial services of $203 million was up $32 million or 19% compared to the period a year ago. 
We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we guard store-level execution and offer products that build customer value and loyalty. 
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $723 million, an increase of $56 million or 8%. We've had an all-time record high in customer care growth profit of $310 million, an increase of $26 million or 9%. 
Customer pay gross was $124 million, up 4%. This was our 19th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross. 
Warranty gross was $60 million, up 19%. Dilution growth was $29 million, up 11%. 
Excluding the impact of elevated recalls, we continue to expect mid-single digit growth in customer care. 
I would like to then call 24,500 associates for a job well done this quarter. As an organization, we remain focused on driving sales, driving service and building the AutoNation brand. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jon Ferrando."

We're excited to announce that in April, we completed 2 acquisitions that we signed in the first quarter, including Mercedes-Benz store located in San Jose, California.

We also acquired a Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram store in Valencia, California, our 32nd franchise in Southern California. The Chrysler store will be an excellent addition to our business in the Valencia Automall, where we offer 9 brands. 
AutoNation has also signed an agreement to acquire a Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo store in our Spokane, Washington market. This will give us 25 franchises in the State of Washington. 
As previously announced, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Mercedes-Benz store in Reno, Nevada and the Volkswagen store in Atlanta. The combined annual revenue for our 5 acquisitions since the beginning of 2015, including the Spokane acquisition, which we expect to complete in early May is approximately $320 million. 
As of today, our store portfolio number is 290 franchises and 235 stores in 15 states, representing 34 manufacturer brands. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our author retail markets, as well as markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. 
As for M&A market conditions, there is a solid pipeline of potential opportunities in the marketplace. While we have not seen a material increase in competition for deals, we have seen an uptick in sellers testing the market with unrealistic expectations. 
We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

There were no adjustments to net income in the first quarter of 2015. Adjustments in net income in prior periods are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release.
In the first quarter, revenue increased $581 million or 13% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved $93 million or 13%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.7% for the quarter, which represents 110 basis point decrease compared to the year ago period.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $14.2 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance, which increased due to higher new vehicle sales.
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $95 million, during the first quarter to $3 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased -- decreased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities.
Nonvehicle interest expense decreased slightly to $21.4 million compared to $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to improved pricing from our credit facility refinancing that was completed in December of 2014. At the end of March, we had $1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and a total nonvehicle debt balance of $2.1 billion. This was a decrease of $73 million compared to December 31, 2014. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $69.8 million or 38.5%.
From January 1 through April 20, 2015, we repurchased 150,000 shares for $9 million at an average price of $60.46 per share. AutoNation has approximately $272 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. As of April 20, there were approximately 114 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio decreased to 2.2x at the end of Q1 as compared to 2.3x at the end of Q4. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net-debt basis, and this includes used floorplan availability. And our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $63 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales.
Our quarter-end cash balance was $74 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $900 million at the end of March.
The finance team remains committed to supporting our operational partners with a unified focus on driving long-term shareholder value.
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Going forward, my c",463,"Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning. AutoNation posted stellar first quarter results with double-digit growth in revenue and gross profit across all business sectors. This marked our 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis and compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise.
Total gross profit for variable operations was $459 million, up 12%. Total variable growth was $3,406 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $67 or 2%. New and used same-store sale unit volume was up 10%. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, an increase of $277 million or 11%.
We retailed 76,900 units, an increase of 9%. New vehicle gross profit was $2,005 on a per vehicle retail basis, off slightly due to continued pressure in Import segment as well as growth in volume of entry-level Premium Luxury models.
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $121 million or 13%. Used vehicle retailed were 57,400, up 11%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,738 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $42 or 2%.
As you might remember in Q1 2014, we focused on maximizing margins due to our tight inventory supply. We are well positioned with our used inventory for the second quarter. We increased our total store used units by 26% compared to last year and our current total store used vehicle inventory levels at 34 days.
Customer financial services gross profit set an all-time record at $1,515 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $114 or 8%. Approximately 2/3 of our gross profit per vehicle retailed was related to customer financial service products, and approximately 1/3 was related to finance.
Total gross profit per customer financial services of $203 million was up $32 million or 19% compared to the period a year ago. We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we guard store-level execution and offer products that build customer value and loyalty.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $723 million, an increase of $56 million or 8%. We've set an all-time record high in customer care gross profit of $310 million, an increase of $26 million or 9%.
Customer pay gross was $124 million, up 4%. This was our 19th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross.
Warranty gross was $60 million, up 19%. Collision growth was $29 million, up 11%.
Excluding the impact of elevated recalls, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in customer care.
I would like to then call 24,500 associates for a job well done this quarter. As an organization, we remain focused on driving sales, driving service and building the AutoNation brand.
I'll now turn the call over to Jon Ferrando."

We are excited to announce that in April, we completed 2 acquisitions that we signed in the first quarter, including Mercedes-Benz store located in San Jose, California. This represents our 22nd Mercedes-Benz franchise and our 21st franchise in Northern California.
We also acquired a Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram store in Valencia, California, our 32nd franchise in Southern California. The Chrysler store will be an excellent addition to our business in the Valencia Auto Mall where we offer 9 brands.
AutoNation has also signed an agreement to acquire a Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo store in our Spokane, Washington market. This will give us 25 franchises in the State of Washington.
As previously announced, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a Mercedes-Benz store in Reno, Nevada and a Volkswagen store in Atlanta. The combined annual revenue for our 5 acquisitions since the beginning of 2015, including the Spokane acquisition, which we expect to complete in early May, is approximately $320 million.
As of today, our store portfolio number is 290 franchises and 235 stores in 15 states, representing 34 manufacturer brands.
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our author retail markets as well as markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure.
As for M&A market conditions, there is a solid pipeline of potential opportunities in the marketplace. While we have not seen a material increase in competition for deals, we have seen an uptick in sellers testing the market with unrealistic expectations.
We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.
I will now turn it back to Mike Jackson."

There were no adjustments to net income in the first quarter of 2015. Adjustments in net income in prior periods are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release.
In the first quarter, revenue increased $581 million or 13% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved $93 million or 13%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.7% for the quarter, which represents 110 basis point decrease compared to the year ago period.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $14.2 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance, which increased due to higher new vehicle sales.
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $95 million, during the first quarter to $3 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased -- decreased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities.
Nonvehicle interest expense decreased slightly to $21.4 million compared to $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to improved pricing from our credit facility refinancing that was completed in December of 2014. At the end of March, we had $1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and a total nonvehicle debt balance of $2.1 billion. This was a decrease of $73 million compared to December 31, 2014. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $69.8 million or 38.5%.
From January 1 through April 20, 2015, we repurchased 150,000 shares for $9 million at an average price of $60.46 per share. AutoNation has approximately $272 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. As of April 20, there were approximately 114 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio decreased to 2.2x at the end of Q1 as compared to 2.3x at the end of Q4. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net-debt basis, and this includes used floorplan availability. And our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $63 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales.
Our quarter-end cash balance was $74 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $900 million at the end of March.
The finance team remains committed to supporting our operational partners with a unified focus on driving long-term shareholder value.

This marked our 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis and compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise.
Total gross profit for variable operations was $459 million, up 12%. Total variable growth was $3,406 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $67 or 2%. New and used same-store sale unit volume was up 10%. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, an increase of $277 million or 11%.
We retailed 76,900 units, an increase of 9%. New vehicle gross profit was $2,005 on a per vehicle retail basis, off slightly due to continued pressure in Import segment as well as growth in volume of entry-level Premium Luxury models.
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $121 million or 13%. Used vehicle retailed were 57,400, up 11%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,738 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $42 or 2%.
As you might remember in Q1 2014, we focused on maximizing margins due to our tight inventory supply. We are well positioned with our used inventory for the second quarter. We increased our total store used units by 26% compared to last year and our current total store used vehicle inventory levels at 34 days.
Customer financial services gross profit set an all-time record at $1,515 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $114 or 8%. Approximately 2/3 of our gross profit per vehicle retailed was related to customer financial service products, and approximately 1/3 was related to finance.
Total gross profit per customer financial services of $203 million was up $32 million or 19% compared to the period a year ago. We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we guard store-level execution and offer products that build customer value and loyalty.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $723 million, an increase of $56 million or 8%. We've set an all-time record high in customer care gross profit of $310 million, an increase of $26 million or 9%.
Customer pay gross was $124 million, up 4%. This was our 19th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross.
Warranty gross was $60 million, up 19%. Collision gross was $29 million, up 11%.
Excluding the impact of elevated recalls, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in customer care.
I would like to thank all 24,500 associates for a job well done this quarter. As an organization, we remain focused on driving sales, driving service and building the AutoNation brand.

The combined annual revenue for our 5 acquisitions since the beginning of 2015, including the Spokane acquisition, which we expect to complete in early May, is approximately $320 million.
As of today, our store portfolio number is 290 franchises and 235 stores in 15 states, representing 34 manufacturer brands.
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our auto retail markets as well as markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure.
As for M&A market conditions, there is a solid pipeline of potential opportunities in the marketplace. While we have not seen a material increase in competition for deals, we have seen an uptick in sellers testing the market with unrealistic expectations.
We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.
I will now turn it back to Mike Jackson."

First quarter 2015 revenue totaled $4.9 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 13%, driven by a stronger performance in all of our business sectors.
In the first quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 10% or 9% on same-store basis.

There were no adjustments to net income in the first quarter of 2015. Adjustments in net income in prior periods are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release.
In the first quarter, revenue increased $581 million or 13% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved $93 million or 13%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.7% for the quarter, which represents 110 basis point decrease compared to the year ago period.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $14.2 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance, which increased due to higher new vehicle sales.
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $95 million, during the first quarter to $3 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased -- decreased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities.
Nonvehicle interest expense decreased slightly to $21.4 million compared to $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to improved pricing from our credit facility refinancing that was completed in December of 2014. At the end of March, we had $1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and a total nonvehicle debt balance of $2.1 billion. This was a decrease of $73 million compared to December 31, 2014. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $69.8 million or 38.5%.
From January 1 through April 20, 2015, we repurchased 150,000 shares for $9 million at an average price of $60.46 per share. AutoNation has approximately $272 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. As of April 20, there were approximately 114 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio decreased to 2.2x at the end of Q1 as compared to 2.3x at the end of Q4. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net-debt basis, and this includes used floorplan availability. And our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $63 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales.
Our quarter-end cash balance was $74 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $900 million at the end of March.
The finance team remains committed to supporting our operational partners with a unified focus on driving long-term shareholder value.

This marked our 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis and compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise.
Total gross profit for variable operations was $459 million, up 12%. Total variable growth was $3,406 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $67 or 2%. New and used same-store sale unit volume was up 10%. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, an increase of $277 million or 11%.
We retailed 76,900 units, an increase of 9%. New vehicle gross profit was $2,005 on a per vehicle retail basis, off slightly due to continued pressure in Import segment as well as growth in volume of entry-level Premium Luxury models.
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $121 million or 13%. Used vehicle retailed were 57,400, up 11%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,738 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $42 or 2%.
As you might remember in Q1 2014, we focused on maximizing margins due to our tight inventory supply. We are well positioned with our used inventory for the second quarter. We increased our total store used units by 26% compared to last year and our current total store used vehicle inventory levels at 34 days.
Customer financial services gross profit set an all-time record at $1,515 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $114 or 8%. Approximately 2/3 of our gross profit per vehicle retailed was related to customer financial service products, and approximately 1/3 was related to finance.
Total gross profit per customer financial services of $203 million was up $32 million or 19% compared to the period a year ago. We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we guard store-level execution and offer products that build customer value and loyalty.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $723 million, an increase of $56 million or 8%. We've set an all-time record high in customer care gross profit of $310 million, an increase of $26 million or 9%.
Customer pay gross was $124 million, up 4%. This was our 19th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross.
Warranty gross was $60 million, up 19%. Collision gross was $29 million, up 11%.
Excluding the impact of elevated recalls, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in customer care.
I would like to thank all 24,500 associates for a job well done this quarter. As an organization, we remain focused on driving sales, driving service and building the AutoNation brand.
I'll now turn the call over to Jon Ferrando."

AutoNation has also signed an agreement to acquire a Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo store in our Spokane, Washington market. This will give us 25 franchises in the state of Washington.
As previously announced, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a Mercedes-Benz store in Reno, Nevada and a Volkswagen store in Atlanta. The combined annual revenue for our 5 acquisitions since the beginning of 2015, including the Spokane acquisition, which we expect to complete in early May, is approximately $320 million.

Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our auto retail markets as well as markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure.
As for M&A market conditions, there is a solid pipeline of potential opportunities in the marketplace. While we have not seen a material increase in competition for deals, we have seen an uptick in sellers testing the market with unrealistic expectations.
We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

It's working for all the protected classes. It's working for the banks, and it's working for the retailers. So it's a very efficient, effective system.

This is the 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth and EPS from continuing operations. 
Second quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.2 billion compared to $4.8 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 9%, driven by stronger performance in all our business sectors. Total gross profit was an all-time record at $819 million compared to $745 million in the year ago period, an increase of 10%. 
Operating income was a second quarter record at $220 million compared to $198 million in the year ago period, an increase of 12%. 
In the second quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased by 6% or 4% on the same-store sales basis. 
Last week, Financial [indiscernible], a Honda  financial services, announced a new policy for dealer reserve. It does not affect the dealer economics but achieves the CFPB's goal of reducing dealer reserve discretion. We have applaud Honda Financial Services for developing an enlightened solution that could become a template for the industry. 
Regarding our digital initiatives. We have accelerated the rollout of AutoNation Express.

AutoNation expresses and  encompasses our continued commitment to delivering a peerless customer experience.

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $115 million or $1 per share versus net income of $101 million or $0.83 per share during the second quarter of 2014, a 20% improvement on a per share basis. There were no adjustment to net income in either periods. 
In the second quarter, revenue increased $436 million or 9% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $74 million or 10%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.4% for the quarter, which represents a 100 basis-point decrease compared to the year ago period. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $16 million, an increase of $2 million from the second quarter of 2014 primarily due to higher floorplan assistance. Floorplan assistance increased due to higher new vehicle sales and an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit. 
Floorplan debt increased sequentially, approximately $319 million during the second quarter to $3.3 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased borrowings in our new and used floorplan facilities, which was driven by higher inventory levels supporting current sales trends and newly-acquired stores. 
Nonvehicle interest expense increased slightly to $21.6 million compared to $21.3 million the second quarter of 2014 due to higher debt balances. At the end of June, we had $2.1 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $73 million compared to March 31, 2015. 
In addition to our fixed-rate debt, this balance includes $800 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $299 million of commercial paper.  The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71.6 million or 38.3%. 
During the second quarter 2015, we repurchased 796,000 shares for $50 million at an average price of $62.78 per share. AutoNation has approximately $217 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. 
As of July 20, there were approximately 113 million shares outstanding, and, again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. 
Our leverage ratio remained at 2.2x at the end of Q2 as compared to Q1. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $65.2 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $65 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.1 billion at the end of June. We plan to use the revolving credit facility as liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. 
At quarter end, we had $299 million of commercial paper notes outstanding, which an effect reduces our available liquidity to $806 million. 
We remain committed to driving company value and shareholder returns through disciplined capital allocation as we continue to invest in strategic digital initiatives, acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchase.

AutoNation posted record second quarter results with growth across all business sectors. We reported an all time record in total gross profits, used vehicle revenue, customer care revenue and customer care gross profit. 
In the second quarter, we set records in operating income, net income from continuing operations and this marks our 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Going forward, my comments will be in the same-store basis and compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise. 
Total gross profit for variable operations was $459 million, up 6%. Total variable growth was $3307 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $30 or 1%. New and used the same-store sale unit volume was up 5%. 
New vehicle growth revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, an increase of $144 million or 5%. We retailed 83,000 units, an increase of 4%. New vehicle gross profit was $1905 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $106 or 5%. 
We continue to experience new car PVR pressure in the Import segment, increased tenant as well as growth in entry-level Premium Luxury models. However, our focus remains on the total variable operations. 
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $86 million or 9% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicle retail were 55,800, up 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,590 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $95 or 6%. 
Customer financial services growth profit was $1,520 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $133 or 10%. Approximately 2/3 of our gross profit per vehicle retailed was related to customer financial service product and 1/3 was related to finance. 
Total gross profit for customer financial services of $212 million was up $28 million or 15% compared to the period a year ago. 
During the quarter, we rolled out the first AutoNation branded products, the AutoNation Vehicle Protection Plan or VPP in our central region. The initial launch of VPP has been well received by our associates in the marketplace. 
By the end of the third quarter, the program will roll out nationwide through our meeting Domestic and Import stores. 
Over the remainder of the year, we will also pilot additional AutoNation branded products. We continue to see opportunity to customer financial services as we drive store-level execution and offer product to deliver customer value and drive loyalty. 
As Mike mentioned earlier, we do not expect the financial impact to our business from Honda Financial Services, new dealer reserve policy. The new policy provides compensation in addition to the dealer reserve which is capped to 100 to 125 basis points based on the term of the loan. We believe Honda's new policy could become attractive template for the industry. 
In the quarter, customer care revenue was an all-time record of $751 million, an increase of $51 million or 7%. We set another all-time customer in customer care and gross profit of $324 million, an increase of $26 million or 9%. 
Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 8%, our 20th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross. 
Warranty gross was $62 million, up 11%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 12%. 
Turning to digital. Though we're still in the early phases of the rollout, we're pleased with the growth of traffic to our website. AutoNation's website generate over 20% of sales for the first half of the year. We completed the first phase of AutoNation Express 6 months ahead of schedule. 
We remain committed to providing transparency and delivering a peerless customer experience initiatives such as AutoNation Express. 
Thanks to the efforts of our 25,000 associates, we achieved an unprecedented milestone in automotive history with the sale of our 10 million vehicle. We continue to build on this momentum I the second half of the year by selling and servicing one car at a time to our next milestone.

And I think the Honda solutions is quite enlightened in that by putting cash in place that dramatically reduced the amount of discretion that exists at the -- on the individual transaction at the store level is dramatically reduced. And in principle, AutoNation moved in that direction a decade ago. But with the capital only 100 to 125 basis points, the economics would change, and that's not acceptable as a solution and everyone agreed. CFPB lenders and certainly retailers that the added value that dealers have on indirect lending is significant and that the compensation we were receiving was fair and justified, and this was not about changing that. So there is additional compensation system that comes to the dealers for having originated the loan that is built into the base rate from Honda. So we've looked at it. We say that this kept us hold back to where we are and addresses CFPB issues. And I think it's workable for the lenders. So AutoNation is publicly supporting this direction. We will work with Honda closely on working out any bugs in the system to make sure we achieve this goal. And we will urge other lenders to take a close look at this as a template for a solution and pledge to those lenders if they go in this direction, they will have AutoNation's full support."

Also, as I laid out years ago that we would reduce our dependency on third parties and there would be a vetting process to determine who we could partner with in the long-term of third parties but that we expect to ultimately be in the high single digits. We came to a fork in the road with TrueCar, which is 3% of our business in the second quarter, and that money will be reinvested in the AutoNation brand and AutoNation Express going forward.

We intend to fully make our site transactional for every phase of the business. And we think combined with our brand positioning to attract consumers to our site, give them a good experience, the most important thing is on site, they want to be able to do something, the sites need to be transactional. This combination of a strong brand with consumer empowered transactional sites, that is seamlessly integrated into the dealerships is something no one else in the industry is doing, and we're convinced it will be a significant competitive advantage for us in the long-term.

And also there is a large number of dealers who have not narrowed their bandwidth on their financing reserves, had not installed disciplined caps.

It's a good brand mix, including Premium Luxury so we feel like we been able to execute on opportunities in the marketplace. I would say, currently, we continue to see a solid, strong pipeline of potential deals out there, and we are well positioned for a number of reasons to continue to execute on acquisitions that will provide a strong return on capital. So we'll continue to be prudent. We see good opportunities, and we're well positioned to execute."

And you can't expect these extremely low interest rates forever, and it could, actually, be a very healthy sign for the economy that you're telling everyone, this crisis is over. And I think we will go on selling high 16 million, 17 million vehicles in a more normal interest rate environment. Inflation appears to be far away, so above-average rates are something over the horizon from this point of view. As far as to quantify exactly what the cost is of 100 basis points, do you have that Cheryl?"

If you think about from a customer perspective, for instance, if you have a 1% increase in interest rate, that's less than $15 a month. On the average 30,000, 60 months lens. We always think first about impacting customer. And as Mike said in a slow steady rise, that can be very manageable. We've got $2.1 billion of corporate debt, that's 56 splitting and then we've got $3.3 billion of floorplans, which flows but to John's point earlier discussion that we had, you have the assistance of that, you can manage inventory levels you can see where the OEMs go over that fixed-rate assistance on a per vehicle basis to help offset that. The underlying theme though -- this a cyclical business, we've been through interest rate cycles and rises before, we think it's manageable. We think usually the customer is -- tends to be better positioned, which is part of why the rates are rising. And overall, for the economy, we think it's a healthy thing, we're prepared for it. An example of the things that we do in light of it is commercial paper program. So we were able to secure $300 million of financing at a market rate, which are substantially lower than our revolver. So we're looking for ways to continue to reduce spreads and look at alternative instruments where possible to help lower blended rate where we can. And I think that's a great thing about a strong balance sheet is the ability to make sure that we're hitting pockets of the market. There's a lot of capital out there, so we're going to hit pockets of the market where we can be flexible and opportunistic at lower cost rates."

I don't believe either of those, I think it's high $16 million, $17 million is trend. I think the average age is still pushed out to 11.5, 11.6 years. Interest rates are still going to be very reasonable for consumers. I've seen the product portfolio from the manufacturers, it's extraordinary, the best ever. And it looks like gas prices are going to be low for extended period of times. So it's hard to say anything past 3 years, but I think we still have several years to go of high 16, 17, and it's too far over the horizon to say how many. When will it end? When inflation rears its head and the Federal Reserve begins increasing interest rates above normal aggressively to tap down inflation, there will be the downturn in housing and there will be a downturn in auto sales. I am absolutely convinced Cheryl said it earlier, we remain in the cyclical business, and that is not going to change. We'll be prepared for it, we will outperform on it. If our stock falls out the significant favor during the period, we'll view it as buying opportunity. So we really have -- we really -- we can create shareholder value anywhere in the cycle, any time in the cycle, but I think it's high 16, 17. If you want us -- so we all can manage 18, 19, so let's not talk about that. Those who argue for '4, let's say, two things that car sharing is going to have a significant impact on the marketplace, I think car sharing has its place in the marketplace. I think it's wonderful. I think Uber is a great company, but just add up, there's 3 trillion miles driven a year in the United States, how many miles are driven on our car sharing. It's an indispensable part of the marketplace. It will have its place, but it's not going to structure really change the selling volume. And we have millenniums who are going to buy cars, that's the other argument, they're not going to get driver's license, they're not going to drive cars. We talk about the generation everyday. They have a student debt problem that they need to work off, it's a 4- to 5-year delay in what they normally would be doing and are thus, but they want their own, the want to get married, they want to have kids, and they want to have a car. And so that is going to become the biggest generation buying new vehicles in. And so I'm right smack there in the middle, high 16 -- high 17 million, high 16 million to 17 million I think that's sustainable over the next several years."

Today, we reported record second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of $1, a 20% increase as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $0.83 for the same period in the prior year. This is the 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in EPS from continuing operations.
Second quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.2 billion compared to $4.8 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 9%, driven by stronger performance in all our business sectors. Total gross profit was an all-time record at $819 million compared to $745 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 10%.
Operating income was a second quarter record at $220 million (sic) [ $222 million ] compared to $198 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 12%.
In the second quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased by 6% or 4% on the same-store sales basis.
Last week, Financial Honda -- Honda Financial Services, announced a new policy for dealer reserve. It does not affect the dealer economics, but achieves the CFPB's goal of reducing dealer reserve discretion. We applaud Honda Financial Services for developing an enlightened solution that could become a template for the industry.
Regarding our digital initiatives. We have accelerated the rollout of AutoNation Express. The first phase of the rollout, identifying and reserving a specific vehicle online, has been well received by the marketplace and our associates. AutoNation Express encompasses our continued commitment to delivering a peerless customer experience.
I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $115 million or $1 per share versus net income of $101 million or $0.83 per share during the second quarter of 2014, a 20% improvement on a per share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period.
In the second quarter, revenue increased $436 million or 9% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $74 million or 10%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.4% for the quarter, which represents a 100 basis-point decrease compared to the year-ago period.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $16 million, an increase of $2 million from the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance. Floorplan assistance increased due to higher new vehicle sales and an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit.
Floorplan debt increased sequentially, approximately $319 million during the second quarter to $3.3 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased borrowings in our new and used floorplan facilities, which was driven by higher inventory levels supporting current sales trends and newly acquired stores.
Nonvehicle interest expense increased slightly to $21.6 million compared to $21.3 million the second quarter of 2014 due to higher debt balances. At the end of June, we had $2.1 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $73 million compared to March 31, 2015.
In addition to our fixed-rate debt, this balance includes $800 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $299 million of commercial paper.  The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71.6 million or 38.3%.
During the second quarter 2015, we repurchased 796,000 shares for $50 million at an average price of $62.78 per share. AutoNation has approximately $217 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase.
As of July 20, there were approximately 113 million shares outstanding, and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio remained at 2.2x at the end of Q2 as compared to Q1. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $65.2 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales.
Our quarter end cash balance was $65 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of $1.1 billion at the end of June. We plan to use the revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program.
At quarter end, we had $299 million of commercial paper notes outstanding, which in effect reduces our available liquidity to $806 million.
We remain committed to driving company value and shareholder returns through disciplined capital allocation as we continue to invest in strategic digital initiatives, acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchase.

AutoNation posted record second quarter results with growth across all business sectors. We reported all-time record in total gross profits, used vehicle revenue, customer care revenue and customer care gross profit.
In the second quarter, we set records in operating income, net income from continuing operations, and this marked our 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.
Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis and compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise.
Total gross profit for variable operations was $459 million, up 6%. Total variable gross was $3,307 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $30 or 1%. New and used same-store sale unit volume was up 5%.
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, an increase of $144 million or 5%. We retailed 83,000 units, an increase of 4%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,905 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $106 or 5%.
We continue to experience new car PVR pressure in the Import segment, increased dealership incentives, as well as growth in entry-level premium luxury models. However, our focus remains on the total variable operation.
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $86 million or 9% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicle retail were 55,800, up 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,590 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $95 or 6%.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,528 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $133 or 10%. Approximately 2/3 of our gross profit per vehicle retailed was related to customer financial service product and 1/3 was related to finance. Total gross profit for customer financial services of $212 million was up $28 million or 15% compared to the period a year ago.
During the quarter, we rolled out the first AutoNation-branded product, the AutoNation Vehicle Protection Plan or VPP in our central region. The initial launch of VPP has been well received by our associates and the marketplace. By the end of the third quarter, the program will be rolled out nationwide to our many domestic and import stores.
Over the remainder of the year, we will also pilot additional AutoNation-branded products. We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we drive store-level execution and offer product to deliver customer value and drive loyalty.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we do not expect a financial impact to our business from Honda Financial Services' new dealer reserve policy. The new policy provides compensation in addition to the dealer reserve, which is capped at 100 to 125 basis points based on the term of the loan. We believe Honda's new policy could become an attractive template for the industry.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was at an all-time record of $751 million, an increase of $51 million or 7%. We set another all-time record in customer care gross profit of $324 million, an increase of $26 million or 9%.
Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 8%, our 20th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross.
Warranty gross was $62 million, up 11%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 12%.
Turning to digital. Though we are still in the early phases of the rollout, we are pleased with the growth of traffic to our websites. AutoNation websites generated over 20% of sales for the first half of the year. We completed the first phase of AutoNation Express 6 months ahead of schedule. We remain committed to providing transparency and delivering a peerless customer experience through initiatives such as AutoNation Express.
Thanks to the efforts of our 25,000 associates, we achieved an unprecedented milestone in automotive history with the sale of our 10 millionth vehicle. We will continue to build on this momentum in the second half of the year by selling and servicing one car at a time to our next milestone.

It's something that while in principle everyone agreed that discrimination or unintentional disparate impact is not something that should exist in auto retail, how to get there was quite a contentious dilemma. And I think the Honda solution is quite enlightened in that by putting caps in place that have dramatically reduced the amount of discretion that exist at the -- on the individual transaction at the store level was dramatically reduced. And in principle, AutoNation moved in that direction a decade ago. But with a cap of only 100 to 125 basis points, the economics would change, and that's not acceptable as a solution. And everyone agreed, CFPB, lenders and certainly retailers, that the added value that dealers have on indirect lending is significant and that the compensation we were receiving was fair and justified, and this was not about changing that. So there is additional compensation system that comes to the dealers for having originated the loan that is built into the base rate from Honda. So we've looked at it. We say, this gets us whole, back to where we are and addresses CFPB issues. And I think it's workable for the lenders. So AutoNation is publicly supporting this direction. We will work with Honda closely on working out any bugs in the system to make sure we achieve this goal. And we will urge other lenders to take a close look at this as a template for a solution and pledge to those lenders if they go in this direction, they will have AutoNation's full support."

I think for smaller dealers, the ever-increasing regulatory burden in principle -- and by the way, you can look at that for all business, whether we're talking about how you keep track of overtime, how you deal with health care, the regulatory environment now here around the CFPB, it's a regulatory burden for smaller companies in principle in America is getting more and more difficult. And also, there is a large number of dealers who have not narrowed their bandwidth on their financing reserves, have not installed discipline caps. And so they have much further to go to get to a solution like Honda. Now I can't begin to tell you whether that's going to change the acquisition environment. I will tell you though that this regulatory burden and difficulty of doing business and the complexity of the demands from the OEMs, you need a Ph.D. to keep track of these incentive programs. It is making the world much more difficult and you need a certain size and a certain structure and a certain discipline to be able to manage it all. So I think the willing sellers are going to be standing there for quite some time."

First, we're building the brand, AutoNation, and the metric I can give you there is that the awareness and consideration of doing business with AutoNation in a relatively short period of time, just over 2 years, has already exceeded all the legacy brands. It's just a tremendous launch and embraced by the marketplace. The next metric we look at -- and we've changed our marketing to drive much more traffic to AutoNation sites -- is what is the yield or what is the business generated from AutoNation sites by raising the visibility of our brand in all the ways you do in the digital marketplace and then how do you prove the experience that you have ever higher customer satisfaction and higher closing rates. And again, I'll just give you their very broad metric from -- before we started this effort, AutoNation's digital sites generated less than 10% of the business. And now, we're over 20% of the business. So that's a doubling since the brand launch and the investments to improve the experience on the AutoNation sites. So you look at that report card and you say, ""Yes, this is working."""

That's roughly 56% floating. And then we've got $3.3 billion of floorplan which floats, but to John's point earlier, the discussion that we had, you have assistance on that so you can manage inventory levels, you can see where the OEMs go with that fixed-rate assistance on a per vehicle basis to help offset that. The underlying theme though, this a cyclical business, we've been through interest rate cycles and rises before. We think it's manageable. We think usually the customer is -- tends to be better positioned, which is part of why the rates are rising. And overall, for the economy, we think it's a healthy thing. We're prepared for it. An example of the things that we do in light of it is commercial paper program. So we were able to secure $300 million of financing out at market rates which are substantially lower than our revolver. So we're looking for ways to continue to reduce spreads and look at alternative instruments where possible to help lower our blended rate where we can. And I think that's the great thing about a strong balance sheet is the ability to make sure that we're hitting pockets of the market. There's a lot of capital out there.

I've seen the product portfolio from the manufacturers, it's extraordinary, the best ever. And it looks like gas prices are going to be low for an extended period of time. So it's hard to say anything past 3 years, but I think we still have several years to go of high 16 million, 17 million, and it's too far over the horizon to say how many. When will it end? When inflation rears its head and the Federal Reserve begins increasing interest rates above normal aggressively to tap down inflation. There will be the downturn in housing and there will be a downturn in auto sales. I am absolutely convinced, Cheryl said it earlier, we remain in a cyclical business, and that is not going to change. We'll be prepared for it. We will outperform in it. If our stock falls out of significant favor during that period, we'll view it as a buying opportunity. So we really have -- we really think we can create shareholder value anywhere in the cycle, any time in the cycle, but I think it's high 16 million, 17 million. If you want to -- so we all can manage 18 million, 19 million, okay, so let's not even talk about that. Those who argue for 14 million that say 2 things. That car sharing is going to have a significant impact on the marketplace. I think car sharing has its place in the marketplace. I think it's wonderful. I think Uber is a great company. But just somebody add up, there's 3 trillion miles driven a year in the United States, how many miles are driven on car sharing. It's an infinitesimal part of the marketplace. It will have its place, but it's not going to structurally change the selling volume. And we have millennials who are not going to buy cars, that's the other argument. They're not going to get driver's license. They're not going to drive cars. We talk to that generation every day. They have a student debt problem that they need to work off. It's a 4- to 5-year delay in what they normally would be doing in their lives. But they want their own home, they want to get married, they want to have kids, and they want to have a car. And so that is going to become the biggest generation buying new vehicles in. And so I'm right smack there in the middle, high 16 million, high 7 -- high 16 million to 17 million, and I think that's sustainable over the next several years."

This is the 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in EPS from continuing operations.
Second quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.2 billion compared to $4.8 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 9%, driven by stronger performance in all our business sectors. Total gross profit was an all-time record at $819 million compared to $745 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 10%.
Operating income was a second quarter record at $220 million (sic) [ $222 million ] compared to $198 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 12%.
In the second quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased by 6% or 4% on the same-store sales basis.
Last week, Financial Honda -- Honda Financial Services, announced a new policy for dealer reserve. It does not affect the dealer economics, but achieves the CFPB's goal of reducing dealer reserve discretion. We applaud Honda Financial Services for developing an enlightened solution that could become a template for the industry.

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $115 million or $1 per share versus net income of $101 million or $0.83 per share during the second quarter of 2014, a 20% improvement on a per share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period.
In the second quarter, revenue increased $436 million or 9% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $74 million or 10%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.4% for the quarter, which represents a 100 basis-point decrease compared to the year-ago period.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $16 million, an increase of $2 million from the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher floorplan assistance. Floorplan assistance increased due to higher new vehicle sales and an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit.
Floorplan debt increased sequentially, approximately $319 million during the second quarter to $3.3 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased borrowings in our new and used floorplan facilities, which was driven by higher inventory levels supporting current sales trends and newly acquired stores.
Nonvehicle interest expense increased slightly to $21.6 million compared to $21.3 million the second quarter of 2014 due to higher debt balances. At the end of June, we had $2.1 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $73 million compared to March 31, 2015.
In addition to our fixed-rate debt, this balance includes $800 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $299 million of commercial paper.  The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71.6 million or 38.3%.
During the second quarter 2015, we repurchased 796,000 shares for $50 million at an average price of $62.78 per share. AutoNation has approximately $217 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase.
As of July 20, there were approximately 113 million shares outstanding, and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio remained at 2.2x at the end of Q2 as compared to Q1. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $65.2 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales.
Our quarter end cash balance was $65 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of $1.1 billion at the end of June. We plan to use the revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program.
At quarter end, we had $299 million of commercial paper notes outstanding, which in effect reduces our available liquidity to $806 million.
We remain committed to driving company value and shareholder returns through disciplined capital allocation as we continue to invest in strategic digital initiatives, acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchase.
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

AutoNation posted record second quarter results with growth across all business sectors. We reported all-time record in total gross profits, used vehicle revenue, customer care revenue and customer care gross profit.
In the second quarter, we set records in operating income, net income from continuing operations, and this marked our 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.
Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis and compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise.
Total gross profit for variable operations was $459 million, up 6%. Total variable gross was $3,307 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $30 or 1%. New and used same-store sale unit volume was up 5%.
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, an increase of $144 million or 5%. We retailed 83,000 units, an increase of 4%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,905 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $106 or 5%.
We continue to experience new car PVR pressure in the Import segment, increased dealership incentives, as well as growth in entry-level premium luxury models. However, our focus remains on the total variable operation.
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $86 million or 9% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicle retail were 55,800, up 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,590 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $95 or 6%.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,528 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $133 or 10%. Approximately 2/3 of our gross profit per vehicle retailed was related to customer financial service product and 1/3 was related to finance. Total gross profit for customer financial services of $212 million was up $28 million or 15% compared to the period a year ago.
During the quarter, we rolled out the first AutoNation-branded product, the AutoNation Vehicle Protection Plan or VPP in our central region. The initial launch of VPP has been well received by our associates and the marketplace. By the end of the third quarter, the program will be rolled out nationwide to our many domestic and import stores.
Over the remainder of the year, we will also pilot additional AutoNation-branded products. We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we drive store-level execution and offer product to deliver customer value and drive loyalty.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we do not expect a financial impact to our business from Honda Financial Services' new dealer reserve policy. The new policy provides compensation in addition to the dealer reserve, which is capped at 100 to 125 basis points based on the term of the loan. We believe Honda's new policy could become an attractive template for the industry.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was at an all-time record of $751 million, an increase of $51 million or 7%. We set another all-time record in customer care gross profit of $324 million, an increase of $26 million or 9%.
Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 8%, our 20th consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross.
Warranty gross was $62 million, up 11%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 12%.
Turning to digital. Though we are still in the early phases of the rollout, we are pleased with the growth of traffic to our websites. AutoNation websites generated over 20% of sales for the first half of the year. We completed the first phase of AutoNation Express 6 months ahead of schedule. We remain committed to providing transparency and delivering a peerless customer experience through initiatives such as AutoNation Express.
Thanks to the efforts of our 25,000 associates, we achieved an unprecedented milestone in automotive history with the sale of our 10 millionth vehicle. We will continue to build on this momentum in the second half of the year by selling and servicing one car at a time to our next milestone.
I'll now turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

I think the Honda agreement is very enlightened. It's something that while in principle everyone agreed that discrimination or unintentional disparate impact is not something that should exist in auto retail, how to get there was quite a contentious dilemma. And I think the Honda solution is quite enlightened in that by putting caps in place that have dramatically reduced the amount of discretion that exist at the -- on the individual transaction at the store level was dramatically reduced. And in principle, AutoNation moved in that direction a decade ago. But with a cap of only 100 to 125 basis points, the economics would change, and that's not acceptable as a solution. And everyone agreed, CFPB, lenders and certainly retailers, that the added value that dealers have on indirect lending is significant and that the compensation we were receiving was fair and justified, and this was not about changing that. So there is additional compensation system that comes to the dealers for having originated the loan that is built into the base rate from Honda. So we've looked at it. We say, this gets us whole, back to where we are and addresses CFPB issues. And I think it's workable for the lenders. So AutoNation is publicly supporting this direction. We will work with Honda closely on working out any bugs in the system to make sure we achieve this goal. And we will urge other lenders to take a close look at this as a template for a solution and pledge to those lenders if they go in this direction, they will have AutoNation's full support."

We were operating under a contract that had acceptable terms. That contract expired end of February, beginning of March. TrueCar demanded in the new contract that we give them all our customer information. In our old contract, we gave TrueCar no customer information. We gave them anonymous data, but we gave them no customer information. This is an unprecedented demand. They weren't asking for the 3%, they were asking for 100%. And we've never given -- I don't know what company gives away 100% of their customer information. I think that also if we said yes, definitely it would have created privacy issues that would have been cumbersome for us to implement and that we would have had to gotten permission from our customers to give this information to TrueCar. And we really didn't want to intrude into a sales transaction by saying, ""Oh, Mr. Smith, you've never heard of TrueCar? But do you mind if we send them all the information on this transaction?"" That's something -- we really wanted to protect the privacy of our customers. And TrueCar was making this demand saying this is how they operate with all their dealerships. And while I certainly didn't investigate that other than to say, ""I don't think that's true. I think they operate quite differently with other companies. I think this is a new demand that we cannot agree to."" So I think it was a demand that we could not agree to that was based on a false premise.

If you think about from a customer perspective, for instance, if you have a 1% increase in interest rate, that's less than $15 a month on the average $30,000 60-month loan. So we always think first about impact on the customer. And as Mike said, in a slow, steady rise, that's going to be very manageable. We've got $2.1 billion of corporate debt. That's roughly 56% floating. And then we've got $3.3 billion of floorplan which floats, but to John's point earlier, the discussion that we had, you have assistance on that so you can manage inventory levels, you can see where the OEMs go with that fixed-rate assistance on a per vehicle basis to help offset that. The underlying theme though, this a cyclical business, we've been through interest rate cycles and rises before. We think it's manageable. We think usually the customer is -- tends to be better positioned, which is part of why the rates are rising. And overall, for the economy, we think it's a healthy thing. We're prepared for it. An example of the things that we do in light of it is commercial paper program. So we were able to secure $300 million of financing out at market rates which are substantially lower than our revolver. So we're looking for ways to continue to reduce spreads and look at alternative instruments where possible to help lower our blended rate where we can. And I think that's the great thing about a strong balance sheet is the ability to make sure that we're hitting pockets of the market. There's a lot of capital out there. So we're going to hit pockets of the market where we can be flexible and opportunistic at lower cost rates."

I think the average age is still pushed out to 11.5, 11.6 years. Interest rates are still going to be very reasonable for consumers. I've seen the product portfolio from the manufacturers, it's extraordinary, the best ever. And it looks like gas prices are going to be low for an extended period of time. So it's hard to say anything past 3 years, but I think we still have several years to go of high 16 million, 17 million, and it's too far over the horizon to say how many. When will it end? When inflation rears its head and the Federal Reserve begins increasing interest rates above normal aggressively to tap down inflation. There will be the downturn in housing and there will be a downturn in auto sales. I am absolutely convinced, Cheryl said it earlier, we remain in a cyclical business, and that is not going to change. We'll be prepared for it. We will outperform in it. If our stock falls out of significant favor during that period, we'll view it as a buying opportunity. So we really have -- we really think we can create shareholder value anywhere in the cycle, any time in the cycle, but I think it's high 16 million, 17 million. If you want to -- so we all can manage 18 million, 19 million, okay, so let's not even talk about that. Those who argue for 14 million that say 2 things. That car sharing is going to have a significant impact on the marketplace. I think car sharing has its place in the marketplace. I think it's wonderful. I think Uber is a great company. But just somebody add up, there's 3 trillion miles driven a year in the United States, how many miles are driven on car sharing. It's an infinitesimal part of the marketplace. It will have its place, but it's not going to structurally change the selling volume. And we have millennials who are not going to buy cars, that's the other argument. They're not going to get driver's license. They're not going to drive cars. We talk to that generation every day. They have a student debt problem that they need to work off. It's a 4- to 5-year delay in what they normally would be doing in their lives. But they want their own home, they want to get married, they want to have kids, and they want to have a car. And so that is going to become the biggest generator -- generation buying new vehicles in. And so I'm right smack there in the middle, high 16 million, high 7 -- high 16 million to 17 million, and I think that's sustainable over the next several years."

It's been very successful. It's our flagship development program. We think it helps us attract great talent into the company. When we go out and acquire businesses, that's a great selling point for sellers that we offer tremendous careers, and we back it up for great talent by making major investments in people and AN University is one example of it. It is a large investment. It's 5 weeks of their time throughout a year along with mentorship along the way. So we're able to attract, retain and develop great talent through the investment. And in fact, Bill and I have been working on a number of ways to expand that to other positions within the company as well as with Cheryl on the finance side. So we continue to expand our university development offerings to talented people that want to go further with their career."

This is",390,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported an all-time record earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.05, a 17% increase as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $0.90 for the same period in the prior year. This is our 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in EPS from continuing operations. 
Third quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 9%, driven by stronger performance in all of our business sectors. 
Total gross profit was $830 million compared to $753 million in the year ago period, an increase of 10%. Operating income was $236 million compared to $207 million in the year ago period, an increase of 14%. 
In the third quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased by 7% or 5% on a same-store basis. 
Today, AutoNation also announced the acquisition of Allen Samuels Auto Group closed stores with approximately $800 million in annual revenue, spanning across 6 Texas markets. 
Since the beginning of 2015, we have announced acquisitions with roughly $1.7 billion in annual revenue, of which $1 billion is Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, Dodge-related. 
We will continue to pursue acquisitions that leverage our scale, expand the AutoNation brand and provide strong returns for our shareholders. 
The third quarter was also pivotal for AutoNation. We continue to build the AutoNation brand, execute our digital strategy, showing our website currently represent over 25% of our unit sales and third-party leads now represent less than 9% of our unit sales. 
We did all of these and delivered an all-time record EPS from continuing operation. 
In the third quarter, we announced an unprecedented industry-leading recall policy. It's simple. We will not sell, lease, wholesale or view or trade any new or used vehicle that has an open recall. We have made it our responsibility to identify and remove these vehicles from our inventories until their recall issues have been addressed. 
This will require us to build used inventory levels through the fourth quarter. We expect our used business to normalize in the first half of 2016 once our used inventory levels are ramped down. This is a significant brand attribute that differentiates AutoNation from, that no competitor has matched, not even CarMax.

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $119 million or $1.05 per share versus net income of $107 million or $0.90 per share during the third quarter of 2014, a 17% improvement on a per share basis.  There were no adjustments to net income in either periods. 
In the third quarter, revenue increased $445 million or 9% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $77 million or 10%. 
SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 68.5% for the quarter, which represents a 90 basis point decrease compared to the year ago period.  The provision for income tax in the quarter was $76.3 million or 39.1%. 
On September 21, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $300 million of notes at 3.35%, which were scheduled to mature in 2021 as well as $450 million of notes at 4.5%, which are scheduled to mature in 2025. 
The transaction represented our debut investment-grade bond financing and was extremely well received by investors. The note proceeds were primarily used to reduce borrowings  under our existing revolving credit facility. This resulted in an increase in our percentage of fixed rate nonvehicle debt to 80% at the end of the quarter from 48% at June 30, 2015. 
Returning to third quarter results. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $17 million, an increase of $2 million from the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased new vehicle unit sales as well as higher floorplan assistance rate per unit. 
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $118 million during the third quarter to $3.2 billion at quarter end, primarily due to reduced borrowings under our used vehicle floorplan facilities. 
Nonvehicle interest expense decreased slightly to $21.4 million compared to $21.7 million in the third quarter of 2014. 
The decrease in interest expense was driven by lower interest rates associated with the refinancing of our credit facility in December 2014 and the establishment of our commercial paper program in May of this year. 
At the end of September, we had $2.2 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $77 million compared to June 30, 2015. Nonvehicle debt includes $435 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of September, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. 
I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017. 
During the third quarter 2015, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $59.83 per share. 
As of October 26th, we had approximately $297 million of board authorization remaining for share repurchase and there were approximately 111 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. 
Our leverage ratio remained at 2.2x at the end of Q3 as compared to Q2. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $27.9 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis and exclude operating lease buyouts  and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $64 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.8 billion at the end of September. We continue to use our revolving credit facility at the liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. As I mentioned a moment ago, we had $435 million of commercial paper outstanding at year-end, which in effect, at quarter end -- which in effect, reduces available liquidity to $1.3 billion. 
We continue to leverage our strong operating results and cash flow generation in order to make strategic investments in our business in addition to opportunistic acquisitions and share repurchase. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

AutoNation posted record results in the third quarter. We set an all-time record in EPS from continuing operations. This was our 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis when compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise. 
Gross profit for variable operations was $467 million, up 6%. Variable gross were $3,282 on a per vehicle retailed basis, an increase of $103 or 3%. New and used same-store unit volumes was up 3%. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of $201 million or 7%. We retailed 87,400 units, an increase of 5%. 
New vehicle gross profit was $1,877 on a per vehicle retailed basis, which was relatively flat compared to the same period a year ago. 
We are pleased with our new vehicle PVR performance for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential increase in PVRs in the $200 range due to the seasonal mixed shift towards Premium Luxury. 
Our pivotal way from less profitable third-party lead providers helps offset new PVR competitor pressures, new vehicle PVRs from our self-generated sales, including customer financial services are approximately $800 higher than new vehicle PVRs from third-party sales. 
Regarding our digital strategies, AutoNation website currently generate over 25% of our unit sales. Sales from third-party lease now represents under 9% of our unit sales. 
Used vehicle retail revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of $24 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicles retail were relatively flat year-over-year at 55,900. 
Used vehicle gross profit was $1,509 on a vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $112 or 7%. 
As Mike mentioned in the third quarter, we set an auto retail industry standard and decided not to sell, lease or wholesale any new or used vehicle that has an open recall. 
As of September 30, 6% of our inventory, which represents less than 2% of our new vehicle inventory and approximately 16% of our used vehicle inventory, was not available for sale due to open recalls. We will continue to build our used vehicle inventory levels to ensure we have adequate supply to meet customer demand. 
In the third quarter, our used vehicle sales were slowed by our recall policy, and we expect to see an impact in the fourth quarter as well. Putting our customers first is the right thing to do. We believe the short-term investments are outweighed by the long-term safety benefits for our customers and supports the AutoNation brand promise. 
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,549 on a per vehicle retailed basis, an increase of $146 or 10%. 
Total gross profit per customer financial services of $222 million was up $26 million or 14% compared to the period a year ago. 
In the quarter, customer care revenue was an all-time record at $757 million, an increase of $44 million or 6%. 
We set another all-time record in customer care gross profit of $330 million, an increase of $28 million or 9%. 
Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 7%, our 21st consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross profit. 
Warranty gross was $67 million, up 15%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 13%. 
In the third quarter, we announced the Drive Pink campaign from coast-to-coast. Our Drive Pink campaign ties into the first-ever AutoNation tier ball which is held at Orlando ball on December 19 to benefit the breast cancer research foundation. AutoNation pledged $1 million to support BCRF. I would like to thank our 25,000 associates and our customers for partnering with AutoNation to raise $1 million for breast cancer research. 
Finally, I would like to welcome the Valley Motors Auto Group associates to the AutoNation family.

We're very excited today to announce the acquisition of the Allen Samuels Auto Group in Texas. In connection with the transaction, we will acquire 12 stores to generate approximately [indiscernible]   in annual revenue and retail 19,500 new and used vehicles annually. 
Stores are located in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Corpus Christi, Tyler, Ennis and at Waco markets. The franchise represented include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Sprinter. 
The acquisition is consistent with our strategy of enhancing brand representation in sales in our markets and the strong truck product offering of Allen's annuals makes it a great fit in Texas. 
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including manufacturing approval. We expect the transaction to close in Q1 2016. On completing the Allen Samuels acquisition, AutoNation will have 53 stores in the State of Texas. 
We look forward to welcoming the more than 1,000 Allen Samuels associates and tens of thousands of new customers to the AutoNation family. 
Also in September, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Valley Motors in the Baltimore market,and we're on track to complete in Q4 the acquisition of 13 stores in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee and Carl Gregory. 
In 2015, AutoNation has announced the acquisition of 33 stores, generating approximately $1.7 billion in annual revenue and since Q4 2012, AutoNation has announced acquisitions and new franchises awarded by the manufacturers that will generate $3.3 billion in annual revenue once fully operational. 
As of today, our store portfolio numbers 307 franchises and 240 stores in 15 states, representing 35 manufactured brands. These numbers will grow to 372 franchises and 265 stores upon completion of the Carl Gregory and Allen Samuels acquisition. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and a markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

It's very difficult to say what the missed opportunity was, so I'm very -- I'm not enthusiastic about putting an actual number on there other than to say there was an opportunity impact. Obviously, our used vehicle sales were stable. We had some impact on the gross as it took longer to prepare vehicles, to have a frontline ready. And there is some disruption. But we think we're going to work through all those issues over the next quarter and starting sometime in the first half of next year go back to growing the used vehicle business and improving the grosses. There are -- there will be some permanent hard cost in that we're going to increase inventory to allow for on the used side 10% to 15% of it will be tied up at all times with open recall, but I think that cost is very manageable, you can do the math on that. The building, the technology systems to manage it all both to identify the open recalls every day and to manage the process, of getting them all repaired, that's all underway, that's again a manageable cost, and it's a onetime cost. But clearly, there is some opportunity that we missed in the quarter because of the steps that we've taken. In my view, it's hard to put a number on that, but if you weigh the cost benefit both for what it needs for the industry that we're taking a leadership position in something that's clearly a black eye for the industry at the moment, namely the recall situation that AutoNation is going to part of the solution, not part of the problem, that we put our customers first, the safety of our customers first is a clear brand statement. And we see that the strength of our brand is, every year, more evident. And all you have to do is look at on the new vehicle side where we pivoted away from dependence on traffic bought from third parties to relying on our brand and our own sites and investing in those, the strength that, that gave us to unique brand attribute like the recall policy to positioning in the marketplace that the company really cares about big issues such as the fight against cancer and right now the Drive Pink is focused on breast cancer awareness and raising funds to find a cure. I think all of this is very compelling. And so yes, in used cars, we have some lost opportunity for a few quarters, but in the grand scheme of things, I think we're on it convincing and compelling growth. Because the hardest thing to do in business is to open a sustainable competitive advantage. And I think the evidence is becoming clear and fear that AutoNation is doing something special."

That's exactly what you described is happening on the digital side and the fact that if I just look at the new car business, which was primarily where Costco and TrueCar was, Joe, I think it was around 7% of our business, something like 7% of our new car business we walked away from and yet we had an outstanding performance. So if you want clear evidence to forward the brand is taking hold and that our -- the enhancement of our digital sides making better customer experience is worthwhile, and if you want -- to me, the biggest proof is look at our front-end gross new vehicles, up $33. So we walk -- the business we walked away from with TrueCar and Costco haven't have -- their front end gross on average was $900 less than the business coming through AutoNation channels. So we left our most unprofitable business behind us, our most expensive business to acquire. It weakens our brand, it did not strengthen our brand. That's why I think the third quarter is uncontestable proof that the strategy we've been talking about, investing in, has been validated, and that we're getting tremendous benefit from it. We have probably, on the pure technology side, passed the peak investment periods, but substantial investment is yet to come."

So then when you say you have a brand, the brand has to stand for something, and you see what we're doing everything from our recall policy, to Drive Pink, to our fair pricing and are very -- and capabilities in our digital side. So they are not informational, they're transactional. It took a lot of money and a lot of efforts to make that happen. So here's my point, there is a place in the marketplace -- in the market for third-party lead providers. There are dealers where it's appropriate that they do business with them. But here's the way, I think, about it, every dollar I spend on marketing today, deals a car today and sales a car tomorrow because I'm building a brand. And if I'm diverting, 30%, 40%, ultimately 50% of my marketing budget to build somebody else's brand, will play out where that ends. So that's why the third quarter is so important, we were leading up to it, it was our pivot. And clearly, it works. And in my view, every year, AutoNation is going to be stronger than the year before and all the benefits that comes from that. And so that gives us a relevancy and approachability and an; attractiveness in the marketplace that can cut through all the other choices that consumers have and give us a very interesting and compelling business.

And it's a clear expression of my confidence and optimism about those brands in the U.S. I love the fact that it's all 4 brands under one roof and that Chrysler Corporation continues to differentiate and make genuine differences in those brands. I've seen the product portfolio for the next several years, it's very compelling. But there are those who observed that Chrysler Corporation has been a boom and bust. And if you're thinking about filling something, maybe while everything is fine, it's a good thing to do it. So I think that's a factor of $1 billion out of $1.7 billion."

Total gross profit was $830 million compared to $753 million in the year ago period, an increase of 10%. Operating income was $236 million compared to $207 million in the year ago period, an increase of 14%. 
In the third quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased by 7% or 5% on a same-store basis. 
Today, AutoNation also announced the acquisition of Allen Samuels Auto Group, 12 stores with approximately $800 million in annual revenue, spanning across 6 Texas markets. 
Since the beginning of 2015, we have announced acquisitions with roughly $1.7 billion in annual revenue, of which $1 billion is Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, Dodge-related. 
We will continue to pursue acquisitions that leverage our scale, expand the AutoNation brand and provide strong returns for our shareholders. 
The third quarter was also pivotal for AutoNation. We continue to build the AutoNation brand, execute our digital strategy, showing our website currently represent over 25% of our unit sales and third-party leads now represent less than 9% of our unit sales. 
We did all of this and delivered an all-time record EPS from continuing operation. 
In the third quarter, we announced an unprecedented industry-leading recall policy. It's simple. We will not sell, lease, wholesale or deal or trade any new or used vehicle that has an open recall. We have made it our responsibility to identify and remove these vehicles from our inventory until their recall issues have been addressed. 
This will require us to build used inventory levels through the fourth quarter. We expect our used business to normalize in the first half of 2016 once our used inventory levels are ramped up. This is a significant brand attribute that differentiates AutoNation from -- that no competitor has matched, not even CarMax. 
I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $119 million or $1.05 per share versus net income of $107 million or $0.90 per share during the third quarter of 2014, a 17% improvement on a per share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either periods. 
In the third quarter, revenue increased $445 million or 9% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $77 million or 10%. 
SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 68.5% for the quarter, which represents a 90 basis point decrease compared to the year ago period. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $76.3 million or 39.1%. 
On September 21, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $300 million of notes at 3.35%, which are scheduled to mature in 2021 as well as $450 million of notes at 4.5%, which are scheduled to mature in 2025. 
The transaction represented our debut investment-grade bond financing and was extremely well received by investors. The note proceeds were primarily used to reduce borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. This resulted in an increase in our percentage of fixed rate nonvehicle debt to 80% at the end of the quarter from 48% at June 30, 2015. 
Returning to third quarter results. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $17 million, an increase of $2 million from the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased new vehicle unit sales as well as higher floorplan assistance rate per unit. 
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $118 million during the third quarter to $3.2 billion at quarter end, primarily due to reduced borrowings under our used vehicle floorplan facilities. 
Nonvehicle interest expense decreased slightly to $21.4 million compared to $21.7 million in the third quarter of 2014. 
The decrease in interest expense was driven by lower interest rates associated with the refinancing of our credit facility in December 2014 and the establishment of our commercial paper program in May of this year. 
At the end of September, we had $2.2 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $77 million compared to June 30, 2015. Nonvehicle debt includes $435 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of September, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. 
I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017. 
During the third quarter 2015, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $59.83 per share. 
As of October 26, we had approximately $297 million of board authorization remaining for share repurchase and there were approximately 111 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock option. 
Our leverage ratio remained at 2.2x at the end of Q3 as compared to Q2. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $27.9 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis and exclude operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $64 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.8 billion at the end of September. We continue to use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. As I mentioned a moment ago, we had $435 million of commercial paper outstanding at year end, which, in effect, at quarter end -- which in effect, reduces available liquidity to $1.3 billion. 
We continue to leverage our strong operating results and cash flow generation in order to make strategic investments in our business in addition to opportunistic acquisitions and share repurchase.

AutoNation posted record results in the third quarter. We set an all-time record in EPS from continuing operations. This was our 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis when compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise. 
Gross profit for variable operations was $467 million, up 6%. Variable gross was $3,282 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $103 or 3%. New and used same-store unit volumes was up 3%. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of $201 million or 7%. We retailed 87,400 units, an increase of 5%. 
New vehicle gross profit was $1,877 on a per vehicle retail basis, which was relatively flat compared to the same period a year ago. 
We are pleased with our new vehicle PVR performance for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential increase in PVRs in the $200 range due to the seasonal mixed shift towards Premium Luxury. 
Our pivotal way from less profitable third-party lead providers helped offset new PVR competitor pressures, new vehicle PVRs from our self-generated sales, including customer financial services are approximately $800 higher than new vehicle PVRs from third-party sales. 
Regarding our digital strategy, AutoNation websites currently generate over 25% of our unit sales. Sales from third-party leads now represent under 9% of our unit sales. 
Used vehicle retail revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of $24 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicles retail were relatively flat year-over-year at 55,900. 
Used vehicle gross profit was $1,509 on a vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $112 or 7%. 
As Mike mentioned in the third quarter, we set an auto retail industry standard and decided not to sell, lease or wholesale any new or used vehicle that has an open recall. 
As of September 30, 6% of our inventory, which represents less than 2% of our new vehicle inventory and approximately 16% of our used vehicle inventory, was not available for sale due to open recalls. We will continue to build our used vehicle inventory levels to ensure we have adequate supply to meet customer demand. 
In the third quarter, our used vehicle sales were slowed by our recall policy, and we expect to see an impact in the fourth quarter as well. Putting our customers first is the right thing to do. We believe the short-term investments are outweighed by the long-term safety benefits for our customers and supports the AutoNation brand promise.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,549 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $146 or 10%. 
Total gross profit per customer financial services of $222 million was up $26 million or 14% compared to the period a year ago. 
In the quarter, customer care revenue was an all-time record at $757 million, an increase of $44 million or 6%. 
We set another all-time record in customer care gross profit of $330 million, an increase of $28 million or 9%. 
Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 7%, our 21st consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross profit. 
Warranty gross was $67 million, up 15%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 13%. 
In the third quarter, we announced the Drive Pink campaign from coast-to-coast. Our Drive Pink campaign ties into the first-ever AutoNation Cure Bowl, which we held at the Orlando Citrus Bowl on December 19 to benefit the breast cancer research foundation. AutoNation has pledged to donate $1 million to support BCRF. I would like to thank our 25,000 associates and our customers for partnering with AutoNation to raise $1 million for breast cancer research. 
Finally, I would like to welcome the Valley Motors Auto Group associates to the AutoNation family.

We are very excited today to announce the acquisition of the Allen Samuels Auto Group in Texas. In connection with the transaction, we will acquire 12 stores to generate approximately [indiscernible]  In annual revenue and retail 19,500 new and used vehicles annually. 
Stores are located in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Corpus Christi, Tyler, Ennis and Waco markets. The franchise represented include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Sprinter. 
The acquisition is consistent with our strategy of enhancing brand representation in sales in our markets and the strong truck product offering of Allen Samuels makes it a great fit in Texas. 
Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including manufacturer approval. We expect the transaction to close in Q1 2016. On completing the Allen Samuels acquisition, AutoNation will have 53 stores in the State of Texas. 
We look forward to welcoming the more than 1,000 Allen Samuels associates and tens of thousands of new customers to the AutoNation family. 
Also, in September, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Valley Motors in the Baltimore market,and we're on track to complete in Q4 the acquisition of 13 stores in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee from Carl Gregory. 
In 2015, AutoNation has announced the acquisition of 33 stores, generating approximately $1.7 billion in annual revenue and since Q4 2012, AutoNation has announced acquisitions and new franchises awarded by the manufacturers that will generate $3.3 billion in annual revenue once fully operational. 
As of today, our store portfolio numbers 307 franchises and 240 stores in 15 states, representing 35 manufacturer brands. These numbers will grow to 372 franchises and 265 stores upon completion of the Carl Gregory and Allen Samuels acquisition. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

It's very difficult to say what the missed opportunity was, so I'm very -- I'm not enthusiastic about putting an actual number on there other than to say there was an opportunity impact. Obviously, our used vehicle sales were stable. We had some impact on the gross as it took longer to prepare vehicles, to have them frontline ready. And there is some disruption. But we think we're going to work through all those issues over the next quarter and starting sometime in the first half of next year, go back to growing the used vehicle business and improving the grosses. There are -- there will be some permanent hard cost in that we're going to increase inventory to allow for, on the used side, 10% to 15% of it to be tied up at all times with open recall. But I think that cost is very manageable, you can do the math on that. Building the technology systems to manage it all both to identify the open recalls every day and to manage the process of getting them all repaired, that's all underway. That's, again, a manageable cost, and it's a onetime cost. But clearly, there's some opportunity that we missed in the quarter because of this step that we've taken. In my view, it's hard to put a number on that, but if you weigh the cost benefit both for what it needs for the industry that we're taking a leadership position in something that's clearly a black eye for the industry at the moment, namely the recall situation that AutoNation is going to part of the solution, not part of the problem, that we put our customers first, the safety of our customers first is a clear brand statement. And we see that the strength of our brand is, every year, more evident. And all you have to do is look at on the new vehicle side where we pivoted away from dependence on traffic bought from third parties to relying on our brand and our own sites and investing in those, the strength that, that gave us to a unique brand attribute like the recall policy to positioning in the marketplace that the company really cares about big issues such as the fight against cancer and right now the Drive Pink is focused on breast cancer awareness and raising funds to find a cure. I think all of this is very compelling. And so yes, in used cars, we have some lost opportunity for a few quarters. But in the grand scheme of things, I think we're on a convincing and compelling growth. Because the hardest thing to do in business is to open a sustainable competitive advantage. And I think the evidence is becoming clearer and clearer that AutoNation is doing something special."

So if you want clear evidence that the power of the brand is taking hold and that our -- the enhancement of our digital sites making it a better customer experience is worthwhile. And if you want -- to me, the biggest proof is look at our front-end gross new vehicles, up $33. So we walk -- the business we walked away from with TrueCar and Costco haven't have -- their front end gross on average was $900 less than the business coming through AutoNation channels. So we left our most unprofitable business behind us, our most expensive business to acquire. It weakened our brand, it did not strengthen our brand.

So what we do is we take a very patient and balanced approach to our integration.

When I talk about patients, we don't try to sit here and put a switch and from one day to the next, go from being a legacy store into an AutoNation store. But over several months, we've perfected a process of being able to integrate them into our systems, our processes and our pay plans. And then one unique thing that we're able to do because of our size and our scale is, we call it a buddy system, someone can probably think of a better name, but we actually get current AutoNation associates from the general manager, all the way to individual department heads to partner in the stores during the transition period so they actually have a peer, a mentor on an equal basis to help guide them through the transaction and the transition. The last -- I think we're up to 10 to 12 stores that we put on that way. We had a very, very low turnover rate, a high adoption rate and then been able to hit our pro forma target."

Now people who are checking the market to see if they can get the sun, the moon, the sky and everything else, but it's not really for sale, it's just for sale if they can get a ""too good to be true"" price, and those discussions are out there. We identify those rather quickly, move on. We observe most of the time those businesses don't actually sell. Occasionally, someone will actually step up and pay the price and buy it, and that's fine, can't do every deal, that's for sure. If someone else has a different point of view, okay, that's going to happen, and you have to be willing to do that if you're going to stay disciplined on price. So I think the key point you mentioned is, obviously, a $17 million SAAR. Some people who are maybe sellers, not really concluded the sale, will check the market, and you'll hear stories about what they're asking. And occasionally, somebody will pay the price."

I mean that's an indisputable. Here's the way I think about it. I came to a conclusion several years ago that building a brand with genuine attributes was the only way to compete and win in this marketplace and not be disrupted and become a warehouse fulfillment center for others. That's really where I didn't want to end up. So then when you say you have a brand, the brand has to stand for something, and you see what we're doing, everything from our recall policy, to Drive Pink, to our fair pricing and are very -- and the capabilities on our digital sites. They're not informational, they're transactional. And it took a lot of money and a lot of effort to make that happen. So here's my point, there is a place in the marketplace -- in the market for third-party lead providers. There are dealers where it's appropriate that they do business with them. But here's the way I think about it, every dollar I spend on marketing today sells a car today and sells a car tomorrow because I'm building a brand. And if I'm diverting 30%, 40%, ultimately 50% of my marketing budget to build somebody else's brand, we'll play out where that ends. So that's why the third quarter is so important, we were leading up to it, it was our pivot. And clearly, it works. And in my view, every year, AutoNation is going to be stronger than the year before and all the benefits that comes from that. And so that gives us a relevancy and approachability and an attractiveness in the marketplace that can cut through all the other choices that consumers have and give us a very interesting and compelling business. But it has to be genuine, and you have to take risks, you have to take short-term disruption in order to get that differentiation, and we are doing that."

As Mike said, we're looking for a good cultural fit so that we can successfully onboard employees and transition the business profitably and successfully.

So buying, again, Chrysler and Chevy in Texas with a pickup truck mix is ideal. Similarly, last year in Bellevue, Washington, we bought a Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Porsche stores so that brand, mix and cultural fit was excellent. So we're balancing all of those factors now have to come together and it feeds back into what Mike said earlier as well that if you look at our batting average, if you want to look at it that way, it's about 100.

Today, we reported an all-time record earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.05, a 17% increase as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $0.90 for the same period in the prior year. This is our 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in EPS from continuing operations. 
Third quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 9%, driven by stronger performance in all of our business sectors. 
Total gross profit was $830 million compared to $753 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 10%. Operating income was $236 million compared to $207 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 14%.
In the third quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased by 7% or 5% on a same-store basis. 
Today, AutoNation also announced the acquisition of Allen Samuels Auto Group, 12 stores with approximately $800 million in annual revenue, spanning across 6 Texas markets. 
Since the beginning of 2015, we have announced acquisitions with roughly $1.7 billion in annual revenue, of which $1 billion is Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, Dodge-related. 
We will continue to pursue acquisitions that leverage our scale, expand the AutoNation brand and provide strong returns for our shareholders. 
The third quarter was also pivotal for AutoNation. We continue to build the AutoNation brand, execute our digital strategy, showing our websites currently represent over 25% of our unit sales and third-party leads now represent less than 9% of our unit sales. 
We did all of this and delivered an all-time record EPS from continuing operations. 
In the third quarter, we announced an unprecedented industry-leading recall policy. It's simple. We will not sell, lease, wholesale or deal or trade any new or used vehicle that has an open recall. We have made it our responsibility to identify and remove these vehicles from our inventory until their recall issues have been addressed.
This will require us to build used inventory levels through the fourth quarter. We expect our used business to normalize in the first half of 2016 once our used inventory levels are ramped up. This is a significant brand attribute that differentiates AutoNation from -- that no competitor has matched, not even CarMax.

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $119 million or $1.05 per share versus net income of $107 million or $0.90 per share during the third quarter of 2014, a 17% improvement on a per share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period.
In the third quarter, revenue increased $445 million or 9% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $77 million or 10%. 
SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 68.5% for the quarter, which represents a 90 basis point decrease compared to the year-ago period. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $76.3 million or 39.1%. 
On September 21, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $300 million of notes at 3.35%, which are scheduled to mature in 2021, as well as $450 million of notes at 4.5%, which are scheduled to mature in 2025. 
The transaction represented our debut investment-grade bond financing and was extremely well received by investors. The note proceeds were primarily used to reduce borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. This resulted in an increase in our percentage of fixed rate non-vehicle debt to 80% at the end of the quarter from 48% at June 30, 2015. 
Returning to third quarter results. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $17 million, an increase of $2 million from the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased new vehicle unit sales as well as higher floorplan assistance rates per unit. 
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $118 million during the third quarter, to $3.2 billion at quarter end, primarily due to reduced borrowings under our used vehicle floorplan facilities. 
Non-vehicle interest expense decreased slightly to $21.4 million compared to $21.7 million in the third quarter of 2014. 
The decrease in interest expense was driven by lower interest rates associated with the refinancing of our credit facility in December 2014 and the establishment of our commercial paper program in May of this year. 
At the end of September, we had $2.2 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $77 million compared to June 30, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $435 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of September, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility.
I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017. 
During the third quarter 2015, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $59.83 per share. 
As of October 26, we had approximately $297 million of board authorization remaining for share repurchase, and there were approximately 111 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio remained at 2.2x at the end of Q3 as compared to Q2. The leverage ratio was 2.0x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $27.9 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis and exclude operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter-end cash balance was $64 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.8 billion at the end of September. We continue to use the revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. As I mentioned a moment ago, we had $435 million of commercial paper outstanding at year end, which, in effect -- at quarter end, which, in effect, reduces available liquidity to $1.3 billion. 
We continue to leverage our strong operating results and cash flow generation in order to make strategic investments in our business in addition to opportunistic acquisitions and share repurchase. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

AutoNation posted record results in the third quarter. We set an all-time record in EPS from continuing operations. This was our 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Going forward, my comments will be on a same-store basis and compared to the period a year ago unless noted otherwise. 
Gross profit for variable operations was $467 million, up 6%. Variable gross was $3,282 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $103 or 3%. New and used same-store unit volume was up 3%. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of $201 million or 7%. We retailed 87,400 units, an increase of 5%. 
New vehicle gross profit was $1,877 on a per-vehicle retail basis, which was relatively flat compared to the same period a year ago. 
We are pleased with our new vehicle PVR performance for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential increase in PVRs in the $200 range due to the seasonal mixed shift towards Premium Luxury. 
Our pivot away from less profitable third-party lead providers helped offset new PVR competitive pressures. New vehicle PVRs from our self-generated sales, including customer financial services, are approximately $800 higher than new vehicle PVRs from third-party sales. 
Regarding our digital strategy, AutoNation websites currently generate over 25% of our unit sales. Sales from third-party leads now represent under 9% of our unit sales. 
Used vehicle retail revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of $24 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicles retails were relatively flat year-over-year at 55,900. 
Used vehicle gross profit was $1,509 on a vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $112 or 7%. 
As Mike mentioned in the third quarter, we set an auto retail industry standard and decided not to sell, lease or wholesale any new or used vehicle that has an open recall. 
As of September 30, 6% of our inventory, which represents less than 2% of our new vehicle inventory and approximately 16% of our used vehicle inventory, was not available for sale due to open recalls. We will continue to build our used vehicle inventory levels to ensure we have adequate supply to meet customer demand. 
In the third quarter, our used vehicle sales were slowed by our recall policy, and we expect to see an impact in the fourth quarter as well. Putting our customers first is the right thing to do. We believe these short-term investments are outweighed by the long-term safety benefits for our customers and support the AutoNation brand promise.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,549 on a per-vehicle retail basis, an increase of $146 or 10%. 
Total gross profit for customer financial services of $222 million was up $26 million or 14% compared to the period a year ago. 
In the quarter, customer care revenue was an all-time record at $757 million, an increase of $44 million or 6%. 
We set another all-time record in customer care gross profit of $330 million, an increase of $28 million or 9%.
Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 7%, our 21st consecutive quarterly increase in customer pay gross profit. 
Warranty gross was $67 million, up 15%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 13%. 
In the third quarter, we announced the Drive Pink campaign from coast-to-coast. Our Drive Pink campaign ties into the first-ever AutoNation Cure Bowl, which will be held at the Orlando Citrus Bowl on December 19 to benefit the breast cancer research foundation. AutoNation has pledged to donate $1 million to support BCRF. I would like to thank our 25,000 associates and our customers for partnering with AutoNation to raise $1 million for breast cancer research. 
Finally, I would like to welcome the Valley Motors Auto Group associates to the AutoNation family.

We are very excited today to announce the acquisition of the Allen Samuels Auto Group in Texas. In connection with the transaction, we will acquire 12 stores to generate approximately $800 million in annual revenue and retail 19,500 new and used vehicles annually. 
Stores are located in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Corpus Christi, Tyler, Ennis and Waco markets. The franchise represented include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Sprinter. 
The acquisition is consistent with our strategy of enhancing brand representation and scale in our markets, and the strong truck product offering of Allen Samuels makes it a great fit in Texas. 
Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including manufacturer approval. We expect the transaction to close in Q1 2016. Upon completing the Allen Samuels acquisition, AutoNation will have 53 stores in the State of Texas. 
We look forward to welcoming the more than 1,000 Allen Samuels associates and tens of thousands of new customers to the AutoNation family. 
Also, in September, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Valley Motors in the Baltimore market,and we're on track to complete in Q4 the acquisition of 13 stores in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee from Carl Gregory. 
In 2015, AutoNation has announced the acquisition of 33 stores, generating approximately $1.7 billion in annual revenue. And since Q4 2012, AutoNation has announced acquisitions and new franchises awarded by the manufacturers that will generate $3.3 billion in annual revenue once fully operational. 
As of today, our store portfolio numbers 307 franchises and 240 stores in 15 states, representing 35 manufacturer brands. These numbers will grow to 372 franchises and 265 stores upon completion of the Carl Gregory and Allen Samuels acquisition. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital, with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

It's very difficult to say what the missed opportunity was, so I'm very -- I'm not enthusiastic about putting an actual number on there other than to say there was an opportunity impact. Obviously, our used vehicle sales were stable. We had some impact on the gross, as it took longer to prepare vehicles to have them frontline ready. And there is some disruption. But we think we're going to work through all those issues over the next quarter and starting sometime in the first half of next year, go back to growing the used vehicle business and improving the grosses. There are -- there will be some permanent hard cost in that we're going to increase inventory to allow for, on the used side, 10% to 15% of it to be tied up at all times with open recall. But I think that cost is very manageable, you can do the math on that. Building the technology systems to manage it all, both to identify the open recalls every day and to manage the process of getting them all repaired, that's all underway. That's, again, a manageable cost, and it's a one-time cost. But clearly, there's some opportunity that we missed in the quarter because of this step that we've taken. In my view, it's hard to put a number on that, but if you weigh the cost benefit both for what it means for the industry, that we're taking a leadership position in something that's clearly a black eye for the industry at the moment, namely the recall situation, that AutoNation is going to part of the solution, not part of the problem, that we put our customers first, the safety of our customers first, is a clear brand statement. And we see that the strength of our brand is, every year, more evident. And all you have to do is look at -- on the new vehicle side where we pivoted away from a dependence on traffic bought from third parties to relying on our brand and our own sites and investing in those, the strength that, that gave us to a unique brand attribute like the recall policy to a positioning in the marketplace that the company really cares about big issues such as the fight against cancer, and right now the Drive Pink is focused on breast cancer awareness and raising funds to find a cure. I think all of this is very compelling. And so yes, in used cars, we have some lost opportunity for a few quarters. But in the grand scheme of things, I think we're on a convincing and compelling road. Because the hardest thing to do in business is to open a sustainable competitive advantage. And I think the evidence is becoming clearer and clearer that AutoNation is doing something special."

That exactly what you described is happening on the digital side and the fact that if I just look at the new car business, which was primarily where Costco and TrueCar was, Cheryl, I think was around 7% of our business, something like 7% of our new car business we walked away from and yet we had an outstanding performance. So if you want clear evidence that the power of the brand is taking hold and that our -- the enhancement of our digital sites making it a better customer experience is worthwhile. And if you want -- to me, the biggest proof is look at our front-end gross new vehicles, up $33. So we walked -- the business we walked away from with TrueCar and Costco had an -- their front end gross on average was $900 less than the business coming through AutoNation channels. So we left our most unprofitable business behind us, our most expensive business to acquire. It weakened our brand, it did not strengthen our brand. And that's why I think the third quarter is uncontestable proof that the strategy we've been talking about, investing in, has been validated, and that we're getting tremendous benefit from it. We have probably, on the pure technology side, passed the peak investment periods, but substantial investment is yet to come."

And I think that would be not a good development on any side. And I, for one, believe when you have an issue in the industry, be part of the solution. It's a genuine issue for our customers.

We have a level of conversation that we could do a lot of deals next year. Whether they'll meet all that criteria or not, I don't know.

So we've stayed disciplined. We haven't chased things internationally. We have continued to stay disciplined. The nice thing now is we're starting to see some of these deals hit, and we've been positioned for this. So with the strength in our base cash that's in the [ph] operating business, combined with the EBITDA we get with the acquisitions, knowing that will, in an acquisition, increase the EBITDA, it gives us a lot of flexibility to do both.

I mean, that's indisputable. Here's the way I think about it. I came to a conclusion several years ago that building a brand with genuine attributes was the only way to compete and win in this marketplace and not be disrupted and become a warehouse fulfillment center for others. That's really where I didn't want to end up. So then when you say you have a brand, the brand has to stand for something, and you see what we're doing, everything from our recall policy to Drive Pink to our fair pricing and our very -- and the capabilities on our digital sites. They're not informational, they're transactional. It took a lot of money and a lot of effort to make that happen. So here's my point: There is a place in the marketplace -- in the market for third-party lead providers. There are dealers where it's appropriate that they do business with them. But here's the way I think about it. Every dollar I spend on marketing today sells a car today and sells a car tomorrow because I'm building a brand. And if I'm diverting 30%, 40%, ultimately 50% of my marketing budget to build somebody else's brand, we'll play out where that ends. So that's why the third quarter is so important. We were leading up to it, it was our pivot. And clearly, it works. And in my view, every year, AutoNation is going to be stronger than the year before and all the benefits that come from that. And so that gives us a relevancy and approachability and an attractiveness in the marketplace that can cut through all the other choices that consumers have and give us a very interesting and compelling business.

If the rules of the game are that, hey, listen, you pay me for traffic, and we're not talking about AutoNation and what you are, then that's going to be a more difficult conversation. So those negotiations will probably take the next quarter or so. And when I see how all that goes, I can probably give you a pretty good idea of where it's going to settle down, settle in. And if I have an appropriate positioning for my brand, then I'm really going to view them not as a third-party lead provider, I'm going to view them as a partner with AutoNation. I'm looking for a win-win partnership. And if I find that, we can have a long-term relationship."
