We delivered healthy top line growth with gross bookings up 28% and revenue up 21% year-on-year. Room nights grew 26% for the year, air tickets were up 28%, and we grew our ad and media business, in",849,"Thanks, Alan. 2014 was a terrific year for Expedia, Inc. We delivered healthy top line growth with gross bookings up 28% and revenue up 21% year-on-year. Room nights grew 26% for the year, air tickets were up 28%, and we grew our ad and media business, including trivago, by 50%.
At the same time, we made significant investments in areas that will position us for long-term growth, ramping up our hotel acquisition efforts, scaling our global technology platforms and making key investments to drive growth at trivago. In total, we are able to balance our near-term profit objectives and long-term investment priorities and deliver full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%.
As we move into 2015, we like to talk to you about 4 distinct businesses in our portfolio: The core OTA group, eLong,  trivago and Egencia, each of which has its own market opportunity, growth drivers, competitive dynamics and ultimately, value creation potential. 
Our core OTA group is led by our 2 flagship global brands: Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, and also excludes regional or segment brand leaders, such as Hotwire, Venere and CarRentals.com, E and our affiliate business and now, Travelocity and Wotif. 
Over the past several years, we've made significant investments and improved our execution across our online marketing platforms, customer-facing technology and supplier facing platforms. Now while the work is never done, this business is performing well, and we're seeing the benefits show up in our operating results. 
On a combined basis, our core OTA business generated approximately $43 billion of gross bookings in 2014, up about 30% year-on-year. This growth is significantly faster than the industry, and we believe we're gaining market share in every major geography. 
Additionally, we're finding key commercial deals and acquisitions that enable us to leverage our existing technology and operations infrastructure to amplify our growth, such as the deal to power and now owned Travelocity and the acquisition of Wotif. Our platforms and operational processes now allow us to acquire businesses, integrate them pretty predictably and quickly, and realize meaningful synergies while equating improved experiences for our customers and our supply partners.
As a performance challenges we've seen at Hotwire demonstrate, bumps in the road will always a rise in this highly competitive segment. However, we believe we're executing well and are positioned better than ever. Staying with the theme of challenges, eLong incurred a $27 million adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4, as a highly competitive environment that we talked about during our last call was more than true. We manage our 65% eLong stake independently and eLong has its own capital, so we are not making trade-off investments in other businesses to fund eLong.
While we are counting on the competitive environment getting any better in 2015, we know that the market opportunity in China is huge. We're confident in the execution capabilities of the eLong team and are very confident that we're building real value there.
As is shown any geography, in which we compete, we aren't documented about our approach, and will draw towards one simple goal: Long-term value creation for Expedia shareholders.
Turning to trivago. We've owned the majority stake in trivago since March of 2013 and the business continues to grow at impressive rates. If you watch any TV in the U.S., you've now seen the trivago guy pitching the site as an excellent place to find the ideal hotel at the best price. 
On a stand-alone basis, for the full year, trivago generated revenue of over $410 million, up 68% year-on-year, and EBITDA, $4 million. Note that this includes revenue from all the other Expedia, Inc. brands. Our focus for trivago has been on growing the top line rather than profitability, and we've been reinvesting profits from core markets at trivago to define worldwide expansion. While we expect trivago to generate adjusted EBITDA growth in 2015, we will continue to trade off near-term profits for long-term value.
Turning to Egencia. We have a terrific corporate travel business year, which exceeded $5 billion of gross bookings in 2014. Egencia is growing at healthy rates, signing up new business at a fast pace, while integrating platforms in key acquisitions over time. This business, were mostly focus in industry disruption bringing more new products and services and better technology to corporate customers. 
And although they remain much larger than Egencia, we see the big legacy players on their back foot trying to figure out how to deliver technology and tools to compete effectively with Egencia and other online offerings. We believe this business can grow nicely on an organic basis, but we'll continue to look opportunistically at acquisitions to accelerate growth and further scale the business over time.
In closing, let me say this. While we celebrate our job well done in 2014, we are by no means standing still. Our products and services while better, have miles of improvement ahead of them. You won't find a single person across Expedia Inc. who would tell you that we're executing to our full potential, but we're finally seeing the arc possible. With that, I'll hand it to Mark."
25915843,275643323,756172,"Expedia Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. In the fourth quarter, we again saw strong performance from our core OTA group, trivago and Egencia, and although profitably was negatively affected by sizable investments at eLong, negative FX trends and significant due diligence and other",1239,"Thanks, Dara. In the fourth quarter, we again saw strong performance from our core OTA group, trivago and Egencia, and although profitably was negatively affected by sizable investments at eLong, negative FX trends and significant due diligence and other deal costs, we are happy to exit a terrific year with good momentum. 
Top line growth was driven this quarter by robust unit growth pretty much across the board. Room nights and air ticket growth helped drive gross bookings growth at 24%, 27% excluding the impact of foreign currency, and revenue growth of 18% or 22% excluding FX.
Hotel room night growth accelerated to 28%, with healthy growth seen across all major geographies. Travelocity and Wotif together contributed around 5 percentage points to total room night growth. Room night economics, on the other hand, continue to be lower year-over-year, with revenue per room night down 10% on flat ADRs. The impact from foreign currency was the larger driver this quarter than in prior periods, and we estimate that the negative impact on our revenue per room night was roughly 5 percentage points, with a portion of this hedged off and recorded as other income.
The other main drivers of the decline in unit economics remain relatively consistent with prior periods. We continue to reduce our hotel margins to enable an accelerated global build-out of hotel room inventory and availability. And we also continue to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs, along with coupons and other incentives, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We will continue to push these levers throughout 2015 and as such, to continue to expect revenue per room night to decline.
Air revenue grew 18% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 6%. Air gross bookings and air revenue were helped again this quarter by Travelocity, which represented approximately 12 percentage points of total ticket volume growth. Revenue per ticket was down as expected, as a result of the renewal of certain airline deals earlier in the year, and we expect this pressure to continue into 2015 as we annualize these contracts. 
Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, has become quite large and is growing fast. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 38%, net of intercompany amounts. We also saw healthy contributions from our car and insurance products.
On the expense side, we saw solid leverage this quarter in cost of revenue, as the team continues to drive for global efficiencies in our customer operations platform and on reduced levels of fraud and chargebacks year-over-year. General and administrative expenses grew faster than revenue, due primarily to over $8 million of deal costs, without which the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and nicely leveraging versus revenue.
The pace of growth of our technology and content expense was a little bit faster than the growth we saw in the third quarter. Selling and marketing expense growth was also broadly consistent with prior quarters. De-leverage in selling and marketing versus revenue continues to be driven primarily by success in variable marketing channels, as we continue to execute well and expand across the globe.
The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, excluding eLong, and 3% on a consolidated basis. As I mentioned, our Q4 results were also impacted by negative FX trends, over $8 million of deal costs and eLong losses, all of which exceeded our expectations at the time of our loss call. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA growth for the full year 2014 would have been at the top end of our guidance range.
You'll also notice $26 million of restructuring and related charges in Q4. These consist primarily of cost associated with the integration of our Wotif acquisition, but also include some other efficiency-related initiatives, including the migration of our Venere business onto our Hotels.com platform, as well as platform consolidation in our CarRentals.com business and at Egencia. We do expect $10 million to $15 million of additional restructuring costs in 2015, the majority of which you'll see in the first half of the year. Note that these expenses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
From a capital allocation perspective, 2014 was an active year. We delivered over $1 billion of free cash flow and allocated 500 towards acquisitions, paid out $85 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares for $537 million. Now I'd like to spend some time on our financial expectations for 2015. Please note that our format for providing guidance is a little bit different this quarter.
As Dara mentioned, the Chinese market remains highly competitive and dynamic. And because of this, we are not going to provide any specific adjusted EBITDA expectations for eLong for 2015. 
Directionally, we think the adjusted EBITDA loss of $27 million that eLong reported in the fourth quarter is a good baseline, and we would expect the quarterly losses to be larger than this as we move through 2015. ELong is a well-capitalized, NASDAQ listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we encourage you to value our eLong position and its impact on our consolidated results on a stand-alone basis.
For the rest of the business, excluding eLong, we are currently expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the 10% to 15% range. Note that this includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 5 percentage points at current rates. Against the general backdrop of strength across our business and our continuing efforts to balance near-term profits against investments to drive medium and long-term growth, I would call the following regarding our expected performance in 2015. 
We are expecting that deceleration in revenue growth in 2015 on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity implementation, further impact from the reduction of our hotel margins, the negative impact of foreign currency and the continued success of our loyalty programs, these are partially offset by the tailwind of adding the Wotif business.
On the expense side, while we continue to manage to the business toward our target P&L, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth, especially in the first half of the year, as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack for the increased pace at which we have been building global scale.
From a seasonality perspective, we are not expecting any meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter and expect the bulk of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. In terms of an effective tax rate on a consolidated basis, we are expecting an elevated rate in 2015, primarily as a result of non-deductible losses that we are anticipating on the back of increased investment levels at eLong.
One final quick housekeeping item before we begin Q&A. As Dara mentioned, we plan to increasingly discuss our business in 4 distinct components: The core OTA group, eLong,  trivago and Egencia. In this regard, we will break out the results of these 4 businesses beginning with the first quarter of 2015, so that our investors can have the appropriate level of visibility to be able to model a specific value reflecting the unique opportunities and valuation considerations inherent in each business.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to ask questions."

With respect to your specific question on acquisitions, a couple of things I would just note. We certainly are expecting to get a year-on-year helper from those acquisitions. But a lot of the numbers that are available publicly are probably not the best source to look at for the purposes of coming up with those estimates. When we acquired Wotif, that was a business that was facing some pretty significant challenges. Again, it's going to see pretty significant FX headwinds as we move into through 2013. And we're also in the middle of an integration. And we don't expect to see a meaningful uptick in the performance of Wotif until we get that business onto our platform. Now we are making progress on that. We moved international traffic onto the Brand Expedia platform in January. We do expect to get the rest of the business onto the platform in the first half of 2015. But in the meantime, you've got a business that is undergoing a very significant restructuring on a base momentum that is declining. And so you've got a bit of a headwind certainly versus what you have seen more probably available. Listen, Travelocity, we do think that there could be some upside there. It's very difficult for us to put a precise value on that for you right now. It's really going to depend on how effective we are in really marketing this business. The Travelocity business didn't spend a lot of money on brand advertising in 2014. That is something that we're going to want to do very likely to reinvigorate that brand, which is a great brand. So I think the acquisitions are going to be a tailwind, but I wouldn't rely on public numbers. Lastly, I would just say that our philosophy is one where our EBITDA outcome is one of careful management and one of careful decisions around what upside we see and what investments do we have available to us to drive medium and long-term growth. And so -- but we do have some tailwinds from acquisitions. And we did have some last year from Travelocity. We're constantly looking at investments that we can make that -- respect the EBITDA guidance and the EBITDA target that we set for our ourselves, but also set ourselves up for more sustained growth. Okay. So with respect to EBITDA, let me just go through the numbers for you. So for eLong, the EBITDA for full year 2014 was $27 million loss, okay? For the Expedia business, the Egencia business, it's $60 million. For trivago, it's $4 million. And then you can back into the core OTA business for the rest."

So when you look at our revenue per room night, for example, revenue per room night for International was down significantly more on a year-on-year basis than domestic. Europe, as a part of that, but frankly, Asia Pacific is a part of that as well. The foreign exchange trends on a year-on-year basis are significant. And if nothing changes, then at this point, we don't anticipate anything changes -- changing, we'll continue to be significant as we go through the year. As far as the relative strength of the European market, et cetera, one trend that we have observed is that due to the strength of the dollar, we're seeing a lower balance of European demand coming into the U.S. because of the U.S. books more expensive. In general, we are seeing stronger demand from the U.S. to Europe. And I'd say, in general, across Europe and APAC, we are seeing a higher concentration of demand locally. Now part of that is because we have better local supply and I think we've got better local marketing. But in general, our domestic room night growth in most territories exceeds international room night growth. We think it's a good trend. It hurts ADRs and it hurts length of stay, but we think it's a very, very positive factor on our growing business on a global basis."

How do you think about the role eLong might be able to play if the market in China consolidated? And how you could redeploy that capital into other areas of the business if that opportunity presented itself versus the opportunity for eLong as a standalone entity long-term? And then second one, you certainly done a fair bit of acquisitions over the last 18 months in the OTA space broadly with Wotif and Travelocity. What do you think the pathway forward is to do more acquisitions in the OTA space, especially to leverage some of the technology investments you made over the last couple of years?"

This is a business that shows off $1 billion of free cash flow. ELong has plenty of capital. They've got over $300 million in cash. And the reason why we say we're not trading off eLong investments against other investments is because we don't have to. So we'll disclose them to you. And from our standpoint, we're very confident of the eLong team. They have built a big, big business there. And we think that eLong will be very accretive for Expedia shareholders over a period of time, and we're just heads down on maximizing the value from a long-term perspective. As far as acquisitions go, acquisitions are a part of our game plan. We've had a number of acquisitions over the years. And I would say that our technology platforms now and our operating practices now are at a different level where we are good at and have a very strong practice at, bringing in and consolidating acquisitions and realizing synergies. We have our hands full with Wotif and Travelocity. But the travel market is enormous. It's a $1.3 trillion travel market. We're one of the biggest players out there with only $50 billion, less than 5% of that market, and we do think that consolidation is going to continue. We think that the big global players in general a going to gain share. And we will look for consolidation opportunities if they make sense for our shareholders. And if they give us a higher return than buy back our own stock."

But can we just talk about, I guess, what is baked in, in terms of organic growth in the core franchise relative to the 18% or, I'll call it, mid-teens ex Travelocity in 2014. And then, I guess a question on the unit efficiency. So given the trends with revenue per room night and then the marketing spend that's flowing for trivago, is that the right way to look at the growth rate of marketing or direct marketing relative to your room night growth? Or how do we think about the rate of marketing deleverage? How much of that is trivago versus some of the contra revenue items you mentioned versus just kind of industry dynamic?"

We -- again, we will get some help us for those acquisitions. But again, we got harder headers this year just blocking over the Travelocity acquisition. So the guidance, I would take us really representing strength in the core of the business and not a lot of that help from anything other than that. With respect to unit trends and sales and marketing deleverage, again, we're deleveraging sales and marketing since we think are really great reasons, which are really 2 major drivers. One is that we're just having much more success in variable marketing channels to continue to improve the conversion on our websites, and we just get much, much better at that on a global basis. And of course, no matter how efficient those channels are, they're always going to be more expensive than free, which is why the direct type in traffic is. And so when we're driving growth for other channels, which we are right now, you're going to continue to see deleverage on the P&L there. And secondly is just global expansion and of course, that's happening across all of our brands. We continue to push into international markets on a more aggressive basis. And those markets even though themselves get efficient or more efficient over time, they are generally less efficient than our core domestic market. So those are the big drivers. trivago is certainly a piece of it. But I think now you'll see completely clear of that acquisition. So we've got clean comps, and that wasn't the case for all of 2014. We had a tougher comp in Q1. They're going to continue to be a driver but really, it's the core business that's driving a lot of that story now that we're annualizing over the Travelocity or sorry, the trivago acquisition. In terms of how to look at it, listen, I think looking at direct sales and marketing per room night is a decent way to look at it. A lot of our marketing spend does go against our hotel business. I think you'll be able to back into a number that at least approximates what you think trivago spends on marketing. You could back out an estimate on that. But I think that could give you a reasonable way to look at it on a go-forward basis."

I'll say a portion of that is hedged off and it sits in our other income item. But if you looking at just a total revenue, it's not in that number. The other drivers are just very consistent with what we've spoke about on prior quarters. One is that we continue to adjust our hotel margins to make sure that we're just competitive for local market conditions. And that's pretty important for us as we continue to aggressively build our hotel count and it really drive for great rates and availability with our hotel partners. Secondly is the impact of our loyalty programs. And Dara mentioned the Hotels.com Welcome Rewards program been very successful. More and more of the Hotels.com business is really coming from that repeat loyal user base. It's nicely efficient for us on an adjusted EBITDA basis. But in our P&L, it's shown as a contra revenue item as opposed to sales and marketing, and that puts pressure in the metric as well. And then also that call that, bucket of loyalty, is couponing and discounting that we do from time to time."

In general, the volumes that we see from -- the strength of volumes from the U.S. to international markets, and U.S. is about 50% of our volume, is offsetting the weakness of international markets coming to the U.S. In general, those 2 are offsetting in big picture terms. We are seeing significant negative headwinds on foreign exchange and we're seeing, for example, average daily rates this year being negative because of foreign exchange. That's a translation of these foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. And in general, we're seeing more domestic travel on a worldwide basis. So our Russian volumes are more staying within Russia. And almost every single country, we're seeing more travel locally. Part of this is because of our expanding supply and becoming more relevant to local customers.

At the same time, one area that we are working on I think in a much better at is to upsell various parts of travel to our customers. So when a customer comes in to buy an Expedia air ticket, I think we're getting much better about upselling a car or upselling destination services, ground transport, to that customer, ticket to a theme park, et cetera. So all of these, of their travel opportunities, many, many of them are opportunities that we are servicing now. And our focus is how can we cross sell those customers more stuff because those cross sell to be clear very, very high margins because we don't have to kind of reacquire those customers through third-party channels.

We delivered healthy top line growth, with gross bookings up 28% and revenue up 21% year-on-year. Room nights grew 26% for the year, air tickets were up 28%, and we grew our ad and media business, including trivago, by 50%.
At the same time, we made significant investments in areas that will position us for long-term growth, ramping up our hotel acquisition efforts, scaling our global technology platforms and making key investments to drive growth at trivago. In total, we were able to balance our near-term profit objectives and long-term investment priorities and deliver full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%.
As we move into 2015, we'd like to talk to you about 4 distinct businesses in our portfolio: The core OTA group, eLong, trivago and Egencia, each of which has its own market opportunity, growth drivers, competitive dynamics and, ultimately, value creation potential. 
Our core OTA group is led by our 2 flagship global brands: Brand Expedia and Hotels.com; and also includes regional or segment brand leaders, such as Hotwire, Venere and CarRentals.com; EAN, our affiliate business; and now, Travelocity and Wotif. 
Over the past several years, we've made significant investments and improved our execution across our online marketing platforms, customer-facing technology and supplier-facing platforms. And while the work is never done, this business is performing well, and we're seeing the benefits show up in our operating results. 
On a combined basis, our core OTA business generated approximately $43 billion of gross bookings in 2014, up about 30% year-on-year. This growth is significantly faster than the industry, and we believe we're gaining market share in every major geography. 
Additionally, we're finding key commercial deals and acquisitions that enable us to leverage our existing technology and operations infrastructure to amplify our growth, such as the deal to power and now own Travelocity and the acquisition of Wotif. Our platforms and operational processes now allow us to acquire businesses, integrate them predictably and quickly and realize meaningful synergies, while creating improved experiences for our customers and our supply partners.
As the performance challenges we've seen at Hotwire demonstrate, bumps in the road will always arise in this highly competitive segment. However, we believe we're executing well and are positioned better than ever. Staying with the theme of challenges, eLong incurred a $27 million adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4 as a highly competitive environment that we talked about during our last call was more than true. We manage our 65% eLong stake independently and eLong has its own capital, so we are not making trade-off investments in other businesses to fund eLong.
While we aren't counting on the competitive environment getting any better in 2015, we know that the market opportunity in China is huge. We're confident in the execution capabilities of the eLong team and are very confident that we're building real value there.
As is sure in any geography in which we compete, we aren't dogmatic about our approach, and will draw towards one simple goal: long-term value creation for Expedia shareholders.
Turning to trivago. We've owned the majority stake in trivago since March of 2013, and the business continues to grow an -- at impressive rates. If you watch any TV at all in the U.S., you've no doubt seen the trivago guy pitching the site as an excellent place to find the ideal hotel at the best price. 
On a stand-alone basis, for the full year, trivago generated revenue of over $410 million, up 68% year-on-year, and EBITDA of $4 million. Note that this includes revenue from all the other Expedia, Inc. brands. Our focus for trivago has been on growing the top line rather than profitability, and we've been reinvesting profits from core markets at trivago to fund [ph] worldwide expansion. While we expect trivago to generate adjusted EBITDA growth in 2015, we will continue to trade off near-term profits for long-term value.
Turning to Egencia. We had a terrific corporate travel business year, which exceeded $5 billion of gross bookings in 2014. Egencia is growing at healthy rates, signing up new business at a fast pace, while integrating platforms in key acquisitions over time. With this business, we're mostly focused on industry disruption, bringing more new products and services and better technology to corporate customers. 
And although they remain much larger than Egencia, we see the big legacy players on their back foot trying to figure out how to deliver technology and tools to compete effectively with Egencia and other online offerings. We believe this business can grow nicely on an organic basis, but we'll continue to look opportunistically at acquisitions to accelerate growth and further scale the business over time.
In closing, let me say this. While we celebrate our job well done in 2014, we are by no means standing still. Our products and service, while better, have miles of improvement ahead of them. You won't find a single person across Expedia, Inc. who will tell you that we're executing to our full potential, but we're finally seeing the art of the possible. 
With that, I'll hand it to Mark."
25915843,275643323,756458,"Expedia Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara.

In the fourth quarter, we again saw strong performance from our core OTA group, trivago and Egencia. And although profitably was negatively affected by sizable investments at eLong, negative FX trends and significant due diligence and other deal costs, we were happy to exit a terrific year with good momentum. 
Top line growth was driven this quarter by robust unit growth pretty much across the board. Room nights and air ticket growth helped drive gross bookings growth of 24%, 27% excluding the impact of foreign currency, and revenue growth of 18% or 22% excluding FX.
Hotel room night growth accelerated to 28%, with healthy growth seen across all major geographies. Travelocity and Wotif together contributed around 5 percentage points to total room night growth. Room night economics, on the other hand, continue to be lower year-over-year, with revenue per room night down 10% on flat ADRs. The impact from foreign currency was the larger driver this quarter than in prior periods, and we estimate that the negative impact on our revenue per room night was roughly 5 percentage points, with a portion of this hedged off and recorded as other income.
The other main drivers of the decline in unit economics remain relatively consistent with prior periods. We continue to reduce our hotel margins to enable an accelerated global buildout of hotel room inventory and availability. And we also continue to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs, along with coupons and other incentives, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We will continue to push these levers throughout 2015, and as such, to continue to expect revenue per room night to decline.
Air revenue grew 18% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 6%. Air gross bookings and air revenue were helped again this quarter by Travelocity, which represented approximately 12 percentage points of the total ticket volume growth. Revenue per ticket was down, as expected, as a result of the renewal of certain airline deals earlier in the year, and we expect this pressure to continue into 2015 as we annualize these contracts. 
Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, has become quite large and is growing fast. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 38%, net of intercompany amounts. We also saw healthy contributions from our car and insurance products.
On the expense side, we saw solid leverage this quarter in cost of revenue, as the team continues to drive for global efficiencies in our customer operations platform and on reduced levels of fraud and charge-backs year-over-year. General and administrative expenses grew faster than revenue, due primarily to over $8 million of deal costs, without which, the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and nicely leveraging versus revenue.
The pace of growth of our technology and content expense was a little bit faster than the growth we saw in the third quarter. Selling and marketing expense growth was also broadly consistent with prior quarters. De-leverage in selling and marketing versus revenue continues to be driven primarily by success in variable marketing channels, as we continue to execute well and expand across the globe.
The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, excluding eLong, and 3% on a consolidated basis. As I mentioned, our Q4 results were also impacted by negative FX trends, over $8 million of deal costs and eLong losses, all of which exceeded our expectations at the time of our last call. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA growth for the full year 2014 would have been at the top end of our guidance range.
You will also notice $26 million of restructuring and related charges in Q4. These consist primarily of costs associated with the integration of our Wotif acquisition, but also include some other efficiency-related initiatives, including the migration of our Venere business onto our Hotels.com platform as well as platform consolidation in our CarRentals.com business and at Egencia. We do expect $10 million to $15 million of additional restructuring costs in 2015, the majority of which you'll see in the first half of the year. Note that these expenses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
From a capital allocation perspective, 2014 was an active year. We delivered over $1 billion of free cash flow and allocated $500 million towards acquisitions, paid out $85 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares for $537 million. 
Now I'd like to spend some time on our financial expectations for 2015. Please note that our format for providing guidance is a little bit different this quarter.
As Dara mentioned, the Chinese market remains highly competitive and dynamic. And because of this, we are not going to provide any specific adjusted EBITDA expectations for eLong for 2015.
Directionally, we think the adjusted EBITDA loss of $27 million that eLong reported in the fourth quarter is a good baseline, and we would expect the quarterly losses to be larger than this as we move through 2015. eLong is a well-capitalized, NASDAQ-listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we encourage you to value our eLong position and its impact on our consolidated results on a stand-alone basis.
For the rest of the business excluding eLong, we are currently expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the 10% to 15% range. Note that this includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 5 percentage points at current rates. Against the general backdrop of strength across our business and our continuing efforts to balance the near-term profits against investments to drive medium- and long-term growth, I would call the following regarding our expected performance in 2015: We are expecting a  deceleration in revenue growth in 2015 on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity implementation, further impact from the reduction of our hotel margins, the negative impact of foreign currency and the continued success of our loyalty programs. These are partially offset by the tailwind of adding the Wotif business.
On the expense side, while we continue to manage the business toward our target P&L, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth, especially in the first half of the year, as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack with the increased pace at which we have been building global scale.
From a seasonality perspective, we are not expecting any meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter and expect the bulk of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. In terms of an effective tax rate on a consolidated basis, we are expecting an elevated rate in 2015, primarily as a result of non-deductible losses that we are anticipating on the back of increased investment levels at eLong.
One final quick housekeeping item before we begin Q&A. As Dara mentioned, we plan to increasingly discuss our business in 4 distinct components: The core OTA group, eLong, trivago and Egencia. In this regard, we will break out the results of these 4 businesses beginning with the first quarter of 2015, so that our investors can have the appropriate level of visibility to be able to model a specific value reflecting the unique opportunities and valuation considerations inherent in each business.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to ask questions."

With respect to your specific question on acquisitions, a couple of things I would just note. We certainly are expecting to get a year-on-year helper from those acquisitions. But a lot of the numbers that are available publicly are probably not the best source to look at for the purposes of coming up with those estimates. When we acquired Wotif, that was a business that was facing some pretty significant challenges. Again, it's going to see pretty significant FX headwinds as we move into -- through 2015. And we're also in the middle of an integration. And we don't expect to see a meaningful uptick in the performance of Wotif until we get that business onto our platform. Now we are making progress on that. We moved international traffic onto the Brand Expedia platform in January. We do expect to get the rest of the business onto the platform in the first half of 2015. But in the meantime, you've got a business that is undergoing a very significant restructuring on a base momentum that is declining. And so you've got a bit of a headwind, certainly, versus what you would've seen more publicly available. Listen, Travelocity, we do think that there could be some upside there. It's very difficult for us to put a precise value on that for you right now. It's really going to depend on how effective we are in really marketing this business. The Travelocity business didn't spend a lot of money on brand advertising in 2014. That is something that we're going to want to do very likely to reinvigorate that brand, which is a great brand. So I think, the acquisitions are going to be a tailwind, but I wouldn't rely on public numbers. Lastly, I would just say that our philosophy is one where our EBITDA outcome is one of careful management and one of careful decisions around what upside we see and what investments do we have available to us to drive medium- and long-term growth. And so -- but we do have some tailwinds from acquisitions, and we did have some last year from Travelocity. We're constantly looking at investments that we can make that respect the EBITDA guidance and the EBITDA target that we set for our ourselves, but also set ourselves up for more sustained growth. Okay? So with respect to EBITDA, let me just go through the numbers for you. So for eLong, the EBITDA for full year 2014 was $27 million loss, okay? For the Expedia business -- the Egencia business, it's $60 million. For trivago, it's $4 million, and then you can back into the core OTA business for the rest."

So when you look at our revenue per room night, for example, revenue per room night for international was down significantly more on a year-on-year basis than domestic. Europe is a part of that, but frankly, Asia Pacific is a part of that as well. The foreign exchange trends on a year-on-year basis are significant. And if nothing changes, and at this point, we don't anticipate anything changes -- changing, we'll continue to be significant as we go through the year. As far as the relative strength of the European market, et cetera, one trend that we have observed is that due to the strength of the dollar, we're seeing a lower balance of European demand coming into the U.S., because the U.S. books more expensive. In general, we are seeing stronger demand from the U.S. to Europe. And I'd say, in general, across Europe and APAC, we are seeing a higher concentration of demand locally. Now part of that is because we have better local supply and I think, we've got better local marketing. But in general, our domestic room night growth in most territories exceeds international room night growth. We think it's a good trend. It hurts ADRs and it hurts length of stay, but we think it's a very, very positive factor on our growing business on a global basis."

And that'll be one of the things that drove increased travel pattern. The other thing is just more disposable income for consumers. And we've seen estimates of anywhere from $500 to $1,000 extra in the pockets of the average American household. And on the typical trip, a hotel stay, part of that trip will be around $300. So that could actually drive more volume and more consumer demand around the world.

And how you could redeploy that capital into other areas of the business if that opportunity presented itself versus the opportunity for eLong as a stand-alone entity long-term? And second one, you've obviously done a fair bit of acquisitions over the last 18 months in the OTA space, broadly with Wotif and Travelocity. What do you think the pathway forward is to do more acquisitions in the OTA space, especially to leverage on some of the technology investments you made over the last couple of years?"

And the reason why we say we're not trading off eLong investments against other investments is because we don't have to. So we'll disclose them to you. And from our standpoint, we're very confident of the eLong team. They have built a big, big business there. And we think that eLong will be very accretive for Expedia shareholders over a period of time, and we're just heads down on maximizing that value from a long-term perspective. As far as acquisitions go, acquisitions are a part of our game plan. We've had a number of acquisitions over the years. And I would say that our technology platforms now and our operating practices now are at a different level where we are good at, and have a very strong practice at, bringing in and consolidating acquisitions and realizing synergies. We have our hands full with Wotif and Travelocity. But the travel market is enormous. It's a $1.3 trillion travel market. We're one of the biggest players out there with only $50 billion, less than 5% of that market, and we do think that consolidation is going to continue. We think that the big global players, in general, are going to gain share. And we will look for consolidation opportunities if they make sense for our shareholders and if they give us a higher return than buy back our own stock."

And then, I guess, a question on the unit efficiency. So given the trends with revenue per room night and then the marketing spend that's flowing through trivago, is the right way to look at the growth rate of marketing or direct marketing relative to your room night growth? Or how do we think about the rate of marketing de-leverage? How much of that is trivago versus some of the contra-revenue items you mentioned versus just kind of industry dynamic?"

We -- again, we will get some helpers from the -- for those acquisitions. But again, we got harder headwinds this year, just lapping over the Travelocity acquisition. So the guidance, I would take as really representing strength in the core of the business and not a lot of net help from anything other than that. With respect to unit trends and sales and marketing de-leverage, again, we're de-leveraging sales and marketing since -- for what, we think, are really great reasons, which, really, 2 major drivers. One is that we're just having much more success in variable marketing channels as we continue to improve the conversion on our websites, and we just get much, much better at that on a global basis. And of course, no matter how efficient those channels are, they're always going to be more expensive than free, which is what the direct type in traffic is. And so when we're driving growth at other channels, which we are right now, you're going to continue to see de-leverage on the P&L there. And secondly, it's just global expansion. And of course, that's happening across all of our brands. We continue to push into international markets on a more aggressive basis. And those markets, even though themselves get efficient or more efficient over time, they are generally less efficient than our core domestic market. So those are the big drivers. trivago is certainly a piece of it. But I think now you'll see completely [ph] clear of that acquisition. So we've got clean comps, and that wasn't the case for all of 2014. We had a tougher comp in Q1. They're going to continue to be a driver, but really, it's the core business that's driving a lot of that story, now that we're annualizing over the Travelocity -- or sorry, the trivago acquisition. In terms of how to look at it, listen, I think looking at direct sales and marketing per room night is a decent way to look at it. A lot of our marketing spend does go against our hotel business. I think you'll be able to back into a number that, at least, approximates what you think trivago spends on marketing. You could back out an estimate on that. But I think that could give you a reasonable way to look at it on a go-forward basis."

The other drivers are just very consistent with what we've -- what we spoke about on prior quarters. One is that we continue to adjust our hotel margins to make sure that we're just competitive for local market conditions. And that's pretty important for us as we continue to aggressively build our hotel count and really drive for great rates and availability with our hotel partners. Secondly is the impact of our loyalty programs. And Dara mentioned, the Hotels.com Welcome Rewards program has been very successful. More and more of the Hotels.com business is really coming from that repeat loyal-user base. It's nicely efficient for us on an adjusted EBITDA basis. But in our P&L, it's shown as a contra-revenue item as opposed to sales and marketing, and so that puts pressure on the metric as well. And then, also in, call it, that bucket of loyalty is couponing and discounting that we do from time to time."

In general, the volumes that we see from -- the strength of volumes from the U.S. to international markets, and U.S. is about 50% of our volume, is offsetting the weakness of international markets coming to the U.S. In general, those 2 are offsetting in big-picture terms. We are seeing significant negative headwinds on foreign exchange, and we're seeing, for example, average daily rates this year being negative because of foreign exchange. That's the translation of these foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. And in general, we're seeing more domestic travel on a worldwide basis. So our Russian volumes are more staying within Russia. In almost every single country, we're seeing more travel locally. Part of this is because of our expanding supply and becoming more relevant to local customers.

We're getting more and more bookable properties onto Expedia. We're giving the Home Away inventory more exposure. And at this point, we don't have kind of a final call on what it means, but it looks like the inventory is certainly attractive, and it does look like a certain segment of our population and customer base likes that inventory and appreciates our showing them that inventory. At the same time, one area that we are working on and, I think, getting much better at is to up-sell various parts of travel to our customers. So when a customer comes in to buy an Expedia air ticket, I think we're getting much better about up-selling a car or up-selling destination services, ground transport to that customer. Ticket to a theme park, et cetera. So all of these, of their travel opportunities, many, many of them are opportunities that we are servicing now. And our focus is how can we cross-sell those customers more stuff because those cross-sells typically are very, very high margins, because you don't have to kind of reacquire those customers through third-party channels. So we certainly want to cast our net wider, but it's within the set of products that we're offering now. And we're seeing very, very good experience there.

We delivered healthy top line growth with gross bookings up 28% and revenue up 21% year-on-year. Room nights grew 26% for the year, air tickets were up 28%, and we grew our ad and media business, including trivago, by 50%.
At the same time, we made significant investments in areas that will position us for long-term growth, ramping up our hotel acquisition efforts, scaling our global technology platforms and making key investments to drive growth at trivago. In total, we were able to balance our near-term profit objectives and long-term investment priorities and deliver full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%.
As we move into 2015, we'd like to talk to you about 4 distinct businesses in our portfolio: the core OTA group, eLong, trivago and Egencia, each of which has its own market opportunity, growth drivers, competitive dynamics and, ultimately, value-creation potential. 
Our core OTA group is led by our 2 flagship global brands: Brand Expedia and Hotels.com and also includes regional or segment brand leaders, such as Hotwire, Venere and CarRentals.com; EAN, our affiliate business; and now, Travelocity and Wotif. 
Over the past several years, we've made significant investments and improved our execution across our online marketing platforms, customer-facing technology and supplier-facing platforms. And while the work is never done, this business is performing well, and we're seeing the benefits show up in our operating results. 
On a combined basis, our core OTA business generated approximately $43 billion of gross bookings in 2014, up about 30% year-on-year. This growth is significantly faster than the industry, and we believe we're gaining market share in every major geography. 
Additionally, we're finding key commercial deals and acquisitions that enable us to leverage our existing technology and operations infrastructure to amplify our growth, such as the deal to power and now own Travelocity and the acquisition of Wotif. Our platforms and operational processes now allow us to acquire businesses, integrate them predictably and quickly, and realize meaningful synergies while creating improved experiences for our customers and our supply partners.
As the performance challenges we've seen at Hotwire demonstrate, bumps in the road will always arise in this highly competitive segment. However, we believe we're executing well and are positioned better than ever. Staying with the theme of challenges, eLong incurred a $27 million adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4 as a highly competitive environment that we talked about during our last call was more than true. We manage our 65% eLong stake independently, and eLong has its own capital, so we are not making tradeoff investments in other businesses to fund eLong.
While we aren't counting on the competitive environment getting any better in 2015, we know that the market opportunity in China is huge, we're confident in the execution capabilities of the eLong team and are very confident that we're building real value there.
As is sure in any geography in which we compete, we aren't dogmatic about our approach and will draw it towards one simple goal: long-term value creation for Expedia shareholders.
Turning to trivago. We've owned a majority stake in trivago since March of 2013, and the business continues to grow an -- at impressive rates. If you watch any TV at all in the U.S., you've no doubt seen the trivago guy pitching the site as an excellent place to find the ideal hotel at the best price. 
On a stand-alone basis for the full year, trivago generated revenue of over $410 million, up 68% year-on-year and EBITDA of $4 million. Note that this includes revenue from all the other Expedia, Inc., brands. Our focus for trivago has been on growing the top line rather than profitability, and we've been reinvesting profits from core markets at trivago to fund worldwide expansion. While we expect trivago to generate adjusted EBITDA growth in 2015, we will continue to trade off near-term profits for long-term value.
Turning to Egencia. We had a terrific corporate travel business year, which exceeded $5 billion of gross bookings in 2014. Egencia is growing at healthy rates, signing up new business at a fast pace while integrating platforms in key acquisitions over time. With this business, we're mostly focused on industry disruption bringing more new products and services and better technology to corporate customers. 
And although they remain much larger than Egencia, we see the big legacy players on their back foot trying to figure out how to deliver technology and tools to compete effectively with Egencia and other online offerings. We believe this business can grow nicely on an organic basis, but we'll continue to look opportunistically at acquisitions to accelerate growth and further scale the business over time.
In closing, let me say this. While we celebrate a job well done in 2014, we are by no means standing still. Our products and service, while better, have miles of improvement ahead of them. You won't find a single person across Expedia, Inc., who will tell you that we're executing to our full potential, but we're finally seeing the arc of the possible. 
With that, I'll hand it to Mark."
25915843,275643323,756574,"Expedia Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. In the fourth quarter, we again saw strong performance from our core OTA group, trivago and Egencia.

In the fourth quarter, we again saw strong performance from our core OTA group, trivago and Egencia. And although profitably was negatively affected by sizable investments at eLong, negative FX trends and significant due diligence and other deal costs, we were happy to exit a terrific year with good momentum. 
Top line growth was driven this quarter by robust unit growth pretty much across the board. Room nights and air ticket growth helped drive gross bookings growth of 24%, 27% excluding the impact of foreign currency, and revenue growth of 18% or 22% excluding FX.
Hotel room night growth accelerated to 28% with healthy growth seen across all major geographies. Travelocity and Wotif together contributed around 5 percentage points to total room night growth. Room night economics, on the other hand, continue to be lower year-over-year with revenue per room night down 10% on flat ADRs. The impact from foreign currency was the larger driver this quarter than in prior periods, and we estimate that the negative impact on our revenue per room night was roughly 5 percentage points with a portion of this hedged off and recorded as other income.
The other main drivers of the decline in unit economics remain relatively consistent with prior periods. We continue to reduce our hotel margins to enable an accelerated global buildout of hotel room inventory and availability. And we also continue to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs along with coupons and other incentives which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We will continue to push these levers throughout 2015, and as such, continue to expect revenue per room night to decline.
Air revenue grew 18% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 6%. Air gross bookings and air revenue were helped again this quarter by Travelocity, which represented approximately 12 percentage points of the total ticket volume growth. Revenue per ticket was down, as expected, as a result of the renewal of certain airline deals earlier in the year, and we expect this pressure to continue into 2015 as we annualize these contracts. 
Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, has become quite large and is growing fast. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 38%, net of intercompany amounts. We also saw healthy contributions from our car and insurance products.
On the expense side, we saw solid leverage this quarter in costs of revenue as the team continues to drive for global efficiencies in our customer operations platform and on reduced levels of fraud and charge-backs year-over-year. General and administrative expenses grew faster than revenue due primarily to over $8 million of deal costs, without which, the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and nicely leveraging versus revenue.
The pace of growth of our technology and content expense was a little bit faster than the growth we saw in the third quarter. Selling and marketing expense growth was also broadly consistent with prior quarters. Deleverage in selling and marketing versus revenue continues to be driven primarily by success in variable marketing channels as we continue to execute well and expand across the globe.
The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% excluding eLong and 3% on a consolidated basis. As I mentioned, our Q4 results were also impacted by negative FX trends, over $8 million of deal costs and eLong losses, all of which exceeded our expectations at the time of our last call. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA growth for the full year 2014 would have been at the top end of our guidance range.
You will also notice $26 million of restructuring and related charges in Q4. These consist primarily of costs associated with the integration of our Wotif acquisition but also include some other efficiency-related initiatives, including the migration of our Venere business onto our Hotels.com platform as well as platform consolidation in our CarRentals.com business and at Egencia. We do expect $10 million to $15 million of additional restructuring costs in 2015, the majority of which you'll see in the first half of the year. Note that these expenses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
From a capital allocation perspective, 2014 was an active year. We delivered over $1 billion of free cash flow and allocated $500 million towards acquisitions, paid out $85 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares for $537 million. 
Now I'd like to spend some time on our financial expectations for 2015. Please note that our format for providing guidance is a little bit different this quarter.
As Dara mentioned, the Chinese market remains highly competitive and dynamic. And because of this, we are not going to provide any specific adjusted EBITDA expectations for eLong for 2015.
Directionally, we think the adjusted EBITDA loss of $27 million that eLong reported in the fourth quarter is a good baseline, and we would expect the quarterly losses to be larger than this as we move through 2015. eLong is a well-capitalized, NASDAQ-listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we encourage you to value our eLong position and its impact on our consolidated results on a stand-alone basis.
For the rest of the business excluding eLong, we are currently expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the 10% to 15% range. Note that this includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 5 percentage points at current rates. Against the general backdrop of strength across our business and our continuing efforts to balance near-term profits against investments to drive medium- and long-term growth, I would call the following regarding our expected performance in 2015: We are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth in 2015 on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity implementation, further impact from the reduction of our hotel margins, the negative impact of foreign currency and the continued success of our loyalty programs. These are partially offset by the tailwind of adding the Wotif business.
On the expense side, while we continue to manage the business toward our target P&L, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth, especially in the first half of the year, as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack for the increased pace at which we have been building global scale.
From a seasonality perspective, we are not expecting any meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter and expect the bulk of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. In terms of an effective tax rate on a consolidated basis, we are expecting an elevated rate in 2015 primarily as a result of nondeductible losses that we are anticipating on the back of increased investment levels at eLong.
One final quick housekeeping item before we begin Q&A. As Dara mentioned, we plan to increasingly discuss our business in 4 distinct components: The core OTA group, eLong, trivago and Egencia. In this regard, we will break up the results of these 4 businesses beginning with the first quarter of 2015 so that our investors can have the appropriate level of visibility to be able to model a specific value reflecting the unique opportunities and valuation considerations inherent in each business.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to ask questions."

With respect to your specific question on acquisitions, a couple of things I would just note. We certainly are expecting to get a year-on-year helper from those acquisitions. But a lot of the numbers that are available publicly are probably not the best source to look at for the purposes of coming up with those estimates. When we acquired Wotif, that was a business that was facing some pretty significant challenges, again, is going to see pretty significant FX headwinds as we move into -- through 2015. And we're also in the middle of an integration. And we don't expect to see a meaningful uptick in the performance of Wotif until we get that business onto our platform. Now we are making progress on that. We moved international traffic onto the Brand Expedia platform in January. We do expect to get the rest of the business onto the platform in the first half of 2015. But in the meantime, you've got a business that is undergoing a very significant restructuring on a base momentum that is declining. And so you've got a bit of a headwind, certainly, versus what you would've seen more publicly available. Listen, Travelocity, we do think that there could be some upside there. It's very difficult for us to put a precise value on that for you right now. It's really going to depend on how effective we are in really marketing this business. The Travelocity business didn't spend a lot of money on brand advertising in 2014. That is something that we're going to want to do very likely to reinvigorate that brand, which is a great brand. So I think, the acquisitions are going to be a tailwind, but I wouldn't rely on public numbers. Lastly, I would just say that our philosophy is one where our EBITDA outcome is one of careful management and one of careful decisions around what upside we see and what investments do we have available to us to drive medium- and long-term growth. And so -- but we do have some tailwinds from acquisitions, and we did have some last year from Travelocity. We're constantly looking at investments that we can make that respect the EBITDA guidance and the EBITDA targets that we set for our ourself but also set ourselves up for more sustained growth, okay. So with respect to EBITDA, let me just go through the numbers for you. So for eLong, the EBITDA for full year 2014 was a $27 million loss, okay. For the Expedia business -- the Egencia business, it's $60 million. For trivago, it's $4 million, and then you can back into the core OTA business with the rest."

So when you look at our revenue per room night, for example, revenue per room night for international was down significantly more on a year-on-year basis than domestic. Europe is a part of that, but frankly, Asia Pacific is a part of that as well. The foreign exchange trends on a year-on-year basis are significant. And if nothing changes, and at this point, we don't anticipate anything changes -- changing, will continue to be significant as we go through the year. As far as the relative strength of the European market, et cetera, one trend that we have observed is that due to the strength of the dollar, we're seeing a lower balance of European demand coming into the U.S. because the U.S. book is more expensive. In general, we are seeing stronger demand from the U.S. to Europe. And I'd say, in general, across Europe and APAC, we are seeing a higher concentration of demand locally. Now part of that is because we have better local supply and I think we've got better local marketing.

We haven't quite figured out exactly what our strategy is and how we set up the P&L for the long term, but we certainly have that potential. Wotif, we're really in the middle of the integration as we speak. We are going to take the Wotif site, put it on the Brand Expedia platform, but really, it's heads down working on that integration.

And we think that eLong will be very accretive for Expedia shareholders over a period of time, and we're just heads down on maximizing that value from a long-term perspective. As far as acquisitions go, acquisitions are a part of our game plan. We've had a number of acquisitions over the years. And I would say that our technology platforms now and our operating practices now are at a different level where we are good at and have a very strong practice at bringing in and consolidating acquisitions and realizing synergies. We have our hands full with Wotif and Travelocity. But the travel market is enormous. It's a $1.3 trillion travel market. We're one of the biggest players out there with only $50 billion, less than 5% of that market, and we do think that consolidation is going to continue. We think that the big global players, in general, are going to gain share.

And then, I guess, a question on the unit efficiency. So given the trends with revenue per room night and then the marketing spend that's flowing through trivago, is the right way to look at the growth rate of marketing or direct marketing relative to your room night growth? Or how do we think about the rate of marketing deleverage? How much of that is trivago versus some of the contra-revenue items you mentioned versus just kind of industry dynamic?"

We -- again, we will get some helpers from the -- for those acquisitions. But again, we got harder headwinds this year just lapping over the Travelocity acquisition. So the guidance I would take as really representing strength in the core of the business and not a lot of net help from anything other than that. With respect to unit trends and sales and marketing deleverage, again, we're deleveraging sales and marketing essentially for what we think are really great reasons, which, really, 2 major drivers. One is that we're just having much more success in variable marketing channels as we continue to improve the conversion on our websites, and we just get much, much better at that on a global basis. And of course, no matter how efficient those channels are, they're always going to be more expensive than free, which is what the direct type-in traffic is. And so when we're driving growth at other channels, which we are right now, you're going to continue to see deleverage on the P&L there. And secondly, it's just global expansion. And of course, that's happening across all of our brands. We continue to push into international markets on a more aggressive basis. And those markets, even though themselves get efficient -- more efficient over time, they are generally less efficient than our core domestic market. So those are the big drivers. trivago is certainly a piece of it. But I think now you'll see it completely [ph] clear of that acquisition. So we've got clean comps, and that wasn't the case for all of 2014. We had a tougher comp in Q1. They're going to continue to be a driver, but really, it's the core business that's driving a lot of that story now that we're annualizing over the Travelocity -- or sorry, the trivago acquisition. In terms of how to look at it, listen, I think looking at direct sales and marketing per room night is a decent way to look at it. A lot of our marketing spend does go against our hotel business. I think you'll be able to back into a number that at least approximates what you think trivago spends on marketing. You could back out an estimate on that. But I think that could give you a reasonable way to look at it on a go-forward basis."

The other drivers are just very consistent with what we've -- what we spoke about on prior quarters. One is that we continue to adjust our hotel margins to make sure that we're just competitive for local market conditions. And that's pretty important for us as we continue to aggressively build our hotel count and really drive for great rates and availability with our hotel partners. Secondly is the impact of our loyalty programs. And Dara mentioned the Hotels.com Welcome Rewards program has been very successful. More and more of the Hotels.com business is really coming from that repeat loyal user base. It's nicely efficient for us on an adjusted EBITDA basis. But in our P&L, it's shown as a contra-revenue item as opposed to sales and marketing, and so that puts pressure on the metric as well.

We are seeing significant negative headwinds on foreign exchange, and we're seeing, for example, average daily rates this year being negative because of foreign exchange. That's the translation of these foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. And in general, we're seeing more domestic travel on a worldwide basis. So our Russian volumes are more staying within Russia. In almost every single country, we're seeing more travel locally. Part of this is because of our expanding supply and becoming more relevant to local customers.

And we're very comfortable that the businesses that we're in now, kind of the core OTA business, the corporate business, the Wotif business, eLong in China, all have very long runways ahead of them. So right now, we're pretty squarely focused dead ahead on the businesses at hand. Now we are testing and learning. So for example, we're certainly testing and learning with Home Away. We're getting more and more bookable properties on to Expedia. We're giving the Home Away inventory more exposure. And at this point, we don't have kind of a final call on what it means, but it looks like the inventory is certainly attractive, and it does look like a certain segment of our population and customer base likes that inventory and appreciates our showing them that inventory. At the same time, one area that we are working on and, I think, getting much better at is to up-sell various parts of travel to our customers. So when a customer comes in to buy an Expedia air ticket, I think we're getting much better about up-selling a car or up-selling destination services, ground transport to that customer, ticket to a theme park, et cetera. So all of these other travel opportunities, many, many of them are opportunities that we are servicing now. And our focus is how can we cross-sell those customers more stuff because those cross-sells typically are very, very high margins because we don't have to kind of reacquire those customers through third-party channels. So we certainly want to cast our net wider, but it's within the set of products that we're offering now. And we're seeing very, very good experience there. Our attach-type revenue growth for us is really at record highs, and we think there's much, much more to go."

We delivered healthy top line growth with gross bookings up 28% and revenue up 21% year-on-year. Room nights grew 26% for the year, air tickets were up 28%, and we grew our ad and media business, including trivago, by 50%.
At the same time, we made significant investments in areas that will position us for long-term growth, ramping up our hotel acquisition efforts, scaling our global technology platforms and making key investments to drive growth at trivago. In total, we were able to balance our near-term profit objectives and long-term investment priorities and deliver full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%.
As we move into 2015, we'd like to talk to you about 4 distinct businesses in our portfolio: the core OTA group, eLong, trivago and Egencia, each of which has its own market opportunity, growth drivers, competitive dynamics and, ultimately, value-creation potential. 
Our core OTA group is led by our 2 flagship global brands: Brand Expedia and Hotels.com and also includes regional or segment brand leaders, such as Hotwire, Venere and CarRentals.com; EAN, our affiliate business; and now, Travelocity and Wotif. 
Over the past several years, we've made significant investments and improved our execution across our online marketing platforms, customer-facing technology and supplier-facing platforms. And while the work is never done, this business is performing well, and we're seeing the benefits show up in our operating results. 
On a combined basis, our core OTA business generated approximately $43 billion of gross bookings in 2014, up about 30% year-on-year. This growth is significantly faster than the industry, and we believe we're gaining market share in every major geography. 
Additionally, we're finding key commercial deals and acquisitions that enable us to leverage our existing technology and operations infrastructure to amplify our growth, such as the deal to power and now own Travelocity and the acquisition of Wotif. Our platforms and operational processes now allow us to acquire businesses, integrate them predictably and quickly, and realize meaningful synergies while creating improved experiences for our customers and our supply partners.
As the performance challenges we've seen at Hotwire demonstrate, bumps in the road will always arise in this highly competitive segment. However, we believe we're executing well and are positioned better than ever. Staying with the theme of challenges, eLong incurred a $27 million adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4 as a highly competitive environment that we talked about during our last call was more than true. We manage our 65% eLong stake independently, and eLong has its own capital, so we are not making tradeoff investments in other businesses to fund eLong.
While we aren't counting on the competitive environment getting any better in 2015, we know that the market opportunity in China is huge, we're confident in the execution capabilities of the eLong team and are very confident that we're building real value there.
As is sure in any geography in which we compete, we aren't dogmatic about our approach and will draw it towards one simple goal: long-term value creation for Expedia shareholders.
Turning to trivago. We've owned a majority stake in trivago since March of 2013, and the business continues to grow an -- at impressive rates. If you watch any TV at all in the U.S., you've no doubt seen the trivago guy pitching the site as an excellent place to find the ideal hotel at the best price. 
On a stand-alone basis for the full year, trivago generated revenue of over $410 million, up 68% year-on-year and EBITDA of $4 million. Note that this includes revenue from all the other Expedia, Inc., brands. Our focus for trivago has been on growing the top line rather than profitability, and we've been reinvesting profits from core markets at trivago to fund worldwide expansion. While we expect trivago to generate adjusted EBITDA growth in 2015, we will continue to trade off near-term profits for long-term value.
Turning to Egencia. We had a terrific corporate travel business year, which exceeded $5 billion of gross bookings in 2014. Egencia is growing at healthy rates, signing up new business at a fast pace while integrating platforms in key acquisitions over time. With this business, we're mostly focused on industry disruption bringing more new products and services and better technology to corporate customers. 
And although they remain much larger than Egencia, we see the big legacy players on their back foot trying to figure out how to deliver technology and tools to compete effectively with Egencia and other online offerings. We believe this business can grow nicely on an organic basis, but we'll continue to look opportunistically at acquisitions to accelerate growth and further scale the business over time.
In closing, let me say this. While we celebrate a job well done in 2014, we are by no means standing still. Our products and service, while better, have miles of improvement ahead of them. You won't find a single person across Expedia, Inc., who will tell you that we're executing to our full potential, but we're finally seeing the arc of the possible. 
With that, I'll hand it to Mark."

In the fourth quarter, we again saw strong performance from our core OTA group, trivago and Egencia.

In the fourth quarter, we again saw strong performance from our core OTA group, trivago and Egencia. And although profitably was negatively affected by sizable investments at eLong, negative FX trends and significant due diligence and other deal costs, we were happy to exit a terrific year with good momentum. 
Top line growth was driven this quarter by robust unit growth pretty much across the board. Room nights and air ticket growth helped drive gross bookings growth of 24%, 27% excluding the impact of foreign currency, and revenue growth of 18% or 22% excluding FX.
Hotel room night growth accelerated to 28% with healthy growth seen across all major geographies. Travelocity and Wotif together contributed around 5 percentage points to total room night growth. Room night economics, on the other hand, continue to be lower year-over-year with revenue per room night down 10% on flat ADRs. The impact from foreign currency was the larger driver this quarter than in prior periods, and we estimate that the negative impact on our revenue per room night was roughly 5 percentage points with a portion of this hedged off and recorded as other income.
The other main drivers of the decline in unit economics remain relatively consistent with prior periods. We continue to reduce our hotel margins to enable an accelerated global buildout of hotel room inventory and availability. And we also continue to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs along with coupons and other incentives which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We will continue to push these levers throughout 2015, and as such, continue to expect revenue per room night to decline.
Air revenue grew 18% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 6%. Air gross bookings and air revenue were helped again this quarter by Travelocity, which represented approximately 12 percentage points of the total ticket volume growth. Revenue per ticket was down, as expected, as a result of the renewal of certain airline deals earlier in the year, and we expect this pressure to continue into 2015 as we annualize these contracts. 
Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, has become quite large and is growing fast. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 38%, net of intercompany amounts. We also saw healthy contributions from our car and insurance products.
On the expense side, we saw solid leverage this quarter in costs of revenue as the team continues to drive for global efficiencies in our customer operations platform and on reduced levels of fraud and charge-backs year-over-year. General and administrative expenses grew faster than revenue due primarily to over $8 million of deal costs, without which, the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and nicely leveraging versus revenue.
The pace of growth of our technology and content expense was a little bit faster than the growth we saw in the third quarter. Selling and marketing expense growth was also broadly consistent with prior quarters. Deleverage in selling and marketing versus revenue continues to be driven primarily by success in variable marketing channels as we continue to execute well and expand across the globe.
The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% excluding eLong and 3% on a consolidated basis. As I mentioned, our Q4 results were also impacted by negative FX trends, over $8 million of deal costs and eLong losses, all of which exceeded our expectations at the time of our last call. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA growth for the full year 2014 would have been at the top end of our guidance range.
You will also notice $26 million of restructuring and related charges in Q4. These consist primarily of costs associated with the integration of our Wotif acquisition but also include some other efficiency-related initiatives, including the migration of our Venere business onto our Hotels.com platform as well as platform consolidation in our CarRentals.com business and at Egencia. We do expect $10 million to $15 million of additional restructuring costs in 2015, the majority of which you'll see in the first half of the year. Note that these expenses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
From a capital allocation perspective, 2014 was an active year. We delivered over $1 billion of free cash flow and allocated $500 million towards acquisitions, paid out $85 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares for $537 million. 
Now I'd like to spend some time on our financial expectations for 2015. Please note that our format for providing guidance is a little bit different this quarter.
As Dara mentioned, the Chinese market remains highly competitive and dynamic. And because of this, we are not going to provide any specific adjusted EBITDA expectations for eLong for 2015.
Directionally, we think the adjusted EBITDA loss of $27 million that eLong reported in the fourth quarter is a good baseline, and we would expect the quarterly losses to be larger than this as we move through 2015. eLong is a well-capitalized, NASDAQ-listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we encourage you to value our eLong position and its impact on our consolidated results on a stand-alone basis.
For the rest of the business excluding eLong, we are currently expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the 10% to 15% range. Note that this includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 5 percentage points at current rates. Against the general backdrop of strength across our business and our continuing efforts to balance near-term profits against investments to drive medium- and long-term growth, I would call the following regarding our expected performance in 2015: We are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth in 2015 on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity implementation, further impact from the reduction of our hotel margins, the negative impact of foreign currency and the continued success of our loyalty programs. These are partially offset by the tailwind of adding the Wotif business.
On the expense side, while we continue to manage the business toward our target P&L, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth, especially in the first half of the year, as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack for the increased pace at which we have been building global scale.
From a seasonality perspective, we are not expecting any meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter and expect the bulk of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. In terms of an effective tax rate on a consolidated basis, we are expecting an elevated rate in 2015 primarily as a result of nondeductible losses that we are anticipating on the back of increased investment levels at eLong.
One final quick housekeeping item before we begin Q&A. As Dara mentioned, we plan to increasingly discuss our business in 4 distinct components: The core OTA group, eLong, trivago and Egencia. In this regard, we will break up the results of these 4 businesses beginning with the first quarter of 2015 so that our investors can have the appropriate level of visibility to be able to model a specific value reflecting the unique opportunities and valuation considerations inherent in each business.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to ask questions."

With respect to your specific question on acquisitions, a couple of things I would just note. We certainly are expecting to get a year-on-year helper from those acquisitions. But a lot of the numbers that are available publicly are probably not the best source to look at for the purposes of coming up with those estimates. When we acquired Wotif, that was a business that was facing some pretty significant challenges, again, is going to see pretty significant FX headwinds as we move into -- through 2015. And we're also in the middle of an integration. And we don't expect to see a meaningful uptick in the performance of Wotif until we get that business onto our platform. Now we are making progress on that. We moved international traffic onto the Brand Expedia platform in January. We do expect to get the rest of the business onto the platform in the first half of 2015. But in the meantime, you've got a business that is undergoing a very significant restructuring on a base momentum that is declining. And so you've got a bit of a headwind, certainly, versus what you would've seen more publicly available. Listen, Travelocity, we do think that there could be some upside there. It's very difficult for us to put a precise value on that for you right now. It's really going to depend on how effective we are in really marketing this business. The Travelocity business didn't spend a lot of money on brand advertising in 2014. That is something that we're going to want to do very likely to reinvigorate that brand, which is a great brand. So I think, the acquisitions are going to be a tailwind, but I wouldn't rely on public numbers. Lastly, I would just say that our philosophy is one where our EBITDA outcome is one of careful management and one of careful decisions around what upside we see and what investments do we have available to us to drive medium- and long-term growth. And so -- but we do have some tailwinds from acquisitions, and we did have some last year from Travelocity. We're constantly looking at investments that we can make that respect the EBITDA guidance and the EBITDA targets that we set for our ourself but also set ourselves up for more sustained growth, okay. So with respect to EBITDA, let me just go through the numbers for you. So for eLong, the EBITDA for full year 2014 was a $27 million loss, okay. For the Expedia business -- the Egencia business, it's $60 million. For trivago, it's $4 million, and then you can back into the core OTA business with the rest."

So when you look at our revenue per room night, for example, revenue per room night for international was down significantly more on a year-on-year basis than domestic. Europe is a part of that, but frankly, Asia Pacific is a part of that as well. The foreign exchange trends on a year-on-year basis are significant. And if nothing changes, and at this point, we don't anticipate anything changes -- changing, will continue to be significant as we go through the year. As far as the relative strength of the European market, et cetera, one trend that we have observed is that due to the strength of the dollar, we're seeing a lower balance of European demand coming into the U.S. because the U.S. book is more expensive. In general, we are seeing stronger demand from the U.S. to Europe. And I'd say, in general, across Europe and APAC, we are seeing a higher concentration of demand locally. Now part of that is because we have better local supply and I think we've got better local marketing. But in general, our domestic room night growth in most territories exceeds international room night growth. We think it's a good trend. It hurts ADRs and it hurts length of stay, but we think it's a very, very positive factor in our growing business on a global basis."

And we think that eLong will be very accretive for Expedia shareholders over a period of time, and we're just heads down on maximizing that value from a long-term perspective. As far as acquisitions go, acquisitions are a part of our game plan. We've had a number of acquisitions over the years. And I would say that our technology platforms now and our operating practices now are at a different level where we are good at and have a very strong practice at bringing in and consolidating acquisitions and realizing synergies. We have our hands full with Wotif and Travelocity. But the travel market is enormous. It's a $1.3 trillion travel market. We're one of the biggest players out there with only $50 billion, less than 5% of that market, and we do think that consolidation is going to continue. We think that the big global players, in general, are going to gain share.

And then, I guess, a question on the unit efficiency. So given the trends with revenue per room night and then the marketing spend that's flowing through trivago, is the right way to look at the growth rate of marketing or direct marketing relative to your room night growth? Or how do we think about the rate of marketing deleverage? How much of that is trivago versus some of the contra-revenue items you mentioned versus just kind of industry dynamic?"

We -- again, we will get some helpers from the -- for those acquisitions. But again, we got harder headwinds this year just lapping over the Travelocity acquisition. So the guidance I would take as really representing strength in the core of the business and not a lot of net help from anything other than that. With respect to unit trends and sales and marketing deleverage, again, we're deleveraging sales and marketing essentially for what we think are really great reasons, which, really, 2 major drivers. One is that we're just having much more success in variable marketing channels as we continue to improve the conversion on our websites, and we just get much, much better at that on a global basis. And of course, no matter how efficient those channels are, they're always going to be more expensive than free, which is what the direct type-in traffic is. And so when we're driving growth at other channels, which we are right now, you're going to continue to see deleverage on the P&L there. And secondly, it's just global expansion. And of course, that's happening across all of our brands. We continue to push into international markets on a more aggressive basis. And those markets, even though themselves get efficient -- more efficient over time, they are generally less efficient than our core domestic market. So those are the big drivers. trivago is certainly a piece of it. But I think now you'll see it completely [ph] clear of that acquisition. So we've got clean comps, and that wasn't the case for all of 2014. We had a tougher comp in Q1. They're going to continue to be a driver, but really, it's the core business that's driving a lot of that story now that we're annualizing over the Travelocity -- or sorry, the trivago acquisition. In terms of how to look at it, listen, I think looking at direct sales and marketing per room night is a decent way to look at it. A lot of our marketing spend does go against our hotel business. I think you'll be able to back into a number that at least approximates what you think trivago spends on marketing. You could back out an estimate on that. But I think that could give you a reasonable way to look at it on a go-forward basis."

And that's pretty important for us as we continue to aggressively build our hotel count and really drive for great rates and availability with our hotel partners. Secondly is the impact of our loyalty programs. And Dara mentioned the Hotels.com Welcome Rewards program has been very successful. More and more of the Hotels.com business is really coming from that repeat loyal user base. It's nicely efficient for us on an adjusted EBITDA basis.

We are seeing significant negative headwinds on foreign exchange, and we're seeing, for example, average daily rates this year being negative because of foreign exchange. That's the translation of these foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. And in general, we're seeing more domestic travel on a worldwide basis. So our Russian volumes are more staying within Russia. In almost every single country, we're seeing more travel locally. Part of this is because of our expanding supply and becoming more relevant to local customers.

So right now, we're pretty squarely focused dead ahead on the businesses at hand. Now we are testing and learning. So for example, we're certainly testing and learning with Home Away. We're getting more and more bookable properties on to Expedia. We're giving the Home Away inventory more exposure. And at this point, we don't have kind of a final call on what it means, but it looks like the inventory is certainly attractive, and it does look like a certain segment of our population and customer base likes that inventory and appreciates our showing them that inventory. At the same time, one area that we are working on and, I think, getting much better at is to up-sell various parts of travel to our customers. So when a customer comes in to buy an Expedia air ticket, I think we're getting much better about up-selling a car or up-selling destination services, ground transport to that customer, ticket to a theme park, et cetera. So all of these other travel opportunities, many, many of them are opportunities that we are servicing now. And our focus is how can we cross-sell those customers more stuff because those cross-sells typically are very, very high margins because we don't have to kind of reacquire those customers through third-party channels. So we certainly want to cast our net wider, but it's within the set of products that we're offering now. And we're seeing very, very good experience there.

Expedia's off to a strong start this year, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver another year of solid results in a healthy travel environment. Aside from the worsening impact of FX translation on our results, our expectations for what we can deliver this year haven't changed. I'm particularly happy with our unit growth this quarter. Global room night is up 32%, air ticket is up 18%, and car rental days up over 35%, all representing share gains in the overall travel market.
The major brands in our core OTA segment are executing well and delivering good results. Revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by organic growth of Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN, as well as nice contributions from Travelocity and Wotif. I'm pleased that the pace of hotel acquisition has accelerated in 2015. Excluding eLong inventory, we added almost 14,000 hotels on the first quarter, which represents a pace of acquisition more than twice as fast as the fourth quarter of last year. 
We expect to continue to grow our marketing management team and significantly increase our rate of innovation and supplier technology to drive ongoing acceleration of hotel property additions. 
The migration of the Wotif site onto the Expedia platform is substantially complete, a process that has taken less than 6 months end to end. We had many an employee give up late nights with their friends and family to make this happen, and we're thankful oto all of the contributing Expedia Inc. employees, especially our new colleagues on the Wotif team for their efforts. 
Wotif is not yet a meaningful contributor to the bottom line due to negative FX trends, purchase accounting adjustments and elimination of certain consumer booking fees. However, we're pleased to have broaden Australian consumer's access to a global inventory. We're seeing very positive conversion trends as a result of our integration programs and expect the business to contribute more to profitability as we move through 2015 and into next year. 
We've also welcomed the Travelocity marketing teams into our business and are making good progress on migrating tools and approaches. In the near term, we plan to ramp up selling and marketing spend to build momentum for this brand, which is likely to put some pressure on adjusted EBITDA contribution from Travelocity this year.
We are seeing double-digit transaction growth year-over-year and are pleased to see the strength of the Travelocity brand in action.
Now I'm sure you're all interested in an update on the announced Orbitz transaction. The DOJ made a second request and we're cooperating with them to make sure they have information they need to enable them to complete their review by the end of the year. We believe the global travel market is huge and competition is fierce, and that the transaction will benefit both competition and consumers. Beyond that, we don't have any additional information to share at this time.
Venere continues to see very strong growth, generating standalone revenue of $119 million in the first quarter and $449 million on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to aggressively invest profits from more developed markets to drug brand recognition in global expansion in newer markets. Of particular note, trivago continues to gain incisive think they'll U.S., which now represents their largest market in terms of revenue generated.
As a result of the increased investments that we mentioned last quarter, eLong drove an acceleration on year-over-year room night growth in the first quarter compared to the growth rate in Q4 2014. Efforts in mobile and supply additions are very true with mobile growing triple digits overall and representing more than 65% of eLong brand room nights for the quarter.
We're very supportive of the eLong management team, are pleased to see our investments start to bear fruit and we remain confident that we can create real shareholder value through this asset.
Lastly, Egencia saw very good year-over-year unit growth this quarter, essentially consistent with the pace of growth this in Q4 and with strength in both the U.S. and Europe.
Our new product introduction, such as our iPad app, have been met by enthusiasm by our existing and potential clients. Egencia continues to win new clients in impressive rate on the back of its industry-leading technology, and we remain confident in its ability to continue to make share gains in the large and attractively managed corporate travel segment.
Note that Egencia has a big European business invest is disproportionally impacted by FX headwinds. You can see that impact reflected in the reported gross bookings and revenue growth. In closing, while we're pleased with our early momentum, the year is young, and as usual, we have plenty of sale just in elevated. We are clear about our strategy and are fully in execution mode. With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Overall themes for Q1 performance are very similar to what we saw the fourth quarter. Once again, we saw strong performance from a core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, offset by negative FX trends and ongoing headwinds on unit economics. A",1012,"Thanks, Dara. Overall themes for Q1 performance are very similar to what we saw the fourth quarter. Once again, we saw strong performance from a core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, offset by negative FX trends and ongoing headwinds on unit economics. As expected, the eLong team continued investing aggressively in China, which did put pressure on the consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Top line growth was again driven by solid unit growth across all major geographies. 
Room night growth accelerated for all of our major brands relative to Q4 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 32% year-over-year. Domestic room nights grew 23% in Q1, while international room nights were up 41%. We did get a 4 percentage point tailwind to global room night growth from the inorganic impact of Wotif and the consolidation of the areas of joint venture.
Note that we also comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial agreement during the first quarter, so Q2 will be our first clean comp for that business. Revenue per room night was down 13.6% this quarter, while ADRs were down 2.5%, roughly half of the decline in revenue per room night this quarter was driven by the negative impact of foreign currency. The other half included the impact of the delivered reductions in hotel margins to accelerate our global build-out of hotel room inventory and availability, as well as efforts to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs and other incentives. It's very consistent with the factors we have discussed in the past.
Air revenue grew 9% on ticket growth of 18%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 7%. Ticket volume growth decelerated this quarter as we comp over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial deal in Q1 of last year. This headwind was partially offset by 2 percentage point tailwind from consolidation of the Air Asia joint venture. On a normalized basis, air ticket growth, excluding Travelocity and Air Asia, accelerated nicely the first quarter. Revenue per ticket was down as a result of foreign currency headwind, geographic mix and the renewal of certain airline deals in 2014.
Our Advertising and Media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group has become quite large and is growing fast. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated over $0.5 billion of net advertising and media revenue, up 35% year-over-year. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 23% net of intercompany amounts.
We also continue to see healthy contributions from our car and insurance products.
On the expense side, excluding eLong, we saw expense leverage across cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people cost and technology and content expense. Direct selling and marketing expense grew faster than revenue as expected.
As well as the case for Q4, general administrative expenses also grew faster than revenue due primarily to about $8 million of due diligence in other deals cost without which the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and leveraging nicely.
The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 25%, excluding eLong, and a decline of 5% year-over-year, including eLong. Note that adjusted earnings per share was negatively impacted this quarter by an unfavorable effective tax rate.
As we mentioned on the last call, due to eLong losses for which we are not recording a tax benefit, we are forecasting an elevated effective tax rate for the full year. Specifically, assuming eLong losses continue at this quarter's level or higher, we expect the tax rate to be in the mid-30% range for the full year. For illustrative purposes, had we applied that rate to this quarter's results, adjusted EPS would have improved by approximately $0.08 per share.
In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, as Dara mentioned, with the exception of foreign currency trends working against us, we're happy with our year-to-date performance and remain optimistic about the year. As such, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. Note that since the date of our Q4 call, we estimate that FX trends has worked against us by another approximately 200 basis points of full year adjusted EBITDA growth. And as such, we are a bit more cautious about where we will finish in this range.
With respect to the shape of the year, again specifically for Expedia, excluding eLong, I would like to reiterate that we expect the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. As we move into the balance of the year, we are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity limitation, which is only partially offset by tailwinds from recent acquisitions. And our organic revenue growth rate remains subject to the unit economic pressures, which we have discussed. On the expense side, we continue to expect elevated technology and content expense growth as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack.
In the second quarter, specifically, we'll have added pressure on adjusted EBITDA growth as we ramp selling and marketing expense to drive summer season revenue, a good portion of which will not be recognized until Q3 and beyond. Now moving away for guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, to focus specifically on guidance for eLong standalone.
ELong's adjusted EBITDA loss of $33 million in Q1 is indicative of the size and scale of the competitive efforts and investments required in that market. We expect the quarterly losses for eLong to be as large, if not larger, than the first quarter loss on a go-forward basis. 
ELong is a well-capitalized, publicly listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we continue to encourage analysts and investors to model, analyze and report on eLong separately and to value our eLong position on a stand-alone basis.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

With respect to factors that will drive core EBITDA, excluding eLong on a go-forward basis, really, the big driver there is strength in the core OTA business. This business lives or dies by the strength of brand Expedia and Hotels.com, EAN. And really, that's the big driver. I mean, we will get some help from Travelocity and Wotif. But as Dara mentioned in his remarks, we don't expect Wotif, for example, to be a big driver or a driver really until the back half of the year. And with our plans for ramping up sales and marketing to build momentum at Travelocity, in addition to the momentum we've already got, we do expect again that benefit to largely come in the back half of the year as well."

I would just caution everyone again that a quarter does not make a business make. It's a highly seasonal business. And I think particularly in Q1, it's hard to draw any conclusions. In terms of trivago, we did have a nice profit in Q1. A few things driving that. One is the business continues to perform very well, both in its core European markets, but also in the U.S. And the performance, at least on the revenue line, did exceed the expectations a bit in the first quarter. And there's also with trivago, as you can imagine, given the amount of -- particularly television advertising spend that they do, they can also be heavily influenced from quarter-to-quarter by the timing of spend. And there was a bit of timing-related goodness, if you will, in the first quarter as well."

And we are testing out the Brand Expedia retail hotel platform on Hotwire, and we're seeing some early positive signs there. So that makes us hopeful. And we are launching a new ad campaign for Hotwire in Q2. It will be an EBITDA headwind, but we are quite positive about the app campaign and expect it to introduce more consumers to the Hotwire brand, which we think fundamentally is still a good brand at a good product. So we're hopeful, but at this point, the business is still on a negative trend from a profitability basis, obviously, made up by some of our other brands.

The loyalty programs, particularly the Hotels.com loyalty program, is a big factor and a growing factor in terms of the volume of business that they're getting from that program. That obviously shows up as a contra revenue line item. And you can kind of back into some rough numbers based on some of our disclosure in terms of impact on revenue per room night. And so that's a great piece of business, however. It's business that generally involves high spending, loyal customers who come through more direct channels and ultimately, when we look through the bottom line, we would say, we definitely want more of that business as opposed to less of that business. In terms of our hotel margins, listen, the -- there is certainly going to be an impact of lower hotel margins on room night growth. Of course, we have no idea what in fact that impact is. But as a reminder, we are lowering our hotel margins to essentially just be competitive with the local market conditions. And that encourages new hotels to sign up with us and our existing hotels to give us more attractive inventory because they view us as a more attractive general to distribute through. And in return, that just gives our customers much better product essentially and opens up different marketing channels for us. So there's definitely a connection there. It's hard to draw it completely. With respect to 2Q sales and marketing spend, as I mentioned, there was some timing shift between Q1 and Q2 a little bit of trivago and a number of other brands as well. Travelocity is going to be a factor. Wotif may also be a factor in the quarter. And then, of course, you do definitely have to be ordinary issue of in a growing and particularly accelerating business. You have a mismatch between sales and marketing spend and revenue, and it can create some mismatches in profit from quarter-to-quarter."

We knew that there will be an upfront costs to hiring the headcount, training the headcount and the field sales force. And to some extent, we bore those costs last year. And now you're seeing a combination of those marketing managers being trained up and effective. We have improved and invested in our technology so that we can onboard hotels faster when we sign them up. And also, linking up that onboarding to our marketing channels, especially variable marketing channels so that we can produce for the hotels that we signed up even more quickly after a sign-up. So the acceleration was expected. And this is something that we continue to expect to see for the balance of the year. And as you know, there are thousands and thousands more hotels that we can wire up on a global basis. So we think that this is just the beginning of a multiyear journey. As far as marketing ROIs go, I would say that there hasn't been a significant shifts one way or the other as far as overall ROIs. We continue to, on variable channels, bid on the various channels based on expected revenue from those channels. Foreign exchange trends in U.S. dollars has in general, taken down the amount that we can bid, let's say, for foreign demand because average revenue per transaction is coming down in U.S. dollar terms. But from an efficiency standpoint, we are just as aggressive as we have been in the past. I'd say that some of the channel shift that we had seen in the past over the 2, 3 years of the variable channels growing as a percentage of our direct channels, some of that channel shift is slowing down a bit. Our variable channels continue to grow quickly. But our brand channels, Mark made the comments on loyalty previously, the repeat part of our business is growing faster now than it was growing 2, 3 years ago. So the mix shift that we talked to you previously is probably easing up a bit. And that's not necessarily good or bad news because we always want to be able to allocate as much marketing money as we can efficiently to the variable channels. But it's certainly is good to see the direct channels growing faster than they have been historically. And hopefully, it'll keep going."

I would then sort of lumped into that the $8 million of deal cost. And it puts it solidly into the negatives. So the story that you saw in Q1 was indeed an organic story. And as we said in the prepared remarks, and Dara mentioned subsequently, again, we don't expect there to be a significant tailwind on profitability, if you will, from Wotif and Travelocity really until we move through back part of Q2 and into the back part of this year. So it's -- our story this year, despite in the headlines on acquisitions, very much is an organic story."

But we are a middle man that adds value or a middle person that adds value. These are the hotel businesses is incredibly fragmented. We are making global demand available to these hotel years through our marketing channels. We think on the technology side, we can add very significant value as far as building great consumer experiences. And at this point, we are seeing our transactional growth and unit growth accelerating. So from my standpoint, we are a middle person who is getting more valuable and certainly not getting squeezed. Now that said, as we scale and as the Internet becomes more ubiquitous, we do have to drive our cost of operations down. And so you are seeing that in our revenue margins. It is something that is tough to execute. It is tough financially. But we've done it for a number of years. And the team understands the task at hand.

It is the combination of a number of different activities going across the business and essentially, everybody doing their jobs well. If you really want to simplify the core of room night growth, it's dependent on 3 factors. How much traffic are you bringing in? How are you converting that traffic? And really, what you're repeat rate is. And our -- the traffic growth for the businesses is healthy and in general, has been either generally healthy and/or improving. Conversion has continues to increase both for Hotels.com and Expedia and that is a better website in general, more repeat customers and stronger supply including the new hotels that we're adding on a local basis. So conversion is positive. And then repeat rate in general is positive as well, as the higher percentage of our bookings come from repeat customers. We're essentially going out, acquiring new customers, converting them to repeat customers through either their experience, which is a good experience, or through loyalty programs. And then you enter repeat. And you use of those profits to buy and acquire new customers. So it is all of those factors coming together to combine for a healthy room night Q1, what certainly a number that we're happy with. And hopefully, we can keep our room night growth growing at healthy rates on a go-forward basis. As far as the hotel margins go, in general, we were at higher level than our competition, especially in Europe and some of the Asia Pacific markets. And we've moved our margins to be more competitive with some of the local players there. And as we've moved the margins to be more competitive, the hoteliers, the local hotel years are talking to us. And obviously, they know our brand. They see the amount of demand that we're bringing to the country. They see the amount of foreign travel so that we can bring in. And as a result, the sales calls are more successful higher percentage of the time than they were and we have more feet on the street. So it was, again, investment that we have to make, kind of upfront investment. We have to make a bet that the volume would come. And so far, the bet working out well.

Another factor there is as we continue to build out our hotel base and we add more properties, one of the first places you could see that pick up is in metasearch channels. We're able to drive traffic directly to those properties. I think the third factor is trivago has been expanding very aggressively into the U.S. And Dara mentioned in his prepared remarks the U.S. is the biggest market now by revenue.

25915843,283238799,799663,"Expedia Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan.

Aside from the worsening impact of FX translation on our results, our expecta",815,"Thanks, Alan. Expedia's off to a strong start this year, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver another year of solid results in a healthy travel environment. Aside from the worsening impact of FX translation on our results, our expectations for what we can deliver this year haven't changed. I'm particularly happy with our unit growth this quarter: global room nights up 32%, air tickets up 18% and car rental days up over 35%, all representing share gains in the overall travel market.
The major brands in our core OTA segment are executing well and delivering good results. Revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by organic growth of Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN as well as nice contributions from Travelocity and Wotif.
I'm also pleased that the pace of hotel acquisition has accelerated in 2015. Excluding eLong inventory, we added almost 14,000 hotels on the first quarter, which represents a pace of acquisition more than twice as fast as the fourth quarter of last year.  We expect to continue to grow our marketing management team and significantly increase our rate of innovation and supplier technology to drive ongoing acceleration of hotel property additions. 
The migration of the Wotif site onto the Expedia platform is substantially complete, a process that has taken less than 6 months end to end. We had many an employee give up late nights with their friends and family to make this happen, and we're thankful to all of the contributing Expedia Inc. employees, especially our new colleagues on the Wotif team for their efforts.
Wotif is not yet a meaningful contributor to the bottom line due to negative FX trends, purchase accounting adjustments and elimination of certain consumer booking fees. However, we're pleased to have broadened Australian consumers' access to our global inventory. We're seeing early positive conversion trends as a result of our integration programs and expect the business to contribute more to profitability as we move through 2015 and into next year.
We've also welcomed the Travelocity marketing teams into our business and are making good progress on migrating tools and approaches. In the near term, we plan to ramp up selling and marketing spend to build momentum for this brand, which is likely to put some pressure on adjusted EBITDA contribution from Travelocity this year. We are seeing double-digit transaction growth year-over-year and are pleased to see the strength of the Travelocity brand in action.
Now I'm sure you're all interested in an update on the announced Orbitz transaction. The DOJ made a second request, and we're cooperating with them to make sure they have the information they need to enable them to complete their review by the end of the year. We believe the global travel market is huge and competition is fierce and that the transaction will benefit both competition and consumers. Beyond that, we don't have any additional information to share at this time.
trivago continued to see very strong growth, generating stand-alone revenue of $119 million in the first quarter and $449 million on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to aggressively invest profits from more developed markets to drive brand recognition and global expansion in newer markets. Of particular note, trivago continues to gain in size and strength in the U.S., which now represents their largest market in terms of revenue generated.
As a result of the increased investments that we made -- that we mentioned last quarter, eLong drove an acceleration on year-over-year room night growth in the first quarter compared to the growth rate in Q4 2014. Efforts in mobile and supply additions are bearing fruit with mobile growing triple digits overall and representing more than 65% of eLong brand room nights for the quarter. We're very supportive of the eLong management team, are pleased to see our investments start to bear fruit and remain confident that we can create real shareholder value through this asset.
Lastly, Egencia saw very good year-over-year unit growth this quarter, essentially consistent with the pace of growth in Q4 and with strength in both the U.S. and Europe. Our new product introductions, such as our iPad app, have been met by enthusiasm by our existing and potential clients. Egencia continues to win new clients in an impressive rate on the back of its industry-leading technology, and we remain confident in its ability to continue to make share gains in the large and attractively managed corporate travel segment.
Note that Egencia has a big European business and thus, is disproportionally impacted by FX headwinds. You can see that impact reflected in their reported gross bookings and revenue growth.
In closing, while we're pleased with our early momentum, the year is young, and as usual, we have plenty of challenges to navigate. We're clear about our strategy and are fully in execution mode.
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Overall themes for Q1 performance are very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Once again, we saw strong performance from our core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, offset by negative FX trends and ongoing headwinds on unit economics. As expected, the eLong team continued investing aggressively in China, which did put pressure on the consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Top line growth was again driven by solid unit growth across all major geographies.
Room night growth accelerated for all of our major brands relative to Q4 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 32% year-over-year. Domestic room nights grew 23% in Q1, while international room nights were up 41%. We did get a 4 percentage point tailwind to global room night growth from the inorganic impact, Wotif and the consolidation of the areas of joint venture. Note that we also comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial agreement during the first quarter, so Q2 will be our first clean comp for that business.
Revenue per room night was down 13.6% this quarter, while ADRs were down 2.5%. Roughly half of the decline in revenue per room night this quarter was driven by the negative impact of foreign currency. The other half included the impacts of the deliberate reductions in hotel margins to accelerate our global build-out of hotel room inventory and availability as well as efforts to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs and other incentives. It's very consistent with the factors we have discussed in the past.
Air revenue grew 9% on ticket growth of 18%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 7%. Ticket volume growth decelerated this quarter as we comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial deal in Q1 of last year. This headwind was partially offset by a 2 percentage point tailwind from consolidation of the AirAsia joint venture. On a normalized basis, air ticket growth, excluding Travelocity and AirAsia, accelerated nicely in the first quarter. Revenue per ticket was down as a result of foreign currency headwind, geographic mix and the renewal of certain airline deals in 2014.
Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group has become quite large and is growing fast. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated over $0.5 billion of net advertising and media revenue, up 35% year-over-year. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 23% net of intercompany amounts.
We also continued to see healthy contributions from our car and insurance products.
On the expense side, excluding eLong, we saw expense leverage across cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people cost and technology and content expense. Direct selling and marketing expense grew faster than revenue as expected.
As was the case for Q4, general and administrative expenses also grew faster than revenue due primarily to about $8 million of due diligence in other deals cost, without which, the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and leveraging nicely.
The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 25%, excluding eLong, and a decline of 5% year-over-year, including eLong. Note that adjusted earnings per share was negatively impacted this quarter by an unfavorable effective tax rate.
As we mentioned on the last call, due to eLong losses for which we are not recording a tax benefit, we are forecasting an elevated effective tax rate for the full year. Specifically, assuming eLong losses continue at this quarter's level or higher, we expect the tax rate to be in the mid-30% range for the full year. For illustrative purposes, had we applied that rate to this quarter's results, adjusted EPS would have improved by approximately $0.08 per share.
In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, as Dara mentioned, with the exception of foreign currency trends working against us, we're happy with our year-to-date performance and remain optimistic about the year. As such, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. Note that since the date of our Q4 call, we estimate that FX trends had worked against us by another approximately 200 basis points of full year adjusted EBITDA growth. And as such, we are a bit more cautious about where we will finish in this range.
With respect to the shape of the year, again, specifically for Expedia, excluding eLong, I would like to reiterate that we expect the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. As we move into the balance of the year, we are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity implementation, which are only partially offset by tailwinds from recent acquisitions. And our organic revenue growth rate remains subject to the unit economic pressures, which we have discussed. On the expense side, we continue to expect elevated technology and content expense growth as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack. In the second quarter, specifically, we'll have added pressure on adjusted EBITDA growth as we ramp selling and marketing expense to drive summer season revenue, a good portion of which will not be recognized until Q3 and beyond.
Now moving away for guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, to focus specifically on guidance for eLong standalone. ELong's adjusted EBITDA loss of $33 million in Q1 is indicative of the size and scale of the competitive efforts and investments required in that market. We expect the quarterly losses for eLong to be as large, if not, larger than the first quarter loss on a go-forward basis. eLong is a well-capitalized, publicly listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we continue to encourage analysts and investors to model, analyze and report on eLong separately and to value our eLong position on a stand-alone basis.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

It was a little bit better than our expectations. But as a reminder, Q1 is a super small quarter. We don't manage the business by quarter, and so from quarter-to-quarter, we can have the shift of some ad spend. And certainly, that happened in the first quarter. With respect to factors that'll drive core EBITDA, excluding eLong on a go-forward basis, really, the big driver there is strength in the core OTA business. This business lives or dies by the strength of Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, EAN, and really, that's the big driver. I mean, we will get some help from Travelocity and Wotif, but as Dara mentioned in his remarks, we don't expect Wotif, for example, to be a big driver or a driver really until the back half of the year. And with our plans for ramping up sales and marketing to build momentum at Travelocity, in addition to the momentum they've already got, we do expect again that benefit to largely come in the back half of the year as well."

But we did see those margins level out quite nicely, and really, that's just the model and the target P&L working, control on fixed costs and really driving as much marketing contribution as we can through that part of the business. I would just caution everyone again that a quarter does not a business make. It's a highly seasonal business, and I think, particularly in Q1, it's hard to draw any conclusions. In terms of trivago, we did have a nice profit in Q1. A few things driving that. One is the business continues to perform very well, both in its core European markets but also in the U.S. And the performance, at least on the revenue line, did exceed the expectations a bit in the first quarter. And there's also, with trivago, as you could imagine given the amount of -- particularly television advertising spend that they do, they can also be heavily influenced from quarter-to-quarter by the timing of spend. And there was a bit of timing-related goodness, if you will, in the first quarter as well."

So there is still some work ahead of us, although that work is also very much on a good track. As far as Travelocity goes, the Travelocity migration in general is by no means simple, but it is simpler in that the site has already been migrated. Now what we're doing is really wiring up the marketing systems data, et cetera, so that the Travelocity team can work with the same analytical and marketing tool sets that we have available to our other brands. That work is moving on nicely and should be largely complete within the month. As far as Orbitz goes, no real update one way or the other. Obviously, we're in the middle of the DOJ process, so the amount of information we have and plans, et cetera, are not fully fleshed out. I would also remind you that the Orbitz business is a considerably more complicated business. There are a lot of different business lines, Orbitz for Business, et cetera, so it's a more complex business. And we think that some of the capabilities that the Orbitz business and team have are pretty impressive. And so I think that it's going to be really taking the best of breed and combining some of what they do really well with some of what we do really well. So I think that one will probably be a longer process, and it deserves to be a longer process. But first, we have to get there with the DOJ."

As far as the transactional impacts go, we are definitely seeing a very nice acceleration of U.S. volumes to international markets. That is those numbers were quite positive and continue to accelerate, so Q1 was a very strong quarter for Americans taking advantage of the strong dollar and exploring the world so to speak. And as far as international mix goes, we absolutely do see a higher mix of Europeans taking vacations in Europe. Our beach market package business, for example, is up quite significantly, and we're seeing the same thing with our Asian consumers. In general, we are seeing a mix shift to more local hotels, lower-star hotels, which are typically kind of more domestic-type travelers. Length of stay comes down a little bit. But in general, those trends are, I'd say, positive for us because we are starting to penetrate into domestic and regional travel market, where I would say we are relatively underpenetrated.  The biggest negative factor that we see obviously with international bookings is a translation effect. And that's just the negative on revenue, and it's a negative on earnings. And it's something that so far we've been able to overcome, but it will be a challenge for us."

We are seeing -- we have moved over the Hotwire air path onto the Brand Expedia platform, and we are testing out the Brand Expedia retail hotel platform on Hotwire. And we're seeing some early positive signs there, so that makes us hopeful. And we are launching a new ad campaign for Hotwire in Q2. It will be an EBITDA headwind, but we are quite positive about the ad campaign and expect it to introduce more consumers to the Hotwire brand, which we think fundamentally is still a good brand and a good product. So we're hopeful, but at this point, the business is still on a negative trend from a profitability basis, obviously, made up by some of our other brands. As far as mobile goes, I'd say no necessarily incremental insight one way or the other. It's -- the teams are executing. They continue to execute. Mobile app installs are on a nice trend for all of the brands. In general, mobile web for us now is growing at very significant levels, and we are expanding our mobile product as well. So for example, car rental product is now available on the Expedia mobile app. Hotwire continues to improve its car rental product on the app as well. So the app has turned into a really important channel for us, but it's more business than usual than anything. And of course, we are all excited about the Apple Watch, et cetera. We've got our presence there as far as apps go, and we'll be tracking that and hopefully, talking a bit more about that as we gather more data."

The loyalty programs, particularly the Hotels.com loyalty program, is a big factor and a growing factor in terms of the volume of business that they're getting from that program. That obviously shows up as a contra revenue line item, and you can kind of back into some rough numbers based on some of our disclosures in terms of impact on revenue per room night. And so that's a great piece of business. However, it's business that generally involves high-spending, loyal customers who come through more direct channels, and ultimately, when we look through to the bottom line, we would say we definitely want more of that business as opposed to less of that business. In terms of our hotel margins, listen, the -- there's certainly going to be an impact of lower hotel margins on room night growth. Of course, we have no idea what in fact that impact is. But as a reminder, we are lowering our hotel margins to essentially just be competitive with the local market conditions, and that encourages new hotels to sign up with us and our existing hotels to give us more attractive inventory because they view us as a more attractive channel to distribute through. And in return, that just gives our customers much better product essentially and opens up different marketing channels for us. So there's definitely a connection there. It's hard to draw it completely. With respect to 2Q sales and marketing spend, as I mentioned, there was some timing shift between Q1 and Q2, a little bit of trivago and a number of other brands as well. Travelocity is going to be a factor. Wotif may also be a factor in the quarter. And then, of course, you do definitely have to be ordinary issue of in a growing and particularly accelerating business you have a mismatch between sales and marketing spend and revenue, and it can create some mismatches in profit from quarter-to-quarter."

As far as property additions go, listen, this is part of the, I'd say, formula that we have been setting up. We knew that there will be an upfront cost to hiring the headcount, training the headcount and the field sales force, and to some extent, we bore those costs last year. And now you're seeing a combination of those marketing managers being trained up and effective. We have improved and invested in our technology so that we can onboard hotels faster when we sign them up and also, linking up that onboarding to our marketing channels, especially our variable marketing channels so that we can produce for the hotels that we signed up even more quickly after a sign-up. So the acceleration was expected, and this is something that we continue to expect to see for the balance of the year. And as you know, there are thousands and thousands more hotels that we can wire up on a global basis, so we think that this is just the beginning of a multi-year journey. As far as marketing ROIs go, I would say that there hasn't been significant shifts one way or the other as far as overall ROIs. We continue to, on variable channels, bid on the various channels based on expected revenue from those channels. Foreign exchange trends in U.S. dollars has, in general, taken down the amount that we can bid, let's say, for foreign demand because average revenue per transaction is coming down in U.S. dollar terms. But from an efficiency standpoint, we are just as aggressive as we have been in the past. I'd say that some of the channel shift that we had seen in the past over the 2, 3 years of the variable channels growing as a percentage of our direct channels, some of that channel shift is slowing down a bit. Our variable channels continue to grow quickly, but our brand channels, Mark made the comment on loyalty previously, the repeat part of our business is growing faster now than it was growing 2, 3 years ago. So the mix shift that we talked to you previously is probably easing up a bit. That's not necessarily good or bad news because we always want to be able to allocate as much marketing money as we can efficiently to the variable channels. But it certainly is good to see the direct channels growing faster than they have been historically, and hopefully, it'll keep going."

But we are a middle man that adds value or a middle person that adds value. These are -- the hotel business is incredibly fragmented. We are making global demand available to these hoteliers through our marketing channels. We think on the technology side, we can add very significant value as far as building great consumer experiences. And at this point, we are seeing our transactional growth and unit growth accelerating, so from my standpoint, we are a middle person who is getting more valuable and certainly not getting squeezed. Now that said, as we scale and as the Internet becomes more ubiquitous, we do have to drive our cost of operations down, and so you are seeing that in our revenue margins. It is something that is tough to execute. It is tough financially. But we've done it for a number of years, and the team understands the task at hand.

Conversion has -- continues to increase both for Hotels.com and Expedia, and that is a better website, in general more repeat customers and stronger supply, including the new hotels that we're adding on a local basis.

And then you rinse and repeat. And you use those profits to go out and acquire new customers. So it is all of those factors coming together to combine for a healthy room night. Q1 was certainly a number that we're happy with, and hopefully, we can keep our room night growth growing at healthy rates on a go-forward basis. As far as the hotel margins go, in general, we were at higher levels than our competition, especially in Europe and some of the Asia-Pacific markets, and we've moved our margins to be more competitive with some of the local players there. And as we've moved the margins to be more competitive, the hoteliers, the local hoteliers are talking to us, and obviously, they know our brand. They see the amount of demand that we're bringing into the country. They see the amount of foreign travelers that we can bring in, and as a result, the sales calls are more successful, a higher percentage of the time than they were. And we have more feet on the street. So it was, again, an investment that we have to make, kind of upfront investment. We have to make a bet that the volume will come, and so far, the bet is working out well. But we have a lot of execution to go forward to keep making it work."

I would say the primary driver is really the factors that Dara explained. It's core execution by our businesses that enable them to do better in variable channels. And I think if you look across a number of channels, trivago included, generally, our brands, the big brands are doing better and are able to take share in those channels. Another factor there is as we continue to build out our hotel base and we add more properties, one of the first places you could see that pickup is in meta-search channels we're able to drive traffic directly to those properties. I think the third factor is trivago has been expanding very aggressively into the U.S., and Dara mentioned in his prepared remarks the U.S. is their biggest market now by revenue. And that plays directly into our strength. We have great brands in the U.S. We've got great supply, and so it enables us to do very well in that channel. In terms of FX impact on international gross bookings, it's about 15 percentage points, and we're not going to break out organic versus inorganic at this point."

Expedia's off to a strong start this year, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver another year of solid results in a healthy travel environment. Aside from the worsening impact of FX translation on our results, our expectations for what we can deliver this year haven't changed. I'm particularly happy with our unit growth this quarter: global room nights up 32%, air tickets up 18% and car rental days up over 35%, all representing share gains in the overall travel market.
The major brands in our core OTA segment are executing well and delivering good results. Revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by organic growth of Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN as well as nice contributions from Travelocity and Wotif.
I'm also pleased that the pace of hotel acquisition has accelerated in 2015. Excluding eLong inventory, we added almost 14,000 hotels on the first quarter, which represents a pace of acquisition more than twice as fast as the fourth quarter of last year. We expect to continue to grow our marketing management team and significantly increase our rate of innovation and supplier technology to drive ongoing acceleration of hotel property additions. 
The migration of the Wotif site onto the Expedia platform is substantially complete, a process that has taken less than 6 months end-to-end. We had many an employee give up late nights with their friends and family to make this happen, and we're thankful to all of the contributing Expedia Inc. employees, especially our new colleagues on the Wotif team for their efforts.
Wotif is not yet a meaningful contributor to the bottom line due to negative FX trends, purchase accounting adjustments and elimination of certain consumer booking fees. However, we're pleased to have broadened Australian consumers' access to our global inventory. We're seeing early positive conversion trends as a result of our integration programs and expect the business to contribute more to profitability as we move through 2015 and into next year.
We've also welcomed the Travelocity marketing teams into our business and are making good progress on migrating tools and approaches. In the near term, we plan to ramp up selling and marketing spend to build momentum for this brand, which is likely to put some pressure on adjusted EBITDA contribution from Travelocity this year. We are seeing double-digit transaction growth year-over-year and are pleased to see the strength of the Travelocity brand in action.
Now I'm sure you're all interested in an update on the announced Orbitz transaction. The DOJ made a second request, and we're cooperating with them to make sure they have the information they need to enable them to complete their review by the end of the year. We believe the global travel market is huge and competition is fierce and that the transaction will benefit both competition and consumers. Beyond that, we don't have any additional information to share at this time.
trivago continued to see very strong growth, generating stand-alone revenue of $119 million in the first quarter and $449 million on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to aggressively invest profits from more developed markets to drive brand recognition and global expansion in newer markets. Of particular note, trivago continues to gain in size and strength in the U.S., which now represents their largest market in terms of revenue generated.
As a result of the increased investments that we made -- that we mentioned last quarter, eLong drove an acceleration on year-over-year room night growth in the first quarter compared to the growth rate in Q4 2014. Efforts in mobile and supply additions are bearing fruit with mobile growing triple digits overall and representing more than 65% of eLong brand room nights for the quarter. We're very supportive of the eLong management team, are pleased to see our investments start to bear fruit and remain confident that we can create real shareholder value through this asset.
Lastly, Egencia saw very good year-over-year unit growth this quarter, essentially consistent with the pace of growth in Q4 and with strength in both the U.S. and Europe. Our new product introductions, such as our iPad app, have been met by enthusiasm by our existing and potential clients. Egencia continues to win new clients at an impressive rate on the back of its industry-leading technology, and we remain confident in its ability to continue to make share gains in the large and attractively managed corporate travel segment.
Note that Egencia has a big European business and thus, is disproportionally impacted by FX headwinds. You can see that impact reflected in their reported gross bookings and revenue growth.
In closing, while we're pleased with our early momentum, the year is young, and as usual, we have plenty of challenges to navigate. We're clear about our strategy and are fully in execution mode.
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Overall themes for Q1 performance are very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Once again, we saw strong performance from our core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, offset by negative FX trends and ongoing headwinds on unit economics. As expected, the eLong team continued investing aggressively in China, which did put pressure on the consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Top line growth was again driven by solid unit growth across all major geographies.
Room night growth accelerated for all of our major brands relative to Q4 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 32% year-over-year. Domestic room nights grew 23% in Q1, while international room nights were up 41%. We did get a 4 percentage point tailwind to global room night growth from the inorganic impact of Wotif and the consolidation of the AirAsia joint venture. Note that we also comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial agreement during the first quarter, so Q2 will be our first clean comp for that business.
Revenue per room night was down 13.6% this quarter, while ADRs were down 2.5%. Roughly half of the decline in revenue per room night this quarter was driven by the negative impact of foreign currency. The other half included the impacts of the deliberate reductions in hotel margins to accelerate our global build-out of hotel room inventory and availability as well as efforts to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs and other incentives. These are very consistent with the factors we have discussed in the past.
Air revenue grew 9% on ticket growth of 18%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 7%. Ticket volume growth decelerated this quarter as we comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial deal in Q1 of last year. This headwind was partially offset by a 2 percentage point tailwind from consolidation of the AirAsia joint venture. On a normalized basis, air ticket growth, excluding Travelocity and AirAsia, accelerated nicely in the first quarter. Revenue per ticket was down as a result of foreign currency headwind, geographic mix and the renewal of certain airline deals in 2014.
Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group has become quite large and is growing fast. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated over $0.5 billion of net advertising and media revenue, up 35% year-over-year. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 23% net of intercompany amounts.
We also continued to see healthy contributions from our car and insurance products.
On the expense side, excluding eLong, we saw expense leverage across cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people cost and technology and content expense. Direct selling and marketing expense grew faster than revenue as expected.
As was the case for Q4, general and administrative expenses also grew faster than revenue due primarily to about $8 million of due diligence and other deals costs, without which, the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and leveraging nicely.
The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 25%, excluding eLong, and a decline of 5% year-over-year, including eLong. Note that adjusted earnings per share was negatively impacted this quarter by an unfavorable effective tax rate.
As we mentioned on the last call, due to eLong losses for which we are not recording a tax benefit, we are forecasting an elevated effective tax rate for the full year. Specifically, assuming eLong losses continue at this quarter's level or higher, we expect the tax rate to be in the mid-30% range for the full year. For illustrative purposes, had we applied that rate to this quarter's results, adjusted EPS would have improved by approximately $0.08 per share.
In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, as Dara mentioned, with the exception of foreign currency trends working against us, we're happy with our year-to-date performance and remain optimistic about the year. As such, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. Note that since the date of our Q4 call, we estimate that FX trends has worked against us by another approximately 200 basis points of full year adjusted EBITDA growth. And as such, we are a bit more cautious about where we will finish in this range.
With respect to the shape of the year, again, specifically for Expedia, excluding eLong, I would like to reiterate that we expect the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. As we move into the balance of the year, we are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity implementation, which are only partially offset by tailwinds from recent acquisitions. And our organic revenue growth rate remains subject to the unit economic pressures, which we have discussed. On the expense side, we continue to expect elevated technology and content expense growth as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack. In the second quarter, specifically, we'll have added pressure on adjusted EBITDA growth as we ramp selling and marketing expense to drive summer season revenue, a good portion of which will not be recognized until Q3 and beyond.
Now moving away for guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, to focus specifically on guidance for eLong stand-alone. ELong's adjusted EBITDA loss of $33 million in Q1 is indicative of the size and scale of the competitive efforts and investments required in that market. We expect the quarterly losses for eLong to be as large, if not, larger than the first quarter loss on a go-forward basis. eLong is a well-capitalized, publicly listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we continue to encourage analysts and investors to model, analyze and report on eLong separately and to value our eLong position on a stand-alone basis.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

With respect to factors that'll drive core EBITDA, excluding eLong on a go-forward basis, really, the big driver there is strength in the core OTA business. This business lives or dies by the strength of Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, EAN, and really, that's the big driver. I mean, we will get some help from Travelocity and Wotif, but as Dara mentioned in his remarks, we don't expect Wotif, for example, to be a big driver or a driver really until the back half of the year. And with our plans for ramping up sales and marketing to build momentum at Travelocity, in addition to the momentum they've already got, we do expect again that benefit to largely come in the back half of the year as well."

I would just caution everyone again that a quarter does not a business make. It's a highly seasonal business, and I think, particularly in Q1, it's hard to draw any conclusions. In terms of trivago, we did have a nice profit in Q1. A few things driving that. One is the business continues to perform very well, both in its core European markets, but also in the U.S. And the performance, at least on the revenue line, did exceed the expectations a bit in the first quarter. And there's also, with trivago, as you can imagine given the amount of -- particularly television advertising spend that they do, they can also be heavily influenced from quarter-to-quarter by the timing of spend. And there was a bit of timing-related goodness, if you will, in the first quarter as well."

As far as Travelocity goes, the Travelocity migration in general is by no means simple, but it is simpler in that the site has already been migrated. Now what we're doing is really wiring up the marketing systems data, et cetera, so that the Travelocity team can work with the same analytical and marketing tool sets that we have available to our other brands.

Obviously, we're in the middle of the DOJ process, so the amount of information we have and plans, et cetera, are not fully fleshed out. I would also remind you that the Orbitz business is a considerably more complicated business.

And so I think that it's going to be really taking the best of breed and combining some of what they do really well with some of what we do really well.

As far as the transactional impacts go, we are definitely seeing a very nice acceleration of U.S. volumes to international markets. That is those numbers were quite positive and continue to accelerate, so Q1 was a very strong quarter for Americans taking advantage of the strong dollar and exploring the world so to speak. And as far as international mix goes, we absolutely do see a higher mix of Europeans taking vacations in Europe. Our beach market package business, for example, is up quite significantly, and we're seeing the same thing with our Asian consumers. In general, we are seeing a mix shift to more local hotels, lower-star hotels, which are typically kind of more domestic-type travelers. Length of stay comes down a little bit. But in general, those trends are, I'd say, positive for us because we are starting to penetrate into domestic and regional travel market, where I would say we are relatively underpenetrated. The biggest negative factor that we see obviously with international bookings is a translation effect. And that's just the negative on revenue, and it's a negative on earnings. And it's something that so far we've been able to overcome, but it will be a challenge for us."

Traffic trends are, in general, looking better and more positive. Revenue per transaction is challenged, especially on the hotel side, where we have -- had to take out some margin dollars in order to give consumers the kind of discounts that they expect in a -- what's a strong market. We are seeing -- we have moved over the Hotwire air path onto the Brand Expedia platform, and we are testing out the Brand Expedia retail hotel platform on Hotwire. And we're seeing some early positive signs there, so that makes us hopeful. And we are launching a new ad campaign for Hotwire in Q2. It will be an EBITDA headwind, but we are quite positive about the ad campaign and expect it to introduce more consumers to the Hotwire brand, which we think fundamentally is still a good brand and a good product. So we're hopeful, but at this point, the business is still on a negative trend from a profitability basis, obviously, made up by some of our other brands. As far as mobile goes, I'd say no necessarily incremental insight one way or the other. It's -- the teams are executing. They continue to execute. Mobile app installs are on a nice trend for all of the brands. In general, mobile web for us now is growing at very significant levels, and we are expanding our mobile product as well. So for example, car rental product is now available on the Expedia mobile app. Hotwire continues to improve its car rental product on the app as well. So the app has turned into a really important channel for us, but it's more business than usual than anything. And of course, we are all excited about the Apple Watch, et cetera.

The loyalty programs, particularly the Hotels.com loyalty program, is a big factor and a growing factor in terms of the volume of business that they're getting from that program. That obviously shows up as a contra revenue line item, and you can kind of back into some rough, rough numbers based on some of our disclosures in terms of impact on revenue per room night. And so that's a great piece of business, however. It's business that generally involves high-spending, loyal customers who come through more direct channels, and ultimately, when we look through to the bottom line, we would say we definitely want more of that business as opposed to less of that business. In terms of our hotel margins, listen, the -- there's certainly going to be an impact of lower hotel margins on room night growth. Of course, we have no idea what in fact that impact is. But as a reminder, we are lowering our hotel margins to essentially just be competitive with the local market conditions, and that encourages new hotels to sign up with us and our existing hotels to give us more attractive inventory because they view us as a more attractive channel to distribute through. And in return, that just gives our customers much better product essentially and opens up different marketing channels for us. So there's definitely a connection there. It's hard to draw it completely. With respect to 2Q sales and marketing spend, as I mentioned, there was some timing shift between Q1 and Q2, a little bit of trivago and a number of other brands as well. Travelocity is going to be a factor. Wotif may also be a factor in the quarter. And then, of course, you do definitely have to be ordinary issue of in a growing and particularly accelerating business you have a mismatch between sales and marketing spend and revenue, and it can create some mismatches in profit from quarter-to-quarter."

As far as property additions go, listen, this is part of the, I'd say, formula that we have been setting up. We knew that there will be an upfront cost to hiring the headcount, training the headcount and the field sales force, and to some extent, we bore those costs last year. And now you're seeing a combination of those market managers being trained up and effective. We have improved and invested in our technology so that we can onboard hotels faster when we sign them up and also, linking up that onboarding to our marketing channels, especially our variable marketing channels so that we can produce for the hotels that we signed up even more quickly after a sign-up. So the acceleration was expected, and this is something that we continue to expect to see for the balance of the year. And as you know, there are thousands and thousands more hotels that we can wire up on a global basis, so we think that this is just the beginning of a multi-year journey. As far as marketing ROIs go, I would say that there hasn't been significant shifts one way or the other as far as overall ROIs. We continue to, on variable channels, bid on the various channels based on expected revenue from those channels. Foreign exchange trends in U.S. dollars has, in general, taken down the amount that we can bid, let's say, for foreign demand because average revenue per transaction is coming down in U.S. dollar terms. But from an efficiency standpoint, we are just as aggressive as we have been in the past. I'd say that some of the channel shift that we had seen in the past over the 2, 3 years of the variable channels growing as a percentage of our direct channels, some of that channel shift is slowing down a bit. Our variable channels continue to grow quickly, but our brand channels, Mark made the comment on loyalty previously, the repeat part of our business is growing faster now than it was growing 2, 3 years ago. So the mix shift that we talked to you previously is probably easing up a bit. That's not necessarily good or bad news because we always want to be able to allocate as much marketing money as we can efficiently to the variable channels. But it certainly is good to see the direct channels growing faster than they have been historically, and hopefully, it'll keep going."

We think on the technology side, we can add very significant value as far as building great consumer experiences. And at this point, we are seeing our transactional growth and unit growth accelerating, so from my standpoint, we are a middle person who is getting more valuable and certainly not getting squeezed. Now that said, as we scale and as the Internet becomes more ubiquitous, we do have to drive our cost of operations down, and so you are seeing that in our revenue margins.

As far as the room night growth and acceleration goes, the key here is that there's no magic bullet. It is the combination of a number of different activities going across the business and essentially everybody doing their jobs well. If you really want to simplify the core of room night growth, it's dependent on 3 factors: how much traffic are you bringing in; how are you converting that traffic; and really, what your repeat rate is. And our -- the traffic growth for the businesses is healthy and in general, has been either generally healthy and/or improving. Conversion has -- continues to increase both for Hotels.com and Expedia, and that is a better website, in general more repeat customers and stronger supply, including the new hotels that we're adding on a local basis. So conversion is positive. And then repeat rate, in general, is positive as well as a higher percentage of our bookings come from repeat customers. We're essentially going out, acquiring new customers, converting them to repeat customers through either their experience, which is a good experience or through loyalty programs. And then you rinse and repeat. And you use those profits to go out and acquire new customers. So it is all of those factors coming together to combine for a healthy room night. Q1 was certainly a number that we're happy with, and hopefully, we can keep our room night growth growing at healthy rates on a go-forward basis. As far as the hotel margins go, in general, we were at higher levels than our competition, especially in Europe and some of the Asia-Pacific markets, and we've moved our margins to be more competitive with some of the local players there. And as we've moved the margins to be more competitive, the hoteliers, the local hoteliers are talking to us, and obviously, they know our brands. They see the amount of demand that we're bringing into the country. They see the amount of foreign travelers that we can bring in, and as a result, the sales calls are more successful, a higher percentage of the time than they were. And we have more feet on the street. So it was, again, an investment that we had to make, kind of an upfront investment. We had to make a bet that the volume will come, and so far, the bet is working out well. But we have a lot of execution to go forward to keep making it work."

And I think if you look across a number of channels, trivago included, generally, our brands, the big brands are doing better and are able to take share in those channels. Another factor there is as we continue to build out our hotel base and we add more properties, one of the first places you could see that pickup is in meta-search channels. We're able to drive traffic directly to those properties. I think the third factor is trivago has been expanding very aggressively into the U.S. And Dara mentioned in his prepared remarks that the U.S. is their biggest market now by revenue. And that plays directly into our strength. We have great brands in the U.S. We've got great supply, and so it enables us to do very well in that channel.

Expedia's off to a strong start this year, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver another year of solid results in a healthy travel environment. Aside from the worsening impact of FX translation on our results, our expectations for what we can deliver this year haven't changed. I'm particularly happy with our unit growth this quarter: global room nights up 32%, air tickets up 18% and car rental days up over 35%, all representing share gains in the overall travel market.
The major brands in our core OTA segment are executing well and delivering good results. Revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by organic growth of Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN as well as nice contributions from Travelocity and Wotif.
I'm also pleased that the pace of hotel acquisition has accelerated in 2015. Excluding eLong inventory, we added almost 14,000 hotels on the first quarter, which represents a pace of acquisition more than twice as fast as the fourth quarter of last year. We expect to continue to grow our marketing management team and significantly increase our rate of innovation and supplier technology to drive ongoing acceleration of hotel property additions. 
The migration of the Wotif site onto the Expedia platform is substantially complete, a process that has taken less than 6 months end-to-end. We had many an employee give up late nights with their friends and family to make this happen, and we're thankful to all of the contributing Expedia Inc. employees, especially our new colleagues on the Wotif team for their efforts.
Wotif is not yet a meaningful contributor to the bottom line due to negative FX trends, purchase accounting adjustments and elimination of certain consumer booking fees. However, we're pleased to have broadened Australian consumers' access to our global inventory. We're seeing early positive conversion trends as a result of our integration programs and expect the business to contribute more to profitability as we move through 2015 and into next year.
We've also welcomed the Travelocity marketing teams into our business and are making good progress on migrating tools and approaches. In the near term, we plan to ramp up selling and marketing spend to build momentum for this brand, which is likely to put some pressure on adjusted EBITDA contribution from Travelocity this year. We are seeing double-digit transaction growth year-over-year and are pleased to see the strength of the Travelocity brand in action.
Now I'm sure you're all interested in an update on the announced Orbitz transaction. The DOJ made a second request, and we're cooperating with them to make sure they have the information they need to enable them to complete their review by the end of the year. We believe the global travel market is huge and competition is fierce and that the transaction will benefit both competition and consumers. Beyond that, we don't have any additional information to share at this time.
trivago continued to see very strong growth, generating stand-alone revenue of $119 million in the first quarter and $449 million on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to aggressively invest profits from more developed markets to drive brand recognition and global expansion in newer markets. Of particular note, trivago continues to gain in size and strength in the U.S., which now represents their largest market in terms of revenue generated.
As a result of the increased investments that we made -- that we mentioned last quarter, eLong drove an acceleration on year-over-year room night growth in the first quarter compared to the growth rate in Q4 2014. Efforts in mobile and supply additions are bearing fruit with mobile growing triple digits overall and representing more than 65% of eLong brand room nights for the quarter. We're very supportive of the eLong management team, are pleased to see our investments start to bear fruit and remain confident that we can create real shareholder value through this asset.
Lastly, Egencia saw very good year-over-year unit growth this quarter, essentially consistent with the pace of growth in Q4 and with strength in both the U.S. and Europe. Our new product introductions, such as our iPad app, have been met by enthusiasm by our existing and potential clients. Egencia continues to win new clients at an impressive rate on the back of its industry-leading technology, and we remain confident in its ability to continue to make share gains in the large and attractively managed corporate travel segment.
Note that Egencia has a big European business and thus, is disproportionally impacted by FX headwinds. You can see that impact reflected in their reported gross bookings and revenue growth.
In closing, while we're pleased with our early momentum, the year is young, and as usual, we have plenty of challenges to navigate. We're clear about our strategy and are fully in execution mode.
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Overall themes for Q1 performance are very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Once again, we saw strong performance from our core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, offset by negative FX trends and ongoing headwinds on unit economics. As expected, the eLong team continued investing aggressively in China, which did put pressure on the consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Top line growth was again driven by solid unit growth across all major geographies.
Room night growth accelerated for all of our major brands relative to Q4 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 32% year-over-year. Domestic room nights grew 23% in Q1, while international room nights were up 41%. We did get a 4 percentage point tailwind to global room night growth from the inorganic impact of Wotif and the consolidation of the AirAsia joint venture. Note that we also comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial agreement during the first quarter, so Q2 will be our first clean comp for that business.
Revenue per room night was down 13.6% this quarter, while ADRs were down 2.5%. Roughly half of the decline in revenue per room night this quarter was driven by the negative impact of foreign currency. The other half included the impacts of the deliberate reductions in hotel margins to accelerate our global build-out of hotel room inventory and availability as well as efforts to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs and other incentives. These are very consistent with the factors we have discussed in the past.
Air revenue grew 9% on ticket growth of 18%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 7%. Ticket volume growth decelerated this quarter as we comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial deal in Q1 of last year. This headwind was partially offset by a 2 percentage point tailwind from consolidation of the AirAsia joint venture. On a normalized basis, air ticket growth, excluding Travelocity and AirAsia, accelerated nicely in the first quarter. Revenue per ticket was down as a result of foreign currency headwind, geographic mix and the renewal of certain airline deals in 2014.
Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group has become quite large and is growing fast. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated over $0.5 billion of net advertising and media revenue, up 35% year-over-year. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 23% net of intercompany amounts.
We also continued to see healthy contributions from our car and insurance products.
On the expense side, excluding eLong, we saw expense leverage across cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people cost and technology and content expense. Direct selling and marketing expense grew faster than revenue as expected.
As was the case for Q4, general and administrative expenses also grew faster than revenue due primarily to about $8 million of due diligence and other deals costs, without which, the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and leveraging nicely.
The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 25%, excluding eLong, and a decline of 5% year-over-year, including eLong. Note that adjusted earnings per share was negatively impacted this quarter by an unfavorable effective tax rate.
As we mentioned on the last call, due to eLong losses for which we are not recording a tax benefit, we are forecasting an elevated effective tax rate for the full year. Specifically, assuming eLong losses continue at this quarter's level or higher, we expect the tax rate to be in the mid-30% range for the full year. For illustrative purposes, had we applied that rate to this quarter's results, adjusted EPS would have improved by approximately $0.08 per share.
In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, as Dara mentioned, with the exception of foreign currency trends working against us, we're happy with our year-to-date performance and remain optimistic about the year. As such, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. Note that since the date of our Q4 call, we estimate that FX trends has worked against us by another approximately 200 basis points of full year adjusted EBITDA growth. And as such, we are a bit more cautious about where we will finish in this range.
With respect to the shape of the year, again, specifically for Expedia, excluding eLong, I would like to reiterate that we expect the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. As we move into the balance of the year, we are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity implementation, which are only partially offset by tailwinds from recent acquisitions. And our organic revenue growth rate remains subject to the unit economic pressures, which we have discussed. On the expense side, we continue to expect elevated technology and content expense growth as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack. In the second quarter, specifically, we'll have added pressure on adjusted EBITDA growth as we ramp selling and marketing expense to drive summer season revenue, a good portion of which will not be recognized until Q3 and beyond.
Now moving away for guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, to focus specifically on guidance for eLong stand-alone. ELong's adjusted EBITDA loss of $33 million in Q1 is indicative of the size and scale of the competitive efforts and investments required in that market. We expect the quarterly losses for eLong to be as large, if not, larger than the first quarter loss on a go-forward basis. eLong is a well-capitalized, publicly listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we continue to encourage analysts and investors to model, analyze and report on eLong separately and to value our eLong position on a stand-alone basis.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

With respect to factors that'll drive core EBITDA, excluding eLong on a go-forward basis, really, the big driver there is strength in the core OTA business. This business lives or dies by the strength of Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, EAN, and really, that's the big driver. I mean, we will get some help from Travelocity and Wotif, but as Dara mentioned in his remarks, we don't expect Wotif, for example, to be a big driver or a driver really until the back half of the year.

I would just caution everyone again that a quarter does not a business make. It's a highly seasonal business, and I think, particularly in Q1, it's hard to draw any conclusions. In terms of trivago, we did have a nice profit in Q1. A few things driving that. One is the business continues to perform very well, both in its core European markets, but also in the U.S. And the performance, at least on the revenue line, did exceed the expectations a bit in the first quarter. And there's also, with trivago, as you can imagine given the amount of -- particularly television advertising spend that they do, they can also be heavily influenced from quarter-to-quarter by the timing of spend. And there was a bit of timing-related goodness, if you will, in the first quarter as well."

As far as the transactional impacts go, we are definitely seeing a very nice acceleration of U.S. volumes to international markets.

And as far as international mix goes, we absolutely do see a higher mix of Europeans taking vacations in Europe. Our beach market package business, for example, is up quite significantly, and we're seeing the same thing with our Asian consumers. In general, we are seeing a mix shift to more local hotels, lower-star hotels, which are typically kind of more domestic-type travelers. Length of stay comes down a little bit. But in general, those trends are, I'd say, positive for us because we are starting to penetrate into domestic and regional travel market, where I would say we are relatively underpenetrated. The biggest negative factor that we see obviously with international bookings is a translation effect. And that's just the negative on revenue, and it's a negative on earnings. And it's something that so far we've been able to overcome, but it will be a challenge for us."

We are seeing -- we have moved over the Hotwire air path onto the Brand Expedia platform, and we are testing out the Brand Expedia retail hotel platform on Hotwire. And we're seeing some early positive signs there, so that makes us hopeful. And we are launching a new ad campaign for Hotwire in Q2. It will be an EBITDA headwind, but we are quite positive about the ad campaign and expect it to introduce more consumers to the Hotwire brand, which we think fundamentally is still a good brand and a good product. So we're hopeful, but at this point, the business is still on a negative trend from a profitability basis, obviously, made up by some of our other brands. As far as mobile goes, I'd say no necessarily incremental insight one way or the other. It's -- the teams are executing. They continue to execute. Mobile app installs are on a nice trend for all of the brands. In general, mobile web for us now is growing at very significant levels, and we are expanding our mobile product as well.

The loyalty programs, particularly the Hotels.com loyalty program, is a big factor and a growing factor in terms of the volume of business that they're getting from that program. That obviously shows up as a contra revenue line item, and you can kind of back into some rough, rough numbers based on some of our disclosures in terms of impact on revenue per room night. And so that's a great piece of business, however. It's business that generally involves high-spending, loyal customers who come through more direct channels, and ultimately, when we look through to the bottom line, we would say we definitely want more of that business as opposed to less of that business. In terms of our hotel margins, listen, the -- there's certainly going to be an impact of lower hotel margins on room night growth. Of course, we have no idea what in fact that impact is. But as a reminder, we are lowering our hotel margins to essentially just be competitive with the local market conditions, and that encourages new hotels to sign up with us and our existing hotels to give us more attractive inventory because they view us as a more attractive channel to distribute through. And in return, that just gives our customers much better product essentially and opens up different marketing channels for us. So there's definitely a connection there. It's hard to draw it completely. With respect to 2Q sales and marketing spend, as I mentioned, there was some timing shift between Q1 and Q2, a little bit of trivago and a number of other brands as well. Travelocity is going to be a factor. Wotif may also be a factor in the quarter. And then, of course, you do definitely have to be ordinary issue of in a growing and particularly accelerating business you have a mismatch between sales and marketing spend and revenue, and it can create some mismatches in profit from quarter-to-quarter."

As far as property additions go, listen, this is part of the, I'd say, formula that we have been setting up. We knew that there will be an upfront cost to hiring the headcount, training the headcount and the field sales force, and to some extent, we bore those costs last year. And now you're seeing a combination of those market managers being trained up and effective. We have improved and invested in our technology so that we can onboard hotels faster when we sign them up and also, linking up that onboarding to our marketing channels, especially our variable marketing channels so that we can produce for the hotels that we signed up even more quickly after a sign-up. So the acceleration was expected, and this is something that we continue to expect to see for the balance of the year. And as you know, there are thousands and thousands more hotels that we can wire up on a global basis, so we think that this is just the beginning of a multi-year journey. As far as marketing ROIs go, I would say that there hasn't been significant shifts one way or the other as far as overall ROIs. We continue to, on variable channels, bid on the various channels based on expected revenue from those channels. Foreign exchange trends in U.S. dollars has, in general, taken down the amount that we can bid, let's say, for foreign demand because average revenue per transaction is coming down in U.S. dollar terms. But from an efficiency standpoint, we are just as aggressive as we have been in the past. I'd say that some of the channel shift that we had seen in the past over the 2, 3 years of the variable channels growing as a percentage of our direct channels, some of that channel shift is slowing down a bit. Our variable channels continue to grow quickly, but our brand channels, Mark made the comment on loyalty previously, the repeat part of our business is growing faster now than it was growing 2, 3 years ago. So the mix shift that we talked to you previously is probably easing up a bit. That's not necessarily good or bad news because we always want to be able to allocate as much marketing money as we can efficiently to the variable channels. But it certainly is good to see the direct channels growing faster than they have been historically, and hopefully, it'll keep going."

So the strategy for us is set, we will always be opportunistic from an acquisition standpoint. We definitely want to get bigger in the corporate travel segment, and we're doing so organically with Egencia. But we will continue to look for acquisitions in that segment. We think it's a terrific segment, and we have a great team and a great technology. But in general, we are very happy with our portfolio, and Mark and his corp dev team will continue to sniff out opportunity and strike when they see one."

Listen, you always fear, to some extent, when you have entities like Amazon and Google somewhat involved in the business that you're in. You'd be stupid not to worry about it. That said, Google has been in the travel business for a long time, and they have been a partner of ours for a long time. They certainly have market power, and the European entities are talking to them about that market power. And that's something that should be addressed. But we are a middle man that adds value or a middle person that adds value. These are -- the hotel business is incredibly fragmented. We are making global demand available to these hoteliers through our marketing channels. We think on the technology side, we can add very significant value as far as building great consumer experiences. And at this point, we are seeing our transactional growth and unit growth accelerating, so from my standpoint, we are a middle person who is getting more valuable and certainly not getting squeezed. Now that said, as we scale and as the Internet becomes more ubiquitous, we do have to drive our cost of operations down, and so you are seeing that in our revenue margins. It is something that is tough to execute. It is tough financially. But we've done it for a number of years, and the team understands the task at hand. And the lower we drive those margins, the harder we make it for third parties to get into our business. Fat pigs get slaughtered. And I think that we're in pretty darn good shape, and we're going to get in better shape on a go-forward basis."

As far as the room night growth and acceleration goes, the key here is that there's no magic bullet. It is the combination of a number of different activities going across the business and essentially everybody doing their jobs well. If you really want to simplify the core of room night growth, it's dependent on 3 factors: how much traffic are you bringing in; how are you converting that traffic; and really, what your repeat rate is. And our -- the traffic growth for the businesses is healthy and in general, has been either generally healthy and/or improving. Conversion has -- continues to increase both for Hotels.com and Expedia, and that is a better website, in general more repeat customers and stronger supply, including the new hotels that we're adding on a local basis. So conversion is positive. And then repeat rate, in general, is positive as well as a higher percentage of our bookings come from repeat customers. We're essentially going out, acquiring new customers, converting them to repeat customers through either their experience, which is a good experience or through loyalty programs. And then you rinse and repeat. And you use those profits to go out and acquire new customers. So it is all of those factors coming together to combine for a healthy room night. Q1 was certainly a number that we're happy with, and hopefully, we can keep our room night growth growing at healthy rates on a go-forward basis. As far as the hotel margins go, in general, we were at higher levels than our competition, especially in Europe and some of the Asia-Pacific markets, and we've moved our margins to be more competitive with some of the local players there. And as we've moved the margins to be more competitive, the hoteliers, the local hoteliers are talking to us, and obviously, they know our brands. They see the amount of demand that we're bringing into the country. They see the amount of foreign travelers that we can bring in, and as a result, the sales calls are more successful, a higher percentage of the time than they were. And we have more feet on the street. So it was, again, an investment that we had to make, kind of an upfront investment. We had to make a bet that the volume will come, and so far, the bet is working out well. But we have a lot of execution to go forward to keep making it work."

And I think if you look across a number of channels, trivago included, generally, our brands, the big brands are doing better and are able to take share in those channels. Another factor there is as we continue to build out our hotel base and we add more properties, one of the first places you could see that pickup is in meta-search channels. We're able to drive traffic directly to those properties. I think the third factor is trivago has been expanding very aggressively into the U.S. And Dara mentioned in his prepared remarks that the U.S. is their biggest market now by revenue. And that plays directly into our strength. We have great brands in the U.S. We've got great supply, and so it enables us to do very well in that channel.

We were pleased with revenue growth of 15",766,"Thanks, Alan. Second quarter was another solid quarter for Expedia. We once again saw healthy unit trends across products with global room nights up 35%, air tickets up 26% and car rental days up 35% year-on-year. We were pleased with revenue growth of 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% for the quarter.
Our core OTA segment continued to perform well, led by strong top line growth for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, our 2 biggest businesses. We also saw healthy revenue growth from Travelocity and Ian, along with an in organic tailwind from Wotif and AirAsia Expedia joint venture, which we now consolidate as a result of increasing our ownership stake to 75%. Of particular note, we continue to see very good growth rates for Travelocity even as we anniversary the ramp up of that business last year.
We're also optimistic about Wotif's potential to grow organically over time despite near-term FX headwinds now that's it's fully integrated into the Expedia platform and with the team starting to iterate on the site and on marketing channels.
As with the case last year, we continue to see strong progress in new hotel property acquisition around the world with approximately 27,000 additional properties this quarter, including some recently integrated Wotif properties. This is a significant milestone as we now have added more properties in the first half of 2015 than we did in all of 2014. We've got a very long runway here, and we expect to spend the next several years building out our global lodging inventory.
From a technology perspective, we recently completed a move -- a project to move Venere onto the Hotels.com platform. This is similar to our efforts in the last few years to extend the brand Expedia platform to brands such as Travelocity and Wotif. We now have a global full-service OTA platform in Brand Expedia and a global merchant agency standalone hotel platform in Hotels.com, each capable of powering additional brands.
Based our experience thus far, we believe that these 2 platforms represent unique competitive assets, which can be leveraged to draw further top and bottom line growth going forward. We continue to invest heavily in our technology capabilities to round out our service offerings, adding car rentals and activities to the Brand Expedia mobile app, adding the crews product onto the new platform for Travelocity and innovating a supply facing technology such as real-time reviews, which allow our retail partners to receive feedback from travelers live during their stay to improve the overall guest experience.
Regarding the announced Orbitz transaction, we don't have any significant additional news to share today. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ, providing information in answering questions. We continue to believe that the transaction should be approved and then closed in the back half of the year.
trivago continue to see very strong growth, generating stand-alone revenue of $143 million in the second quarter and $427 [ph] million on a trailing 12-month basis. trivago generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of about $9 million in Q2, pretty consistent with the second quarter of last year, as we continue to invest aggressively in selling and marketing and as we move into the busy part of travel shopping cycle. We expect to continue to invest profits from higher margin markets since the developing markets in order to grow trivago globally.
A note on China. Although we did sell our ownership stake in eLong in the second quarter, I want to be clear that we're still participating in the huge long-term growth opportunity that China represents. We have ongoing commercial agreements, which gives us access to the outbound Chinese travelers of C trip and eLong and expect both of bear fruit over the near and long-term. 
Hotels.com and ENI are growing fast in China, although also the small base. And Brand Expedia has a presence in Hong Kong with more to come in the region. We expect to continue to invest to build our long-term prospects in China. And although our exposure to the domestic Chinese travel market is reduced for the near term, we were pleased to be able to drive substantial value creation for our shareholders through the eLong transaction.
In closing, I'd like to thank our teams around the world for all of their efforts and in doing so, celebrate for a moment a very good first half of the year. We must remain focused on driving strong execution and great innovation. There's still a lot of work ahead of us and competition remains as fierce as ever.
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Financial results for eLong are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date to aid in comparability and the focus on the parts of the business that will be ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia, Inc. results excluding eLong. The overall trajectory of the business remains very strong, as has been the case for some time now, with the second quarter results broadly consistent with Q1 trends and a bit better than we had expected. Strength across our breadth of leading brands and across geographies continues with rare exception. Our core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, are all having solid years with strong execution and the financial results.
Top line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remained strong for all of our major brands relative to Q1 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 35% year-over-year, an acceleration from 32% growth last quarter. Domestic room nights grew 24% in Q2, while international room nights were up 50%.
The inorganic impact from Wotif and the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture added approximately 7 percentage points to global room night growth this quarter. For comparison, last quarter, excludingeLong, inorganic impacts drove over 5 percentage growth of room night growth. Revenue per room night was down just under 16% this quarter, while ADRs were down almost 6%. The factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for quite a while now. Foreign currency accounted for a little less than half of the decline in revenue per room night, while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest.
We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and scale. Air revenue grew 14% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 10%. We saw a significant acceleration in air ticket growth from Brand Expedia this quarter on the back of the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture, along with continued strong performance of the team in rates on the platform.
Excluding inorganic impacts, ticket growth would have been 20%, a nice acceleration from Q1. Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, continued growing nicely with trivago growing stand-alone revenue 37% and net revenue after intercompany eliminations, 25%. On a standalone FX neutral basis, we estimate that trivago revenues were up 67% year-over-year.
On the expense side, we saw significant leverage in cost of revenue and technology and content expenses. Note that technology and content expense growth was lower than we expected, largely due to lower than forecast headcount, higher capitalization rates, and to a lesser extent, the timing of some R&D tax credits. Going forward, we are expecting more elevated year-over-year growth in tech and content expense.
General and administrative expenses grew faster than revenue, primarily due to about 6 percentage points of growth from increased M&A-related costs and an additional 7 percentage points from the intergenic impact of recent acquisitions. Absent these impacts, G&A would have grown about 11% and leverage nicely.
Direct selling and marketing grew faster than revenue, as we continue to invest aggressively to drive global growth and ramp spend ahead of the busy travel season. Indirect selling and marketing costs were slightly faster than revenues as we continue to scale of our lodging and supply team. The net result was adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% for the second quarter.
From a cash and capital deployment perspective, we issued a 650 million Euro bond at a coupon of 2.5% in the second quarter with an eye towards financing a portion of the pending Orbitz transaction. We are also happy to announce a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend payable in the third quarter to $0.24 per share. Our approach to capital deployment remains the same, and we will continue to balance the allocation of our cash flow between opportunistic M&A and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. The Q2 came in a bit better-than-expected, we plan to put that upside back into the business mostly in Q3 to drive continued growth. 
And as a reminder, our guidance this quarter comes with the same caveats as last quarter. We remain cautious about where we'll fall in our guidance range due primarily to significant remaining foreign currency headwinds, which have gotten slightly worse since our Q1 call.
Please note that other than some heightened legal and professional fees we are currently carrying, our financial expect patients do not take into account material impact of the potential Orbitz transaction. In addition to integration costs, consolidation of Orbitz results could result in a negative near-term impact on our consolidated financial results due to the impact of purchase accounting rules, which disallow the recognition of deferred revenue, which is on the books of the acquired company prior to closing.
Finally, I will also note that primarily as a result of selling our stake in eLong, we were able to lower our expectations for our full year effective tax rate to a more normalized mid-20% range.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to line up for questions?"

If you don't have a great website that has -- that's",612,"Sure, Justin. As far as of the room night acceleration, I'd say it's a game of interest and a lot of interest coming together. It certainly starts with the websites and the website's ability to convert. If you don't have a great website that has -- that's very easy to use, easy to understand, you're nowhere in this business. So it does start with that. But we have our marketing teams always looking for new demand vanes that we can reach and our affordable basis. And it's really the website and those marketing teams working together that have been able to get us to a state of accelerated room nights growth for some period of time. And we have no reason to think that that's going to change. 
I think the other 2 factors that you would add to it that are a bit more recent are obviously, the addition of new hotels supply. 27,000 hotels. As we are going down the line in bringing in new hotels, on average, they tend to be smaller hotels, so the contribution per hotel is something that we would expect to come down over a period of time. But obviously, the number of hotels that we are adding has increased. There are some cannibalization in larger markets. But we think that new hotels are certainly a nice positive for us. And the last factor that I discussed is that we are seeing an increased percentage of our business in general coming from repeat customers. We've been investing very aggressively in our loyalty programs and our customer service to keep customers coming back. It is of those repeat customers that account for the majority of the profit of the company. And that repeat customer base has been growing as we've been investing in those customers as we've been growing our loyalty programs and increasing the benefits there. So every part of what I described plays a part in the growth. It's about the site. It's about marketing. It's about supply, and it's about repeat. And when you get it all right, you get a pretty good formula. For the time being, we have it right, and we have to very much stand on our toes to competitive in this marketplace because there are a lot of players competing for that customer attention. As far as TripAdvisor and Google building out booking capability, et cetera, listen, this is nothing new. It's something that has gone up for some time, as you know, as far as TripAdvisor goes. We do participate in the TripAdvisor marketplace as an advertiser. We are not participating in trip instant book. So from a theoretical standpoint, we are getting a smaller addressable market in the TripAdvisor marketplace. And my guess is a lot of that market is going to the hotels direct. That's not new. And that's a headwind that we've been facing, but it's a headwind that we navigated pretty well. And we're hoping to navigate on a go-forward basis. And in general, our business with TripAdvisor is growing. We do see Google make some moves in the area. And I'd say one difference that we see with the Google treatment of the bookings is that the Google treatment tends to be much more clear that the booking is actually with the OTA and Google is not the merchant, et cetera. It's really making the payment, process easier rather than trying to order the customer one way or the other. So we do anticipate testing out the Google and testing out some of the other treatments and seeing how it affects our customers and our customer satisfaction and our economics in general."

We are continuing to see similar trends what we mentioned last quarter, which is we're seeing an increased mix of European travel staying in Europe and the addition of an increased propensity of Americans traveling to Europe and across the board, I think, with a few obvious exceptions in Southern Europe, we're seeing a lot of help in the European market."

As far as the -- just as the sheer scale of the size of that market as an outbound market, it's one of the top markets for us and I think for any travel provider out there. I think that the Chinese customer is quite different and what you're looking for in their behavior in their device mix. So I think that it is a market that, in general, has been difficult to reach for Western companies. That doesn't make it impossible, but it has been difficult to reach for Western companies. And as a result, we see our exposure going forward being partially organic through the building up of some of the brands that we have there. And then through partnership, partnership with eLong and C-trip and certain aspects of the business. And in our EAN business going out and offering our global inventory, both on a stand-alone basis and on a package basis. And you can imagine that the Chinese outbound business is quite package related. And our ability to offer package inventory on a global basis with the kind of scope that we have has proven to be quite interesting to local Chinese travel providers. And we see the partnership opportunities there already pretty strong. And we think we've got a lot of runway ahead of us. So this is not a 1-year thing. It's a multiyear thing. And we won't be competing as much as we had on the past for the local Chinese customer, but we are very much involved in both the Chinese outbound business and inbound business going into China as well. I think on vacation rentals, listen, I think we're -- we continue to test and learn. We have a partnership with Home Away. We're expanding that partnership into Europe and we're testing and learning in certain European markets, and we're very excited to do that because the vacation rental market tends to be quite strong in the European market. So we absolutely want to be there, and we're happy to be there with the Home Away team. I don't think that we've hit kind of on a magic bullet at this point. So we don't see the additional inventory at this point materially increasing our revenue per shopper, but we think the customer experience, at this point isn't what it needs to be, and we think we can materially improve the customer experience. And we're hoping that will add to our customer satisfaction and also help our revenue per shopper. And we're working with Home Away on that front, and we'll look to bring additional inventory as well."

So I'd say the direct sign-ups have been the majority of the increase in supply growth. We had a bit of a nice bump from Wotif. Thank you for that team for bringing those hotels on board. And then we are also setting up hotels through some third parties, but that is the significant minority of the sign-ups that you saw.

So if you look at air product now, we have more content on the quality of the flight through a partnership with route happy. And we are adding features, such as brand affairs, so that while we will show you the lowest price, you can get some more flexibility. You might be able to get -- be able to choose your seat, et cetera, and essentially sell in ancillary type revenue, which is very, very important revenue.

And right now, I'd say the relationships with the majority of our air partners are most definitely on the upswing."

As far as cross-sell goes, we're very happy with our production in the cross-sell area. We measure the percentage of Expedia bookers who buy more than one item for us, bundle one item for us, and that number has been consistently increasing over a period of time. And a lot of couple of things. One is it often allows us to deliver a discount to the consumer by buying multiple products in one purchase. It's like your cable bundle. You buy your Internet and your phone service and your TV service together, you get a discount. We are offering the Internet bundle for online travel and consumers are increasingly taking advantage of it and they're taking advantage of the discounts there. From a supply partner basis, it also helps in that these transactions tend to be longer dated transactions so that the supplier can kind of fill up their window, their inventory on a lawn data basis and they care them lower cancellation rates because the consumer who's booking multiple things, multiple items, typically is a more committed consumer as well. So it's proven to be a great value proposition for our consumers. It's a differentiator versus the other standalone players out there and it's a nice differentiator for our hotel and air partners as well. It's been a nice win-win, and that business continues to track along well. I think a coming benefit in that area is going to be our increasingly merchandising mobile offerings to consumers while they're in the trip. So you can imagine that if you got -- we know that you've flown into New Orleans and you download the Expedia app, we can offer you activities in New Orleans if you got to the airport and don't have arrived, we can offer you a ride to your hotel. And we probably have a bunch of intelligence as to when you're getting to the airport, when you need -- or where you need to go in your hotel. That is a nascent business. But we think it can really delight our customers. And to the extent that we're selling more stuff to our customers, we can in acquiring those customers or we can invest more in keeping those customers through loyalty, through other benefits through, better service. So we're very excited about the opportunity. We think we're in the early to mid-innings. I won't say that we're the absolute early innings because the team is making traction and they're doing good work. As far as our loyalty programs, we continue to see very nice traction there. Hotels.com is going to -- the biggest in the family as far as loyalty goes. There are over 80 [ph] million now Hotels.com rewards members around the globe. I think that those -- of those 80 million members since of the program started, I think they stayed in 4.5 million hotel rooms for free. So you can have an idea of how much we are reinvesting in these loyal customers. And higher and higher percentage of our transaction mix and our revenue mix is coming from these loyalty members. The Expedia Loyalty program, the Expedia Plus, was mostly a U.S. program. It's now expanding globally. We're now in 18 points of sale. We're over 10 million members. And that business continues or that loyalty customer base continues to grow as well. This is another differentiator for us and its something that we're pretty excited about and something that we think we can expand and grow."

So we are very actively continuing to collect more reviews on our hotels. Our higher-rated hotels tend to do best in the Expedia marketplace. So I think there's a nice incentive for hoteliers to make sure that the Expedia or Hotels.com customer gets a good -- gets treated well because, not only do those hotels perform better in the marketplace, but then over 50 million, 60 million other consumers are reading those reviews as well. So it's very important to treat those customers well. The value that we bring with realtime reviews is that if you look at our reviews in the past, the value -- the customer value for those reviews was that they were all real reviews, right? You knew that our customers stayed at that hotel. They're 100% dependable. We've got some complaints from some hoteliers saying, ""Listen, I wish I knew about this customer's poor experience. I wish I could do something about it review other than comment I'm sorry about your experience."" So now with realtime reviews, we're asking the customer when they're in the market, how their experience was. We are then sending the comments from those consumers, either good or bad, we will highlight the bad because you can do something about it, to our hotel partners through our Expedia partner tool, which, by the way, is going mobile as well. So that if someone didn't like their room, if someone didn't like their view, if someone didn't have towels in their room, the hotelier can do something on the real-time basis. And you can imagine that being just a delightful experience if the hotelier does something about it without a complaint coming directly. So we think it's a great tool for hoteliers. And we think it can be a terrific experience for our customers as well. It's early innings, but we're pretty excited about."

So when we talk about shifting marketing spend, that's for plan spend. That tends to be off-line. And then things can change pretty darn materially when we're in quarter. And I think our teams have handled it well and they operate within kind of their efficiency formula, so to speak. But marketing spend is not something that we necessarily want to keep predictable one way or the other. We're will be about the core economics and we're not about the quarter."

I think it goes to what Mark was talking about as far as the Wotif integration. The first benefit that we got from the Travelocity integration was higher conversion because Travelocity was able to piggyback off of a substantial investments that we made on the Brand Expedia platform. There's a second benefit that I got, which is cost efficiency. We didn't have to carry a bunch of secondary cost building out features that had already been built up probably in a better way. So those do come pretty quickly. And then debt teams to start optimizing on the marketing side in various marketing channels. And at that point, they've got to burn in a bunch of algorithms and a bunch of decisions that have to be made. One, based on the conversion of that site in various channels. And two, based on the lifetime value of its customer base. And those factors, while conversion has improved, the conversion of a Travelocity customer, let's say, in the trivago marketplace and the lifetime value there is going to be different than Expedia, is going to be different from Hotels.com. So you start moving through a period of optimization in these marketing channels and I would say, it takes a good 6 months, if not more, for you to start getting these marketing channels to work in the way that they should. And then if you have a good site, if you got marketing, of you've got a great brand, which what you see with Travelocity, you tend to have an entity that can grow. And that's what we're seeing with Travelocity. The thing that I would add is that we don't take 100% of those savings to the bottom line. We take some of the savings on overhead and we reapply them into the brand. So if you look at the Travelocity brand spend this year versus last year, it will be up. We think that's a good thing. And we think the combination of better conversion, better variable marketing, higher brand spend, that's a formula that you need to grow a business. And our intention with Travelocity is to grow the business. It's been a year, and we hope we can do it for multiple years."

The following discussion, including responses to questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 30, 2015, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on the call today are forward looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck.
Please note that we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our results on a like-for-like basis with our a historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Dara."

We were pleased with the revenue growth o",762,"Thanks, Alan. Second quarter was another solid quarter for Expedia. We once again saw healthy unit trends across products with global room nights up 35%, air tickets up 26% and car rental days up 35% year-on-year. We were pleased with the revenue growth of 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% for the quarter.
Our core OTA segment continued to perform well, led by strong top line growth for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, our 2 biggest businesses. We also saw healthy revenue growth from Travelocity and EAN, along with an inorganic tailwind from Wotif and AirAsia Expedia joint venture, which we now consolidate as a result of increasing our ownership stake to 75%.
Of particular note, we continue to see very good growth rates for Travelocity even as we anniversary the ramp-up of that business last year. We're also optimistic about Wotif's potential to grow organically over time despite near-term FX headwinds now that it's fully integrated into the Expedia platform and with the team starting to iterate on the site and on marketing channels.
As was the case last year, we continue to see strong progress in new hotel property acquisition around the world with approximately 27,000 additional properties this quarter, including some recently integrated Wotif properties. This is a significant milestone as we now have added more properties in the first half of 2015 than we did in all of 2014. We've got very long runway here, and we expect to spend the next several years building out our global lodging inventory.
From a technology perspective, we recently completed a move -- a project to move Venere onto the Hotels.com platform. This is similar to our efforts in the last few years to extend the Brand Expedia platform to brands such as Travelocity and Wotif. We now have a global full-service OTA platform in Brand Expedia and a global merchant agency stand-alone hotel platform in Hotels.com, each capable of powering additional brands.
Based our experience, thus far, we believe that these 2 platforms represent unique competitive assets, which can be leveraged to draw further top and bottom line growth going forward. We continue to invest heavily in our technology capabilities to round out our service offerings, adding car rentals and activities to the Brand Expedia mobile app, adding the cruise product onto the new platform for Travelocity and innovating a supply-facing technology such as real-time reviews, which allow our hotel partners to receive feedback from travelers live during their stay to improve the overall guest experience.
Regarding the announced Orbitz transaction, we don't have any significant additional news to share today. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ, providing information and answering questions. We continue to believe that the transaction should be approved and then closed in the back half of the year.
trivago continued to see very strong growth, generating stand-alone revenue of $143 million in the second quarter and $487 million on the trailing 12-month basis. trivago generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of about $9 million in Q2, pretty consistent with the second quarter of last year, as we continue to invest aggressively in selling and marketing and as we moved into the busy part of travel shopping cycle. We expect to continue to invest profits from higher margin markets into developing markets in order to grow trivago globally.
A note on China. Although we did sell our ownership stake in eLong in the second quarter, I want to be clear that we're still participating in the huge long-term growth opportunity that China represents. We have ongoing commercial agreements, which give us access to the outbound Chinese travelers of Ctrip and eLong and expect both to bear fruit over the near and long term.
Hotels.com and EAN are growing fast in China although off of a small base, and Brand Expedia has a presence in Hong Kong with more to come in the region. We expect to continue to invest to build our long-term prospects in China, and although our exposure to the domestic Chinese travel market is reduced for the near term, we were pleased to be able to drive substantial value creation for our shareholders through the eLong transaction.
In closing, I'd like to thank our teams around the world for all of their efforts and in doing so, celebrate for a moment a very good first half of the year. We must remain focused on driving strong execution and great innovation. There's still a lot of work ahead of us, and competition remains as fierce as ever.
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."
25915843,295096688,843598,"Expedia Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. One quick note before I get started.

Financial results for eLong are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and the focus on the parts of the business that will be ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia Inc. results excluding eLong.
The overall trajectory of the business remains very strong as has been the case for some time now with the second quarter results broadly consistent with Q1 trends and a bit better than we had expected. Strength across our breadth of leading brands and across geographies continues with rare exception. Our core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, are all having solid years with strong execution and the financial results.
Top line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remained strong for all of our major brands relative to Q1 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 35% year-over-year, an acceleration from 32% growth last quarter. Domestic room nights grew 24% in Q2, while international room nights were up 50%. The inorganic impact from Wotif and the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture added approximately 7 percentage points to global room night growth this quarter. For comparison, last quarter, excluding eLong, inorganic impacts drove over 5 percentage points of room night growth.
Revenue per room night was down just under 16% this quarter, while ADRs were down almost 6%. The factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for quite a while now. Foreign currency accounted for a little less than half of the decline in revenue per room night, while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest.
We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and scale. Air revenue grew 14% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 10%. We saw a significant acceleration in air ticket growth from Brand Expedia this quarter on the back of the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture, along with continued strong performance that the team innovates on the platform. Excluding inorganic impacts, ticket growth would have been 20%, a nice acceleration from Q1.
Our Advertising & Media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, continued growing nicely with trivago growing stand-alone revenue 37% and net revenue after intercompany eliminations, 25%. On a stand-alone FX neutral basis, we estimate that trivago revenues were up 67% year-over-year.
On the expense side, we saw significant leverage in cost of revenue and technology and content expenses. Note that technology and content expense growth was lower than we expected, largely due to lower-than-forecast headcount, higher capitalization rates and to a lesser extent, the timing of some R&D tax credits. Going forward, we are expecting more elevated year-over-year growth in tech and content expense.
General and administrative expenses grew faster than revenue, primarily due to about 6 percentage points of growth from increased M&A-related cost and an additional 7 percentage points from the inorganic impact of recent acquisitions. Absent these impacts, G&A would have grown about 11% and leveraged nicely.
Direct selling and marketing grew faster than revenue, as we continued to invest aggressively to drive global growth and ramp spend ahead of the busy travel season. Indirect selling and marketing costs were slightly faster than revenues, as we continue to scale up our lodging and supply team. The net result was adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% for the second quarter.
From a cash and capital deployment perspective, we issued a EUR 650 million bond at a coupon of 2.5% in the second quarter with an eye towards financing a portion of the pending Orbitz transaction. We are also happy to announce a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend payable in the third quarter to $0.24 per share. Our approach to capital deployment remains the same, and we will continue to balance the allocation of our cash flow between opportunistic M&A and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. Though Q2 came in a bit better than expected, we plan to put that upside back into the business mostly in Q3 to drive continued growth. And as a reminder, our guidance this quarter comes with the same caveats as last quarter. We remain cautious about where we'll fall in our guidance range due primarily to significant remaining foreign currency headwinds, which have gotten slightly worse since our Q1 call.
Please note that other than some heightened legal and professional fees we are currently carrying, our financial expectations do not take into account material impacts of the potential Orbitz transaction. In addition to integration costs, consolidation of Orbitz' results could result in a negative near-term impact on our consolidated financial results due to the impact of purchase accounting rules, which disallow the recognition of deferred revenue, which is on the books of the acquired company prior to closing.
Finally, I will also note that primarily as a result of selling our stake in eLong, we were able to lower our expectations for our full year effective tax rate to a more normalized mid-20% range.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to line up for questions?"

And then on the competitive side, a lot of noise out there about TripAdvisor and Google taking bookings. How do you view that? Can you participate? And do you see that as a potential headwind down the road?"
25915843,295096688,843598,"Expedia Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Justin. As far as of the room night acceleration, I'd say it's a game of interest and a lot of interest coming together. It certainly starts with the website and the website's ability to convert. If you don't have a great website that has -- that's",613,"Sure, Justin. As far as of the room night acceleration, I'd say it's a game of interest and a lot of interest coming together. It certainly starts with the website and the website's ability to convert. If you don't have a great website that has -- that's very easy to use, easy to understand, you're nowhere in this business. So it does start with that. But we have our marketing teams always looking for new demand veins that we can reach on an affordable basis. And it's really the website and those marketing teams working together that have been able to get us to a state of accelerated room nights growth for some period of time, and we have no reason to think that, that's going to change. I think the other 2 factors that you would add to it that are a bit more recent are obviously the addition of new hotel supply, 27,000 hotels. As we are going down the line in bringing in new hotels, on average, they tend to be smaller hotels. So the contribution per hotel is something that we would expect to come down over a period of time, but obviously, the number of hotels that we are adding has increased. There's some cannibalization in larger markets, but we think the new hotels are certainly a nice positive for us. And the last factor that I discussed is that we are seeing an increased percentage of our business in general coming from repeat customers. We've been investing very aggressively in our loyalty programs and our customer service to keep customers coming back. It is those repeat customers that account for the majority of the profit of the company. And that repeat customer base has been growing as we've been investing in those customers, as we've been growing our loyalty programs and increasing the benefits there. So every part of what I described plays a part in the growth. It's about the site. It's about marketing. It's about supply, and it's about repeat. And when you get it all right, you get a pretty good formula. For the time being, we have it right, and we have to very much stay on our toes to keep competitive in this marketplace because there are a lot of players competing for that customer attention. As far as TripAdvisor and Google building out booking capability, et cetera, listen, this is nothing new. It's something that has gone on for some time, as you know, as far as TripAdvisor goes. We do participate in the TripAdvisor marketplace as an advertiser. We are not participating in Trip Instant Book, so from a theoretical standpoint, we are getting a smaller addressable market in the TripAdvisor marketplace. And my guess is a lot of that market is going to the hotels direct. That's not new. And that's a headwind that we've been facing but is a headwind that we've navigated pretty well. And we're hoping to navigate on a go-forward basis. And in general, our business with TripAdvisor is growing. We do see Google make some moves in the area, and I'd say one difference that we see with the Google treatment on -- of the bookings is that the Google treatment tends to be much more clear that the booking is actually with the OTA and Google is not the merchant, et cetera. It's really making the payment process easier rather than trying to own the customer one way or the other. So we do anticipate testing out with Google and testing out some of the other treatments and seeing how it affects our customers and our customer satisfaction and our economics in general."

Certainly, the foreign exchange impact makes those look worse on a translated basis, but again, in local currency, we continue to see a healthy environment. CPC is up. ADR is up. Occupancies look strong. And really, that rolls into the travel conditions in Europe. We are continuing to see similar trends to what we mentioned last quarter, which is we're seeing an increased mix of European travel stay-in in Europe and the addition of an increased propensity of Americans who travel into Europe. And across the board, I think with a few obvious exceptions in Southern Europe, we're seeing a lot of health in the European market."

As far as the -- just the sheer scale on the size of that market as an outbound market, it's one of the top markets for us and I think for any travel provider out there. I think that the Chinese customer is quite different in what they're looking for and their behavior in their device mix, so I think that it is a market that, in general, has been difficult to reach for western companies. That doesn't make it impossible, but it has been difficult to reach for western companies. And as a result, we see our exposure going forward being partially organic through the building up of some of the brands that we have there and then through partnership, partnership with eLong and Ctrip and certain aspects of the business and then our EAN business going out and offering our global inventory, both on a stand-alone basis and on a package basis. And you can imagine that the Chinese outbound business is quite package related, and our ability to offer package inventory on a global basis with the kind of scope that we have has proven to be quite interesting to local Chinese travel providers. And we see the partnership opportunities there already pretty strong, and we think we've got a lot of runway ahead of us. So this is not a 1-year thing. It's a multi-year thing. And we won't be competing as much as we had on the past for the local Chinese customer, but we are very much involved in both the Chinese outbound business and inbound business going into China as well. I think on vacation rentals, listen, I think we're -- we continue to test and learn. We have a partnership with Home Away. We're expanding that partnership into Europe, and we're testing and learning in certain European markets. And we're very excited to do that because the vacation rental market tends to be quite strong in the European market. So we absolutely want to be there, and we're happy to be there with the Home Away team. I don't think that we've hit kind of on magic bullet at this point. So we don't see the additional inventory at this point materially increasing our revenue per shopper, but we think the customer experience at this point isn't what it needs to be. And we think we can materially improve the customer experience, and we're hoping that will add to our customer satisfaction and also help our revenue per shopper. And we're working with Home Away on that front, and we'll look to bring in additional inventory as well."

As far as our take rates go, while every market is different, I would say the lowering of our take rates, in general, to both secure new inventory and secure better inventory for existing partners has been broad. So our take rates have come down in the U.S. They've come down in Europe. They've come down in Asia whether we're a new entrant or not. And we don't necessarily see that changing. We've adjusted our business model to be able to reduce cost to our marketing partners while able to drive good economics for our shareholders. And that's our job, and we feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on that. As far as long-term position, et cetera, it's very difficult to tell. The only thing that I know is that there's lots and lots of different distribution channels for supply partners on a global basis. And in order to continue to be competitive as a distribution partner, you have to be good and you got to be cheap. And I don't see that changing. And we're prepared for that world. We think we've been able to grow in that world, and we're comfortable with it. As far as the supply growth going, the majority of the supply growth came from kind of, call it, organic acquisition. We have been investing in our market manager for us pretty aggressively, and that investment has led us to be able to go out and sign up hotels on a direct basis. So I'd say the direct sign-ups have been the majority of the increase in supply growth. We had a bit of a nice bump from Wotif. Thank you for that team for bringing those hotels onboard. And then we are also signing up hotels through some third parties, but that is the significant minority of the sign-ups that you saw. At this point, we're hoping to accelerate it on a go-forward basis."

They tend to be vocal, but I don't think they're necessarily representative of the industry. We've got very strong long-term contracts with the vast majority of our air supply partners, and I'd say that those relationships are getting stronger, not the other way around. One of the pretty important initiatives for us is to move from really just being a commodity provider of air product as far as just showing, call it, the lowest price and schedule to becoming a value-added player in selling air. So if you look at our air product now we have more content on the quality of the flight through a partnership with Routehappy. And we are adding features such as branded fare so that while we will show you the lowest price, you can get some more flexibility. You might be able to get -- be able to choose your seat, et cetera, and essentially sell an ancillary-type revenue, which is very, very important revenue. If you follow the airline industry, the airlines have done remarkably well with ancillary revenue. And we are building out features to be able to assist our airline partners in marketing that -- those ancillary services and revenue such as seat choice for example. So this is a really important initiative for us. We're seeing nice traction from our air partners. And right now I'd say the relationships with the majority of our air partners are most definitely on the upswing."

As far as cross sell goes, we're very happy with our production in the cross-sell area. We measure the percentage of Expedia bookers who buy more than one item for us, bundle one item for us, and that number has been consistently increasing over a period of time and allow us a couple of things. One is it often allows us to deliver a discount to the consumer by buying multiple products in one purchase. It's like your cable bundle. You buy your Internet and your phone service and your TV service together, you get a discount. We are offering the Internet bundle for online travel. And consumers are increasingly taking advantage of it, and they're taking advantage of the discounts there. From a supplier -- from a supply partner basis, it also helps in that these transactions tend to be longer-dated transactions so that the supplier can kind of fill up their window, their inventory on a long-dated basis, and they carry with them lower cancellation rates because the consumer who's booking multiple things, multiple items, typically is a more committed consumer as well. So it's proven to be a great value proposition for our consumers. It's a differentiator versus the other stand-alone players out there, and it's a nice differentiator for our hotel and air partners as well. It's been a nice win-win, and that business continues to track along well. I think a coming benefit in that area is going to be our increasingly merchandising mobile offerings to consumers while they're in a trip. So you can imagine that if you've gone -- we know that you've flown into New Orleans and you've downloaded the Expedia app, we can offer you activities in New Orleans. If you got to the airport and don't have a ride, we can offer you a ride to your hotel. And we probably have a bunch of intelligence as to when you've -- when you're getting to the airport, when you need -- or where you need to go in your hotel. That is a nascent business, but we think it can really delight our customers. And to the extent that we're selling more stuff to our customers, we can -- in acquiring those customers or we can invest more in keeping those customers through loyalty, through other benefits, through better service. So we're very excited about the opportunity. We think we're in the early to mid-innings. I won't say that we're in the absolute early innings because the team is making traction, and they're doing good work. As far as our loyalty programs, we continue to see very nice traction there. Hotels.com is going to -- the biggest in the family as far as loyalty goes. There are over 80 million now Hotels.com rewards members around the globe. I think that those -- of those 80 million members, since of the program started, I think they've stayed in 4.5 million hotel rooms for free. So you can have an idea of how much we are reinvesting in these loyal customers. And a higher and higher percentage of our transaction mix and our revenue mix is coming from these loyalty members. The Expedia loyalty program, the Expedia+, was mostly a U.S. program. It's now expanding globally. We're now in 18 points of sale. We're over 10 million members, and that business continues or that loyalty customer base continues to grow as well. This is another differentiator for us. It is something that we're pretty excited about and something that we think we can expand and grow."

As far as reviews go, it's a very important factor in our travelers' decision as to which hotel they pick, second only to pictures I believe. So we are very actively continuing to collect more reviews on our hotels. Our higher-rated hotels tend to do best in the Expedia marketplace. So I think there's a nice incentive for hoteliers to make sure that the Expedia or Hotels.com customer gets a good -- gets treated well because not only do those hotels perform better in the marketplace, but then over 50 million, 60 million other consumers are reading those reviews as well. So it's very important to treat those customers well. The value that we bring with real-time reviews is that if you look at our reviews in the past, the value -- the customer value for those reviews was that they were all real reviews, right? You knew that a customer stayed at that hotel. They're 100% dependable. We got some complaints from some hoteliers saying, ""Listen, I wish I knew about this customer's poor experience. I wish I could do something about a review other than comment I'm sorry about your experience."" So now with real-time reviews, we're asking the customer when they're in the market, how their experience was. We are then sending the comments from those consumers, either good or bad -- we will highlight the bad because you can do something about it -- to our hotel partners through our Expedia partner tool, which, by the way, is going mobile as well so that if someone didn't like their room, if someone didn't like their view, if someone didn't have towels in their room, the hotelier can do something about it on a real-time basis. And you can imagine that being just a delightful experience if the hotelier does something about it without a complaint coming directly. So we think it's a great tool for hoteliers, and we think it can be a terrific experience for our consumers as well. It's early innings, but we're pretty excited about it."

I think it goes to what Mark was talking about as far as the Wotif integration. The first benefit that we got from the Travelocity integration was higher conversion because Travelocity was able to piggyback off of the substantial investments that we made on the Brand Expedia platform. There's a second benefit that it got, which is cost efficiency. We didn't have to carry a bunch of secondary cost building out features that had already been built up probably in a better way. So those 2 come pretty quickly. And then the teams start optimizing on the marketing side in various marketing channels, and at that point, they've got to burn in a bunch of algorithms and a bunch of decisions that have to be made, one, based on the conversion of that site in various channels and two, based on the lifetime value of its customer base. And those factors, while conversion has improved, the conversion of a Travelocity customer, let's say, in the trivago marketplace and the lifetime value there is going to be different than Expedia, is going to be different from Hotels.com. So you start moving through a period of optimization in these marketing channels, and I would say it takes a good 6 months, if not, more for you to start getting these marketing channels to work in the way that they should. And then if you have a good site, if you got good marketing, if you got a great brand, which what you see with Travelocity, you tend to have an entity that can grow, and that's what we're seeing with Travelocity. The thing that I would add is that we don't take 100% of those savings to the bottom line. We take some of the savings on overhead, and we reapply them into the brand. So if you look at the Travelocity brand spend this year versus last year, it will be up. We think that's a good thing. And we think the combination of better conversion, better variable marketing, a higher brand spend, that's a formula that you need to grow a business, and our intention with Travelocity is to grow the business. It's been a year. We hope we can do it for multiple years."

We did start to lap over the hotel revenue side of that business in Q2. As a reminder, we started lapping over essentially the gross bookings part of it in the beginning of the year and then revenue lags, and that cleaned out in the back part of the second quarter. So there was some impact, but it's in and around, call it, the 100 bp type range. It's not a very significant number for us. We think it can continue to grow quite nicely as we optimize the sales and marketing spend. With respect to CapEx, the biggest thing this quarter was the closing of our transactions for the new Seattle headquarters, and that was a number that hit CapEx pretty significantly. With respect to the rest of it, which is largely capitalized software development, I would say just look at the past for a decent predictor of what to expect into the future. And just specifically on the real estate purchases, about $229 million of that CapEx was just for that."

The following discussion, including responses to questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 30, 2015, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on the call today are forward looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck.
Please note that we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Dara."

We once again saw healthy unit trends across products with global room nights up 35%, air tickets up 26% and car rental days up 35% year-on-year. We were pleased with the revenue growth of 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% for the quarter.
Our core OTA segment continued to perform well, led by strong top line growth for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, our 2 biggest businesses. We also saw healthy revenue growth from Travelocity and EAN, along with an inorganic tailwind from Wotif and AirAsia Expedia joint venture, which we now consolidate as a result of increasing our ownership stake to 75%.
Of particular note, we continue to see very good growth rates for Travelocity even as we anniversary the ramp-up of that business last year. We're also optimistic about Wotif's potential to grow organically over time despite near-term FX headwinds now that it's fully integrated into the Expedia platform and with the team starting to iterate on the site and on marketing channels.
As was the case last year, we continue to see strong progress in new hotel property acquisition around the world with approximately 27,000 additional properties this quarter, including some recently integrated Wotif properties. This is a significant milestone as we now have added more properties in the first half of 2015 than we did in all of 2014. We've got very long runway here, and we expect to spend the next several years building out our global lodging inventory.
From a technology perspective, we recently completed a move -- a project to move Venere onto the Hotels.com platform. This is similar to our efforts in the last few years to extend the Brand Expedia platform to brands such as Travelocity and Wotif. We now have a global full-service OTA platform in Brand Expedia and a global merchant agency stand-alone hotel platform in Hotels.com, each capable of powering additional brands.
Based our experience, thus far, we believe that these 2 platforms represent unique competitive assets, which can be leveraged to draw further top and bottom line growth going forward. We continue to invest heavily in our technology capabilities to round out our service offerings, adding car rentals and activities to the Brand Expedia mobile app, adding the cruise product onto the new platform for Travelocity and innovating a supply-facing technology such as real-time reviews, which allow our hotel partners to receive feedback from travelers live during their stay to improve the overall guest experience.
Regarding the announced Orbitz transaction, we don't have any significant additional news to share today. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ, providing information and answering questions. We continue to believe that the transaction should be approved and then closed in the back half of the year.
trivago continued to see very strong growth, generating stand-alone revenue of $143 million in the second quarter and $487 million on the trailing 12-month basis. trivago generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of about $9 million in Q2, pretty consistent with the second quarter of last year, as we continue to invest aggressively in selling and marketing and as we moved into the busy part of travel shopping cycle. We expect to continue to invest profits from higher margin markets into developing markets in order to grow trivago globally.
A note on China. Although we did sell our ownership stake in eLong in the second quarter, I want to be clear that we're still participating in the huge long-term growth opportunity that China represents. We have ongoing commercial agreements, which give us access to the outbound Chinese travelers of Ctrip and eLong and expect both to bear fruit over the near and long term.
Hotels.com and EAN are growing fast in China although off of a small base, and Brand Expedia has a presence in Hong Kong with more to come in the region. We expect to continue to invest to build our long-term prospects in China, and although our exposure to the domestic Chinese travel market is reduced for the near term, we were pleased to be able to drive substantial value creation for our shareholders through the eLong transaction.
In closing, I'd like to thank our teams around the world for all of their efforts and in doing so, celebrate for a moment a very good first half of the year. We must remain focused on driving strong execution and great innovation. There's still a lot of work ahead of us, and competition remains as fierce as ever.
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Financial results for eLong are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and the focus on the parts of the business that will be ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia Inc. results excluding eLong.
The overall trajectory of the business remains very strong as has been the case for some time now with the second quarter results broadly consistent with Q1 trends and a bit better than we had expected. Strength across our breadth of leading brands and across geographies continues with rare exception. Our core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, are all having solid years with strong execution and goo financial results.
Top line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remained strong for all of our major brands relative to Q1 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 35% year-over-year, an acceleration from 32% growth last quarter. Domestic room nights grew 24% in Q2, while international room nights were up 50%. The inorganic impact from Wotif and the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture added approximately 7 percentage points to global room night growth this quarter. For comparison, last quarter, excluding eLong, inorganic impacts drove over 5 percentage points of room night growth.
Revenue per room night was down just under 16% this quarter, while ADRs were down almost 6%. The factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for quite a while now. Foreign currency accounted for a little less than half of the decline in revenue per room night, while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest.
We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and scale. Air revenue grew 14% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 10%. We saw a significant acceleration in air ticket growth from Brand Expedia this quarter on the back of the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture, along with continued strong performance that the team innovates on the platform. Excluding inorganic impacts, ticket growth would have been 20%, a nice acceleration from Q1.
Our Advertising & Media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, continued growing nicely with trivago growing stand-alone revenue 37% and net revenue after intercompany eliminations, 25%. On a stand-alone FX neutral basis, we estimate that trivago revenues were up 67% year-over-year.
On the expense side, we saw significant leverage in cost of revenue and technology and content expenses. Note that technology and content expense growth was lower than we expected, largely due to lower-than-forecast headcount, higher capitalization rates and to a lesser extent, the timing of some R&D tax credits. Going forward, we are expecting more elevated year-over-year growth in tech and content expense.
General and administrative expenses grew faster than revenue, primarily due to about 6 percentage points of growth from increased M&A-related cost and an additional 7 percentage points from the inorganic impact of recent acquisitions. Absent these impacts, G&A would have grown about 11% and leveraged nicely.
Direct selling and marketing grew faster than revenue, as we continued to invest aggressively to drive global growth and ramp spend ahead of the busy travel season. Indirect selling and marketing costs grew slightly faster than revenues, as we continue to scale up our lodging and supply team. The net result was adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% for the second quarter.
From a cash and capital deployment perspective, we issued a EUR 650 million bond at a coupon of 2.5% in the second quarter with an eye towards financing a portion of the pending Orbitz transaction. We are also happy to announce a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend payable in the third quarter to $0.24 per share. Our approach to capital deployment remains the same, and we will continue to balance the allocation of our cash flow between opportunistic M&A and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. Though Q2 came in a bit better than expected, we plan to put that upside back into the business mostly in Q3 to drive continued growth. And as a reminder, our guidance this quarter comes with the same caveats as last quarter. We remain cautious about where we'll fall in our guidance range due primarily to significant remaining foreign currency headwinds, which have gotten slightly worse since our Q1 call.
Please note that other than some heightened legal and professional fees we are currently carrying, our financial expectations do not take into account material impacts of the potential Orbitz transaction. In addition to integration costs, consolidation of Orbitz' results could result in a negative near-term impact on our consolidated financial results due to the impact of purchase accounting rules, which disallow the recognition of deferred revenue, which is on the books of the acquired company prior to closing.
Finally, I will also note that primarily as a result of selling our stake in eLong, we were able to lower our expectations for our full year effective tax rate to a more normalized mid-20% range.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to line up for questions?"

It certainly starts with the website and the website's ability to convert. If you don't have a great website that has -- that's very easy to use, easy to understand, you're nowhere in this business. So it does start with that. But we have our marketing teams always looking for new demand veins that we can reach on an affordable basis. And it's really the website and those marketing teams working together that have been able to get us to a state of accelerated room nights growth for some period of time, and we have no reason to think that, that's going to change. I think the other 2 factors that you would add to it that are a bit more recent are obviously the addition of new hotel supply, 27,000 hotels. As we are going down the line in bringing in new hotels, on average, they tend to be smaller hotels. So the contribution per hotel is something that we would expect to come down over a period of time, but obviously, the number of hotels that we are adding has increased. There's some cannibalization in larger markets, but we think the new hotels are certainly a nice positive for us. And the last factor that I discussed is that we are seeing an increased percentage of our business in general coming from repeat customers. We've been investing very aggressively in our loyalty programs and our customer service to keep customers coming back. It is those repeat customers that account for the majority of the profit of the company. And that repeat customer base has been growing as we've been investing in those customers, as we've been growing our loyalty programs and increasing the benefits there. So every part of what I described plays a part in the growth. It's about the site. It's about marketing. It's about supply, and it's about repeat. And when you get it all right, you get a pretty good formula. For the time being, we have it right, and we have to very much stay on our toes to keep competitive in this marketplace because there are a lot of players competing for that customer attention. As far as TripAdvisor and Google building out booking capability, et cetera, listen, this is nothing new. It's something that has gone on for some time, as you know, as far as TripAdvisor goes. We do participate in the TripAdvisor marketplace as an advertiser. We are not participating in Trip Instant Book, so from a theoretical standpoint, we are getting a smaller addressable market in the TripAdvisor marketplace. And my guess is a lot of that market is going to the hotels direct. That's not new. And that's a headwind that we've been facing but is a headwind that we've navigated pretty well. And we're hoping to navigate on a go-forward basis. And in general, our business with TripAdvisor is growing. We do see Google make some moves in the area, and I'd say one difference that we see with the Google treatment on -- of the bookings is that the Google treatment tends to be much more clear that the booking is actually with the OTA and Google is not the merchant, et cetera. It's really making the payment process easier rather than trying to own the customer one way or the other. So we do anticipate testing out with Google and testing out some of the other treatments and seeing how it affects our customers and our customer satisfaction and our economics in general."

Occupancies look strong. And really, that rolls into the travel conditions in Europe. We are continuing to see similar trends to what we mentioned last quarter, which is we're seeing an increased mix of European travel stay-in in Europe and the addition of an increased propensity of Americans who travel into Europe. And across the board, I think with a few obvious exceptions in Southern Europe, we're seeing a lot of health in the European market."

And you can imagine that the Chinese outbound business is quite package related, and our ability to offer package inventory on a global basis with the kind of scope that we have has proven to be quite interesting to local Chinese travel providers. And we see the partnership opportunities there already pretty strong, and we think we've got a lot of runway ahead of us. So this is not a 1-year thing. It's a multi-year thing. And we won't be competing as much as we had on the past for the local Chinese customer, but we are very much involved in both the Chinese outbound business and inbound business going into China as well. I think on vacation rentals, listen, I think we're -- we continue to test and learn. We have a partnership with Home Away. We're expanding that partnership into Europe, and we're testing and learning in certain European markets. And we're very excited to do that because the vacation rental market tends to be quite strong in the European market. So we absolutely want to be there, and we're happy to be there with the Home Away team. I don't think that we've hit kind of on magic bullet at this point. So we don't see the additional inventory at this point materially increasing our revenue per shopper, but we think the customer experience at this point isn't what it needs to be. And we think we can materially improve the customer experience, and we're hoping that will add to our customer satisfaction and also help our revenue per shopper. And we're working with Home Away on that front, and we'll look to bring in additional inventory as well."

As far as our take rates go, while every market is different, I would say the lowering of our take rates, in general, to both secure new inventory and secure better inventory for existing partners has been broad. So our take rates have come down in the U.S. They've come down in Europe. They've come down in Asia whether we're a new entrant or not. And we don't necessarily see that changing. We've adjusted our business model to be able to reduce cost to our marketing partners while able to drive good economics for our shareholders. And that's our job, and we feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on that. As far as long-term position, et cetera, it's very difficult to tell. The only thing that I know is that there's lots and lots of different distribution channels for supply partners on a global basis. And in order to continue to be competitive as a distribution partner, you have to be good and you got to be cheap. And I don't see that changing. And we're prepared for that world. We think we've been able to grow in that world, and we're comfortable with it. As far as the supply growth going, the majority of the supply growth came from kind of, call it, organic acquisition. We have been investing in our market manager force pretty aggressively, and that investment has led us to be able to go out and sign up hotels on a direct basis. So I'd say the direct sign-ups have been the majority of the increase in supply growth. We had a bit of a nice bump from Wotif. Thank you for that team for bringing those hotels onboard. And then we are also signing up hotels through some third parties, but that is the significant minority of the sign-ups that you saw. At this point, we're hoping to accelerate it on a go-forward basis."

We've got very strong long-term contracts with the vast majority of our air supply partners, and I'd say that those relationships are getting stronger, not the other way around. One of the pretty important initiatives for us is to move from really just being a commodity provider of air product as far as just showing, call it, the lowest price and schedule to becoming a value-added player in selling air. So if you look at our air product now we have more content on the quality of the flight through a partnership with Routehappy. And we are adding features such as branded fare so that while we will show you the lowest price, you can get some more flexibility. You might be able to get -- be able to choose your seat, et cetera, and essentially sell an ancillary-type revenue, which is very, very important revenue. If you follow the airline industry, the airlines have done remarkably well with ancillary revenue. And we are building out features to be able to assist our airline partners in marketing that -- those ancillary services and revenue such as seat choice for example. So this is a really important initiative for us. We're seeing nice traction from our air partners. And right now I'd say the relationships with the majority of our air partners are most definitely on the upswing."

As far as cross sell goes, we're very happy with our production in the cross-sell area. We measure the percentage of Expedia bookers who buy more than one item for us, bundle one item for us, and that number has been consistently increasing over a period of time and allow us a couple of things. One is it often allows us to deliver a discount to the consumer by buying multiple products in one purchase. It's like your cable bundle. You buy your Internet and your phone service and your TV service together, you get a discount. We are offering the Internet bundle for online travel. And consumers are increasingly taking advantage of it, and they're taking advantage of the discounts there. From a supplier -- from a supply partner basis, it also helps in that these transactions tend to be longer-dated transactions so that the supplier can kind of fill up their window, their inventory on a long-dated basis, and they carry with them lower cancellation rates because the consumer who's booking multiple things, multiple items, typically is a more committed consumer as well. So it's proven to be a great value proposition for our consumers. It's a differentiator versus the other stand-alone players out there, and it's a nice differentiator for our hotel and air partners as well. It's been a nice win-win, and that business continues to track along well. I think a coming benefit in that area is going to be our increasingly merchandising mobile offerings to consumers while they're in a trip. So you can imagine that if you've gone -- we know that you've flown into New Orleans and you've downloaded the Expedia app, we can offer you activities in New Orleans. If you got to the airport and don't have a ride, we can offer you a ride to your hotel. And we probably have a bunch of intelligence as to when you've -- when you're getting to the airport, when you need -- or where you need to go in your hotel. That is a nascent business, but we think it can really delight our customers. And to the extent that we're selling more stuff to our customers, we can -- in acquiring those customers or we can invest more in keeping those customers through loyalty, through other benefits, through better service. So we're very excited about the opportunity. We think we're in the early to mid-innings. I won't say that we're in the absolute early innings because the team is making traction, and they're doing good work. As far as our loyalty programs, we continue to see very nice traction there. Hotels.com is going to -- the biggest in the family as far as loyalty goes. There are over 18 million now Hotels.com rewards members around the globe. I think that those -- of those 18 million members, since of the program started, I think they've stayed in 4.5 million hotel rooms for free. So you can have an idea of how much we are reinvesting in these loyal customers. And a higher and higher percentage of our transaction mix and our revenue mix is coming from these loyalty members. The Expedia loyalty program, the Expedia+, was mostly a U.S. program. It's now expanding globally. We're now in 18 points of sale. We're over 10 million members, and that business continues or that loyalty customer base continues to grow as well. This is another differentiator for us. It is something that we're pretty excited about and something that we think we can expand and grow."

As far as reviews go, it's a very important factor in our travelers' decision as to which hotel they pick, second only to pictures I believe. So we are very actively continuing to collect more reviews on our hotels. Our higher-rated hotels tend to do best in the Expedia marketplace. So I think there's a nice incentive for hoteliers to make sure that the Expedia or Hotels.com customer gets a good -- gets treated well because not only do those hotels perform better in the marketplace, but then over 50 million, 60 million other consumers are reading those reviews as well. So it's very important to treat those customers well. The value that we bring with real-time reviews is that if you look at our reviews in the past, the value -- the customer value for those reviews was that they were all real reviews, right? You knew that a customer stayed at that hotel. They're 100% dependable. We got some complaints from some hoteliers saying, ""Listen, I wish I knew about this customer's poor experience. I wish I could do something about a review other than comment I'm sorry about your experience."" So now with real-time reviews, we're asking the customer when they're in the market, how their experience was. We are then sending the comments from those consumers, either good or bad -- we will highlight the bad because you can do something about it -- to our hotel partners through our Expedia partner tool, which, by the way, is going mobile as well so that if someone didn't like their room, if someone didn't like their view, if someone didn't have towels in their room, the hotelier can do something about it on a real-time basis. And you can imagine that being just a delightful experience if the hotelier does something about it without a complaint coming directly. So we think it's a great tool for hoteliers, and we think it can be a terrific experience for our consumers as well. It's early innings, but we're pretty excited about it."

The majority of our marketing spend are essentially it's variable spend. We don't know how competitive the auction is going to be. And essentially, in some of those marketing channels, the more we spend, the better because we're acquiring more new customers as long as you can do it in a competitive manner. So when we talk about shifting marketing spend, that's for plan spend that tends to be offline. And then things can change pretty darn materially when we're in quarter. And I think our teams have handled it well, and they operate within kind of their efficiency formula so to speak. But marketing spend is not something that we necessarily want to keep predictable one way or the other. We're really about the core economics, and we're not about the quarter."

I think it goes to what Mark was talking about as far as the Wotif integration. The first benefit that we got from the Travelocity integration was higher conversion because Travelocity was able to piggyback off of the substantial investments that we made on the Brand Expedia platform. There's a second benefit that it got, which is cost efficiency. We didn't have to carry a bunch of secondary cost building out features that had already been built up probably in a better way. So those 2 come pretty quickly. And then the teams start optimizing on the marketing side in various marketing channels, and at that point, they've got to burn in a bunch of algorithms and a bunch of decisions that have to be made, one, based on the conversion of that site in various channels and two, based on the lifetime value of its customer base. And those factors, while conversion has improved, the conversion of a Travelocity customer, let's say, in the trivago marketplace and the lifetime value there is going to be different than Expedia, is going to be different from Hotels.com. So you start moving through a period of optimization in these marketing channels, and I would say it takes a good 6 months, if not, more for you to start getting these marketing channels to work in the way that they should. And then if you have a good site, if you got good marketing, if you got a great brand, which what you see with Travelocity, you tend to have an entity that can grow, and that's what we're seeing with Travelocity. The thing that I would add is that we don't take 100% of those savings to the bottom line. We take some of the savings on overhead, and we reapply them into the brand. So if you look at the Travelocity brand spend this year versus last year, it will be up. We think that's a good thing. And we think the combination of better conversion, better variable marketing, a higher brand spend, that's a formula that you need to grow a business, and our intention with Travelocity is to grow the business. It's been a year. We hope we can do it for multiple years."

So there was some impact, but it's in and around, call it, the 100 bp type range. It's not a very significant number for us. We think it can continue to grow quite nicely as we optimize the sales and marketing spend. With respect to CapEx, the biggest thing this quarter was the closing of our transactions for the new Seattle headquarters, and that was a number that hit CapEx pretty significantly. With respect to the rest of it, which is largely capitalized software development, I would say just look at the past for a decent predictor of what to expect into the future. And just specifically on the real estate purchases, about $229 million of that CapEx was just for that."

It all starts with the integral growth, and ours was excellent. Room night growth of 36%, air tickets up 31% and car days up 33% year-over-year. Excluding Orbitz, gross bookings grew 18%, revenue was up 15% and adjusted EBITDA grew 17% with a performance nicely about that we'd expected when we last spoke. Note, too, that we achieve these result despite considerable foreign exchange, revenue margin and deal expense headwinds. Our teams are executing well.
Let me quickly cover a few other key matters that I'm sure of are interest to all of you before handing it over to Mark. We are pleased to have closed the Orbitz contraction on September 17. The teams immediately began integration planning, working closely to determine how best to bring these 2 beating travel companies together. As we said before, over wide is a global business. And as such, is significantly more complex than our prior integrations. The bulk of the integration work is expected to take place over the next 9 months with certain business, such as Orbitz partner network and Orbitz for business, pushing out to a year or more.
That said, we're off to a strong start and the teams are working hard to bring the companies together as quickly and as efficiently as possible, making sure that our travelers and supply or distribution partners are all taking care of in the process.
We've decided to make the Orbitz.com and cheap tickets businesses onto the Brand Expedia platform, and we'll look to look for leverage opportunities across the Orbitz portfolio brands. Mark will cover the near-term financial expectations for the Orbitz business in his remarks. 
Our hotel supply position continues to improve and this year, we added 14,000 properties through our inventory, now up 29% year-over-year. We continue to invest in people, processes and technology across our supply organization and our on boarding new hotels in record time at higher quality than we ever have. We expect to see some variation and seasonality quarter-to-quarter and expect property additions in Q4 to outpace Q3. We continue to have aggressive plans for property growth over the long term.
Now I'm sure have questions regarding any potential impacts arising from recent developments in the TripAdvisor instant book product. To the extent that price launch participation accelerates in some book global penetration, we would anticipate additional volume pressure in the TripAdvisor channel. While certainly not a positive, TripAdvisor has been a shrinking share of our overall demand pull for some time. Note too TripAdvisor is one of our lower margin channel so the impact in profitably will most likely be muted. Lastly, I will tell you that we're very happy to have trivago, one of the fastest-growing major global hotel meta-brands as part of our family. You've seen us invest aggressively that ran and should expect the same moving forward.
Now a fundamental part of our strategy is to continue to develop our marketing and product efforts relating to our proprietary direct channels. There are 3 areas that I'd like to highlight today: Loyalty, mobile and attach. 
On loyalty, we continue to see good progress in terms of customer loyalty and repeat behavior. The Hotels.com rewards loyalty program, which recently surpassed the 20 million member milestone, continues to see strong growth and in fact, one of the fastest-growing marketing channels for that brand. Our Expedia plus rewards program now has over 12 million members and has launched in 27 countries just this year with 2 more to come by year-end.
Turning to mobile. Mobile web for us is about new customer acquisition and app is about cementing those new customers into loyal repeat users. We see great traction in both channels, especially on the conversion on product side with our OTA brands seeing a range of 40% to 60% of traffic and 20% to 40% of transactions booked on mobile overall. I think its safe to say that mobile has transitioned from being a profit headwind to the key component of our core offerings and a channel product where we see significant potential going forward.
Last and certainly not least, we have in our portfolio now the preeminent full-service OTA brands, such as Brand Expedia, Travelocity, Hotwire, Wotif, Orbitz, Cheap Tickets and eBookers, and that means lots of air shoppers. Today, not including Orbitz, we see over 7.5 billion annual air searches, which is likely to increase over time and drive real opportunities to upsell and to ancillary of product and fair offerings, as well as cross sell into hotels, apartments, vacation rentals, rental cars, car hire, local tours and activities, insurance and more. We've just scratched the surface here in an area where we believe we have substantial lead and a strategic advantage. Next on the agenda is to execute this very same playbook with rail. We're coding up a new rail product as we speak, which we plan to launch next year.
The vast majority of our profits come from our direct channels in efforts like these represent a strategic growth drivers of the company now and moving forward. We've have a terrific year so far and I'd like to take a moment to thank employees place for all of their hard work, job well done. A tremendous effort is improving our capabilities in our business each and every day. With that, I'll hand it to Mark."
25915843,306992161,886067,"Expedia Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started. We sold our 62% stake in eLong on May 22, and financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date.

We sold our 62% stake in eLong on May 22, and financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and to focus on the parts of the business that are ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia Inc. results, excluding eLong. 
The overall trajectory of the business remains strong with the third quarter probably consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the year, strength across our breadth of leading brands and across geographies continue with rare exception. Our core OTA segments, trivago and Egencia, are all having solid years with strong execution and good financial results.
Top line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remained strong for all of our major brands relative to first half growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 36% year-over-year, as slight acceleration from 35% last quarter. The inorganic impact from recent acquisitions added approximately 8 percentage points to global room night growth in Q3.
Note that due to purchase accounting rules, we don't recognize revenue or the related room night volume from acquisitions, which was booked prior to the close date. And therefore, the impact on hotel revenue and room night growth from Orbitz was de minimus. Domestic room nights grew 25% in Q3 while international room nights were up 50%. Revenue per room night was down approximately 15% this quarter while ADRs were down 6%. These metrics are similar to to those we've reported in Q2 and the factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for a while. 
Foreign currency accounted for little more than half of the decline in revenue per room night, while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and to a lesser extent, the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest. We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale.
Air revenue grew 19% on ticket growth of 31%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 9%. We continue to see fast ticket growth for Brand Expedia on the back of the consolidation of the Air Asia Expedia joint venture and the benefit of innovating them on the platform. In addition, Orbitz contributed 6 percentage points to air ticket growth this quarter. 
Excluding all inorganic impacts, air revenue would have grow 4% on ticket growth of 19%. Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, continued growing nicely, with trivago growing stand-alone revenue of 27% or approximately 49% currency neutral. Media Solutions also grew at a healthy rate and Orbitz contributed 2 percentage points to add media growth this quarter. We continue to drive to our P&L that reflects an aggressive sales and marketing investment around the world to expand our global reach and drive long-term growth, both gaining scale and leverage another key expense categories.
Excluding the impact from Orbitz, the P&L we delivered in Q3 was consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing growing a bit faster than revenue with cost of revenue, technology and content and G&A growing slower providing leverage. Importantly, our results for Q3 also include the layering of the Orbitz stand-alone financials for the 14 days of the quarter that we own the business. As we told you to expect on our Q2 call, the impact from Orbitz on adjusted EBITDA was indeed negative in Q3, primarily as a result of purchase again impacts, which when taken with approximately $7 million of deal and integration costs resulted in a negative impact of approximately $17 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. At the top line, Orbitz controverted $421 million of gross bookings and $19 million of revenue.
Now I'd like to cover our financial expectations for full year 2015. I will give some color on our expectations, both excluding the impact of the Orbitz transactions, or an apple-to-apples basis with prior guidance, as well as including the impact of Orbitz, so you can fully understand the relevant impacts.
Given performance to date and the trends we are seeing, we are now forecasting full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding eLong, of 12% to 15%. On an apples-to-apples basis, relative to prior guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong and excluding all impacts of the Orbitz transaction in Q3 and Q4, we are forecasting full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth to come in near the high-end of that range.
On the other hand, including all impacts of Orbitz for both Q3 and Q4, which were not included in our prior guidance, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of our range. In total, we expect the full year negative adjusted EBITDA impact from Orbitz of over $32 million with approximately $15 million coming in the fourth quarter. This includes integrated related costs, as well as Orbitz operating results, which as mentioned will be negatively impacted by purchase accounting rules.
Although we plan to give you more color on our Q4 call regarding the likely impact of Orbitz for 2016, I'm able to share some additional perspective today. Based on the current trajectory of Orbitz on a standalone basis, we believe the business would have delivered full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA of roughly $135 million, which we think is slightly lower than street expectations. However, with the benefit of the more detailed integration planning we've been able to do since the closing of the transaction, we now have a better view on synergy realization timelines, as well as run rate synergy potential. 
Though there's still much more work to do and details to iron out, what I can tell you is that we now believe that there is meaningful upside to the $75 million in run rate synergies that we project at the time we announced the transaction. We expect the synergies to layer in slowly in the first half of the year, ramping to near run rate by the end of 2016.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

It's -- we don't see it in that business. It's not affecting us directly at all. If anything, we think that Airbnb may be getting a new class of consumer into travel. It's typically a lower price point. It's appeal to millennials, and we think that, based on different occasions, sometimes some consumers will opt for rental type inventory and sometimes, they will opt for hotels. And we think the hotel product is a great product and it certainly shows up in our numbers. That said, it is adding supply into the market, into the logic marketplace. And that supply is addressable to a certain portion of the population. So our belief is that it will put pricing pressure in certain markets, where you see a significant amount of Airbnb inventory. We have heard sporadically from some of our market managers that there are certain period so that would be absolute peak periods that where a town with a town would tiddly sellout where it's quite selling out, and actually, that translates into good news for us because we wind up having hotel inventory to sell and market to our consumers during a time where previously, we wouldn't have that inventory. So, so far, when we talk to, call it, the crew on the ground who really know what's going on in the business, they view it as a positive versus a negative. It's clearly product that's important for certain group of people. So we will look to build out our rental product over time. First order of businesses is the traditional hotel product, but we are adding apartment type product, and we'll continue to add it. I think, incrementally, it'll become more important part of our mix next year and going into the following years."

First, OTAs have been around 15 years, and yet you're growing domestic room nights 25%. Can you talk about the penetration of online bookings in the U.S. and then what they might actually later? How much is going and how much room is still there? And then, secondly, the tech platform, I believe it were 2 or 3 years into it, price line arguably was 9 years into there, purchases in some of the other Booking.com platforms. But how much more room do you have to improve conversion or other things with that tech platform? Or do think you might be running out of room?"

As far as the OTAs ago, I just think that anyone now who is looking to travel or looking to research or book travel is going to look at OTAs. And I think we have become mainstream. The numbers that we see as far as online penetration are in the 40%,",563,"Sure. As far as the OTAs ago, I just think that anyone now who is looking to travel or looking to research or book travel is going to look at OTAs. And I think we have become mainstream. The numbers that we see as far as online penetration are in the 40%, 50% range. And while there is some -- you have to believe in the law of large numbers that online penetration is going to slow down. I think our brands are becoming more relevant. Our supply is getting better. Our sites are getting better and faster. Our service is improving. So it really does look like we are taking share from some of the smaller players who can't make the kinds of marketing and technology and customer service and loyalty investments that we can. So I think, at this point, it is a game of not just online penetration increasing, but also our gaining share versus a number of other players. Keep in mind that we are still just a single-digit percentage of total room night in the U.S. So we think -- we really think we have a long way to go. And the teams are executing well. This is the teams that are accomplishing this. On the tech platform, we look very carefully at what we call our run rate. We are obviously, are running thousands of tests that are powered by thousands of hypotheses by our product teams. And we look at our win rate versus, call it, neutral or a loss rate, we look at the average size of win. In other words, if we have a win, is it -- what does that look like on a percentage basis versus the base case? And our win rate and the average size of win continue at rates that are pretty darn attractive and conversion continues to be a tailwind. So while theoretically, we think that there's a high water mark that we might be hitting, we haven't seen it. I do think that our increasing our supply and increasing the quality of supply and just the number of hotels is kind of a new tailwind that we haven't seen in the past couple of years. So I think that the conversion is not only a factor of the product and the tech platform, but it's also a factor of the good work that our supply team is doing. I would add just one thing about the tech platform, one thing that really touched me about the tech platform is that step one was who the platform was really these experience that the consumer saw. That tech platform now is going down the stack. And for example, our tell your experience, the total so we are offering our hoteliers are improving rapidly. We are arming them up with so much more data or hoteliers can look up how many people are looking at the their hotel. How many people looked at their hotel in built on arrival hotel? They're able to do it on a website. They're able to do it through an app, et cetera. This tech platform is of the benefits that we're getting from the tech platform are much broader than just the consumer, and we think that we're just getting started on the other parts that typically don't get headlines, but are quite valuable."

So it's our intent to test and learn with them, and we will let the data and what our consumer tell us essentially drive the long-term decision to their. As far as price participation on trivago, it's unknown. trivago is now pretty aggressively testing out a product that looks like instant book. We think there's a lot more clarity again on where the consumer is booking their travel. trivago is simply trying to optimize that path versus, let's say, gather consumer data, upsell and other stuff. So they are very, very focused on just optimizing that consumer experience in that moment. The test is happening in Germany. And so far, we like what we see. And many of Expedia brands are participating. And I think the trivago team is excited about rolling out that product. We see if price line participates or not."

Again, we are dissipating in China, booked through our Expedia affiliate network business that powers a lot of the leading players in China with our international hotel inventory also through Hotels.com, also through Egencia and trivago is tipping -- it's tipping its flip it's still in the water in China.

I mean, we are probably 3 quarters the way through the process with the Travelocity right now, and we like what we see. That's a brand that's continued to be a growth brand, lapping over everything. So very encouraging. Wotif is probably a quarter the way through. It's on the platform. We're training the marketing models. They've just launched the brand-new brand campaign in Australia, which we're pretty excited about. It's one of their biggest ever. And that's really aimed at returning that iconic brand to iconic status. And I think, listen, those are good parallels for Orbitz generally. That said, as Dara said in his prepared remarks, Orbitz is a bigger business. Orbitz is a more global business. Even if you look at Orbitz in cheap tickets, I mean, these are business that have been, I would say, compared with Wotif or compared with the Travelocity, a little bit closer to optimization already. And so I think for the Orbitz business, even though the playbook is the same, the caveat is that we could see when we flip it over to the platform, actually a moment where conversion might degrade and we actually have a little bit more of an optimization period to go through. So I think that's the caveat that we really don't know the answer to yet. But aside from that, I think it is very similar playbook."

We have not to date aggressively participated in variable channels in air because of the revenue and profitability per unit that air has averaged historically. We think that we are in a position now to participate more aggressively in some of these variable channels and the growth rates that we see those bearable channels are very significant, but off of small basis. So air tends to be much more of a direct business. So attach revenue tends to be higher-margin revenue, so to speak, but we're very much looking forward to participating more aggressively in variable channels on the air side. There are some variable channels such as Maeda in the U.S. on the air side where we can't participate based on some kind of deals, women's that Mena channels have with some of our air partners. So while I think there's growth in the variable channels for air, it's not going to quite look like what we see in the hotel product, but it is a nice upside versus where we are now."

The phase we're in right now wherever continues to be an that we are able to take those profits and put them into new opportunities. The story continues to be told in the U.S, Canada and Australia. The growth rates in the U.S. continue to be very impressive and U.S. awareness is now up to one in every second Americans actually heard of trivago, coming from a point of obscurity in 2012. So we're really still in that investment mode. We do think that the U.S. market will start to mature probably into next year. But then we look at some of the other markets, where they've entered recently. I mean, Japan, for example, we're seen revenue actually what Drupal year-over-year, fivefold in Brazil in the Middle East, it's sevenfold in some places. So they're still continues to be pockets of real great opportunity for trivago. And we continue to be very willing to invest in that. But again, I think keep in mind here is that we do have the model, where we actually see what long-term profitability looks like. We're just in a mode right now we are we just have too many attractive investment opportunities to drop that to the bottom line."

But when we look at our overall efficiency this year versus last year in the larger channels in Google, in Trip, and trivago and some of the social channels, the efficiencies haven't changed much. What we do look for is channels that are significantly, call it, new customer acquisition channels. And then our capability of moving those new customers into repeat customers through, call it, direct channels. The more we are able to convert those customers, the higher kind of toll we're willing to pay for those new customers.

So think they have Sam's a lot of the losses. But again, we think we can do that was -- keep the conversion benefits of that sometimes get hurt when you take certain steps to stop fraud. In terms of how much from revenue, how much from cost synergies? We're not going to provide a ton of detail on that at this point. Again, we're still working through the detail. Obviously, there is a cost component around public company cost it's around that we mentioned. And there are some redundant teams, if you will. But we're not really getting into too much detail. I would tell you, though, that we -- even though we think there is a cost reduction opportunity that will create synergies on paper for the deal case, it also presents a huge recruiting opportunity for us. We've got about a thousand opened position at Expedia that are -- in our base operating budget that we would guide you to. But we just got open position and we find that Orbitz is a very talented team. We're looking to place of that people that may find themselves redundant, which is many of those roles as we can. We do think we're going to have some meaningful technology and product capabilities in addition to Orbitz teams located in Chicago. And we think this is a win-win opportunity across the board."

There is pro forma data in the Q that you can see the more other I can give you a little bit more color. In terms of growth differential between bookings and revenue, listen, the big driver there continues to be what we've been doing on the hotel side, is reflected in our revenue per room night. Big chunk of that is foreign exchange. But also, just the deliberate margin reductions we're doing. So as I said to Mark on the kickoff question, I think we're really well into 2017 before we expect to see those pressures abate. And I think, at that point, you could expect to see those growth rates converge. And then I would also say the bigger that trivago gets, that can be a tailwind for it as well. Because of course, they're not a gross bookings at all, they're just a net debt to revenue."

On China, it's really too soon to tell as to how the Ctrip and Cherner transaction will affect, how those respective businesses are run. We think -- we are admiration for the Ctrip team has only increased with that deal we think that's strategically super, super smart. James, and Jane and team are clearly executing, not only well on the ground, but also strategically. And I think you also heard that the changes in the one child policy that I think Jim supported for a long-term. So that team is executing well on a number of fronts. We have a very strong relationship with the Ctrip as part of the eLong deal, with eLong. And also, we've been doing business with Cherner as well for a long time on all about business. So we think that our outbound volumes will continue with them. It's just too hard to tell at this point, as to whether the deal that was announced will have any effect on those volumes. We don't think so, but you never know until you know. As far as inbound volume goes, I'd say the same thing, there's plenty of inbound volume going into China as well. We haven't seen any material change, but since the announcement. But it really is early at this point. As far as of the growth in repeat customers, we don't disclose a bunch of data there, but I would certainly confirm that the growth rate of our repeat customers, if we look at it this year versus the way we were 3, 4 years ago, it's much more healthy than it had been. The -- and it's a natural factor in that we're bringing in more new customers from the variable channels. And so there's a mathematical factor and that they -- a certain percentage of them turn into repeat customers. And the activity that we have in our core product, loyalty, et cetera, is also improving our repeat rates, which is a very nice contributor to, call it, the core profit engine of the company. So the trends that we see there are certainly, good trends and something that we're much more focused on now than where we were call it 3, 4 years ago. 3, 4 years ago was kind of about product conversion reaching into variable channels. Now it's not only those machines but also increasing our supply base and then increasing our repeat customer base as well. 
And then I think you asked a question on conversion as well. Conversion continues to be a positive factor. We don't disclose how positive one way or the other, but it continues to be a nice tailwind for the business."

In Orbitz, yes, they are traditionally weaker. International Hotel, et cetera and also, product mix. Definitely, that something we can help them with. Having access to our global footprint of now over 270,000 hotels around the world having access to our international air and car and soon rail content can only help the Orbitz business. I think, as Dara mentioned, we become pretty darn good at attaching hotel to air tickets. And one of the great things about Orbitz is they got a ton of air traffic. So we think that's a good opportunity, which should help them on the hotel side as well."

Third quarter was another strong one for Expedia building on the very good results we saw in the first half of the year. It all starts with the unit growth, and ours was excellent. Room night growth of 36%, air tickets up 31% and car days up 30% year-over-year. Excluding Orbitz, gross bookings grew 18%, revenue was up 15% and adjusted EBITDA grew 17% with a performance nicely above that we'd expected when we last spoke. Note, too, that we achieve these result despite considerable foreign exchange, revenue margin and deal expense headwinds. Our teams are executing well.
Let me quickly cover a few other key matters that I'm sure of -- are of interest to all of you before handing it over to Mark. We are pleased to have closed the Orbitz contraction on September 17. The teams immediately began integration planning, working quickly to determine how best to bring these 2 leading travel companies together. As we said before, Orbitz Worldwide is a global business. And as such, is significantly more complex than our prior integrations. The bulk of the integration work is expected to take place over the next 9 months with certain business, such as Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business, pushing out to a year or more.
That said, we're off to a strong start and the teams are working hard to bring the companies together as quickly and as efficiently as possible, making sure that our travelers and supply or distribution partners are all taking care of in the process.
We've decided to move the Orbitz.com and cheap tickets businesses onto the Brand Expedia platform, and we'll look to look for leverage opportunities across the Orbitz portfolio brands. Mark will cover the near-term financial expectations for the Orbitz business in his remarks. 
Our hotel supply position continues to improve. In this year, we added 14,000 properties to our inventory, now up 29% year-over-year. We continue to invest in people, processes and technology across our supply organization and our on boarding new hotels in record time at higher quality than we ever have. We expect to see some variation and seasonality quarter-to-quarter and expect property additions in Q4 to outpace Q3. We continue to have aggressive plans for property growth over the long term.
Now I'm sure you have questions regarding any potential impacts arising from recent developments in the TripAdvisor Instant Book product. To the extent that Priceline's participation accelerates Instant Book global penetration, we would anticipate additional volume pressure in the TripAdvisor channel. While certainly not a positive, TripAdvisor has been a shrinking share of our overall demand pool for some time. Note, too, that TripAdvisor is one of our lower margin channel so the impact on profitably will most likely be muted. Lastly, I will tell you that we're very happy to have trivago, one of the fastest-growing major global hotel meta-brands as part of our family. You've seen us invest aggressively in that brand and should expect the same moving forward.
Now a fundamental part of our strategy is to continue to develop our marketing and product efforts relating to our proprietary direct channels. There are 3 areas that I'd like to highlight today: Loyalty, mobile and attach. 
On loyalty, we continue to see good progress in terms of customer loyalty and repeat behavior. The Hotels.com rewards loyalty program, which recently surpassed the 20 million member milestone, continues to see strong growth and in fact, is one of the fastest-growing marketing channels for that brand. Our Expedia Plus rewards program now has over 12 million members and has launched in 27 countries just this year with 2 more to come by year end.
Turning to mobile. Mobile web for us is about new customer acquisition and app is about cementing those new customers into loyal repeat users. We see great traction in both channels, especially on the conversion on product side with our OTA brands seeing a range of 40% to 60% of traffic and 20% to 40% of transactions booked on mobile overall. I think it's safe to say that mobile has transitioned from being a profit headwind to key component of our core offerings and a channel and product where we see significant potential going forward.
Last and certainly not least, we have in our portfolio now the preeminent full-service OTA brands, such as Brand Expedia, Travelocity, Hotwire, Wotif, Orbitz, Cheap Tickets and ebookers, and that means lots of air shoppers. Today, not including Orbitz, we see over 7.5 billion annual air searches, which is likely to increase over time and drive real opportunities to upsell into ancillary air product and fair offerings, as well as cross sell into hotels, apartments, vacation rentals, rental cars, car hire, local tours and activities, insurance and more. We've just scratched the surface here in an area where we believe we have a substantial lead and a strategic advantage. Next on the agenda is to execute this very same playbook with rail. We're coding up a new rail product as we speak, which we plan to launch next year.
The vast majority of our profits come from our direct channels and efforts like these represent a strategic growth drivers of the company now and moving forward. We've had a terrific year so far and I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for all of their hard work for a job well done. A tremendous effort is going into improving our capabilities in our business each and every day. With that, I'll hand it to Mark."
25915843,306992161,886452,"Expedia Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started. We sold our 62% stake in eLong on May 22, and financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and to focus on th",1045,"Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started. We sold our 62% stake in eLong on May 22, and financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and to focus on the parts of the business that are ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia Inc. results, excluding eLong. 
The overall trajectory of the business remains strong with the third quarter results broadly consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the year, strength across our breadth of leading brands and across geographies continue with rare exception. Our core OTA segments, trivago and Egencia, are all having solid years with strong execution and good financial results.
Top line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remained strong for all of our major brands relative to first half growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 36% year-over-year, a slight acceleration from 35% last quarter. The inorganic impact from recent acquisitions added approximately 8 percentage points to global room night growth in Q3.
Note that due to purchase accounting rules, we don't recognize revenue or the related room night volume from acquisitions, which was booked prior to the close date. And therefore, the impact on hotel revenue and room night growth from Orbitz was de minimus. Domestic room nights grew 25% in Q3 while international room nights were up 50%. Revenue per room night was down approximately 15% this quarter while ADRs were down 6%. These metrics are similar to those we've reported in Q2 and the factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for a while. 
Foreign currency accounted for a little more than half of the decline in revenue per room night, while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and to a lesser extent, the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest. We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale.
Air revenue grew 19% on ticket growth of 31%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 9%. We continue to see fast ticket growth for Brand Expedia on the back of the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture and the benefit of innovating them on the platform. In addition, Orbitz contributed 6 percentage points to air ticket growth this quarter. 
Excluding all inorganic impacts, air revenue would have grown 4% on ticket growth of 19%. Our Advertising & Media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, continued growing nicely, with trivago growing stand-alone revenue of 27% or approximately 49% currency neutral. Media Solutions also grew at a healthy rate and Orbitz contributed 2 percentage points to add media growth this quarter. We continue to drive to a P&L that reflects aggressive sales and marketing investment around the world to expand our global reach and drive long-term growth, both gaining scale and leverage and other key expense categories.
Excluding the impact from Orbitz, the P&L we delivered in Q3 was consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing growing a bit faster than revenue, with cost of revenue, technology and content and G&A growing slower providing leverage. Importantly, our results for Q3 also include the layering in of the Orbitz stand-alone financials for the 14 days of the quarter that we own the business. As we told you to expect on our Q2 call, the impact from Orbitz on adjusted EBITDA was indeed negative in Q3, primarily as a result of purchase accounting impacts, which when taken with approximately $7 million of deal and integration costs resulted in a negative impact of approximately $17 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. At the top line, Orbitz contributed $421 million of gross bookings and $19 million of revenue.
Now I'd like to cover our financial expectations for full year 2015. I will give some color on our expectations, both excluding the impact of the Orbitz transactions, or an apple-to-apples basis with prior guidance, as well as including the impact of Orbitz, so you can fully understand the relevant impacts.
Given performance to date and the trends we are seeing, we are now forecasting full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding eLong, of 12% to 15%. On an apples-to-apples basis, relative to prior guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong and excluding all impacts of the Orbitz transaction in Q3 and Q4, we are forecasting full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth to come in near the high end of that range.
On the other hand, including all impacts of Orbitz for both Q3 and Q4, which were not included in our prior guidance, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of our range. In total, we expect a full year negative adjusted EBITDA impact from Orbitz of over $32 million with approximately $15 million coming in the fourth quarter. This includes integrated related costs, as well as Orbitz operating results, which, as mentioned, will be negatively impacted by purchase accounting rules.
Although we plan to give you more color on our Q4 call regarding the likely impact of Orbitz for 2016, I'm able to share some additional perspective today. Based on the current trajectory of Orbitz on a standalone basis, we believe the business would have delivered full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA of roughly $135 million, which we think is likely lower than street expectations. However, with the benefit of the more detailed integration planning we've been able to do since the closing of the transaction, we now have a better view on synergy realization timelines, as well as run rate synergy potential. 
Though there's still much more work to do and details to iron out, what I can tell you is that we now believe that there is meaningful upside to the $75 million in run rate synergies that we project at the time we announced the transaction. We expect this synergies to layer in slowly in the first half of the year, ramping to near run rate by the end of 2016.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

It's -- we don't see it in a business. It's not affecting us directly at all. If anything, we think that Airbnb may be getting a new class of consumer into travel. It's typically a lower price point. It's appeal to millennials, and we think that, based on different occasions, sometimes some consumers will opt for rental-type inventory and sometimes, they will opt for hotels. And we think the hotel product is a great product and it certainly shows up in our numbers. That said, it is adding supply into the market, into the lodging marketplace. And that supply is addressable to a certain portion of the population. So our belief is that it will put pricing pressure in certain markets, where you see a significant amount of Airbnb inventory. We have heard sporadically from some of our market managers that there are certain periods that would be absolute peak periods that where a town would totally sellout where it's not quite selling out, and actually, that translates into good news for us because we wind up having hotel inventory to sell and market to our consumers during a time where previously, we wouldn't have that inventory. So, so far, when we talk to, call it, the crew on the ground who really know what's going on in the business, they view it as a positive versus a negative. It's clearly product that's important for certain group of people. So we will look to build out our rental product over time. First order of businesses is the traditional hotel product, but we are adding apartment-type product, and we'll continue to add it. I think, incrementally, it'll become more important part of our mix next year and going into the following years."

First, OTAs have been around 15 years, and yet you're growing domestic room nights 25%. Can you talk about the penetration of online bookings in the U.S., and then we'll think about international later. But how it's going and how much room is still there? And then, secondly, the tech platform, I believe it were 2 or 3 years into it, Priceline arguably was 9 years into their purchases of some of the Booking.com platforms. But how much more room do you have to improve conversion or other things with the tech platform? Or do think you might be running out of room?"

As far as the OTAs go, I just think that anyone now who is looking to travel or looking to research or book travel is going to look at OTAs. And I think we have become mainstream. The numbers that we see as far as online penetration are in the 40%, 50% range. And while there is some -- you have to believe in the law of large numbers that online penetration is going to slow down. I think our brands are becoming more relevant. Our supply is getting better. Our sites are getting better and faster. Our service is improving. So it really does look like we are taking share from some of the smaller players who can't make the kinds of marketing and technology and customer service and loyalty investments that we can. So I think, at this point, it is a game of not just online penetration increasing, but also our gaining share versus a number of other players. Keep in mind that we are still just a single-digit percentage of total room night in the U.S. So we think -- we really think we have a long way to go. And the teams are executing well. This is the teams that are accomplishing this. On the tech platform, we look pretty carefully at what we call our win rate. We are obviously are running thousands of tests that are powered by thousands of hypotheses by our product teams. And we look at our win rate versus, call it, neutral or a loss rate. We look at the average size of win. In other words, if we have a win, is it -- what does that look like on a percentage basis versus the base case? And our win rate and the average size of win continue at rates that are pretty darn attractive and conversion continues to be a tailwind. So while theoretically, we think that there's a high-water mark that we might be hitting, we haven't seen it. I do think that our increasing our supply and increasing the quality of supply and just the number of hotels is kind of a new tailwind that we haven't seen in the past couple of years. So I think the conversion is not only a factor of the product and the tech platform, but it's also a factor of the good work that our supply team is doing. I would add just one thing about the tech platform, is that -- one thing that really touched me about the tech platform is, step one, was the platform was about the user experience, was really about the website experience that the consumer saw. That tech platform now is going down the stack. And for example, our hotelier experience, the tools that we are offering our hoteliers are improving rapidly. We are arming them up with so much more data or hoteliers can look up how many people are looking at their hotel. How many people looked at their hotel and booked on a rival hotel? They're able to do it on a website. They're able to do it through an app, et cetera. This tech platform is -- the benefits that we're getting from the tech platform are much broader than just the consumer, and we think that we're just getting started on the other parts that typically don't get headlines, but are quite valuable."

As far as the Instant Book product goes, we have worked with Google very closely on their hotel product, various parts of their hotel product. And I think we talked about it previously that it was our intention to test and learn with Google on their -- on the book on Google. We thought the branding, the clarity that they sent to consumers was right on. So it's our intent to test and learn with them, and we will let the data and what our consumer tell us essentially drive the long-term decision there. As far as Priceline's participation on trivago, it's unknown. trivago is now pretty aggressively testing out a product that looks like Instant Book. We think that there's a lot more clarity, again, on where the consumer is booking their travel. trivago is simply trying to optimize that path versus, let's say, gather consumer data to upsell them other stuff. So they're very, very focused on just optimizing that consumer experience in that moment. The test is happening in Germany. And so far, we like what we see. And many of Expedia brands are participating. And I think the trivago team is excited about rolling out that product. We'll see if Priceline participates or not."

So very promising. I will take your China outbound question. I'd say no major change for us. It's hard with a country that big which is growing travel so fast for us to perceive different movements either way. Again, we are participating in China, booked through our Expedia affiliate network business that powers a lot of the leading players in China with our international hotel inventory also through Hotels.com, also through Egencia and trivago is tipping it's -- putting it's toe in the water, I would say, in China. And we are looking forward to implementing the broader commercial relationship that we have with Ctrip through the back part of this year and the beginning part of next. And so we do think -- at least for us, anyways, China outbound remains a very big opportunity, and we continue to like what we see there."

And then, with the Orbitz integration, it sounds like the optimization timeline is consistent with these prior endeavors. You get it on the platform and then the optimization comes over the course of 1 to 2 quarters. Is that the right way to think about it?"

I mean, the 2 that we are nearing the end of that process with our, of course, Travelocity where we did the tech integration really through last year, and we started the marketing integration that you speak of this year. I mean, we are probably 3 quarters the way through the process with Travelocity right now, and we like what we see. That's a brand that's continued to be a growth brand, lapping over everything. So very encouraging. Wotif is probably a quarter the way through. It's on the platform. We're training the marketing models. They've just launched the brand-new brand campaign in Australia, which we're pretty excited about. It's one of their biggest ever. And that's really aimed at returning that iconic brand to iconic status. And I think, listen, those are good parallels for Orbitz generally. That said, as Dara said in his prepared remarks, Orbitz is a bigger business. Orbitz is a more global business. Even if you look at Orbitz in cheap tickets, I mean, these are businesses that have been, I would say, compared with Wotif or compared with the Travelocity, a little bit closer to optimization already. And so I think for the Orbitz business, even though the playbook is the same, the caveat is that we could see when we flip it over to the platform, actually a moment where conversion might degrade and we actually have a little bit more of an optimization period to go through. So I think that's the caveat that we really don't know the answer to yet. But aside from that, I think it is very similar playbook."

So that is a feature that we will look to build on our platforms, but it's their idea, their conception, et cetera. And there are technologies that they built around air research, around connectivity with various providers. Those are, again, super interesting technologies that they build. The talent there is really good. So I think while Orbitz will move on to the Expedia platform, we're going to look for Orbitz to improve the Expedia platform as well."

As far as air queries go, in general, air CPCs tend to be lower than hotel CPCs and air revenue per unit tend to be significantly lower than hotel revenue per unit. We have not to date aggressively participated in variable channels in air because of the revenue and profitability per unit that air has had historically. We think that we are in a position now to participate more aggressively in some of these variable channels and the growth rates that we see in those variable channels are very significant, but off of small basis. So air tends to be much more of a direct business. So attach revenue tends to be higher-margin revenue, so to speak, but we're very much looking forward to participating more aggressively in variable channels on the air side. There are some variable channels, such as meta, in the U.S. on the air side where we can't participate based on some of the kind of deals, agreements that meta channels have with some of our air partners. So while I think there's growth in the variable channels for air, it's not going to quite look like what we see in the hotel product, but it is a nice upside versus where we are now."

And what we see there is a margin structure that quite frankly, looks a lot like TripAdvisor. Essentially, it's a big media business and that's growing nicely with attractive margins. The phase we're in right now however continues to be that we're able to take those profits and put them into new opportunities. The story continues to be told in the U.S, Canada and Australia. The growth rates in the U.S. continue to be very impressive and U.S. awareness is now up to one in every second Americans actually heard of trivago, coming from a point of obscurity in 2012. So we're really still in that investment mode. We do think that the U.S. market will start to mature probably into next year. But then we look at some of the other markets, where they've entered recently. I mean, Japan, for example, we're seeing revenue actually quadruple year-over-year; fivefold in Brazil; in the Middle East, it's sevenfold in some places. So they're still continues to be pockets of real great opportunity for trivago. And we continue to be very willing to invest in that. But again, the thing to keep in mind here is that we do have the model where we actually see what long-term profitability looks like. We're just in a mode right now where we just have too many attractive investment opportunities to drop that to the bottom line."

In general, our ROI in the various channels has been fairly consistent this year versus last year. The amount that we can bid in certain geographies such as Europe has gone down on a CPC basis because of foreign exchange. But our efficiencies, sometimes they'll go up, sometimes they'll go down based on the bidding dynamics of the auction on a local basis. But when we look at our overall efficiency this year versus last year in the larger channels in Google, in Trip and trivago and some of the social channels, the efficiencies haven't changed much. What we do look for is channels that are significantly, call it, new customer acquisition channels. And then our capability on moving those new customers into repeat customers through, call it, direct channels. The more we are able to convert those customers, the higher kind of toll we're willing to pay for those new customers. And it's been a formula that has been going on for a while and it's pretty comfortable. So I'd say right now, things are pretty stable. The only, I'd say mutable -- notable new factory is that the mobile channels for us are beginning to become more affordable, so to speak. We have to call it, 2, 3 years ago when we are bidding into mobile. We have to go in at substantial loss in order to build up volume, in order to test and learn, in order to gather data so that we could optimize our products. Those losses now are -- have been significantly mitigated. And while we are still in investment mode on mobile, it's become a -- it's a nice story on a year-on-year basis for us."

And that opens up a bunch of opportunities that go beyond what we said on the call initially, which was really access to our global hotel footprints, access to our technology platform potentially and reduction of some corporate costs. And really, what's opened up now is that once Orbitz and Cheap Tickets are on the Brand Expedia platform, not only do they get access and get to ride on the test and learn machine that Dara has spoken about frequently around just all the testing we do and the product getting better and better, but they instantly get access to our global footprint, of not only just global hotels, but air, car, vacation packages activities, et cetera. So the product envelope gets widen. The other pieces of this, though, or as we've dug into the business, we've seen that they did have, and they spoke about it, fraud and chargeback problems. That's something that we can help them with instantly as part of the program. We do have a global customer operations team, which has truly global scale and has huge amounts of efficiency benefits. They will immediately go on to that. And then the cherry on top of all of this, as Dara said, is that they do have some great technology around some of the air technology they built, some of their loyalty technology that we can really use to make our overall product better as well. So those are all the things of that add up. Of course, we don't know the exact amount yet. We're not ready to update the exact amount.

In terms of growth differential between bookings and revenue, listen, the big driver there continues to be what we've been doing on the hotel side, is reflected in our revenue per room night. Big chunk of that is foreign exchange. But also, just the deliberate margin reductions we're doing. So as I said to Mark on the kickoff question, I think we're really well into 2017 before we expect to see those pressures abate. And I think, at that point, you could expect to see those growth rates converge. And then I would also say the bigger that trivago gets, that can be a tailwind for it as well. Because of course, they're not in gross bookings at all, they're just a net add to revenue."

On China, it's really too soon to tell as to how the Ctrip and Qunar transaction will affect, how those respective businesses are run. We think -- we -- our admiration for the Ctrip team has only increased with that deal. We think it's strategically super, super smart. James and Jane and team are clearly executing, not only well on the ground, but also strategically. And I think you also heard that the changes in the one-child policy that, I think, James supported for a long time. So that team is executing well on a number of fronts. We have a very strong relationship with Ctrip as part of the eLong deal, with eLong. And also, we've been doing business with Qunar as well for a long time on outbound business. So we think that our outbound volumes will continue with them. It's just too hard to tell at this point, as to whether the deal that was announced will have any effect on those volumes. We don't think so, but you never know until you know. As far as inbound volume goes, I'd say the same thing, there's plenty of inbound volume going into China as well. We haven't seen any material change, but since the announcement. But it really is early at this point. As far as the growth in repeat customers, we don't disclose a bunch of data there, but I would certainly confirm that the growth rate of our repeat customers, if we look at it this year versus where we were 3, 4 years ago, it's much more healthy than it had been. The -- and it's a natural factor and that we're bringing in more new customers from the variable channels. And so there's a mathematical factor and that they -- a certain percentage of them turn into repeat customers. And the activity that we have in our core product, loyalty, et cetera, is also improving our repeat rates, which is a very nice contributor to, call it, the core profit engine of the company. So the trends that we see there are certainly good trends and it's something that we're much more focused on now than where we were, call it, 3, 4 years ago. 3, 4 years ago was kind of about product conversion reaching into variable channels. Now it's not only those machines but also increasing our supply base and then increasing our repeat customer base as well. 
And then I think you asked a question on conversion as well. Conversion continues to be a positive factor. We don't disclose how positive one way or the other, but it continues to be a nice tailwind for the business."

At this point, we are more focused on our core hotel product. It's kind of order of operations. And as you've seen this year, we have accelerated bringing in incremental new hotel inventory.

And what we've found and our hotel partners have found is that the better inventory they put into the marketplace, the better they perform. And they are completely free to do what they want. What we've seen is that hotels want volume. And in general, there's kind of a good self-reinforcing mechanism going on. And our marketplace, as you know by our volumes, has gone stronger. Our relationships with our hotel partners, in general, has gotten better. And when we look at the quality of our inventory, the quality of our inventory has increased, not decreased, since some of these issues have come up. So we absolutely want to be supplier-friendly.

But our APAC-to-APAC business, our Europe-to-Europe business, our in-country business, is the strongest segment of our business on a room night basis.

We talk about reviews and how it affects our conversion. Review used to be something that was only in TripAdvisor bailiwick. But right now, it's a big part of TripAdvisor. But it's something that's core to our product. Just like it's something that's core to their product. They are more involved in the booking path. You've seen us and various players test with meta-like product on the OTA paths. So I think a lot of these experiences are getting melded together. This is an industry that -- we had a young person who recently joined our company, and I like to spend some time with them. And he said, ""God, your industry has so many people competing with each other and working -- there's more co-opetition in your industry that I've ever seen.""

Welcome to Expedia's Financial Results Conference Call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. Pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations.
The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, October 29, 2015, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise the information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which is previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dara."

Third quarter was another strong one for Expedia, building on the very good results we saw in the first half of the year. It all starts with the unit growth, and ours was excellent. Room night growth of 36%, air tickets up 31% and car days up 30% year-over-year. Excluding Orbitz, gross bookings grew 18%, revenue was up 15% and adjusted EBITDA grew 17% with a performance nicely above what we'd expected when we last spoke. Note, too, that we achieved these result despite considerable foreign exchange, revenue margin and deal expense headwinds. Our teams are executing well.
Let me quickly cover a few other key matters that I'm sure of -- are of interest to all of you before handing it over to Mark. We are pleased to have closed the Orbitz transaction on September 17. The teams immediately began integration planning, working quickly to determine how best to bring these 2 leading travel companies together. As we said before, Orbitz Worldwide is a global business. And as such, is significantly more complex than our prior integrations. The bulk of the integration work is expected to take place over the next 9 months with certain businesses such as Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business, pushing out to a year or more.
That said, we're off to a strong start and the teams are working hard to bring the companies together as quickly and as efficiently as possible, making sure that our travelers and supplier distribution partners are all taken care of in the process.
We've decided to move the Orbitz.com and Cheap Tickets businesses onto the Brand Expedia platform, and we'll look to look for leverage opportunities across the Orbitz portfolio of brands. Mark will cover the near-term financial expectations for the Orbitz business in his remarks. 
Our hotel supply position continues to improve. And this year, we added 14,000 properties to our inventory, now up 29% year-over-year. We continue to invest in people, processes and technology across our supply organization and are on-boarding new hotels in record time at higher quality than we ever have. We expect to see some variation and seasonality quarter-to-quarter and expect property additions in Q4 to outpace Q3. We continue to have aggressive plans for property growth over the long term.
Now I'm sure you have questions regarding any potential impacts arising from recent developments in the TripAdvisor Instant Book product. To the extent that Priceline's participation accelerates Instant Book global penetration, we would anticipate additional volume pressure in the TripAdvisor channel. While certainly not a positive, TripAdvisor has been a shrinking share of our overall demand pool for some time. Note, too, that TripAdvisor is one of our lower margin channels so the impact on profitably will most likely be muted. Lastly, I will tell you that we're very happy to have trivago, one of the fastest-growing major global hotel meta-brands as part of our family. You've seen us invest aggressively in that brand and should expect the same moving forward.
Now a fundamental part of our strategy is to continue to develop our marketing and product efforts relating to our proprietary direct channels. There are 3 areas that I'd like to highlight today: Loyalty, mobile and attach. 
On loyalty, we continue to see good progress in terms of customer loyalty and repeat behavior. The Hotels.com rewards loyalty program, which recently surpassed the 20 million member milestone, continues to see strong growth and in fact, is one of the fastest-growing marketing channels for that brand. Our Expedia Plus rewards program now has over 12 million members and has launched in 27 countries just this year with 2 more to come by year end.
Turning to mobile. Mobile web for us is about new customer acquisition and app is about cementing those new customers into loyal repeat users. We see great traction in both channels, especially on the conversion on product side with our OTA brands seeing a range of 40% to 60% of traffic and 20% to 40% of transactions booked on mobile overall. I think it's safe to say that mobile has transitioned from being a profit headwind to a key component of our core offerings and a channel and product where we see significant potential going forward.
Last and certainly not least, we have in our portfolio now the preeminent full-service OTA brands, such as Brand Expedia, Travelocity, Hotwire, Wotif, Orbitz, Cheap Tickets and ebookers, and that means lots of air shoppers. Today, not including Orbitz, we see over 7.5 billion annual air searches, which is likely to increase over time and drive real opportunities to upsell into ancillary air product and fair offerings, as well as cross sell into hotels, apartments, vacation rentals, rental cars, car hire, local tours and activities, insurance and more. We've just scratched the surface here in an area where we believe we have a substantial lead and a strategic advantage. Next on the agenda is to execute this very same playbook with rail. We're coding up a new rail product as we speak, which we plan to launch next year.
The vast majority of our profits come from our direct channels and efforts like these represent the strategic growth drivers of the company now and moving forward. We've had a terrific year so far and I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for all of their hard work for a job well done. A tremendous effort is going into improving our capabilities in our business each and every day. With that, I'll hand it to Mark."
25915843,306992161,886555,"Expedia Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started.

We sold our 62% stake in eLong on May 22, and financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and to focus on the parts of the business that are ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia Inc. results, excluding eLong. 
The overall trajectory of the business remains strong with the third quarter results broadly consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the year, strength across our breadth of leading brands and across geographies continue with rare exception. Our core OTA segments, trivago and Egencia, are all having solid years with strong execution and good financial results.
Top line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remained strong for all of our major brands relative to first half growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 36% year-over-year, a slight acceleration from 35% last quarter. The inorganic impact from recent acquisitions added approximately 8 percentage points to global room night growth in Q3.
Note that due to purchase accounting rules, we don't recognize revenue or the related room night volume from acquisitions, which was booked prior to the close date. And therefore, the impact on hotel revenue and room night growth from Orbitz was de minimus. Domestic room nights grew 25% in Q3 while international room nights were up 50%. Revenue per room night was down approximately 15% this quarter while ADRs were down 6%. These metrics are similar to those we've reported in Q2 and the factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for a while. 
Foreign currency accounted for a little more than half of the decline in revenue per room night, while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and to a lesser extent, the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest. We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale.
Air revenue grew 19% on ticket growth of 31%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 9%. We continue to see fast ticket growth for Brand Expedia on the back of the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture and the benefit of innovating on the platform. In addition, Orbitz contributed 6 percentage points to air ticket growth this quarter. 
Excluding all inorganic impacts, air revenue would have grown 4% on ticket growth of 19%. Our Advertising & Media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, continued growing nicely, with trivago growing stand-alone revenue, 27%, or approximately 49% currency neutral. Media Solutions also grew at a healthy rate and Orbitz contributed 2 percentage points to add media growth this quarter. We continue to drive to a P&L that reflects aggressive sales and marketing investment around the world to expand our global reach and drive long-term growth, while gaining scale and leverage and other key expense categories.
Excluding the impact from Orbitz, the P&L we delivered in Q3 was consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing growing a bit faster than revenue, with cost of revenue, technology and content and G&A growing slower providing leverage. Importantly, our results for Q3 also include the layering in of the Orbitz stand-alone financials for the 14 days of the quarter that we own the business. As we told you to expect on our Q2 call, the impact from Orbitz on adjusted EBITDA was indeed negative in Q3, primarily as a result of purchase accounting impacts, which when taken with approximately $7 million of deal and integration costs resulted in a negative impact of approximately $17 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. At the top line, Orbitz contributed $421 million of gross bookings and $19 million of revenue.
Now I'd like to cover our financial expectations for full year 2015. I will give some color on our expectations, both excluding the impact of the Orbitz transactions, or an apple-to-apples basis with prior guidance, as well as including the impact of Orbitz, so you can fully understand the relevant impacts.
Given performance to date and the trends we are seeing, we are now forecasting full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding eLong, of 12% to 15%. On an apples-to-apples basis, relative to prior guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong and excluding all impacts of the Orbitz transaction in Q3 and Q4, we are forecasting full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth to come in near the high end of that range.
On the other hand, including all impacts of Orbitz for both Q3 and Q4, which were not included in our prior guidance, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of our range. In total, we expect a full year negative adjusted EBITDA impact from Orbitz of over $32 million with approximately $15 million coming in the fourth quarter. This includes integrated related costs, as well as Orbitz operating results, which, as mentioned, will be negatively impacted by purchase accounting rules.
Although we plan to give you more color on our Q4 call regarding the likely impact of Orbitz for 2016, I'm able to share some additional perspective today. Based on the current trajectory of Orbitz on a standalone basis, we believe the business would have delivered full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA of roughly $135 million, which we think is likely lower than Street expectations. However, with the benefit of the more detailed integration planning we've been able to do since the closing of the transaction, we now have a better view on synergy realization timelines, as well as run rate synergy potential. 
Though there's still much more work to do and details to iron out, what I can tell you is that we now believe that there is meaningful upside to the $75 million in run rate synergies that we projected at the time we announced the transaction. We expect these synergies to layer in slowly in the first half of the year, ramping to near run rate by the end of 2016.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

Can you just give us the apples-to-apples comparison versus last year -- last quarter, i.e., ex acquisitions, what that growth rate would have been?

With respect to room night growth, I'd say, listen, on an apples-to-apples basis, organic around 28% really for both quarters, this quarter and last quarter. So we really see a really consistency and the strength of just the core business. Dara, you want to take the Airbnb?"

It's -- we don't see it in a business. It's not affecting us directly at all. If anything, we think that Airbnb may be getting a new class of consumer into travel. It's typically a lower price point. It appeals to millennials, and we think that, based on different occasions, sometimes some consumers will opt for rental-type inventory and sometimes they will opt for hotels. And we think the hotel product is a great product and it certainly shows up in our numbers. That said, it is adding supply into the market, into the lodging marketplace. And that supply is addressable to a certain portion of the population. So our belief is that it will put pricing pressure in certain markets where you see a significant amount of Airbnb inventory. We have heard sporadically from some of our market managers that there are certain periods that would be absolute peak periods that -- where a town would totally sell out, where it's not quite selling out, and actually, that translates into good news for us because we wind up having hotel inventory to sell and market to our consumers during a time where previously, we wouldn't have that inventory. So, so far, when we talk to, call it, the crew on the ground who really knows what's going on in the business, they view it as a positive versus a negative. It's clearly product that's important for certain group of people. So we will look to build out our rental product over time. First order of businesses is the traditional hotel product, but we are adding apartment-type product, and we'll continue to add it. I think, incrementally, it'll become more important part of our mix next year and going into the following years."

First, OTAs have been around 15 years, and yet you're growing domestic room nights 25%. Can you talk about the penetration of online bookings in the U.S., and then we'll think about international later. But how it's going and how much room is still there? And then, secondly, the tech platform, I believe that we're 2 or 3 years into it, Priceline arguably was 9 years into their purchases of some of the Booking.com platforms. But how much more room do you have to improve conversion or other things with that tech platform? Or do think you might be running out of room?"

The numbers that we see as far as online penetration are in the 40%,",569,"Sure. As far as the OTAs go, I just think that anyone now who is looking to travel or looking to research or book travel is going to look at OTAs. And I think we have become mainstream. The numbers that we see as far as online penetration are in the 40%, 50% range. And while there is some -- you have to believe in the law of large numbers that online penetration is going to slow down, I think our brands are becoming more relevant. Our supply is getting better. Our sites are getting better and faster. Our service is improving. So it really does look like we are taking share from some of the smaller players who can't make the kinds of marketing and technology and customer service and loyalty investments that we can. So I think, at this point, it is a game of not just online penetration increasing, but also our gaining share versus a number of other players. Keep in mind that we are still just a single-digit percentage of total room nights in the U.S. So we think -- we really think we have a long way to go. And the teams are executing well. This is the teams that are accomplishing this. On the tech platform, we look pretty carefully at what we call our win rate. We are obviously -- we're running thousands of tests that are powered by thousands of hypotheses by our product teams. And we look at our win rate versus, call it, neutral or a loss rate. We look at the average size of win. In other words, if we have a win, is it -- what does that look like on a percentage basis versus the base case? And our win rate and the average size of win continue at rates that are pretty darn attractive and conversion continues to be a tailwind. So while theoretically, we think that there's a high-water mark that we might be hitting, we haven't seen it. I do think that our increasing our supply and increasing the quality of supply and just the number of hotels is kind of a new tailwind that we hadn't seen in the past couple of years. So I think the conversion is not only a factor of the product and the tech platform, but it's also a factor of the good work that our supply team is doing. I would add just one thing about the tech platform, is that -- one thing that really touched me about the tech platform is, step one, was the platform was about the user experience, was really about the website experience that the consumer saw. That tech platform now is going down the stack. And for example, our hotelier experience, the tools that we are offering our hoteliers are improving rapidly. We are arming them up with so much more data where hoteliers can look up how many people are looking at their hotel. How many people looked at their hotel and booked on a rival hotel? They're able to do it on a website. They're able to do it through an app, et cetera. This tech platform is -- the benefits that we're getting from the tech platform are much broader than just the consumer, and we think that we're just getting started on the other parts that typically don't get headlines, but are quite valuable."

As far as the Instant Book product goes, we have worked with Google very closely on their hotel product, various parts of their hotel product. And I think we talked about it previously that it was our intention to test and learn with Google on their -- on the book on Google. We thought the branding, the clarity that they sent to consumers was right on. So it's our intent to test and learn with them, and we will let the data and what our consumers tell us, essentially drive the long-term decision there. As far as Priceline's participation on trivago, it's unknown. trivago is now pretty aggressively testing out a product that looks like Instant Book. We think that there's a lot more clarity, again, on where the consumer is booking their travel. trivago is simply trying to optimize that path versus, let's say, gather consumer data to upsell them other stuff. So they're very, very focused on just optimizing that consumer experience in that moment. The test is happening in Germany. And so far, we like what we see. And many of Expedia brands are participating. And I think the trivago team is excited about rolling out that product. We'll see if Priceline participates or not."

So very promising. I will take your China outbound question. I'd say no major change for us. It's hard with a country that big, which is growing travel so fast, for us to perceive different movements either way. Again, we are participating in China, booked through our Expedia affiliate network business that powers a lot of the leading players in China with our international hotel inventory also through Hotels.com, also through Egencia and trivago is tipping it's -- putting it's toe in the water, I would say, in China. And we are looking forward to implementing the broader commercial relationship that we have with Ctrip through the back part of this year and the beginning part of next year. And so we do think -- at least for us, anyways, China outbound remains a very big opportunity, and we continue to like what we see there."

I mean, the 2 that we are nearing the end of that process with our, of course, Travelocity where we did the tech integration really through last year, and we started the marketing integration that you speak of this year. I mean, we are probably 3 quarters the way through the process with Travelocity right now, and we like what we see. That's a brand that's continued to be a growth brand, lapping over everything. So very encouraging. Wotif is probably a quarter the way through. It's on the platform. We're training the marketing models. They've just launched a brand-new brand campaign in Australia, which we're pretty excited about. It's one of their biggest ever. And that's really aimed at returning that iconic brand to iconic status. And I think, listen, those are good parallels for Orbitz generally. That said, as Dara said in his prepared remarks, Orbitz is a bigger business. Orbitz is a more global business. Even if you look at Orbitz and Cheap Tickets, I mean, these are businesses that have been, I would say, compared with Wotif or compared with the Travelocity, a little bit closer to optimization already. And so I think for the Orbitz business, even though the playbook is the same, the caveat is that we could see when we flip it over to the platform, actually, a moment where conversion might degrade and we actually have a little bit more of an optimization period to go through. So I think that's the caveat that we really don't know the answer to yet. But aside from that, I think it is very similar playbook."

So that is a feature that we will look to build on our platforms, but it's their idea, their conception, et cetera. And there are technologies that they built around air search, around connectivity with various providers. Those are, again, super interesting technologies that they've built. The talent there is really good. So I think while Orbitz will move on to the Expedia platform, we're going to look for Orbitz to improve the Expedia platform as well."

As far as air queries go, in general, air CPCs tend to be lower than hotel CPCs and air revenue per unit tends to be significantly lower than hotel revenue per unit. We have not to date aggressively participated in variable channels in air because of the revenue and profitability per unit that air has had historically. We think that we are in a position now to participate more aggressively in some of these variable channels and the growth rates that we see in those variable channels are very significant, but off of small basis. So air tends to be much more of a direct business. So the attach revenue tends to be a higher-margin revenue, so to speak, but we're very much looking forward to participating more aggressively in variable channels on the air side. There are some variable channels, such as meta, in the U.S. on the air side where we can't participate based on some of the kind of deals, agreements that the meta channels have with some of our air partners. So while I think there's growth in the variable channels for air, it's not going to quite look like what we see in the hotel product, but it is nice upside versus where we are now."

And what we see there is a margin structure that quite frankly, looks a lot like TripAdvisor. Essentially, it's a big media business that's growing nicely with attractive margins. The phase we're in right now however continues to be that we're able to take those profits and put them into new opportunities. The story continues to be told in the U.S, Canada and Australia. The growth rates in the U.S. continue to be very impressive and U.S. awareness is now up to one in every second American that's actually heard of trivago, coming from a point of obscurity in 2012. So we're really still in that investment mode. We do think that the U.S. market will start to mature probably into next year. But then we look at some of the other markets, where they've entered recently. I mean, Japan, for example, we're seeing revenue actually quadruple year-over-year; fivefold in Brazil; in the Middle East, it's sevenfold in some places. So there still continues to be pockets of real great opportunity for trivago. And we continue to be very willing to invest in that. But again, the thing to keep in mind here is that we do have the model where we can actually see what long-term profitability looks like. We're just in a mode right now where we just have too many attractive investment opportunities to drop that to the bottom line."

In general, our ROI in the various channels has been fairly consistent this year versus last year. The amount that we can bid in certain geographies such as Europe has gone down on a CPC basis because of foreign exchange. But our efficiencies, sometimes they'll go up, sometimes they'll go down based on the bidding dynamics of the auction on a local basis. But when we look at our overall efficiency this year versus last year in the larger channels in Google, in Trip and trivago and some of the social channels, the efficiencies haven't changed much. What we do look for is channels that are significantly, call it, new customer acquisition channels. And then our capability on moving those new customers into repeat customers through, call it, direct channels. The more we are able to convert those customers, the higher kind of toll we're willing to pay for those new customers. And it's been a formula that has been going on for a while and it's pretty comfortable. So I'd say right now, things are pretty stable. The only, I'd say mutable -- notable new factor is that the mobile channels for us are beginning to become more affordable, so to speak. We had to call it, 2, 3 years ago when we were bidding into mobile. We had to go in at substantial loss in order to build up volume, in order to test and learn, in order to gather data so that we could optimize our products. Those losses now are -- have been significantly mitigated. And while we are still in investment mode on mobile, it's become a -- it's a nice story on a year-on-year basis for us."

And that opens up a bunch of opportunities that go beyond what we said on the call initially, which was really access to our global hotel footprint, access to our technology platform potentially and reduction of some corporate costs. And really, what's opened up now is that once Orbitz and Cheap Tickets are on the Brand Expedia platform, not only do they get access and get to ride on the test and learn machine that Dara has spoken about frequently around just all the testing we do and the product getting better and better, but they instantly get access to our global footprint, of not only just global hotels, but air, car, vacation packages, activities, et cetera. So the product envelope gets widened. The other pieces of this, though, are that as we've dug into the business, we've seen that they did have, and they spoke about it, fraud and chargeback problems. That's something that we can help them with instantly as part of the program. We do have a global customer operations team, which has truly global scale and has huge amounts of efficiency benefits. They will immediately go on to that. And then the cherry on top of all of this, as Dara said, is that they do have some great technology around some of the air technology they built, some of their loyalty technology that we can really use to make our overall product better as well. So those are all the things that add up. Of course, we don't know the exact amount yet. We're not ready to update the exact amount.

There is some proforma data in the Q that you can see tomorrow that can give you a little bit more color. In terms of growth differential between bookings and revenue, listen, the big driver there continues to be what we've been doing on the hotel side, as reflected in our revenue per room night. Big chunk of that is foreign exchange. But also, just the deliberate margin reductions we're doing. So as I said to Mark on the kickoff question, I think we're really well into 2017 before we expect to see those pressures abate. And I think, at that point, you could expect to see those growth rates converge. And then I would also say the bigger that trivago gets, that can be a tailwind for it as well. Because of course, they're not in gross bookings at all, they're just a net add to revenue."

James and Jane and team are clearly executing, not only well on the ground, but also strategically. And I think you also heard that the changes in the one-child policy that, I think, James supported for a long time. So that team is executing well on a number of fronts. We have a very strong relationship with Ctrip as part of the eLong deal, with eLong. And also, we've been doing business with Qunar as well for a long time on the outbound business. So we think that our outbound volumes will continue with them. It's just too hard to tell at this point, as to whether the deal that was announced will have any effect on those volumes. We don't think so, but you never know until you know. As far as inbound volume goes, I'd say the same thing, there's plenty of inbound volume going into China as well. We haven't seen any material change since the announcement. But it really is early at this point. As far as the growth in repeat customers, we don't disclose a bunch of data there, but I would certainly confirm that the growth rate of our repeat customers, if we look at it this year versus where we were 3, 4 years ago, it's much more healthy than it had been. The -- and it's a natural factor in that we're bringing in more new customers from the variable channels. And so there's a mathematical factor and that they -- a certain percentage of them turn into repeat customers. And the activity that we have in our core product, loyalty, et cetera, is also improving our repeat rates, which is a very nice contributor to, call it, the core profit engine of the company. So the trends that we see there are certainly good trends and it's something that we're much more focused on now than where we were, call it, 3, 4 years ago. 3, 4 years ago was kind of about product conversion reaching into variable channels. Now it's not only those machines but also increasing our supply base and then increasing our repeat customer base as well. 
And then I think you asked a question on conversion as well. Conversion continues to be a positive factor. We don't disclose how positive one way or the other, but it continues to be a nice tailwind for the business."

And the product, as you know now is available in mobile. We feature the product on TV. And this is, as far as the technology revamp, et cetera, this product was really revamped and launched into the marketplace based on the new tech platform, really, this year. And the team has been optimizing aggressively. And it shows in the results. And I think we're very early. We think we've got many, many years going forward of our tours product improving substantially and we're just starting. But I'm really excited for the team, and I can tell you the team is pretty pumped right now. As far as our vacation rental strategy, we touched on it. We think that it's an important product. At this point, we are more focused on our core hotel product. It's kind of order of operations. And as you've seen this year, we have accelerated bringing in incremental new hotel inventory. And as we go down the path, especially going into next year, we think that we will start adding more vacation rental apartments, et cetera, inventory, because we do think that fundamentally, it's a type of lodging that clearly customers are interested in. And if customers are interested in, we will look to offer it to them."

And what we've found and our hotel partners have found is that the better inventory they put into the marketplace, the better they perform. And they are completely free to do what they want. What we've seen is that hotels want volume. And in general, there's kind of a good self-reinforcing mechanism going on. And our marketplace, as you know by our volumes, has gone stronger. Our relationship with our hotel partners, in general, has gotten better. And when we look at the quality of our inventory, the quality of our inventory has increased, not decreased, since some of these issues have come up. So we absolutely want to be supplier-friendly.

And you're not going to have kind of these clear delineations between experiences the way that you had. Review is something that's very big on our site right now. We talk about our review content. We talk about reviews and how it affects our conversion. Review used to be something that was only in TripAdvisor's bailiwick. Now, it's a big part of TripAdvisor. But it's something that's core to our product. Just like it's something that's core to their product. They are more involved in the booking path. You've seen us and various players test with meta-like product on the OTA paths. So I think a lot of these experiences are getting melded together. This is an industry that -- we had a young person who recently joined our company, and I like to spend some time with them. And he said, ""God, your industry has so many people competing with each other and working -- there's more co-opetition in your industry that I've ever seen."" And sometimes, when you're in the middle of the industry, you kind of don't have that perspective. A lot of these experiences are coming together.

I think that it has been typically under invested in as far as online travel agencies go because there isn't much money in the product itself. But I think that as we have built up our attach platforms, having context after where the consumer is going, I think is going to give us a lot of upsell opportunity. And then increasing the frequency of touches with our travelers, we think is going to really increase loyalty, especially on the mobile side, both of which are really good things.

The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, October 29, 2015, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise the information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which is previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dara."

Third quarter was another strong one for Expedia, building on the very good results we saw in the first half of the year. It all starts with the unit growth, and ours was excellent. Room night growth of 36%, air tickets up 31% and car days up 30% year-over-year. Excluding Orbitz, gross bookings grew 18%, revenue was up 15% and adjusted EBITDA grew 17% with a performance nicely above what we'd expected when we last spoke. Note, too, that we achieved these result despite considerable foreign exchange, revenue margin and deal expense headwinds. Our teams are executing well.
Let me quickly cover a few other key matters that I'm sure of -- are of interest to all of you before handing it over to Mark. We are pleased to have closed the Orbitz transaction on September 17. The teams immediately began integration planning, working quickly to determine how best to bring these 2 leading travel companies together. As we said before, Orbitz Worldwide is a global business. And as such, is significantly more complex than our prior integrations. The bulk of the integration work is expected to take place over the next 9 months with certain businesses such as Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business, pushing out to a year or more.
That said, we're off to a strong start and the teams are working hard to bring the companies together as quickly and as efficiently as possible, making sure that our travelers and supplier distribution partners are all taken care of in the process.
We've decided to move the Orbitz.com and Cheap Tickets businesses onto the Brand Expedia platform, and we'll look to look for leverage opportunities across the Orbitz portfolio of brands. Mark will cover the near-term financial expectations for the Orbitz business in his remarks. 
Our hotel supply position continues to improve. And this year, we added 14,000 properties to our inventory, now up 29% year-over-year. We continue to invest in people, processes and technology across our supply organization and are on-boarding new hotels in record time at higher quality than we ever have. We expect to see some variation and seasonality quarter-to-quarter and expect property additions in Q4 to outpace Q3. We continue to have aggressive plans for property growth over the long term.
Now I'm sure you have questions regarding any potential impacts arising from recent developments in the TripAdvisor Instant Book product. To the extent that Priceline's participation accelerates Instant Book global penetration, we would anticipate additional volume pressure in the TripAdvisor channel. While certainly not a positive, TripAdvisor has been a shrinking share of our overall demand pool for some time. Note, too, that TripAdvisor is one of our lower margin channels so the impact on profitably will most likely be muted. Lastly, I will tell you that we're very happy to have trivago, one of the fastest-growing major global hotel meta-brands as part of our family. You've seen us invest aggressively in that brand and should expect the same moving forward.
Now a fundamental part of our strategy is to continue to develop our marketing and product efforts relating to our proprietary direct channels. There are 3 areas that I'd like to highlight today: Loyalty, mobile and attach. 
On loyalty, we continue to see good progress in terms of customer loyalty and repeat behavior. The Hotels.com rewards loyalty program, which recently surpassed the 20 million member milestone, continues to see strong growth and in fact, is one of the fastest-growing marketing channels for that brand. Our Expedia Plus rewards program now has over 12 million members and has launched in 27 countries just this year with 2 more to come by year end.
Turning to mobile. Mobile web for us is about new customer acquisition and app is about cementing those new customers into loyal repeat users. We see great traction in both channels, especially on the conversion on product side with our OTA brands seeing a range of 40% to 60% of traffic and 20% to 40% of transactions booked on mobile overall. I think it's safe to say that mobile has transitioned from being a profit headwind to a key component of our core offerings and a channel and product where we see significant potential going forward.
Last and certainly not least, we have in our portfolio now the preeminent full-service OTA brands, such as Brand Expedia, Travelocity, Hotwire, Wotif, Orbitz, Cheap Tickets and ebookers, and that means lots of air shoppers. Today, not including Orbitz, we see over 7.5 billion annual air searches, which is likely to increase over time and drive real opportunities to upsell into ancillary air product and fair offerings, as well as cross sell into hotels, apartments, vacation rentals, rental cars, car hire, local tours and activities, insurance and more. We've just scratched the surface here in an area where we believe we have a substantial lead and a strategic advantage. Next on the agenda is to execute this very same playbook with rail. We're coding up a new rail product as we speak, which we plan to launch next year.
The vast majority of our profits come from our direct channels and efforts like these represent the strategic growth drivers of the company now and moving forward. We've had a terrific year so far and I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for all of their hard work for a job well done. A tremendous effort is going into improving our capabilities in our business each and every day. With that, I'll hand it to Mark."
25915843,306992161,887509,"Expedia Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started.

To aid in comparability and to focus on th",1043,"Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started. We sold our 62% stake in eLong on May 22, and financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and to focus on the parts of the business that are ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia Inc. results, excluding eLong. 
The overall trajectory of the business remains strong with the third quarter results broadly consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the year, strength across our breadth of leading brands and across geographies continue with rare exception. Our core OTA segments, trivago and Egencia, are all having solid years with strong execution and good financial results.
Top line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remained strong for all of our major brands relative to first half growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 36% year-over-year, a slight acceleration from 35% last quarter. The inorganic impact from recent acquisitions added approximately 8 percentage points to global room night growth in Q3.
Note that due to purchase accounting rules, we don't recognize revenue or the related room night volume from acquisitions, which was booked prior to the close date. And therefore, the impact on hotel revenue and room night growth from Orbitz was de minimus. Domestic room nights grew 25% in Q3 while international room nights were up 50%. Revenue per room night was down approximately 15% this quarter while ADRs were down 6%. These metrics are similar to those we've reported in Q2 and the factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for a while. 
Foreign currency accounted for a little more than half of the decline in revenue per room night, while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and to a lesser extent, the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest. We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale.
Air revenue grew 19% on ticket growth of 31%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 9%. We continue to see fast ticket growth for Brand Expedia on the back of the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture and the benefit of innovating on the platform. In addition, Orbitz contributed 6 percentage points to air ticket growth this quarter. 
Excluding all inorganic impacts, air revenue would have grown 4% on ticket growth of 19%. Our Advertising & Media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, continued growing nicely, with trivago growing stand-alone revenue, 27%, or approximately 49% currency neutral. Media Solutions also grew at a healthy rate and Orbitz contributed 2 percentage points to add media growth this quarter. We continue to drive to a P&L that reflects aggressive sales and marketing investment around the world to expand our global reach and drive long-term growth, while gaining scale and leverage and other key expense categories.
Excluding the impact from Orbitz, the P&L we delivered in Q3 was consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing growing a bit faster than revenue, with cost of revenue, technology and content and G&A growing slower providing leverage. Importantly, our results for Q3 also include the layering in of the Orbitz stand-alone financials for the 14 days of the quarter that we own the business. As we told you to expect on our Q2 call, the impact from Orbitz on adjusted EBITDA was indeed negative in Q3, primarily as a result of purchase accounting impacts, which when taken with approximately $7 million of deal and integration costs resulted in a negative impact of approximately $17 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. At the top line, Orbitz contributed $421 million of gross bookings and $19 million of revenue.
Now I'd like to cover our financial expectations for full year 2015. I will give some color on our expectations, both excluding the impact of the Orbitz transactions, or an apple-to-apples basis with prior guidance, as well as including the impact of Orbitz, so you can fully understand the relevant impacts.
Given performance to date and the trends we are seeing, we are now forecasting full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding eLong, of 12% to 15%. On an apples-to-apples basis, relative to prior guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong and excluding all impacts of the Orbitz transaction in Q3 and Q4, we are forecasting full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth to come in near the high end of that range.
On the other hand, including all impacts of Orbitz for both Q3 and Q4, which were not included in our prior guidance, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of our range. In total, we expect a full year negative adjusted EBITDA impact from Orbitz of over $32 million with approximately $15 million coming in the fourth quarter. This includes integrated related costs, as well as Orbitz operating results, which, as mentioned, will be negatively impacted by purchase accounting rules.
Although we plan to give you more color on our Q4 call regarding the likely impact of Orbitz for 2016, I'm able to share some additional perspective today. Based on the current trajectory of Orbitz on a standalone basis, we believe the business would have delivered full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA of roughly $135 million, which we think is likely lower than Street expectations. However, with the benefit of the more detailed integration planning we've been able to do since the closing of the transaction, we now have a better view on synergy realization timelines, as well as run rate synergy potential. 
Though there's still much more work to do and details to iron out, what I can tell you is that we now believe that there is meaningful upside to the $75 million in run rate synergies that we projected at the time we announced the transaction. We expect these synergies to layer in slowly in the first half of the year, ramping to near run rate by the end of 2016.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

It's -- we don't see it in a business. It's not affecting us directly at all. If anything, we think that Airbnb may be getting a new class of consumer into travel. It's typically a lower price point. It appeals to millennials, and we think that, based on different occasions, sometimes some consumers will opt for rental-type inventory and sometimes they will opt for hotels. And we think the hotel product is a great product and it certainly shows up in our numbers. That said, it is adding supply into the market, into the lodging marketplace. And that supply is addressable to a certain portion of the population. So our belief is that it will put pricing pressure in certain markets where you see a significant amount of Airbnb inventory. We have heard sporadically from some of our market managers that there are certain periods that would be absolute peak periods that -- where a town would totally sell out, where it's not quite selling out, and actually, that translates into good news for us because we wind up having hotel inventory to sell and market to our consumers during a time where previously, we wouldn't have that inventory. So, so far, when we talk to, call it, the crew on the ground who really knows what's going on in the business, they view it as a positive versus a negative. It's clearly product that's important for certain group of people. So we will look to build out our rental product over time. First order of businesses is the traditional hotel product, but we are adding apartment-type product, and we'll continue to add it. I think, incrementally, it'll become more important part of our mix next year and going into the following years."

First, OTAs have been around 15 years, and yet you're growing domestic room nights 25%. Can you talk about the penetration of online bookings in the U.S., and then we'll think about international later. But how it's going and how much room is still there? And then, secondly, the tech platform, I believe that we're 2 or 3 years into it, Priceline arguably was 9 years into their purchases of some of the Booking.com platforms. But how much more room do you have to improve conversion or other things with that tech platform? Or do think you might be running out of room?"

As far as the OTAs go, I just think that anyone now who is looking to travel or looking to research or book travel is going to look at OTAs. And I think we have become mainstream. The numbers that we see as far as online penetration are in the 40%, 50% range. And while there is some -- you have to believe in the law of large numbers that online penetration is going to slow down, I think our brands are becoming more relevant. Our supply is getting better. Our sites are getting better and faster. Our service is improving. So it really does look like we are taking share from some of the smaller players who can't make the kinds of marketing and technology and customer service and loyalty investments that we can. So I think, at this point, it is a game of not just online penetration increasing, but also our gaining share versus a number of other players. Keep in mind that we are still just a single-digit percentage of total room nights in the U.S. So we think -- we really think we have a long way to go. And the teams are executing well. This is the teams that are accomplishing this. On the tech platform, we look pretty carefully at what we call our win rate. We are obviously -- we're running thousands of tests that are powered by thousands of hypotheses by our product teams. And we look at our win rate versus, call it, neutral or a loss rate. We look at the average size of win. In other words, if we have a win, is it -- what does that look like on a percentage basis versus the base case? And our win rate and the average size of win continue at rates that are pretty darn attractive and conversion continues to be a tailwind. So while theoretically, we think that there's a high-water mark that we might be hitting, we haven't seen it. I do think that our increasing our supply and increasing the quality of supply and just the number of hotels is kind of a new tailwind that we hadn't seen in the past couple of years. So I think the conversion is not only a factor of the product and the tech platform, but it's also a factor of the good work that our supply team is doing. I would add just one thing about the tech platform, is that -- one thing that really touched me about the tech platform is, step one, was the platform was about the user experience, was really about the website experience that the consumer saw. That tech platform now is going down the stack. And for example, our hotelier experience, the tools that we are offering our hoteliers are improving rapidly. We are arming them up with so much more data where hoteliers can look up how many people are looking at their hotel. How many people looked at their hotel and booked on a rival hotel? They're able to do it on a website. They're able to do it through an app, et cetera. This tech platform is -- the benefits that we're getting from the tech platform are much broader than just the consumer, and we think that we're just getting started on the other parts that typically don't get headlines, but are quite valuable."

So it's our intent to test and learn with them, and we will let the data and what our consumers tell us, essentially drive the long-term decision there. As far as Priceline's participation on trivago, it's unknown. trivago is now pretty aggressively testing out a product that looks like Instant Book. We think that there's a lot more clarity, again, on where the consumer is booking their travel. trivago is simply trying to optimize that path versus, let's say, gather consumer data to upsell them other stuff. So they're very, very focused on just optimizing that consumer experience in that moment. The test is happening in Germany. And so far, we like what we see. And many of Expedia brands are participating. And I think the trivago team is excited about rolling out that product. We'll see if Priceline participates or not."

So very promising. I will take your China outbound question. I'd say no major change for us. It's hard with a country that big, which is growing travel so fast, for us to perceive different movements either way. Again, we are participating in China, booked through our Expedia affiliate network business that powers a lot of the leading players in China with our international hotel inventory also through Hotels.com, also through Egencia and trivago is tipping it's -- putting it's toe in the water, I would say, in China. And we are looking forward to implementing the broader commercial relationship that we have with Ctrip through the back part of this year and the beginning part of next year.

I mean, the 2 that we are nearing the end of that process with our, of course, Travelocity where we did the tech integration really through last year, and we started the marketing integration that you speak of this year. I mean, we are probably 3 quarters the way through the process with Travelocity right now, and we like what we see. That's a brand that's continued to be a growth brand, lapping over everything. So very encouraging. Wotif is probably a quarter the way through. It's on the platform. We're training the marketing models. They've just launched a brand-new brand campaign in Australia, which we're pretty excited about. It's one of their biggest ever. And that's really aimed at returning that iconic brand to iconic status. And I think, listen, those are good parallels for Orbitz generally. That said, as Dara said in his prepared remarks, Orbitz is a bigger business. Orbitz is a more global business. Even if you look at Orbitz and Cheap Tickets, I mean, these are businesses that have been, I would say, compared with Wotif or compared with the Travelocity, a little bit closer to optimization already. And so I think for the Orbitz business, even though the playbook is the same, the caveat is that we could see when we flip it over to the platform, actually, a moment where conversion might degrade and we actually have a little bit more of an optimization period to go through. So I think that's the caveat that we really don't know the answer to yet. But aside from that, I think it is very similar playbook."

As far as air queries go, in general, air CPCs tend to be lower than hotel CPCs and air revenue per unit tends to be significantly lower than hotel revenue per unit.

We think that we are in a position now to participate more aggressively in some of these variable channels and the growth rates that we see in those variable channels are very significant, but off of small basis. So air tends to be much more of a direct business. So the attach revenue tends to be a higher-margin revenue, so to speak, but we're very much looking forward to participating more aggressively in variable channels on the air side. There are some variable channels, such as meta, in the U.S. on the air side where we can't participate based on some of the kind of deals, agreements that the meta channels have with some of our air partners. So while I think there's growth in the variable channels for air, it's not going to quite look like what we see in the hotel product, but it is nice upside versus where we are now."

And what we see there is a margin structure that quite frankly, looks a lot like TripAdvisor. Essentially, it's a big media business that's growing nicely with attractive margins. The phase we're in right now however continues to be that we're able to take those profits and put them into new opportunities. The story continues to be told in the U.S, Canada and Australia. The growth rates in the U.S. continue to be very impressive and U.S. awareness is now up to one in every second American that's actually heard of trivago, coming from a point of obscurity in 2012. So we're really still in that investment mode. We do think that the U.S. market will start to mature probably into next year. But then we look at some of the other markets, where they've entered recently. I mean, Japan, for example, we're seeing revenue actually quadruple year-over-year; fivefold in Brazil; in the Middle East, it's sevenfold in some places. So there still continues to be pockets of real great opportunity for trivago. And we continue to be very willing to invest in that. But again, the thing to keep in mind here is that we do have the model where we can actually see what long-term profitability looks like. We're just in a mode right now where we just have too many attractive investment opportunities to drop that to the bottom line."

In general, our ROI in the various channels has been fairly consistent this year versus last year. The amount that we can bid in certain geographies such as Europe has gone down on a CPC basis because of foreign exchange. But our efficiencies, sometimes they'll go up, sometimes they'll go down based on the bidding dynamics of the auction on a local basis. But when we look at our overall efficiency this year versus last year in the larger channels in Google, in Trip and trivago and some of the social channels, the efficiencies haven't changed much. What we do look for is channels that are significantly, call it, new customer acquisition channels. And then our capability on moving those new customers into repeat customers through, call it, direct channels. The more we are able to convert those customers, the higher kind of toll we're willing to pay for those new customers. And it's been a formula that has been going on for a while and it's pretty comfortable. So I'd say right now, things are pretty stable. The only, I'd say mutable -- notable new factor is that the mobile channels for us are beginning to become more affordable, so to speak. We had to call it, 2, 3 years ago when we were bidding into mobile. We had to go in at substantial loss in order to build up volume, in order to test and learn, in order to gather data so that we could optimize our products. Those losses now are -- have been significantly mitigated. And while we are still in investment mode on mobile, it's become a -- it's a nice story on a year-on-year basis for us."

Listen, one of the big pivotal decisions that we made recently, which opens up incremental opportunity was the decision to put Orbitz.com and Cheaptickets.com on the Brand Expedia platform. And that opens up a bunch of opportunities that go beyond what we said on the call initially, which was really access to our global hotel footprint, access to our technology platform potentially and reduction of some corporate costs. And really, what's opened up now is that once Orbitz and Cheap Tickets are on the Brand Expedia platform, not only do they get access and get to ride on the test and learn machine that Dara has spoken about frequently around just all the testing we do and the product getting better and better, but they instantly get access to our global footprint, of not only just global hotels, but air, car, vacation packages, activities, et cetera. So the product envelope gets widened. The other pieces of this, though, are that as we've dug into the business, we've seen that they did have, and they spoke about it, fraud and chargeback problems. That's something that we can help them with instantly as part of the program. We do have a global customer operations team, which has truly global scale and has huge amounts of efficiency benefits. They will immediately go on to that. And then the cherry on top of all of this, as Dara said, is that they do have some great technology around some of the air technology they built, some of their loyalty technology that we can really use to make our overall product better as well. So those are all the things that add up. Of course, we don't know the exact amount yet. We're not ready to update the exact amount. But we do know is those things add up to what we think is a meaningful upside."

And then, as a follow-up to that, can you just give us a broad sense for how much of the synergy, maybe either using the 75 as a baseline or your revised projections, just how much would come from the revenue side on better terms from hotels or better air terms?

But again, we think we can do that plus keep the conversion benefits that sometimes get hurt when you take certain steps to stop fraud. In terms of how much from revenue, how much from cost synergies? We're not going to provide a ton of detail on that at this point. Again, we're still working through the detail. Obviously, there is a cost component around public company cost, et cetera, that we mentioned. And there are some redundant teams, if you will. But we're not really getting into too much detail. I would tell you, though, that we -- even though we think there is a cost reduction opportunity that will create synergies on paper for the deal case, it also presents a huge recruiting opportunity for us. We've got about a thousand opened position at Expedia that are -- in our base operating budget that we would guide you to. But we've just got open position and we find that Orbitz is a very talented team. We're looking to place people that may find themselves redundant, which is many of those roles as we can.

There is some proforma data in the Q that you can see tomorrow that can give you a little bit more color. In terms of growth differential between bookings and revenue, listen, the big driver there continues to be what we've been doing on the hotel side, as reflected in our revenue per room night. Big chunk of that is foreign exchange. But also, just the deliberate margin reductions we're doing. So as I said to Mark on the kickoff question, I think we're really well into 2017 before we expect to see those pressures abate. And I think, at that point, you could expect to see those growth rates converge. And then I would also say the bigger that trivago gets, that can be a tailwind for it as well. Because of course, they're not in gross bookings at all, they're just a net add to revenue."

James and Jane and team are clearly executing, not only well on the ground, but also strategically. And I think you also heard that the changes in the one-child policy that, I think, James supported for a long time. So that team is executing well on a number of fronts. We have a very strong relationship with Ctrip as part of the eLong deal, with eLong. And also, we've been doing business with Qunar as well for a long time on the outbound business. So we think that our outbound volumes will continue with them. It's just too hard to tell at this point, as to whether the deal that was announced will have any effect on those volumes. We don't think so, but you never know until you know. As far as inbound volume goes, I'd say the same thing, there's plenty of inbound volume going into China as well. We haven't seen any material change since the announcement. But it really is early at this point. As far as the growth in repeat customers, we don't disclose a bunch of data there, but I would certainly confirm that the growth rate of our repeat customers, if we look at it this year versus where we were 3, 4 years ago, it's much more healthy than it had been. The -- and it's a natural factor in that we're bringing in more new customers from the variable channels. And so there's a mathematical factor and that they -- a certain percentage of them turn into repeat customers. And the activity that we have in our core product, loyalty, et cetera, is also improving our repeat rates, which is a very nice contributor to, call it, the core profit engine of the company. So the trends that we see there are certainly good trends and it's something that we're much more focused on now than where we were, call it, 3, 4 years ago. 3, 4 years ago was kind of about product conversion reaching into variable channels. Now it's not only those machines but also increasing our supply base and then increasing our repeat customer base as well. 
And then I think you asked a question on conversion as well. Conversion continues to be a positive factor. We don't disclose how positive one way or the other, but it continues to be a nice tailwind for the business."

That said, we are seeing pretty broad organic strength in a bunch of places, Eastern Europe is strong. Africa is strong. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia. I mean, these are all places that have growth rates that are high-double digits; in some cases, it's triple digits. It's a mix of things. But just keep in mind the acquisitions do bolster that number."

We -- I'd say, we are a great platform for international travelers. But our APAC-to-APAC business, our Europe-to-Europe business, our in-country business, is the strongest segment of our business on a room night basis. On an ADR basis, that actually puts a little pressure on our ADRs, which is as you start to move into business that's less international and more domestic, you tend to move into categories that are lower ADR. So we think that this long term, this kind of shift in demand and supply is going to be a long-term room night positive, but we'll put some pressure on our ADRs. But we think, overall, that's a more healthy marketplace."

It's an analogous of -- situation to what you see in the broader industry. I would say, though, particularly one of the things that drives Expedia share gains and trivago is the fact that they are expanding into markets where we are exceptionally strong. Markets like the U.S., Canada, Australia, for example. And so that just plays naturally into our strengths. But again beyond that, our performance in trivago is dictated by the strength of our platform, the conversion benefits we're driving, as well as the capabilities of our teams and everyone -- the full teams across those functions are doing pretty darn well.

And you're not going to have kind of these clear delineations between experiences the way that you had. Review is something that's very big on our site right now. We talk about our review content. We talk about reviews and how it affects our conversion. Review used to be something that was only in TripAdvisor's bailiwick. Now, it's a big part of TripAdvisor. But it's something that's core to our product. Just like it's something that's core to their product. They are more involved in the booking path. You've seen us and various players test with meta-like product on the OTA paths. So I think a lot of these experiences are getting melded together. This is an industry that -- we had a young person who recently joined our company, and I like to spend some time with them. And he said, ""God, your industry has so many people competing with each other and working -- there's more co-opetition in your industry that I've ever seen."" And sometimes, when you're in the middle of the industry, you kind of don't have that perspective. A lot of these experiences are coming together. We don't know exactly where it's going to shake out, but we're trying to optimize for the customer experience and our partner and supply experience. And I think so far, what we're doing is working; what TripAdvisor is doing is working; clearly, what Priceline is doing is working. And I think the bigger players are going to keep growing. This is a hugely fragmented marketplace, and I do think these experiences are coming together. We just don't know exactly where it's going to shake out. Our interest is pretty simple in keeping our consumers and partners happy."

So fundamentally, rail is an incredibly important way -- a transport mechanism for consumers all over the world. It's super important in Europe. It's very important in the APAC regions. Hoping it will be more important in U.S. but it's not as large a factor in the U.S. So this is just a really important product. I think that it has been typically under invested in as far as online travel agencies go because there isn't much money in the product itself. But I think that as we have built up our attach platforms, having context after where the consumer is going, I think is going to give us a lot of upsell opportunity. And then increasing the frequency of touches with our travelers, we think is going to really increase loyalty, especially on the mobile side, both of which are really good things. So we don't know exactly where this journey is going to take us. But we think that it can add to this theme that you've heard from us, which is air gives us terrific context as to where people are going, gives us a lot of opportunity for delighting them.

In Orbitz, yes, they are traditionally weaker. International hotel, et cetera and also, product mix, definitely, that's something we can help them with. Having access to our global footprint of now over 270,000 hotels around the world having access to our international air and car and soon rail content can only help the Orbitz business.
