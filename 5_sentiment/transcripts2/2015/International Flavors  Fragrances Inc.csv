Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. I would like to start by providing some introductory remarks and then pass the call to Nicholas, who will provide their perspectives on performance for the individual business units.

I would like to start by providing some introductory remarks and then pass the call to Nicholas, who will provide their perspectives on performance for the individual business units. Then, Rich will review our consolidated financial performance in greater detail and finally turn the call back over to me for our 2015 outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions.
To begin, I want to share some of my onboarding experience over the past 5 months. During that time, I focused my attention on getting to know many constituents inside and outside of IFF. As part of this process, I was fortunate to tour 19 IFF sites around the world. While each location, I took the opportunity to meet with many of our global and strategic customers. I learned invaluable opportunity to learn about our relationship with our customers and more importantly understand where we are successful and where we have opportunities to improve.
The tour also provided an excellent opportunity to meet with approximately 80% of our employees via 24 local townhome meetings, which engaged as all of these people on a personal level to get their feedback on our business, strategy and future opportunities. Coming our way from these visits, one is extremely clear, without the passion and dedication of all our employees, we won't have achieved as much success as we did over the history of IFF. I deeply value all of their feedback and I'm glad to have met and spoken with so many of them. 
Finally, I also had the great fortune in meeting much of the investment community. It was terrific to hear their insights and perspectives on our performance, strategy, capital structure and M&A. So for those of you whom I have spoken with, I thank you for taking the time to share your opinion as it's helpful to gain insight into what matter us most for our shareholders.
For those of you who are new to the IFF story, our organization has had a lot of success over the past 5 years. So our 3 pillar strategy, we are now much stronger strategically, innovatively and financially. We will continue to drive performance for sustainable profitable growth, which in turn will lead to incremental shareholder value.
To that end, we have embarked on a strategic refresh where we have pressure testing our current 3 pillar strategy to ensure we are maximizing our performance.
Incorporated in to this process is much of the insight I mentioned earlier. But also includes guidance from an external consulting firm to ensure a deep and broad range of perspectives. This refresh is currently underway and we'll continue for the next couple of months. We expect to communicate our 20/20 vision at our June 2 Investor Day in New York City.
Turning now to the full year 2014 results. We are pleased to report that for the fourth time in 5 years, IFF achieved its long-term financial targets. We met or exceeded our sales, operating profit and EPS goals, and at the same time, continued to invest in R&D, manufacturing and commercial resources to strengthen our business.
Local currency sales grew 5%, on a consolidated basis, driven by new and performance and the acquisition of Aromor. The emerging markets, which grew 3x faster than the developed markets, on a local currency basis 2014, now represent approximately 50% of total sales, which we believe is best-in-class within our industry.
Excluding item impacting comparability, adjusted operating profit increased 11%, led by a 60-basis-point improvement in gross margin, disciplined cost control and lower incentive compensation expense.
The net impact was positive as adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 19.5%. From an EPS perspective, we benefited from a lower tax rate and gained incremental leveraged by our share repurchase program. As a result, adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% to $5.08 per share, which is a company record.
Beyond financial results, 2014 was a year of achievement and progress. For example, we are very proud of our accomplishments in the area of sustainability. In 2014, we were included in the CDP Climate Disclosure Leadership Index and opened the largest solar field in our industry. And just recently, Aromor, our in-house natural facility, and its partner in Turkey, were awarded the full life social responsibility certification for IMO.
2014 also saw some key investments into the business. We opened our new credit facility in Jakarta, then new sales office in Chile. And just last week, we opened our new Flavors facility in Chicago, expanding our coverage in the midwest of the United States.
On the R&D front, we have made advancements in our external collaboration and continued work with our Scientific Advisory Board. It was a successful integration of Aromor into our fragrance business, we are already seeing positive results and expect this positive momentum to continue in the coming year.
Finally, 2014 was also a year of celebration. Globally, it was IFF's 121st Anniversary, an event celebrated in IFF sites around the world. It was our fifth anniversary of our membership at the New York Stock Exchange. And what a perfect year it was formerly to launch our core corporate values of passion, creativity, expertise and empowerment, which was a campaign directed from our employees themselves.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in 2014 and look forward to continue the success. With that, I would like now to pass on to Matthias."

I'm happy to report that Flavors local currency savings grew 6% in the fourth quarter, which was our strongest performance in 2014. Our overall growth was driven by 7% increase in the emerging market, including double-digit performance in India, the south corner of Latin America, Africa and selected markets in Southeast Asia relative to 6% improvement in the developed markets.
On a category basis, Beverages grew double-digit with broad-base growth across all regions. This strong performance was a result of our operative team's ability to provide innovative solutions that are differentiating and satisfy consumer desires for healthier and better-for-you products. Growth in Savory was also solid, improving mid-single-digits globally led by strong new wins. EAME local currency sales growth was strong, increasing 7% as our performance continues to improve sequentially versus Q2 and Q3 over 2014.
Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverages and mid single-digit increases in Savory and Sweets, our results of new win performance. I would like to highlight also that in EAME the mature markets of Western Europe were up mid-single digits.
Great duration of our solids, posting a 3% local currency sales growth, led by mid-single-digit improvement in Savory and in Beverages. Southeast Asia and Japan continued to post solid growth, yet was offset by softness in China where overall consumer sentiment and weaker economic conditions impacted results.
In North America, conditions continued to improve. As we said earlier this year, growing 7% year-over-year in Q4. This improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in dairy and in beverages, which were both a result of strong innovation geared to support our customer's need for healthier, better-for-you product, that contain consumer preference.
Latin America continues to be our strongest performing region, up 13% on a local currency basis, as a result of our successful delivery systems. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is a clear indication of the value, innovation on our business.
From a profitability perspective, segment profit increased 5% and segment margin improved 10 basis points to 20.4%. On a full year basis, local currency sales grew 4%, led by Latin America and EAME. Full year segment profit totaled $331 million versus $323 million in the prior year. And our segment profit margin remained constant at 22.7%.
In addition to our solid financial results, it has been a great year for Flavors in terms of geographic expansion as we opened or improved facilities in all 4 regions over the last 12 months. Last week, I chant the North America Flavors team for the opening of a brand-new facility in Chicago, where we now have applications and flavors labs as well as a culinary center.
In November, we announced the opening of a new site in Chile, in Latin America and a new creative center in Indonesia, Greater Asia. And in EAME, we invested in a new regional dairy in, Netherlands. These new facilities enhanced collaboration and allowed us to partner more closely with our customers, building differentiating pay solutions.
As we also launched our August vanilla campaign, which many of you will see at the next week, showing our expertise with this key ingredient. In addition, our consumer insights team developed new tools such as, powerful programs to help our customers win in the marketplace by identifying key consumer trends at the very early stage. I'm proud of all our 2014 achievements as we build stronger years to come.
In 2015, we expect growth to continue to be driven by new win performance. Just looking at Q1 specifically, while it is early, we are seeing indications of strong growth.
I will now turn the call over to Nicolas."

I am pleased to report that Fragrance local currency sales grew 7% this quarter, including 2 percentage points of growth related to Aromor acquired earlier in the year. Our overall performance reflect mid-to-high-single digit growth across all regions. We developed market for our Fragrance Compound business, which includes consumer fragrances and Fine Fragrance were strong, growing 7%. This was led by high single-digit performance in North America where we continued to benefit from being added to a new core lead.
On a category basis, consumer fragrance performance was stronger, growing 8% as Fabric Care, Home Care and Hair Care all grew double digits. North America and Latin America both grew high-single digits, followed by mid-single digits in EAME and Greater Asia.
It should be noted that this marks the 13th consecutive quarter of consumer fragrance growth. Fine Fragrance local currency sales declined by 1% against a very strong 13% growth reported in the year-ago period and 24% growth in Q4 2012. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by weakness in EAME, which compared to a 32% growth rate reported in the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as softness in Latin America.
Turning now to our Ingredients business. Local currency sales increased 13%, including incremental sales from Aromor. This performance reflects strong growth of specialty ingredients, including Aromor, as well as key product families from IFF, including naturals.
From a profitability perspective, Fragrance segment profit increased 23% or $14 million to $76 million. This strong improvement in segment profit and segment margin reflects top line growth, lower incentive compensation expenses versus a strong year-ago period and productivity initiatives, including savings from the closure of our Augusta, Georgia Ingredients plant, which all combine to offset rising input costs. The net result was robust. Our segment profit margin expanded 290 basis points to 19.1%.
On a full year basis, local currency sales growth was strong, growing 7%, led by a double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in EAME, along with the addition of Aromor earlier this year.
Every region and every category in our fragrance compound business had positive growth. On a category perspective, Fine Fragrances increased 2% on top of the 8% we reported for the full year of 2013. And consumer fragrance sales grew 5% against an 8% comparison, supported by advancements in our market-leading encapsulation technology.
Fragrance Ingredients, which benefited from the addition of Aromor, was up 18% in 2014. Looking at profitability for the full year, segment profit grew 18% and segment profit margin expanded 210 basis points year-over-year.
2014 was a very strong year for Fragrances outside of our financial results. We launched 2 new captive fragrance molecule, received the full life designation for our Aromor naturals portfolio, we successfully integrated Aromor. We strengthened our leading encapsulation technology. We established a new strategic insight group. And we were acknowledged for climate leadership by the Carbon Disclosure Project.
From a customer perspective, we successfully gained access to 3 new, secure meaningful wins with key customers leveraging or leading encapsulation technology, and created the #1 men's fragrance in the U.S., Invictus by Paco Raban, which was previously launched with great success in Europe in 2013. All in, 2014 was a year of accomplishment. And I would like to thank the entire IFF team for their many contributions.
In 2015, we expect continued growth driven by strong new win performance. With respect to Q1, we believe we can deliver modest growth as we're facing our most challenging year-ago comparison. With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich."
281407,282428884,761015,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nicholas. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Looking at our Q4 results, net sales in the fourth quarter were up 7% on a local currency basis led by high single-digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. This quarter also",909,"Thank you, Nicholas. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Looking at our Q4 results, net sales in the fourth quarter were up 7% on a local currency basis led by high single-digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. This quarter also benefited by approximately 2 percentage points associated with an additional week of sales or the 53rd week, which generally incurs every 6 years. The emerging markets grew 6%, while developed markets increased 5%.
Why local currency sales grew 7%, net sales increased 4%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies.
Slight gross margins year-over-year, which was driven by higher input costs was more than offset by ongoing control of our research, selling and administrative expenses and lower incentive compensation cost versus the strong prior year results. As a result, our adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $133 million and our adjusted operating profit margin improved 210 basis points to 17.5% this quarter.
Finally, adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.07 as year-over-year gains and our adjusted operating profit were partially offset by slightly higher adjusted tax rate and interest expense.
The factor in year-over-year comparisons in looking at our top line growth, I thought it would be helpful to include a 2-year average local sales growth chart 5 quarter to highlight the underlying trends. As you can see, in Q4, local currency sales growth accelerated sequentially, growing 7% on a 2-year average basis. If we exclude the impact of additional weaker sales in the fourth quarter, the 2-year average growth rate is 6%, which is in line with the trends we've seen in the first half of 2014.
The improvement versus Q3 is primarily attributable to Flavors, which was more in line with historical norms. Quickly putting our full year results into perspective, I want to highlight that our 2014 performance was within our long-term targets and continued the strong trends we've seen over the past 3 and 5 years.
RSA, as a percent of sales, decreased 220 basis points from 28.3% of sales to 26.1% of sales. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense. Our continued focus to control cost and drive process improvements remains a priority. And by doing so, allows us to invest in R&D and commercial resources to build competitive advantage for our business long-term.
In Q4, R&D, as a percent of sales, remained within our 8% to 9% target range at 8.2% of sales.
Now taking a look at currency. Here, you see our usual chart, showing the change of the year relative to the U.S. dollar as the movement in the year represents our largest exposure relative to the impact on overall results. Foreign exchange movements in Q4 had approximately a 3% negative impact on our top line performance while on a full year basis, it was negligible.
As a reminder, the U.S. dollar strengthening versus the world currencies does not necessarily materially impact IFF in many emerging markets as 2/3 of our sales are tied directly or indirectly to hard currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar.
Looking to 2015, approximately 2/3 of our euro exposure from an operating profit perspective is now hedged at $1.32 rate, a little bit below the full year average for 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure for 2015, at current rates, around $1.13, we believe it will have a little more that 3% -- 3 percentage point negative impact on operating profit in 2015 based on an almost 15% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro.
In addition, at the current rate of $1.13, we would expect to see approximately 5 percentage point negative impact on our 2015 reported sales as we do not hedge the translation impact on our top line, but rather protect our overall operating profit by hedging our raw material purchases. This impact is included in our full year 2015 guidance that Andreas will speak to more about momentarily.
Now turning to a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flows in 2014 was $518 million or 16.8% of sales compared to $408 million or 13.8% of sales in the prior year period. The increase in cash from operations was driven primarily by an increase in net income, lower amount associated with Spanish tax payments and lower year-over-year pension contributions.
Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales as our 5 quarter rolling average figure so the end of the quarter are down 60 basis points to just above 29% of our trailing 12-month sales.
From a capital structure standpoint, capital spending focused on growth and infrastructure was a significant use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we haven't been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity and new technology where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and deliver winning solution to our customers around the globe. In 2014, we are in line with our target as CapEx, as a percent of sales, was 4.6%.
For 2015, we expect a similar level between 4% and 5% and then we believe we will go back to a more normalized level of between 3% and 3.5% going forward.
Finally, regarding our share buyback program, in 2014, we have spent approximately $88 million on share buybacks. This, combined with our dividend payments, resulted in total cash return to our shareholders of $221 million or 53% of net income.
I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas."

As we look ahead to 2015, we believe our businesses is well positioned for continued performance that generates returns for our shareholders, despite macroeconomic uncertainty and increasing currency pressure.
We have available balance geographic profile, a diversed product portfolio and a very strong innovation pipeline that sets us apart from the competition.
We believe this breadth and diversity provides our investors with an attractive combination of sustainable growth and strong cash flow generation. As such, our local currency sales are expected to grow in line with our 4% to 6% long-term target. Balanced growth across those businesses. We also expect to see operating profit in 2015 grow in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%. Albeit, at the low end of the range given the impact of our unhedged portion of our euro exposure. We set expectation income and a expense 100% target level and modest inflation in our raw material cost. Given that we are at the low end of our operating profit range, we expect to see EPS growth high single digits on a reported basis or double digits on a constant-currency basis.
In summary, 2014 was a successful year. We achieved our long-term financial targets for the fourth time in 5 years, continued to invest in R&D to drive innovation and differentiation, made great strides and sustainability, benefited from the integration of Aromor and advanced external collaboration, all critical for future success.
On a full year 2015 basis, we are confident that we should be able to deliver top line and operating profit growth in line with our long-term targets, despite some headwinds such as the macroeconomic uncertainty, currency pressure and modest raw material inflation.
Before I close, I want to remind everyone that we will be presenting at Cagney next Thursday, February 19.

We've been continuing to proactively work with our customers and address these pricing pressures. On the other side, from an oil perspective and where that impacts our results, going forward, it's important to remember that we're 2 or 3 or 4 steps down the chain from a derivative standpoint off of oil.

Then Rich will review our consolidated financial performance in greater detail and finally turn the call back over to me for our 2015 outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions.
To begin, I want to share some of my on-boarding experience over the past 5 months. During that time, I focused my attention on getting to know many constituents inside and outside of IFF. As part of this process, I was fortunate to tour 19 IFF sites around the world. While at each location, I took the opportunity to meet with many of our global and strategic customers. It was an invaluable opportunity to learn about our relationship with our customers and, more importantly, understand where we are successful and where we have opportunities to improve.
The tour also provided an excellent opportunity to meet with approximately 80% of our employees via 24 local town hall meetings, which engaged with all of these people on a personal level, to get their feedback on our business, strategy and future opportunities. Coming away from these visits, one thing is extremely clear: without the passion and dedication of all of our employees, we would not have achieved as much success as we did over the history of IFF. I deeply value all of their feedback, and I'm glad to have met and spoken with so many of them.
Finally, I also had the great fortune in meeting much of the investment community. It was terrific to hear their insights and perspectives on our performance, strategy, capital structure and M&A. So for those of you whom I have spoken with, I thank you for taking the time to share your opinion, as it's helpful to gain insight into what matters most for our shareholders.
For those of you who are new to the IFF story, our organization has had a lot of success over the past 5 years. Through our 3-pillar strategy, we are now much stronger strategically, innovatively and financially. We will continue to drive performance through sustainable profitable growth, which in turn will lead to incremental shareholder value.
To that end, we have embarked on a strategic refresh, where we are pressure testing our current 3-pillar strategy to ensure we are maximizing our performance.
Incorporated into this process is much of the insight I mentioned earlier, but it also includes guidance from an external consulting firm to ensure a deep and broad range of perspectives. This refresh is currently underway and will continue for the next couple of months. We expect to communicate our 2020 vision at our June 2 Investor Day in New York City.
Turning now to the full year 2014 results. We are pleased to report that for the fourth time in 5 years, IFF achieved its long-term financial targets. We met or exceeded our sales, operating profit and EPS goals and, at the same time, continued to invest in R&D, manufacturing and commercial resources to strengthen our business.
Local currency sales grew 5% on a consolidated basis, driven by new win performance and the acquisition of Aromor. The emerging markets, which grew 3x faster than the developed markets, on a local currency basis in 2014, now represents approximately 50% of total sales, which we believe is best in class within our industry.
Excluding item impacting comparability, adjusted operating profit increased 11%, led by a 60 basis point improvement in gross margin, disciplined cost control and lower incentive compensation expense.
The net impact was positive, as adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 19.5%. From an EPS perspective, we benefited from a lower tax rate and gained incremental leverage via our share repurchase program. As a result, adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% to $5.08 per share, which is a company record.
Beyond financial results, 2014 was a year of achievement and progress. For example, we are very proud of our accomplishments in the area of sustainability. In 2014, we were included in the CDP Climate Disclosure Leadership Index and opened the largest solar field in our industry. And just recently, Aromor, our in-house naturals facility, and its partner in Turkey, were awarded the For Life Social Responsibility Certification for IMO.
2014 also saw some key investments into the business. We opened our new creative facility in Jakarta and a new sales office and lab in Chile. And just last week, we opened our new Flavors facility in Chicago, expanding our coverage in the Midwest of the United States.
On the R&D front, we have made advancements in our external collaborations and continued work with our Scientific Advisory Board. And with the successful integration of Aromor into our Fragrance business, we are already seeing positive results and expect this positive momentum to continue in the coming year.
Finally, 2014 was also a year of celebration. Globally, it was IFF's 121st anniversary, an event celebrated in IFF sites around the world. It was our fifth anniversary of our membership at the New York Stock Exchange. And what a perfect year it was formally to launch our core corporate values of passion, creativity, expertise and empowerment, which was a grassroots campaign direct from our employees themselves.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in 2014 and look forward to continue the success.
With that, I would like now to pass on to Matthias."

I'm happy to report that Flavors local currency sales grew 6% in the fourth quarter, which was our strongest performance in 2014. Our overall growth was driven by 7% increase in the emerging markets, including double-digit performance in India, the South Cone of Latin America, Africa and selected markets in Southeast Asia as well as a 6% improvement in the developed markets.
On a category basis, Beverages grew double digit with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was a result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions that are differentiating and satisfy consumer desires for healthier and better-for-you products.
Growth in Savory was also solid, improving mid-single digits globally, led by strong new wins. EAME local currency sales growth was strong, increasing 7%, as our performance continued to improve sequentially versus Q2 and Q3 over 2014.
Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverages and mid-single-digit increases in Savory and Sweet, all a result of new win performance. I would like to highlight also that within EAME, the mature markets of Western Europe were up mid-single digits.
Greater Asia was solid, posting a 3% local currency sales growth, led by mid-single-digit improvement in Savory and in Beverages. Southeast Asia and Japan continued to post solid growth, yet was offset by softness in China, where overall consumer sentiment and weaker economic conditions impacted results.
In North America, conditions continued to improve. As we said, Flavors [ph] earlier this year growing 7% year-over-year in Q4. This improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in Dairy and in Beverages, which were both a result of strong innovation geared to support our customers' need for healthier, better-for-you products that maintain consumer preference.
Latin America continues to be our strongest-performing region, up 13% on a local currency basis, as a result of our successful delivery systems. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is a clear indication of the value innovation has on our business.
From our -- from a profitability perspective, segment profit increased 5% and segment margin improved 10 basis points to 20.4%. On a full year basis, local currency sales grew 4%, led by Latin America and EAME. Full year segment profit totaled $331 million versus $323 million in the prior year and our segment profit margin remained constant at 22.7%.
In addition to our solid financial results, it has been a great year for Flavors in terms of geographic expansion, as we opened or improved facilities in all 4 regions over the last 12 months. Last week, I joined the North America Flavors team for the opening of a brand-new facility in Chicago, where we now have applications and flavors labs as well as a culinary center.
In November, we announced the opening of a new site in Chile in Latin America and a new creative center in Indonesia, Greater Asia. And in EAME, we invested in a new regional dairy center in Hilversum, the Netherlands. These new facilities enhance collaboration and allow us to partner more closely with our customers, building differentiating taste solutions.
As we also launched our Always Vanilla campaign, which many of you, you will see at the CAGNY next week, showcasing our expertise with this key ingredient. In addition, our consumer insights team developed new tools such as trend evaluation [ph], powerful programs to help our customers win in the marketplace by identifying key consumer trends at the very early stage. I'm proud of all our 2014 achievements as we build strong years to come.
In 2015, we expect growth to continue to drive -- to be driven by new win performance. Looking at Q1 specifically, while it is still early, we are seeing indications of strong growth.
I will now turn the call over to Nicolas."

I am pleased to report that Fragrance local currency sales grew 7% this quarter, including 2 percentage points of growth related to Aromor acquired earlier in the year. Our overall performance reflect mid to high single-digit growth across all regions. The developed market for our Fragrance Compound business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrance, was strong, growing 7%. This was led by high single-digit performance in North America where we continue to benefit from being added to a new core list.
On a category basis, Consumer Fragrance performance was stronger, growing 8% as Fabric Care, Home Care and Hair Care all grew double digits. North America and Latin America both grew high single digits, followed by mid-single digits in EAME and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 13th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrance growth. 
Fine Fragrance local currency sales declined by 1% against a very strong 13% growth reported in the year-ago period and 24% growth in Q4 2012. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by weakness in EAME, which compared to a 32% growth rate reported in the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as softness in Latin America.
Turning now to our Ingredients business. Local currency sales increased 13%, including incremental sales from Aromor. This performance reflects strong growth of specialty ingredients, including Aromor as well as key product families from IFF, including naturals.
From a profitability perspective, Fragrance segment profit increased 23% or $14 million to $76 million. This strong improvement in segment profit and segment margin reflects top line growth, lower incentive compensation expenses versus a strong year-ago period and productivity initiatives, including savings from the closure of our Augusta, Georgia Ingredients plant, which all combined to offset rising input costs. The net result was robust. Our segment profit margin expanded 290 basis points to 19.1%.
On a full year basis, local currency sales growth was strong, growing 7%, led by a double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in EAME, along with the addition of Aromor earlier this year.
Every region and every category in our Fragrance Compound business had positive growth. On a category perspective, Fine Fragrances increased 2% on top of the 8% we reported for the full year of 2013. And consumer fragrance sales grew 5% against an 8% comparison, supported by advancements in our market-leading encapsulation technology. Fragrance Ingredients, which benefited from the addition of Aromor, was up 18% in 2014.
Looking at profitability for the full year, segment profit grew 18% and segment profit margin expanded 210 basis points year-over-year.
2014 was a very strong year for Fragrances outside of our financial results. We launched 2 new captives fragrance molecule, received the For Life designation for our Aromor naturals portfolio. We successfully integrated Aromor. We strengthened our leading encapsulation technology. We established a new strategic insight group, and we were acknowledged for climate leadership by the Carbon Disclosure project.
From a customer perspective, we successfully gained access to 3 new core lists, secure meaningful wins with key customers leveraging our leading encapsulation technology and created the #1 men's fragrance in the U.S., Invictus by Paco Rabanne, which was previously launched with great success in Europe in 2013. All in, 2014 was a year of accomplishment, and I would like to thank the entire IFF team for their many contributions.
In 2015, we expect continued growth, driven by strong new win performance. With respect to Q1, we believe we can deliver modest growth as we are facing our most challenging year-ago comparison.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich."
281407,282428884,761452,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Looking at our Q4 results, net sales in the fourth quarter were up 7% on a local currency basis, led by a high single-digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. This quarter als",915,"Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Looking at our Q4 results, net sales in the fourth quarter were up 7% on a local currency basis, led by a high single-digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. This quarter also benefited by approximately 2 percentage points associated with an additional week of sales or the 53rd week, which generally occurs every 6 years. The emerging markets grew 6%, while developed markets increased 5%.
While local currency sales grew 7%, net sales increased 4%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies.
Slight decline in gross margins year-over-year, which was driven by higher input costs, was more than offset by ongoing control of our research, selling and administrative expenses and lower incentive compensation costs versus the strong prior year results. As a result, our adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $133 million and our adjusted operating profit margin improved 210 basis points to 17.5% this quarter.
Finally, adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.07, as year-over-year gains and adjusted operating profit were partially offset by a slightly higher adjusted tax rate and interest expense.
To factor in year-over-year comparisons in looking at our top line growth, I thought it would be helpful to include a 2-year average local currency sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trends. As you can see, in Q4, local currency sales growth accelerated sequentially, growing 7% on a 2-year average basis. If we exclude the impact of the additional week of sales in the fourth quarter, the 2-year average growth rate is 6%, which is in line with the trends we've seen in the first half of 2014.
The improvement versus Q3 is primarily attributable to Flavors, which was more in line with historical norms.
Quickly putting our full year results into perspective, I want to highlight that our 2014 performance was within our long-term targets and continue the strong trends we've seen over the past 3 and 5 years.
RSA as a percent of sales decreased 220 basis points from 28.3% of sales to 26.1% of sales. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense. Our continued focus to control cost and drive process improvements remains a priority, and by doing so, allows us to reinvest in R&D and commercial resources to build competitive advantage for our business long term.
In Q4, R&D as a percent of sales remained within our 8% to 9% target range at 8.2% of sales.
Now taking a look at currency. Here, you see our usual chart showing the change of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, as the movement in euro represents our largest exposure relative to the impact on overall results. Foreign exchange movements in Q4 had approximately 3% negative impact on our top line performance. While on a full year basis, it was negligible.
As a reminder, the U.S. dollar strengthening versus the world's currencies does not necessarily materially impact IFF in many emerging markets, as 2/3 of our sales are tied directly or indirectly to hard currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar.
Looking to 2015, approximately 2/3 of our euro exposure from an operating profit perspective is now hedged at $1.32 rate, a little bit below the full year average for 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure for 2015, at current rates of around $1.13, we believe it will have a little more that 3% -- 3 percentage point negative impact on operating profit in 2015 based on an almost 15% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro.
In addition, at a current rate of $1.13, we would expect to see approximately 5 percentage point negative impact on our 2015 reported sales, as we do not hedge the translation impact on our top line but rather protect our overall operating profit by hedging our raw material purchases. This impact is included in our full year 2015 guidance that Andreas will speak to more about momentarily.
Now turning to a cash flow perspective. Our operating cash flows in 2014 was $518 million or 16.8% of sales compared to $408 million or 13.8% of sales in the prior year period. The increase in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by an increase in net income, lower amounts associated with Spanish tax payments and lower year-over-year pension contributions.
Our core working capital levels continued to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales, as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of the quarter are down 60 basis points to just above 29% of our trailing 12-month sales.
From a capital structure standpoint, capital spending focused on growth and infrastructure was a significant use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity and new technology where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and deliver winning solution to our customers around the globe. In 2014, we are in line with our target as CapEx as a percent of sales was 4.6%.
For 2015, we expect a similar level between 4% and 5%, and then we believe we will revert back to a more normalized level of between 3% and 3.5% going forward.
Finally, regarding our share buyback program. In 2014, we have spent approximately $88 million on share buybacks. This, combined with our dividend payments, resulted in total cash return to our shareholders of $221 million or 53% of net income.

As we look ahead to 2015, we believe our business is well positioned for continued performance that generates returns for our shareholders, despite macroeconomic uncertainty and increasing currency pressure.
We have a well-balanced geographic profile, a diverse product portfolio and a very strong innovation pipeline that sets us apart from the competition.
We believe this breadth and diversity provides our investors with an attractive combination of sustainable growth and strong cash flow generation. As such, our local currency sales are expected to grow in line with our 4% to 6% long-term target, with balanced growth across both businesses.
We also expect to see operating profit in 2015 grow in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%, albeit at the low end of the range given the impact of our unhedged portion of our euro exposure. We set up our expected incentive-based comp and expense to 100% target level and modest inflation in our raw material costs. Given that we are at the low end of our operating profit range, we expect to see EPS grows high single digits on a reported basis or double digits on a constant currency basis.
In summary, 2014 was a successful year. We achieved our long-term financial targets for the fourth time in 5 years, continued to invest in R&D to drive innovation and differentiation, made great strides in sustainability, benefited from the integration of Aromor and advanced external collaboration, all critical for future success.
On a full year 2015 basis, we are confident that we should be able to deliver top line and operating profit growth in line with our long-term targets, despite some headwinds, such as the macroeconomic uncertainty, currency pressure and modest raw material inflation.
Before I close, I want to remind everyone that we will be presenting at CAGNY next Thursday, February 19. I hope to see many of you at the presentation, but also at our correspondents' dinner, where we will showcase some of the art and science aspects of our business.
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

Since, what, the middle of 2014, we've been talking about pricing pressure and input cost pressure, particularly in naturals.

And as I mentioned earlier, we actually saw that impact our fourth quarter gross margins pretty significantly. We've been continuing to proactively work with our customers and address these pricing pressures. On the other side, from an oil perspective and how that impacts our results going forward, it's important to remember that we're 2 or 3 or 4 steps down the chain from a derivative standpoint off of oil.

Yet when it comes to sugar, we also see a lot in Latin America. A few countries have introduced the so-called sugar tax introduction. So you're paying additional taxes if you have a high sugar content or a high calorie content in product, and it simply forces a lot of manufacturers to take calories out and the overall advantage [ph] also for the consumer is changing dramatically. I don't think that in many parts of Asia health and wellness in form of reduced sugar is much advanced. We see though first signs, particularly in India and some other markets. I think it will take probably a few more years there until we see the same engagement and activity level as we would -- as we right now see in Latin America, in Western Europe or in North America.

Then Rich will review our consolidated financial performance in greater detail and finally turn the call back over to me for our 2015 outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions.
To begin, I want to share some of my on-boarding experience over the past 5 months. During that time, I focused my attention on getting to know many constituents inside and outside of IFF. As part of this process, I was fortunate to tour 19 IFF sites around the world. While at each location, I took the opportunity to meet with many of our global and strategic customers. It was an invaluable opportunity to learn about our relationship with our customers and, more importantly, understand where we are successful and where we have opportunities to improve.
The tour also provided an excellent opportunity to meet with approximately 80% of our employees via 24 local town hall meetings, which engaged with all of these people on a personal level, to get their feedback on our business, strategy and future opportunities. Coming away from these visits, one thing is extremely clear: without the passion and dedication of all of our employees, we would not have achieved as much success as we did over the history of IFF. I deeply value all of their feedback, and I'm glad to have met and spoken with so many of them.
Finally, I also had the great fortune in meeting much of the investment community. It was terrific to hear their insights and perspectives on our performance, strategy, capital structure and M&A. So for those of you whom I have spoken with, I thank you for taking the time to share your opinion, as it's helpful to gain insight into what matters most for our shareholders.
For those of you who are new to the IFF story, our organization has had a lot of success over the past 5 years. Through our 3-pillar strategy, we are now much stronger strategically, innovatively and financially. We will continue to drive performance through sustainable profitable growth, which in turn will lead to incremental shareholder value.
To that end, we have embarked on a strategic refresh, where we are pressure testing our current 3-pillar strategy to ensure we are maximizing our performance.
Incorporated into this process is much of the insight I mentioned earlier, but it also includes guidance from an external consulting firm to ensure a deep and broad range of perspectives. This refresh is currently underway and will continue for the next couple of months. We expect to communicate our 2020 vision at our June 2 Investor Day in New York City.
Turning now to the full year 2014 results. We are pleased to report that for the fourth time in 5 years, IFF achieved its long-term financial targets. We met or exceeded our sales, operating profit and EPS goals and, at the same time, continued to invest in R&D, manufacturing and commercial resources to strengthen our business.
Local currency sales grew 5% on a consolidated basis, driven by new win performance and the acquisition of Aromor. The emerging markets, which grew 3x faster than the developed markets on a local currency basis in 2014, now represents approximately 50% of total sales, which we believe is best in class within our industry.
Excluding item impacting comparability, adjusted operating profit increased 11%, led by a 60 basis point improvement in gross margin, disciplined cost control and lower incentive compensation expense.
The net impact was positive, as adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 19.5%. From an EPS perspective, we benefited from a lower tax rate and gained incremental leverage via our share repurchase program. As a result, adjusted diluted EPS improved 14% to $5.08 per share, which is a company record.
Beyond financial results, 2014 was a year of achievement and progress. For example, we are very proud of our accomplishments in the area of sustainability. In 2014, we were included in the CDP Climate Disclosure Leadership Index and opened the largest solar field in our industry. And just recently, Aromor, our in-house naturals facility, and its partner in Turkey, were awarded the For Life Social Responsibility Certification for IMO.
2014 also saw some key investments into the business. We opened our new creative facility in Jakarta and a new sales office and lab in Chile. And just last week, we opened our new Flavors facility in Chicago, expanding our coverage in the Midwest of the United States.
On the R&D front, we have made advancements in our external collaborations and continued work with our Scientific Advisory Board. And with the successful integration of Aromor into our Fragrance business, we are already seeing positive results and expect this positive momentum to continue in the coming year.
Finally, 2014 was also a year of celebration. Globally, it was IFF's 121st anniversary, an event celebrated in IFF sites around the world. It was our fifth anniversary of our membership at the New York Stock Exchange. And what a perfect year it was formally to launch our core corporate values of passion, creativity, expertise and empowerment, which was a grassroots campaign directly from our employees themselves.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in 2014 and look forward to continue the success.
With that, I would like now to pass on to Matthias."

I'm happy to report that Flavors local currency sales grew 6% in the fourth quarter, which was our strongest performance in 2014. Our overall growth was driven by 7% increase in the emerging markets, including double-digit performance in India, the South Cone of Latin America, Africa and selected markets in Southeast Asia as well as a 6% improvement in the developed markets.
On a category basis, Beverages grew double digit with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was the result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions that are differentiating and satisfy consumer desires for healthier and better-for-you products.
Growth in Savory was also solid, improving mid-single digits globally, led by strong new wins. EAME[ph] local currency sales growth was strong, increasing 7%, as our performance continued to improve sequentially versus Q2 and Q3 over 2014.
Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverages and mid-single-digit increases in Savory and Sweet, all a result of new win performance. I would like to highlight also that within EAME, the mature markets of Western Europe were up mid-single digits.
Greater Asia was solid, posting a 3% local currency sales growth, led by mid-single digit improvement in Savory and in Beverages. Southeast Asia and Japan continued to post solid growth, yet was offset by softness in China, where overall consumer sentiment and weaker economic conditions impacted results.
In North America, conditions continued to improve. As we said, even earlier this year growing 7% year-over-year in Q4. This improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in Dairy and in Beverages, which were both a result of strong innovation geared to support our customers' need for healthier, better-for-you products that maintain consumer preference.
Latin America continues to be our strongest-performing region, up 13% on a local currency basis, as a result of our successful delivery systems. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is a clear indication of the value innovation has on our business.
From our -- from a profitability perspective, segment profit increased 5% and segment margin improved 10 basis points to 20.4%. On a full year basis, local currency sales grew 4%, led by Latin America and EAME. Full year segment profit totaled $331 million versus $323 million in the prior year and our segment profit margin remained constant at 22.7%.
In addition to our solid financial results, it has been a great year for Flavors in terms of geographic expansion, as we opened or improved facilities in all 4 regions over the last 12 months. Last week, I joined the North America Flavors team for the opening of a brand-new facility in Chicago, where we now have applications and flavors labs as well as a culinary center.
In November, we announced the opening of a new site in Chile in Latin America and a new creative center in Indonesia, Greater Asia. And in EAME, we invested in a new regional dairy center in Hilversum, the Netherlands. These new facilities enhance collaboration and allow us to partner more closely with our customers, building differentiating taste solutions.
As we also launched our Always Vanilla campaign, which many of you, you will see at the CAGNY next week, showcasing our expertise with this key ingredient. In addition, our consumer insights team developed new tools such as trend evaluation [ph], powerful programs to help our customers win in the marketplace by identifying key consumer trends at the very early stage. I'm proud of all our 2014 achievements as we build strong for years to come.
In 2015, we expect growth to continue to drive -- to be driven by new win performance. Looking at Q1 specifically, while it is still early we are seeing indications of strong growth.
I will now turn the call over to Nicolas."

I am pleased to report that Fragrance local currency sales grew 7% this quarter, including 2 percentage points of growth related to Aromor acquired earlier in the year. Our overall performance reflects mid to high single-digit growth across all regions. The developed market for our Fragrance Compound business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrance, was strong, growing 7%. This was led by high single-digit performance in North America where we continue to benefit from being added to a new core list.
On a category basis, Consumer Fragrance performance was stronger, growing 8% as Fabric Care, Home Care and Hair Care all grew double digits. North America and Latin America both grew high single digits, followed by mid-single digits in EAME and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 13th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrance growth. 
Fine Fragrance local currency sales declined by 1% against a very strong 13% growth reported in the year-ago period and 24% growth in Q4 2012. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by weakness in EAME, which compared to a 32% growth rate reported in the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as softness in Latin America.
Turning now to our Ingredients business. Local currency sales increased 13%, including incremental sales from Aromor. This performance reflects strong growth of specialty ingredients, including Aromor as well as key product families from IFF, including naturals.
From a profitability perspective, Fragrance segment profit increased 23% or $14 million to $76 million. This strong improvement in segment profit and segment margin reflects top line growth, lower incentive compensation expenses versus a strong year-ago period and productivity initiatives, including savings from the closure of our Augusta, Georgia Ingredients plant, which all combined to offset rising input costs. The net result was robust. Our segment profit margin expanded 290 basis points to 19.1%.
On a full year basis, local currency sales growth was strong, growing 7%, led by a double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in EAME, along with the addition of Aromor earlier this year.
Every region and every category in our Fragrance Compound business had positive growth. On a category perspective, Fine Fragrances increased 2% on top of the 8% we reported for the full year of 2013. And consumer fragrance sales grew 5% against an 8% comparison, supported by advancements in our market-leading encapsulation technology. Fragrance Ingredients, which benefited from the addition of Aromor, was up 18% in 2014.
Looking at profitability for the full year, segment profit grew 18% and segment profit margin expanded 210 basis points year-over-year.
2014 was a very strong year for Fragrances outside of our financial results. We launched 2 new captives fragrance molecules, received the For Life designation for our Aromor naturals portfolio. We successfully integrated Aromor. We strengthened our leading encapsulation technology. We established a new strategic insight group, and we were acknowledged for climate leadership by the Carbon Disclosure project.
From a customer perspective, we successfully gained access to 3 new core lists, secured meaningful wins with key customers leveraging our leading encapsulation technology and created the #1 men's fragrance in the U.S., Invictus by Paco Rabanne, which was previously launched with great success in Europe in 2013. All in, 2014 was a year of accomplishment, and I would like to thank the entire IFF team for their many contributions.
In 2015, we expect continued growth, driven by strong new win performance. With respect to Q1, we believe we can deliver modest growth as we are facing our most challenging year-ago comparison.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich."
281407,282428884,761599,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Looking at our Q4 results, net sales in the fourth quarter were up 7% on a local currency basis, led by a high single-digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. This quarter als",915,"Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Looking at our Q4 results, net sales in the fourth quarter were up 7% on a local currency basis, led by a high single-digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. This quarter also benefited by approximately 2 percentage points associated with an additional week of sales or the 53rd week, which generally occurs every 6 years. The emerging markets grew 6%, while developed markets increased 5%.
While local currency sales grew 7%, net sales increased 4%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies.
Slight decline in gross margins year-over-year, which was driven by higher input costs, was more than offset by ongoing control of our research, selling and administrative expenses and lower incentive compensation costs versus the strong prior year results. As a result, our adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $133 million and our adjusted operating profit margin improved 210 basis points to 17.5% this quarter.
Finally, adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.07, as year-over-year gains and adjusted operating profit were partially offset by a slightly higher adjusted tax rate and interest expense.
To factor in year-over-year comparisons in looking at our top line growth, I thought it would be helpful to include a 2-year average local currency sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trends. As you can see, in Q4, local currency sales growth accelerated sequentially, growing 7% on a 2-year average basis. If we exclude the impact of the additional week of sales in the fourth quarter, the 2-year average growth rate is 6%, which is in line with the trends we've seen in the first half of 2014.
The improvement versus Q3 is primarily attributable to Flavors, which was more in line with historical norms.
Quickly putting our full year results into perspective, I want to highlight that our 2014 performance was within our long-term targets and continue the strong trends we've seen over the past 3 and 5 years.
RSA as a percent of sales decreased 220 basis points from 28.3% of sales to 26.1% of sales. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense. Our continued focus to control cost and drive process improvements remains a priority, and by doing so, allows us to reinvest in R&D and commercial resources to build competitive advantage for our business long term.
In Q4, R&D as a percent of sales remained within our 8% to 9% target range at 8.2% of sales.
Now taking a look at currency. Here, you see our usual chart showing the change of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, as the movement in euro represents our largest exposure relative to the impact on overall results. Foreign exchange movements in Q4 had approximately 3% negative impact on our top line performance. While on a full year basis, it was negligible.
As a reminder, the U.S. dollar strengthening versus the world's currencies does not necessarily materially impact IFF in many emerging markets, as 2/3 of our sales are tied directly or indirectly to hard currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar.
Looking to 2015, approximately 2/3 of our euro exposure from an operating profit perspective is now hedged at $1.32 rate, a little bit below the full year average for 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure for 2015, at current rates of around $1.13, we believe it will have a little more that 3% -- 3 percentage point negative impact on operating profit in 2015 based on an almost 15% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro.
In addition, at a current rate of $1.13, we would expect to see approximately 5 percentage point negative impact on our 2015 reported sales, as we do not hedge the translation impact on our top line but rather protect our overall operating profit by hedging our raw material purchases. This impact is included in our full year 2015 guidance that Andreas will speak to more about momentarily.
Now turning to a cash flow perspective. Our operating cash flows in 2014 was $518 million or 16.8% of sales compared to $408 million or 13.8% of sales in the prior year period. The increase in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by an increase in net income, lower amounts associated with Spanish tax payments and lower year-over-year pension contributions.
Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales, as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of the quarter are down 60 basis points to just above 29% of our trailing 12-month sales.
From a capital structure standpoint, capital spending focused on growth and infrastructure was a significant use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity and new technology where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and deliver winning solution to our customers around the globe. In 2014, we are in line with our target as CapEx as a percent of sales was 4.6%.
For 2015, we expect a similar level between 4% and 5%, and then we believe it will revert back to a more normalized level of between 3% and 3.5% going forward.
Finally, regarding our share buyback program. In 2014, we have spent approximately $88 million on share buybacks. This, combined with our dividend payments, resulted in total cash return to our shareholders of $221 million or 53% of net income.
I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas."

As we look ahead to 2015, we believe our business is well positioned for continued performance that generates returns for our shareholders, despite macroeconomic uncertainty and increasing currency pressure.
We have a well-balanced geographic profile, a diverse product portfolio and a very strong innovation pipeline that sets us apart from the competition.
We believe this breadth and diversity provides our investors with an attractive combination of sustainable growth and strong cash flow generation. As such, our local currency sales are expected to grow in line with our 4% to 6% long-term target, with balanced growth across both businesses.
We also expect to see operating profit in 2015 grow in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%, albeit at the low end of the range given the impact of our unhedged portion of our euro exposure. We set up our expected incentive-based comp and expense to 100% target level and modest inflation in our raw material costs. Given that we are at the low end of our operating profit range, we expect to see EPS grow high single digits on a reported basis or double digits on a constant currency basis.
In summary, 2014 was a successful year. We achieved our long-term financial targets for the fourth time in 5 years, continued to invest in R&D to drive innovation and differentiation, made great strides in sustainability, benefited from the integration of Aromor and advanced external collaboration, all critical for future success.
On a full year 2015 basis, we are confident that we should be able to deliver top line and operating profit growth in line with our long-term targets, despite some headwinds, such as the macroeconomic uncertainty, currency pressure and modest raw material inflation.
Before I close, I want to remind everyone that we will be presenting at CAGNY next Thursday, February 19. I hope to see many of you at the presentation, but also at our correspondents' dinner, where we will showcase some of the art and science aspects of our business.
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

Since, what, the middle of 2014, we've been talking about pricing pressure and input cost pressure, particularly in the naturals.

And as I mentioned earlier, we actually saw that impact our fourth quarter gross margins pretty significantly. We've been continuing to proactively work with our customers and address these pricing pressures. On the other side, from an oil perspective and how that impacts our results going forward, it's important to remember that we're 2 or 3 or 4 steps down the chain from a derivative standpoint off of oil.

I cannot share with you exactly what is the mix and how much really of new product which we have in the portfolio that are geared for health and wellness. But I can confirm to you that more than half of all the new wins are geared towards health and wellness not only in the developed markets, but also in developing markets. And when I'm referring to health and wellness, I'm referring to reduced sugar content, less sodium, less fats. I'm referring to mouthfeel. I'm referring to many other very innovative taste solutions as the industry moves more and more from flavors into taste."

Yet when it comes to sugar, we also see a lot in Latin America. A few countries have introduced the so-called sugar tax introduction. So you're paying additional taxes if you have a high sugar content or a high calorie content in products, and it simply forces a lot of manufacturers to take calories out and the overall advantage also for the consumer is changing dramatically. I don't think that in many parts of Asia health and wellness in form of reduced sugar is much advanced. We see though first signs, particularly in India and some other markets.

I would start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter and Rich will review our consolidated performance results in greater detail and turn the call back over to me for comments on the balance of the year and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions. 
We are pleased with our operational performance in quarter 1. On a currency neutral basis, we delivered mid-single digit sales growth and double-digit increases in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. At the same time, we continued to invest in the business to support our strategic goal by bolstering our over Flavors business with the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the opening of a new sales facility near Chicago and the expansion of our operating center in South Africa. 
Currency neutral sales this quarter grew 6% on a consolidated basis, primarily driven by new win performance across both businesses. Currency sales to the emerging markets which now represents 51% of total company sales grew 9%, twice of the rate of sales of the developed markets which we'll focus then. 
Adjusted operating profit grew 10% on a currency neutral basis to $163 million and adjusted operating profit margin was 21%. This improvement was driven by strong sales growth combined with manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. 
From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we also benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, interest expense and shares outstanding. The net result drove a 13% improvement in adjusted EPS on a currency neutral basis to $1.45 per share in the quarter.
In Fragrances, currently currency neutral sales grew 5% at quarter 1 as most regions delivered mid-to high single-digit growth. In the emerging markets, our Fragrance Compounds business which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrances grew 8% while the developed market grew by 4%. 
On a category basis, Consumer Fragrances continued to be our strongest performer growing 9% as Fabric Care and Home Care grew strong double digits. EAME and Latin America both grew high single digits followed by mid-single digits in North America and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 14th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrances growth. 
Fine Fragrances, currency neutral sales declined by 2% against the very strong 10% growth reported in the year-ago period. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by softness in North America and EAME, both of which compared to a strong double-digit growth in the prior year period. If you recall, our quarter 1 performance was our strongest of 2014 as it benefited from a customer pre-building inventory before implementing SAP. 
In Fragrance Ingredients, currency neutral sales declined 2% as it compared to the strongest year-over-year comparison. From a profitability perspective, Fragrances segment profit decreased 6% to $82 million and segment profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 20.5% as the unfavorable net impact of price to input cost and currency pressures more than offset productivity and cost control initiatives.
Turning to Flavors. For 41 consecutive quarters, Flavors reported positive currency neutral sales growth increasing 9% in the first quarter. While overall market performance was driven by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, the developed markets also posted gains increasing 7% year-over-year.
On a category basis, the strong trends we saw last quarter continued as Beverages grew double-digit with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was a result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions with satisfying consumer desires for healthier products.
It also should be noted that all other regions within our Flavors business achieved solid growth led by high single-digit increase in Dairy and mid-single-digit increase in Sweet and Savory. 
On a regional perspective. Greater Asia posted 4% currency neutral sales growth led by double-digit improvement in Beverages and a high single-digit increase in Savory. Southeast Asia, India and Japan all reported growth while China continued to be soft.
In EAME, currency neutral sales growth was strong, increasing 9%. Results are driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverage and high single-digit increases in Sweet, all as a result of new win performance. 
In North America, conditions continued to improve versus the middle of 2014, growing a robust 10% year-over-year in quarter 1. This improvement can primarily be attributed to strong double-digit growth in Dairy, Sweet and Beverage, all of which were a result of strong innovations and our recent investments to drive consumer intimacy in this key market.
For the sixth consecutive quarter, Latin America grew double-digit, up 21% on a currency neutral basis. This performance continues to be driven by innovation, in particular, our successful proprietary delivery system. From a profitability perspective, Flavors segment profit increased 5% to $93 million in quarter 1. Segment profit margin improved 60 basis points to 24.6%, or 24% in the prior-year quarter as top line growth, mixed benefits, productivity and cost control initiatives more than offset currency pressure.
Before turning the call over to Rich, I wanted to provide some commentary in our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors. 
For those of you who have not heard of Ottens, they were a privately held company at Philadelphia. It has approximately $60 million in annual sales and 170 employees. They are all well-known for their diverse flavor technologies, strong talent base and long term reputation for high-quality customer service. 
IFF and Ottens Flavors shares rich histories, world-class and complementary R&D capabilities and a strong commitment to innovative quality products with a keen focus on the customer. The deal was strengthen our operations in North America, improving our market share in this key developed market and increase our ability to meet the needs of our customers especially the faster growing strategic accounts. The impact of this transaction is not included in our guidance for 2015. 
With that, I would like to now introduce Rich."

We're up 6% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in both EAME and Greater Asia. Overall performance was driven by new wins across both businesses and lower volume erosion on existing business, namely in our Flavors business. 
While currency neutral sales were strong, net sales on a reported basis rose 1% reflecting a strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most global currencies. Adjusted gross profit margin remained constant at 44.7% as sales growth, cost-savings initiative and mixed benefits were offset by an unfavorable net impact of price to input cost and foreign exchange headwinds.
Our adjusted operating profit grew $4 [ph] million or 2% to $163 million and adjusting operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 21%, driven by sales growth and expense leverage that more than offset currency headwinds. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $1.45 driven by improvements in adjusted operating profit, foreign exchange gains and working capital in other income, a lower adjusted effective tax rate and interest expense as well as reduced shares outstanding.
As i did in our Q4 earnings call, I wanted to show the 2-year average currency neutral sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trend. As you can see, in Q1, currency neutral sales continued to grow at the upper end of our long term guidance range, increasing 6% on a 2-year average basis. Relative to the market, we believe we are outperforming which is indicative of market share gains.
We continued benefit from our diverse portfolio end used product categories with strong growth in Flavors and Consumer Fragrances, and in geographies with growth in 3 of 4 regions. 
Adjusted RSA expenses as a percent of sales declined 20 basis points from 24% to 23.8%. The year-over-year decline was driven by cost control initiatives and the favorable impact from currency which is partially offset by higher amortization and incentive compensation expense. Maintaining cost discipline and implementing process improvements remain our corporate priority. And by doing so, allows us to reinvest into R&D and commercial resources to drive longer term growth. In Q1, R&D as a percentage of sales remained within our 8% to 9% range at 8.2% of sales.
From a currency perspective, Q1 was challenging as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. We have a natural hedge given our considerable operations in Europe along with pricing mechanism in the most emerging markets. In addition, we proactively hedged our net euro exposure through raw material purchases. However, the recent volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our results. In particular,, the weakening of the U.S. -- the euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure had the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies such as the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound and Japanese yen weakened versus the U.S. dollar, further pressuring Q1 results.
We did experience a modest gain from our transactional euro hedging program. However, the benefits of this program are more back half weighted based on the phasing of the program this year. As a result, foreign exchange movements in Q1 had a 5 percentage point impact on topline compared to a 7 percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit and 3 percentage point impact on adjusted EPS.
For the full year 2015, we remain approximately 70% hedged on a euro exposure at a rate close to the full year average of 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure in 2015, based on the April rate of $1.08, we believe it will have approximately 7 percentage point impact on sales and approximately 4 to 5 percentage points impact in operating profit. This impact is included in our full year guidance which Andreas will speak about momentarily. 
Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $31 million compared to $35 million in the prior year period. Improvements in net income and inventory during the quarter as well as lower incentive compensation payouts were more than offset by a $50 million incremental pension contribution which strengthened the funded status of our largest plans.
Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q1 was down 70 basis points to approximately 29.1% of our trailing 12 month sales.
From a capital structure standpoint, we expect to spend between 4% and 4.5% of sales in 2015 on growth and infrastructure initiatives, specifically our new plants in Turkey and Indonesia. After this year, we expect capital spending to begin to revert back to more normalized levels at 3% to 3.5% of sales for this foreseeable future. 
Regarding cash returned to shareholders in the first quarter, we spend about approximately $38 million on dividend payouts and $11 million on share repurchases. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas."

Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. On a currency neutral basis, we expect all of our key financial metrics, sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to be in line with our long term targets. 
Yet, if global currencies remain where they were in April for the balance of the year, we expect adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to grow to a low to mid-single digits including the impact of currency as well as initiating investments in R&D and commercial resources based on our new strategy to drive long term growth, which will be communicated in June. 
For second quarter of 2015, we expect currency neutral sales trends in Flavors to continue, albeit at a level more in line with our long term target range. And Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in our Fine business and continue to see good growth in Consumer Fragrances. 
And while we expect to see improved volume trends in Ingredients over the course of the year, we still expect year-over-year declines in the second quarter. From a profitability perspective, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind in quarter 2, which will pressure our reported results. 
In summary, we have started the year well as we achieved all our key financial objectives on currency neutral basis by simultaneously investing for the future growth of our business. In addition, for the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the new site in Chicago and the renovation of South Africa, we continue to reinvest in R&D and commercial initiatives to build competitive advantage longer-term. 
Diversity is not only a strength of IFF, it is a source of our stability. It begins in the way we operate, what we offer and where and extend to consumers around the world who have made our customers products part of their everyday lives. This unique profile provides us with the confidence that we should be able to deliver financial results in line with our long term targets on a currency neutral basis. 
Before I open it up to questions, I want to take a moment to explain how excited I am about the opportunities to unveil and discuss our refresh strategy with you on June 2 at our Investor Day here in New York City. It will be a great chance for us to share our 2020 aspirations and speak to the opportunities where we can further differentiate ourselves from the competition and provide innovative solutions for our customers. For those interested in attending, I ask that you reach out to Michael to register for the event. My hope is that you will not only have a chance to hear Vision 2020 but I'll also provide you with an opportunity to experience some of our excellent R&D capabilities. 
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter, then Rich will review our consolidated financial results in greater detail and turn the call back over to me for comments on the balance of the year and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions. 
We are pleased with our operational performance in quarter 1. On a currency neutral basis, we delivered mid-single digit sales growth and double-digit increases in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. At the same time, we continued to invest in the business to support our strategic goal by bolstering our Flavors business with the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the opening of a new sales and creative facility near Chicago and the expansion of our creative center in South Africa. 
Currency neutral sales this quarter grew 6% on a consolidated basis, primarily driven by new win performance across both businesses. Currency neutral sales to the emerging markets, which now represents 51% of total company sales, grew 9%, twice of the rate of sales of the developed markets which we'll focus then. 
Adjusted operating profit grew 10% on a currency neutral basis to $163 million and adjusted operating profit margin was 21%. This improvement was driven by strong sales growth combined with manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. 
From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we also benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, interest expense and shares outstanding. The net result drove a 13% improvement in adjusted EPS on a currency neutral basis to $1.45 per share in the quarter.
In Fragrances, currently currency neutral sales grew 5% in quarter 1 as most regions delivered mid to high and single-digit growth. In the emerging markets, our Fragrance Compounds business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrances, grew 8% while the developed market grew by 4%. 
On a category basis, Consumer Fragrances continued to be our strongest performer, growing 9% as Fabric Care and Home Care grew strong double digits. EAME and Latin America both grew high-single digits followed by mid-single digits in North America and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 14th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrances growth. 
Fine Fragrances, currency neutral sales declined by 2% against the very strong 10% growth reported in the year-ago period. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by softness in North America and EAME, both of which compared to a strong double-digit growth in the prior year period. If you recall, our quarter 1 performance was our strongest of 2014 as it benefited from a customer pre-building inventory before implementing SAP. 
In Fragrance Ingredients, currency neutral sales declined 2% as it compared to the strongest year-over-year comparison. From a profitability perspective, Fragrances segment profit decreased 6% to $82 million and segment profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 20.5% as the unfavorable net impact of price to input costs and currency pressures more than offset productivity and cost-control initiatives.
Turning to Flavors. For 41 consecutive quarters, Flavors reported positive currency neutral sales growth, increasing 9% in the first quarter. While overall market performance was driven by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, the developed markets also posted gains, increasing 7% year-over-year.
On a category basis, the strong trends we saw last quarter continued as Beverages grew double-digit with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was a result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions with satisfying consumer desires for healthier products.
It also should be noted that all other regions within our Flavors business achieved solid growth led by high single-digit increase in Dairy and mid-single-digit increase in Sweet and Savory. 
On a regional perspective. Greater Asia posted 4% currency neutral sales growth led by double-digit improvement in Beverages and a high single-digit increase in Savory. Southeast Asia, India and Japan all reported growth while China continued to be soft.
In EAME, currency neutral sales growth was strong, increasing 9%. Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverage and high single-digit increase in Sweet, all the result of new win performance. 
In North America, conditions continued to improve versus the middle of 2014, growing a robust 10% year-over-year in quarter 1. This improvement can primarily be attributed to a strong double-digit growth in Dairy, Sweet and Beverage, all of which were a result of strong innovations and our recent investments to drive consumer intimacy in this key market.
For the sixth consecutive quarter, Latin America grew double digit, up 21% on a currency neutral basis. This performance continues to be driven by innovation, in particular, our successful proprietary delivery system. From a profitability perspective, Flavors segment profit increased 5% to $93 million in quarter 1. Segment profit margin improved 60 basis points to 24.6% from 24% in the prior-year quarter as top line growth, mix benefits, productivity and cost-control initiatives more than offset currency pressure.
Before turning the call over to Rich, I wanted to provide some commentary in our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors. 
For those of you who have not heard of Ottens, they were a privately held company headquartered in Philadelphia. It has approximately $60 million in annual sales and 170 employees. They are all well-known for their diverse flavor technologies, strong talent base and long-term reputation for high-quality customer service. 
IFF and Ottens Flavors share rich histories, world-class and complementary R&D capabilities and a strong commitment to innovative quality products with a keen focus on the customer. The deal will strengthen our operations in North America, improving our market share in this key developed market and increase our ability to meet the needs of our customers especially the faster-growing strategic accounts. The impact of this transaction is not included in our guidance for 2015. 
With that, I would like to now introduce Rich."
281407,291436133,812367,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 12, 2015",2015-05-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andreas.

We're up 6% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in both EAME and Greater Asia. Overall performance was driven by new wins across both businesses and lower volume erosion on existing business, namely in our Flavors business. 
While currency neutral sales were strong, net sales on a reported basis rose 1%, reflecting a strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most global currencies. Adjusted gross profit margin remained constant at 44.7% as sales growth, cost-savings initiative and mix benefits were offset by an unfavorable net impact of price to input costs and foreign exchange headwinds.
Our adjusted operating profit grew $4 million or 2% to $163 million, and adjusting operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 21%, driven by sales growth and expense leverage that more than offset currency headwinds. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $1.45, driven by improvements in adjusted operating profit, foreign exchange gains on working capital and other income, a lower adjusted effective tax rate and interest expense as well as a reduced shares outstanding.
As I did on our Q4 earnings call, I wanted to show the 2-year average currency neutral sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trend. As you can see, in Q1, currency neutral sales continued to grow at the upper end of our long-term guidance range, increasing 6% on a 2-year average basis. Relative to the market, we believe we are outperforming, which is indicative of market share gains.
We continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end-use product categories with strong growth in Flavors and Consumer Fragrances, and in geographies with growth in 3 of 4 regions. 
Adjusted RSA expenses as a percent of sales declined 20 basis points from 24% to 23.8%. The year-over-year decline was driven by cost-control initiatives and a favorable impact from currency, which is partially offset by higher amortization and incentive compensation expense. Maintaining cost discipline and implementing process improvements remain a priority. And by doing so, allows us to reinvest into R&D and commercial resources to drive longer-term growth. In Q1, R&D as a percentage of sales remained within our 8% to 9% range at 8.2% of sales.
From a currency perspective, Q1 was challenging as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. We have a natural hedge given our considerable operations in Europe along with pricing mechanism in most emerging markets. In addition, we proactively hedged our net euro exposure through raw material purchases. However, the recent volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our results. In particular, the weakening of the U.S. -- the euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure had the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies such as the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound and Japanese yen weakened versus the U.S. dollar, further pressuring Q1 results.
We did experience a modest gain from our transactional euro hedging program. However, the benefits of this program are more back-half weighted based on the phasing of the program this year. As a result, foreign exchange movements in Q1 had a 5 percentage point impact on top line compared to a 7 percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit and 3 percentage point impact on adjusted EPS.
For the full year 2015, we remain approximately 70% hedged on a euro exposure at a rate close to the full year average of 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure in 2015, based on the April rate of $1.08, we believe it will have approximately 7 percentage point impact on sales and approximately 4 to 5 percentage points impact on operating profit. This impact is included in our full year guidance which Andreas will speak about momentarily. 
Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $31 million compared to $35 million in the prior-year period. Improvements in net income and inventory during the quarter as well as incentive -- lower incentive compensation payouts were more than offset by a $50 million incremental pension contribution which strengthened the funded status of our largest plans. Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q1 was down 70 basis points to approximately 29.1% of our trailing 12 month sales. 
From a capital structure standpoint, we expect to spend between 4% and 4.5% of sales in 2015 on growth in infrastructure initiatives, specifically our new plants in Turkey and Indonesia. After this year, we expect capital spending to begin to revert back to more normalized levels at 3% to 3.5% of sales for this foreseeable future. 
Regarding cash returned to shareholders in the first quarter, we spend about approximately $38 million on dividend payouts and $11 million on share repurchases. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Andreas."

Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. On a currency neutral basis, we expect all of our key financial metrics, sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to be in line with our long-term targets. 
Yet, if global currencies remain where they were in April for the balance of the year, we expect adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to grow low to mid-single digits, including the impact of currency as well as initiating investments in R&D and commercial resources based on our new strategy to drive long-term growth, which will be communicated in June. 
For second quarter of 2015, we expect currency neutral sales trends in Flavors to continue, albeit at a level more in line with our long-term target range. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in our Fine business and continue to see good growth in Consumer Fragrances. And while we expect to see improved volume trends in Ingredients over the course of the year, we still expect year-over-year declines in the second quarter. From a profitability perspective, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind in quarter 2, which will pressure our reported results. 
In summary, we have started the year well as we have achieved all our key financial objectives on currency neutral basis by simultaneously investing for the future growth of our business. In addition, for the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the new site in Chicago and the renovation of South Africa, we continue to reinvest in R&D and commercial initiatives to build competitive advantage longer term. 
Diversity is not only a strength of IFF, it is a source of our stability. It begins in the way we operate, what we offer and where and extend to consumers around the world who have made our customers products part of their everyday lives. This unique profile provides us with the confidence that we should be able to deliver financial results in line with our long-term targets on a currency neutral basis. 
Before I open it up to questions, I want to take a moment to explain how excited I am about the opportunities to unveil and discuss our refresh strategy with you on June 2 at our Investor Day here in New York City. It will be a great chance for us to share our 2020 aspirations and speak to the opportunities where we can further differentiate ourselves from the competition and provide innovative solutions for our customers. For those interested in attending, I ask that you reach out to Michael to register for the event. My hope is that you will not only have a chance to hear our vision 2020, but I'll also provide you with an opportunity to experience some of our excellent R&D capabilities.

I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter, then Rich will review our consolidated financial results in greater detail and turn the call back over to me for comments on the balance of the year and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions. 
We are pleased with our operational performance in quarter 1. On a currency neutral basis, we delivered mid-single digit sales growth and double-digit increases in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. At the same time, we continued to invest in the business to support our strategic goals by bolstering our Flavors business with the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the opening of a new sales and creative facility near Chicago and the expansion of our creative center in South Africa. 
Currency neutral sales this quarter grew 6% on a consolidated basis, primarily driven by new win performance across both businesses. Currency neutral sales to the emerging markets, which now represent 51% of total company sales, grew 9%, twice of the rate of sales of the developed markets, which were 4%. 
Adjusted operating profit grew 10% on a currency neutral basis to $163 million and adjusted operating profit margin was 21%. This improvement was driven by strong sales growth combined with manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. 
From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we also benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, interest expense and shares outstanding. The net result drove a 13% improvement in adjusted EPS on a currency neutral basis to $1.45 per share in the quarter.
In Fragrances, currency neutral sales grew 5% in quarter 1 as most regions delivered mid to high and single-digit growth. In the emerging markets, our Fragrance Compounds business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrances, grew 8% while the developed market grew by 4%. 
On a category basis, Consumer Fragrances continued to be our strongest performer, growing 9% as Fabric Care and Home Care grew strong double digits. EAME and Latin America both grew high-single digits followed by mid-single digits in North America and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 14th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrances growth. 
Fine Fragrances, currency neutral sales declined by 2% against a very strong 10% growth reported in the year-ago period. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by softness in North America and EAME, both of which compared to a strong double-digit growth in the prior year period. If you recall, our quarter 1 performance was our strongest of 2014 as it benefited from a customer pre-building inventory before implementing SAP. 
In Fragrance Ingredients, currency neutral sales declined 2%, as it compared to the strongest year-over-year comparison. From a profitability perspective, Fragrances segment profit decreased 6% to $82 million and segment profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 20.5% as the unfavorable net impact of price to input cost and currency pressures more than offset productivity and cost-control initiatives.
Turning to Flavors. For 41 consecutive quarters, Flavors reported positive currency neutral sales growth, increasing 9% in the first quarter. While overall market performance was driven by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, the developed markets also posted gains, increasing 7% year-over-year.
On a category basis, the strong trends we saw last quarter continued as Beverages grew double-digit with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was a result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions with us satisfying consumer desires for healthier products.
It also should be noted that all other regions within our Flavors business achieved solid growth led by high single-digit increase in Dairy and mid-single-digit increase in Sweet and Savory. 
On a regional perspective. Greater Asia posted 4% currency neutral sales growth led by double-digit improvement in Beverages and a high single-digit increase in Savory. Southeast Asia, India and Japan all reported growth while China continued to be soft.
In EAME, currency neutral sales growth was strong, increasing 9%. Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverage and high single-digit increase in Sweet, all the result of new win performance. 
In North America, conditions continued to improve versus the middle of 2014, growing a robust 10% year-over-year in quarter 1. This improvement can primarily be attributed to a strong double-digit growth in Dairy, Sweet and Beverage, all of which were a result of strong innovations and our recent investments to drive consumer intimacy in this key market.
For the sixth consecutive quarter, Latin America grew double digit, up 21% on a currency neutral basis. This performance continues to be driven by innovation, in particular, our successful proprietary delivery system. From a profitability perspective, Flavors segment profit increased 5% to $93 million in quarter 1. Segment profit margin improved 60 basis points to 24.6% from 24% in the prior-year quarter as top line growth, mix benefits, productivity and cost-control initiatives more than offset currency pressure.
Before turning the call over to Rich, I wanted to provide some commentary in our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors. 
For those of you who have not heard of Ottens, they were a privately held company headquartered in Philadelphia. It has approximately $60 million in annual sales and 170 employees. They are all well-known for their diverse flavor technologies, strong talent base and long-term reputation for high-quality customer service. 
IFF and Ottens Flavors share rich histories, world-class and complementary R&D capabilities and a strong commitment to innovative quality products with a keen focus on the customer. The deal will strengthen our operations in North America, improving our market share in this key developed market and increase our ability to meet the needs of our customers, especially the faster-growing strategic accounts. The impact of this transaction is not included in our guidance for 2015. 
With that, I would like to now introduce Rich."
281407,291436133,812516,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 12, 2015",2015-05-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andreas.

We're up 6% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in both EAME and Greater Asia. Overall performance was driven by new wins across both businesses and lower volume erosion on existing business, mainly in our Flavors business. 
While currency neutral sales were strong, net sales on a reported basis rose 1%, reflecting a strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most global currencies. Adjusted gross profit margin remained constant at 44.7% as sales growth, cost-savings initiative and mix benefits were offset by an unfavorable net impact of price to input costs and foreign exchange headwinds.
Our adjusted operating profit grew $4 million or 2% to $163 million, and adjusted operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 21%, driven by sales growth and expense leverage that more than offset currency headwinds. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $1.45, driven by improvements in adjusted operating profit, foreign exchange gains on working capital and other income, a lower adjusted effective tax rate and interest expense as well as a reduced shares outstanding.
As I did on our Q4 earnings call, I wanted to show the 2-year average currency neutral sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trend. As you can see, in Q1, currency neutral sales continued to grow at the upper end of our long-term guidance range, increasing 6% on a 2-year average basis. Relative to the market, we believe we are outperforming, which is indicative of market share gains.
We continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end-use product categories with strong growth in Flavors and Consumer Fragrances, and in geographies with growth in 3 of 4 regions. 
Adjusted RSA expenses as a percent of sales declined 20 basis points from 24% to 23.8%. The year-over-year decline was driven by cost-control initiatives and a favorable impact from currency, which is partially offset by higher amortization and incentive compensation expense. Maintaining cost discipline and implementing process improvements remain a priority. And by doing so, allows us to reinvest into R&D and commercial resources to drive longer-term growth. In Q1, R&D as a percentage of sales remain within our 8% to 9% range at 8.2% of sales.
From a currency perspective, Q1 was challenging as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. We have a natural hedge given our considerable operations in Europe along with pricing mechanism in most emerging markets. In addition, we proactively hedged our net euro exposure through raw material purchases. However, the recent volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our results. In particular, the weakening of the U.S. -- the euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure had the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies such as the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound and Japanese yen weakened versus the U.S. dollar, further pressuring Q1 results.
We did experience a modest gain from our transactional euro hedging program. However, the benefits of this program are more back-half weighted based on the phasing of the program this year. As a result, foreign exchange movements in Q1 had a 5 percentage point impact on top line compared to a 7 percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit and 3 percentage point impact on adjusted EPS.
For the full year 2015, we remain approximately 70% hedged on a euro exposure at a rate close to the full year average of 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure in 2015, based on the April rate of $1.08, we believe it will have approximately 7 percentage point impact on sales and approximately 4 to 5 percentage points impact on operating profit. This impact is included in our full year guidance, which Andreas will speak about momentarily. 
Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $31 million compared to $35 million in the prior-year period. Improvements in net income and inventory during the quarter as well as incentive -- lower incentive compensation payouts were more than offset by a $50 million incremental pension contribution which strengthened the funded status of our largest plans. Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q1 was down 70 basis points to approximately 29.1% of our trailing 12 month sales. 
From a capital structure standpoint, we expect to spend between 4% and 4.5% of sales in 2015 on growth in infrastructure initiatives, specifically our new plants in Turkey and Indonesia. After this year, we expect capital spending to begin to revert back to more normalized levels at 3% to 3.5% of sales for this foreseeable future. 
Regarding cash returned to shareholders in the first quarter, we spend about approximately $38 million on dividend payouts and $11 million on share repurchases. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Andreas."

Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. On a currency neutral basis, we expect all of our key financial metrics, sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to be in line with our long-term targets. 
Yet, if global currencies remain where they were in April for the balance of the year, we expect adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to grow low to mid-single digits, including the impact of currency as well as initiating investments in R&D and commercial resources based on our new strategy to drive long-term growth, which will be communicated in June. 
For second quarter of 2015, we expect currency neutral sales trends in Flavors to continue, albeit at a level more in line with our long-term target range. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in our Fine business and continue to see good growth in Consumer Fragrances. And while we expect to see improved volume trends in Ingredients over the course of the year, we still expect year-over-year declines in the second quarter. From a profitability perspective, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind in quarter 2, which will pressure our reported results. 
In summary, we have started the year well as we have achieved all our key financial objectives on currency neutral basis by simultaneously investing for the future growth of our business. In addition, for the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the new site in Chicago and the renovation of South Africa, we continue to reinvest in R&D and commercial initiatives to build competitive advantage longer term.

I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. Then Rich will review our consolidated financial results in greater detail and turn the call back over to me for comments on the balance of the year and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions. 
We are pleased with our operational performance in quarter 1. On a currency neutral basis, we delivered mid-single digit sales growth and double-digit increases in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. At the same time, we continued to invest in the business to support our strategic goals by bolstering our Flavors business with the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the opening of a new sales and creative facility near Chicago and the expansion of our creative center in South Africa. 
Currency neutral sales this quarter grew 6% on a consolidated basis, primarily driven by new win performance across both businesses. Currency neutral sales to the emerging markets, which now represent 51% of total company sales, grew 9%, twice of the rate of sales of the developed markets, which grew 4%. 
Adjusted operating profit grew 10% on a currency neutral basis to $163 million and adjusted operating profit margin was 21%. This improvement was driven by strong sales growth combined with manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. 
From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we also benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, interest expense and shares outstanding. The net result drove a 13% improvement in adjusted EPS on a currency neutral basis to $1.45 per share in the quarter.
In Fragrances, currency neutral sales grew 5% in quarter 1 as most regions delivered mid to high and single-digit growth. In the emerging markets, our Fragrance Compounds business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrances, grew 8% while the developed market grew by 4%. 
On a category basis, Consumer Fragrances continue to be our strongest performer, growing 9% as Fabric Care and Home Care grew strong double digits. EAME and Latin America both grew high single digits followed by mid-single digits in North America and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 14th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrances growth. 
Fine Fragrances, currency neutral sales declined by 2% against a very strong 10% growth reported in the year ago period. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by softness in North America and EAME, both of which compared to a strong double-digit growth in the prior year period. If you recall, our quarter 1 performance was our strongest of 2014 as it benefited from a customer prebuilding inventory before implementing SAP. 
In Fragrance Ingredients, currency neutral sales declined 2% as they compared to their strongest year-over-year comparison. From a profitability perspective, Fragrances segment profit decreased 6% to $82 million and segment profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 20.5% as the unfavorable net impact of price to input costs and currency pressures more than offset productivity and cost control initiatives.
Turning to Flavors. For 41 consecutive quarters, Flavors reported positive currency neutral sales growth, increasing 9% in the first quarter. While overall market performance was driven by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, the developed markets also posted gains, increasing 7% year-over-year. On a category basis, the strong trends we saw last quarter continued as Beverages grew double digit with broad based growth across all regions. This strong performance was a result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solution with us satisfying consumer desires for healthier product.
It also should be noted that all other regions within our Flavors business achieved solid growth led by high single-digit increase in Dairy and mid-single-digit increase in Sweet and Savory. On a regional perspective, Greater Asia posted 4% currency neutral sales growth led by a double-digit improvement in Beverage and a high single-digit increase in Savory. Southeast Asia, India and Japan all reported growth while China continued to be soft.
In EAME, currency neutral sales growth was strong, increasing 9%. Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverage and high single-digit increase in Sweet, all the result of new win performance. 
In North America, conditions continued to improve versus the middle of 2014, growing a robust 10% year-over-year in quarter 1. This improvement can primarily be attributed to a strong double-digit growth in Dairy, Sweet and Beverage, all of which were a result of strong innovation and our recent investments to drive consumer intimacy in this key market.
For the sixth consecutive quarter, Latin America grew double digit, up 21% on a currency neutral basis. This performance continues to be driven by innovation, in particular our successful proprietary delivery system. From a profitability perspective, Flavor segment profit increased 5% to $93 million in quarter 1. Segment profit margin improved 60 basis points to 24.6% from 24% in the prior year quarter as top line growth, mix benefits, productivity and cost control initiatives more than offset currency pressure.
Before turning the call over to Rich, I wanted to provide some commentary on our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors. For those of you who have not heard of Ottens, they were a privately held company headquartered in Philadelphia with approximately $60 million in annual sales and 170 employees. They are all well-known for their diverse flavor technologies, strong talent base and long-term reputation for high-quality customer service. 
IFF and Ottens Flavors share rich histories, world-class and complementary R&D capabilities and a strong commitment to innovative quality products with a keen focus on the customer. The deal will strengthen our operations in North America, improving our market share in this key developed market and increase our ability to meet the needs of our customers, especially the faster growing strategic accounts. The impact of this transaction is not included in our guidance for 2015. 
With that, I would like to now introduce Rich."
281407,291436133,832019,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 12, 2015",2015-05-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andreas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Net sales in the first quarter were up 6% on a currency neutral basis led by double-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in both EAME and Greater Asia. Overall performance w",824,"Thanks, Andreas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Net sales in the first quarter were up 6% on a currency neutral basis led by double-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in both EAME and Greater Asia. Overall performance was driven by new wins across both businesses and lower volume erosion on existing business, mainly in our Flavors business. 
While currency neutral sales were strong, net sales on a reported basis rose 1%, reflecting a strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most global currencies. Adjusted gross profit margin remained constant at 44.7% as sales growth, cost savings initiative and mix benefits were offset by an unfavorable net impact of price to input costs and foreign exchange headwinds.
Our adjusted operating profit grew $4 million or 2% to $163 million, and adjusted operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 21%, driven by sales growth and expense leverage that more than offset currency headwinds. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $1.45, driven by improvements in adjusted operating profit, foreign exchange gains on working capital and other income, a lower adjusted effective tax rate and interest expense as well as a reduced shares outstanding.
As I did on our Q4 earnings call, I wanted to show the 2-year average currency neutral sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trend. As you can see, in Q1, currency neutral sales continued to grow at the upper end of our long-term guidance range, increasing 6% on a 2-year average basis. Relative to the market, we believe we are outperforming, which is indicative of market share gains. We continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end-use product categories with strong growth in Flavors and Consumer Fragrances, and in geographies with growth in 3 of 4 regions. 
Adjusted RSA expenses as a percent of sales declined 20 basis points from 24% to 23.8%. The year-over-year decline was driven by cost control initiatives and a favorable impact from currency, which is partially offset by higher amortization and incentive compensation expense. Maintaining cost discipline and implementing process improvements remain a priority. And by doing so, allows us to reinvest into R&D and commercial resources to drive longer-term growth. In Q1, R&D as a percentage of sales remained within our 8% to 9% range at 8.2% of sales.
From a currency perspective, Q1 was challenging as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. We have a natural hedge given our considerable operations in Europe along with pricing mechanism in most emerging markets. In addition, we proactively hedge our net euro exposure through raw material purchases. However, the recent volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our results. In particular, the weakening of the U.S. -- the euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure had the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies such as the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound and Japanese yen weakened versus the U.S. dollar further pressuring Q1 results.
We did experience a modest gain from our transactional euro hedging program. However, the benefits of this program are more back-half weighted based on the phasing of the program this year. As a result, foreign exchange movements in Q1 had a 5 percentage point impact on top line compared to a 7 percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit and 3 percentage point impact on adjusted EPS.
For the full year 2015, we remain approximately 70% hedged on a euro exposure at a rate close to the full year average of 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure in 2015, based on the April rate of $1.08, we believe it will have approximately 7 percentage point impact on sales and approximately 4 to 5 percentage points impact on operating profit. This impact is included in our full year guidance, which Andreas will speak about momentarily. 
Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $31 million compared to $35 million in the prior year period. Improvements in net income and inventory during the quarter as well as incentive -- lower incentive compensation payouts were more than offset by a $50 million incremental pension contribution which strengthened the funded status of our largest plans. Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q1 was down 70 basis points to approximately 29.1% of our trailing 12-month sales. 
From a capital structure standpoint, we expect to spend between 4% and 4.5% of sales in 2015 on growth, infrastructure initiatives, specifically our new plants in Turkey and Indonesia. After this year, we expect capital spending to begin to revert back to more normalized levels at 3% to 3.5% of sales for this foreseeable future. Regarding cash returned to shareholders in the first quarter, we have spent about approximately $38 million on dividend payouts and $11 million on share repurchases. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Andreas."

Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. On a currency neutral basis, we expect all of our key financial metrics, sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS,",483,"Thank you, Rich. Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. On a currency neutral basis, we expect all of our key financial metrics, sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, to be in line with our long-term targets. 
Yet, if global currencies remain where they were in April for the balance of the year, we expect adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to grow low to mid-single digits, including the impact of currency as well as initiating investments in R&D and commercial resources based on our new strategy to drive long-term growth, which will be communicated in June. 
For the second quarter of 2015, we expect currency neutral sales trends in Flavors to continue, albeit at a level more in line with our long-term target range. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in our Fine business and continue to see good growth in Consumer Fragrances. And while we expect to see improved volume trends in Ingredients over the course of the year, we still expect year-over-year declines in the second quarter. From a profitability perspective, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind in quarter 2, which will pressure our reported results. 
In summary, we have started the year well as we have achieved all our key financial objectives on currency neutral basis while simultaneously investing for the future growth of our business. In addition, for the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the new site in Chicago and the renovation of South Africa, we continue to reinvest in R&D and commercial initiatives to build competitive advantage longer term. 
Diversity is not only a strength of IFF, it is a source of our stability. It begins in the way we operate, what we offer and where and extends to consumers around the world who have made our customers' products part of their everyday lives. This unique profile provides us with the confidence that we should be able to deliver financial results in line with our long-term targets on a currency neutral basis. 
Before I open it up to questions, I want to take a moment to explain how excited I am about the opportunity to unveil and discuss our refresh strategy with you on June 2 at our Investor Day here in New York City. It will be a great chance for us to share our 2020 aspirations and speak to the opportunities where we can further differentiate ourselves from the competition and provide innovative solutions for our customers to win in the marketplace. For those interested in attending, I ask that you reach out to Michael to register for the event. My hope is that you will not only have a chance to hear our Vision 2020, but also provide you with an opportunity to experience some of our excellent R&D capabilities. 
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

Once finished, level as Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including a specific on each business units and take us through our outlook for the balance of the year. Before opening the call two questions, I will come back to finish out with some comments.
Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid as we delivered results in line with the guidance we provided at our recent Investor Day. Currency neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 1 percentage point relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. 
Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins, which remains strong as both businesses reported solid growth. Adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that when combined with slower research, selling and admin expenses led to 40 basis points improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved by 10% as we gained additional leverage below the line with lower effective tax rate and a year-over-year decrease in average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.
As we are now at the midpoint of 2015, I felt it was appropriate to highlight our first half results. As you can see on this slide, all our key metrics are at or above our currency neutral long-term targets of 4% to 6% sales growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth. Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 6%, was 8% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Adjusting operating profit grew 9% on a currency neutral basis, driven by strong sales growth, benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing cost leverage. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11% in the first half of 2015.
At our Investor Day in June, we unveiled our Vision 2020 strategy, which focuses on building greater differentiation, accelerated profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. Our strategy has 4 pillars. The first one, win where we compete. Our goal to achieve the #1 or 2 market position in key markets and categories and with specific customers. For example, in North America, our home market, where we have an opportunity to increase our market share. We also identified that we want to win in Africa and Middle East, the new frontier in emerging markets, relatively small now but one of the fastest-growing areas in the world. There are also categories, such as Home Care and Fragrances as well as several customers which I cannot name but are going well. 
The second pillar, innovating first. We are also looking to strengthen our position and drive differentiation and priority R&D platforms. During our strategy review process, we evaluated our investment in both existing and new platforms. A disciplined approach starts with our ability to determine the market size and based on the consumer needs states. 
Next, we [indiscernible] our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account the technical likelihood of success and commercial potential. We then conducted a full evaluation of the technology degree of fit within our strategy and made the decision to focus on the highest return opportunities. This includes doubling down on focusing on key initiatives, such as delivery systems, modulation, new molecules and naturals across both businesses.
The third one, become our customer partner of choice. IFF has always been committed to growing our customer intimacy. In Vision 2020, our goal is to take that one step further so that we attain commercial expense by further provider our customers with in-depth local consumer understanding, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service and the highest-quality products. This in turn should allow us to become an essential partner and ultimately lead the incremental business opportunities for our customers as well as IFF.
The fourth pillar is strength and expanding the portfolio. As you have seen over the past couple of months, we effectively pursued value-creating partnerships, collaboration acquisition, both within our industry and adjacencies. These opportunities, some of which I will touch on in a moment, will allow us to tap areas of expertise beyond the walls of IFF, leading to more innovation and ultimately, additional growth.
The 3 enablers to the strategy include talent in organizations with some investment in our people in R&D, continuous improvements as a relentless focus on finding efficiency and streaming processes to reinvest in the business. And sustainability, strengthening sustained progress and become a leader within our industry.
While we are still early in days of execution, we are seeing that our strategies imperatives are the right ones. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are seeing accelerated growth. We continue to leverage our long-standing presence in the emerging markets as they grew 7% on a currency neutral base led by 22% increase in the Middle East and Africa and strong growth in India, Brazil and Argentina. 
We also improved our market share in North America, achieving the #2 position in Flavors after successfully closing the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. Home Care, another strategic priority for us, has increased high single digits globally on a currency neutral basis.
Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continue to drive growth. The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverages continued in the second quarter, led by our encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery system in Flavors. 
In Fragrances, Fabric Care grew mid-teens on a currency neutral basis, driven by our encapsulation technology. We're extending this technology into other categories, such as Toiletries, Home Care and personal wash, which all grew double digits in the second quarter.
In Flavors, Latin America continued its double-digit trend for the seventh consecutive quarter, led by our proprietary delivery system. 
We are very pleased with our sales, our Sweet and Savory modulation portfolio improved strong double-digits, an example that we are providing our customers with innovative solution that win in the marketplace with consumers.
Our continued commitment to provide our customers with in-depth consumer and understanding superior innovation, outstanding service and highest-quality products allow us to capture the growth potential of faster-growing regional accounts. Most notably in Flavors in the second quarter, which outpaced the growth of global accounts. We brought in our product offering, expanding it to more rapidly growing cosmetic actives. With the recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, offering our customers greater option to support this strategic growth initiatives in skin and hair care.
In addition, in Fragrance Ingredients, we launched and market Amber Xtreme, a unique and innovative or effective ingredient of that was previously for the exclusive use of IFF perfumers and is now available for both use within the Fragrance industry.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, we successfully completed the Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer cosmetic acquisitions. We recently signed a partnership with Duke University focusing on finding effective flavor modulators that are novel to our industry, and we are collaborating with University of Liverpool to enhance our delivery system capabilities in Fragrances.
Before turning the call over to Alison, I wanted to provide some additional commentary on our recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is headquartered in Québec city, Canada, with operations in France and Australia. They develop, manufacture and market innovative ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industry. Their products are designed to maintain the body's natural reactions, strengthen its defense against incremental aggressions, delay the signs of aging and address other contemporary this meta- challenges. Some of the benefits of the active ingredients include wrinkle reduction, skin firming and protection from free radicals, among others.
We target Lucas Meyer as a partner as it is an award-winning company with strong proprietary portfolio and great customer relationships. We believe they have a strong fit with IFF's core competencies and strategic assets, including a similar customer base allowing us to build greater customer intimacy and drive penetration into the skincare and hair care businesses through an expanding product offerings. 
Innovation is critical to both industries, and we expect that we can cross leverage shared expertise in analytical research, sensory science and consumer insights. We also can combine IFF's industry leading natural products. LMR with Lucas Meyer botanical platform and they have a strong brand recognition, one that stands from the highest level of quality and trust.
The acquisition will allow us to enter an attractive and fast-growing market with approximately $44 million in annual sales and EBITDAR margins much higher than in the Flavors and Fragrances history. We delivered Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is sustainable on a stand-alone basis. And also a great foundation for further consolidation in cosmetics actives. It's truly a great business, and we're excited to have it within the IFF portfolio. 
With that, I would like to turn over to Alison."

I would like to start out by saying how Happy I am to be here at IFF. It is a great time to be part of a company with the history that IFF has, especially as we embark on Vision 2020 where we're looking toward building greater differentiation, accelerating profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. I've been fortunate enough to speak briefly with some of you, but for those of you who I have not met, let me quickly go through my background.
I joined IFF from Covance, a global drug development company with $2.5 billion of sales and 12,500 employees located in 60 countries where, as a Chief Financial Officer, I was responsible all financial management, including financial reporting and analytics, capital allocation and a strategic planning.
During my tenure, there are several areas I'm proud of, but most notably, the fact that we accelerated revenue growth, improved operating performance, streamline processes and develop talent. These are all areas that I believe are transferable to IFF and I am excited to get started.
Part of my time at Convents, I spent 19 years with AT&T and held leadership roles of increasing responsibility, among them, leading finance for a $30 billion division as Vice President, Forecast Performance and Investment Analysis. I look forward to getting to know many of you over the next few months as I get acclimated to the company and support the execution of Vision 2020. 
To provide a greater level of transparency, I thought I would lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to adjusted currency neutral results, highlighting the impact of currency and showing results with and without the acquisition of Ottens. Focusing in on the second column. Q2 was a challenging quarter from a currency perspective as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. From a sales perspective, the translation impact represented approximately 8 percentage points.
On an adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS basis, despite our natural hedge given our considerable operations in Europe and currency hedging program, the volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our adjusted operating profit by 8 percentage points and adjusted EPS by approximately 11 percentage points. Including the acquisition of Ottens, which is seen as in the third column, currency neutral sales increased 5%. Adjusted operating profit, 7% and adjusted EPS, 10%.
This included a lower tax rate due to higher earnings from lower tax jurisdictions, lower loss provisions and lower repatriation cost in 2015 and the benefit of lower shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.
The acquisition, which only included 2 months worth of business added about 1 point to the top line and with a slight benefit to adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. Excluding the acquisition, our organic business performed well, and was in line with the guidance given at our June 2 Investor Day. We manage to achieve good leverage down the P&L with sales improving 4%, adjusted operating profit, up 7% and adjusted operating expense increasing 9%, all in a currency neutral basis.
Before moving forward, I want to take a moment to note that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens acquisition represented about $1.2 million in the quarter. If we added this back to understand the cash component of the business, growth from the profit and EPS perspective would have improved another 1% to 8% and 11%, respectively. 
As we begin to execute to Vision 2020, M&A is expected to play a larger role. Going forward, we will continue to provide analyst, investors with visibility to the amortization of intangible of acquisitions, so you have a better idea of what the actual cash generation is of the business. From an evaluation perspective, we hope it provides an understanding of the returns of any deals we pursue. 
Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency neutral sales grew 7%, including approximately 3 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced store base growth with the strongest results in Beverage and Savory. Greater Asia was up 6%, driven by mid-single-digit gains in Savory, Beverage and Dairy. 
On a constant [ph] perspective, strong growth was a key in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This performance more than offset a solid decline in China where We temporarily stopped production to new install equipment. The plant has been reopened, and we continue to ramp up production working with the government to ensure we are in full compliance. As of last week, our backlog of orders returned to normal levels, and we are either servicing all the camps in our plant in China or other facilities around the world.
Keeping with the subject of China, we have been notably by Chinese authorities of a compliance issue pertaining to the emission of odors in our Fragrance Ingredients plant. We are working to address these issues by making investments in additional odor abatement equipment similar to what we did in Flavors but expect to operate at a reduced capacity, and so that equipment is in installed and fully operational sometime in Q4. Our full year 2015 guidance, which I will touch on in a moment, is inclusive of this matter both from a top line and cost perspective based on returning to normal production later this year.
Turning back to Flavors. In our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, sales increased 6%, led by double-digit gain in Savory and mid-single-digit growth in Beverage. As I'm sure you've mentioned, the Middle East and Africa reported our highest growth, improving over 20%, driven by strong new win performance. North America improved 5% as a result of additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy.
Excluding the transaction, the core North American business was soft as we previously communicated at our Investor Day, principally due to underlying trends with select customers. Latin America increased 14% as all categories report a positive growth. The double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the seventh consecutive quarter. In Savory and Dairy also grew double-digits as a result of strong new win performance.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 1% as top line growth, productivity and cost control initiatives were reduced by a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. Q2 operating profit margin was also impacted by approximately 50 basis points or about 2 percentage points in terms of growth relating to China. Based on what we know today, we would expect a similar impact through the remainder of the year, which is included in our full year 2015 guidance that I will discuss momentarily.
Fragrance currency neutral sales improved 4%, led by double-digit growth in Europe, Africa and Middle East region and a mid-single-digit improvement in Latin America, driven by Consumer Fragrances. 
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was up 2% as Europe, Africa and Middle East grew 17% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins and volume growth. This strong growth more than offset softness in Latin America where economic conditions, particularly in Brazil, have an impact on discretionary spending. While the economy is soft, we continue to see our win rate remain high, which ultimately will continue to support our market leadership position.
For the 15th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continued to grow up 6%, led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care, thanks in large part to our strong technology and high single-digit growth in home care. 
In addition, Hair Care increased high single-digit as a result of new win performance. As previously communicated, Fragrance Ingredients was weak, down 3% as we made a strategic decision not to engage in lower margin businesses and more importantly, to supply and further strengthen our Fragrance Compounds business as our internal demand for our own Ingredients is up double digits. It should be repeated that this weakness is primarily related to one customer, whom, if we exclude the rest of our portfolio, would be up mid-single digits.
On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 5%, driven by volume growth, continued cost savings initiatives and continued productivity program. Segment profit margin on a currency neutral basis increased of 20 basis points to 20.2%.
From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales as our 5 quarter rolling average figure through the end of Q2 was down 120 basis points to approximately 29% of our trailing 12-month sales. Most of our gains came from lower payables as our days payable outstanding increased 15% versus the same period a year ago.
The net result of our working capital improvement and net income growth led to an $11 million increase in operating cash flow to $166 million and a 35% improvement excluding pension contribution.
We are also making progress on our share buyback program. Year-to-date, through the end of July, we have spent a total of nearly $60 million of buying back roughly 525,000 shares at a price of $112. 
At our Investor Day, we provided an update on our uses of cash. We said we wanted to remain an attractive investment for our shareholders for providing a consistent competitive return of cash. Leveraging our strong cash flow generation commitment to Vision 2020, we increased our targeted cash returns to shareholders to 50% to 60% of adjusted net income. As a follow-up to that, last week, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in dividend. This increase provides us with a total more competitive yielded, while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. In addition, our board authorized an incremental of $250 million share repurchase through the end of 2017 on top of $50 million remaining under the current authorization.
At the current market price, this new program plus the remaining authorization would enable their repurchase of the more than 2.5 million shares or approximately 3% of the shares currently outstanding. This combination is expected to lead to an approximate 55% payout ratio of our estimated adjusted net income in 2015, while still providing financial flexibility for M&A.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015. We will now provide guidance inclusive of Ottens and Lucas Meyer cosmetics acquisition on a preliminary basis. We expect currency neutral sales to grow approximately 6%, including approximately 2% points -- 2 percentage points related to acquisitions. Fragrance Ingredients is expected to remain soft as we have 2 more quarters managing through pressure from the one customer I noted earlier. 
In Fine Fragrance, we expect a modest improvement in the back half of the year as economic softness in the large Fragrance market the presale could have an effect on our results. In addition, we expect to see decelerating of trends our Europe, and Middle East region versus the strong first half to order patterns and higher regenerate on investors wins. 
The solid trends seen in Q2 for Flavors are expected to continue in the second half with an improvement in Flavors North America anticipated in Q3. We expect this top line growth, combined with our continued cost control to lead to approximately 9% adjusted profit -- operating profit growth and about 10% adjusted EPS growth, assuming a 24.5% to 25% full year tax rate, all on a currency neutral basis. This guidance includes approximately $8 million relating to the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions. If we exclude this impact, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS would grow approximately 100 basis points higher.
Like many U.S. multinational companies, the strengthen in U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will impact our results. In this chart, we are highlighting the expected profit impact of key currencies within our foreign exchange the basket by multiplying the year-over-year percentage change through July of 2015 by the portion it represents on our operating profit. As you can see, the weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies, while small in terms of profitability exposure, have all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring our profitability.
Mitigating these exposure, we expect a gain from our transactional euro hedging program, which identified on the last bar on the chart it. As discussed in Q1, the benefit of this program will be more back-half weighted based on the phasing of our program. The net result is we expect foreign exchange movements to have approximately 7 percentage point impact on sales and are approximately 5 percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit on a full year 2015 basis. Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately 7% percentage point drag from currency.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to rise up 4%, inclusive of approximately a 5 percentage point headwind of currency. 
Before turning the call back over to Andreas, just want to reiterate how pleased I am to be part of IFF. I look forward to making progress contribution in the coming months as we continue to create incremental shareholder value.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing comments."

Once finished, I will ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including a specific on each business unit and take us through our outlook for the balance of the year. Before opening the call to questions, I will come back to finish up with some comments.
Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid as we delivered results in line with the guidance we've provided at our recent Investor Day. Currency-neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 1 percentage point relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. 
Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins, which remains strong, as both businesses reported solid growth. Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that, when combined with slower research, selling and admin expenses, led to 40 basis points improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved by 10% as we gained additional leverage below the line with lower effective tax rate and a year-over-year decrease in average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.
As we are now at the midpoint of 2015, I felt it was appropriate to highlight our first half results. As you can see on this slide, all our key metrics are at or above our currency neutral long-term targets of 4% to 6% sales growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth. Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 6%m with was 8% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong sales growth, benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing RSA cost leverage. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11% in the first half of 2015.
At our Investor Day in June, we unveiled our Vision 2020 strategy, which focuses on building greater differentiation, accelerated profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. Our strategy has 4 pillars: The first one, win where we compete. Our goal to achieve the #1 or 2 market position in key markets and categories and with specific customers. For example, in North America, our home market. We have an opportunity to increase our market share. We also identified that we want to win in Africa and Middle East, the new frontier in emerging markets, relatively small now but one of the fastest-growing areas in the world. There are also categories, such as Home Care and Fine Fragrances as well as several customers which I cannot name but are going well. 
The second pillar, innovating first. We are also looking to strengthen our position and drive differentiation and priority R&D platforms. During our strategy review process, we evaluated our investment in both existing and new platforms. A disciplined approach starts with our ability to determine the market size and, based on the consumer need, states. 
Next. We have read our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account the technical likelihood of success and commercial potential. We then conducted a full evaluation of the technology degree or fit within our strategy and made the decision to focus on the highest-return opportunities. This includes doubling down on focusing on key initiatives, such as delivery systems, modulation, new molecules and naturals across both businesses.
The third one, become our customer partner of choice. IFF has always been committed to growing our customer intimacy. In Vision 2020, our goal is to take that one step further so that we attain commercial expense by further provider our customers with in-depth local consumer understanding, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service and the highest-quality products. This, in turn, should allow us to become an essential partner and ultimately lead to incremental business opportunities for our customers as well as IFF.
The fourth pillar is strength and expanding the portfolio. As you have seen over the past couple of months, we actively pursued value-creating sub-partnerships, collaboration and acquisition, both within our industry and adjacencies. These opportunities, some of which I will touch on in a moment, will allow us to tap areas of expertise beyond the walls of IFF, leading to more innovation and ultimately, additional growth.
The 3 enablers to the strategy include: talent in organizations with some investment in our people in R&D; continuous improvements as a relentless focus on finding efficiency and streaming processes to invest in the business; and sustainability strengthening sustainable practices and becoming leader within our industry.
While we are still early in days of execution, we are seeing that our identified strategies, imperatives are the right ones. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are seeing accelerated growth. We continue to leverage our long-standing presence in the emerging markets as they grew 7% on a currency neutral base led by 22% increase in the Middle East and Africa and strong growth in India, Brazil and Argentina. 
We also improved our market share in North America, achieving the #2 position in Flavors after successfully closing the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. 
Home Care. Another strategic priority for us has increased high single digits globally on a currency-neutral basis.
Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continue to drive growth. The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverages continued in the second quarter, led by our encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery system in Flavors. 
In Fragrances. Fabric Care grew mid-teens on a currency-neutral basis, driven by our encapsulation technology. We're expanding this technology into other categories, such as Toiletries, Home Care and personal wash, which all grew double digits in the second quarter.
In Flavors. Latin America continued its double-digit trend for the seventh consecutive quarter led by our proprietary delivery system. We are very pleased with our sales of sweet and savory modulation portfolio improved strong double-digits, an example that we are providing our customers with innovative solution that win in the marketplace with consumers.
Our continued commitment to provide our customers with in-depth consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service and highest-quality products allow us to capture the growth potential of faster-growing regional accounts, most noticeably in Flavors in the second quarter, which outpaced the growth of global accounts. We broadened our product offering, expanding it to more rapidly growing cosmetic actives with the recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, offering our customers greater option to support their strategic growth initiatives in skin and hair care.
In addition, in Fragrance Ingredients, we launched and market Amber Xtreme, a unique and innovative or effective ingredient that was previously captive for the exclusive use of IFF perfumers and is now available for both use within the Fragrance industry.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, we successfully completed the Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer cosmetic acquisitions. We recently signed a partnership with Duke University, focusing on finding effective flavor modulators that are novel to our industry. And we are collaborating with University of Liverpool to enhance our delivery system capabilities in Fragrances.
Before turning the call over to Alison, I wanted to provide some additional commentary on our recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is headquartered in Québec City, Canada, with operations in France and Australia. They develop, manufacture and market innovative ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industry. Their products are designed to maintain the body's natural reactions, strengthen its defense against environmental aggressions, delay the signs of aging and address other contemporary cosmetic challenges. Some of the benefits of the active ingredients include: wrinkle reduction, skin firming and protection from free radicals, among others.
We target Lucas Meyer as a partner as it is an award-winning company with strong proprietary portfolio and great customer relationships. We believe they have a strong fit with IFF's core competencies and strategic assets including a similar customer base, allowing us to build greater customer intimacy and drive penetration into the skincare and hair care businesses through an expanding product offerings. 
Innovation is critical to both industries, and we expect that we can cross-leverage shared expertise in analytical research, sensory science and consumer insights. 
We also can combine IFF's industry-leading natural products. LMR with Lucas Meyer's Southern Cross Botanicals platform. And they have a strong brand recognition, one that stands from the highest level of quality and trust.
The acquisition will allow us to enter an attractive and fast-growing market. With approximately $44 million in annual sales and EBITDAR margins much higher than in the Flavors and Fragrances history, we delivered Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is sustainable on a stand-alone basis and also a great foundation for further consolidation in cosmetics actives. It's truly a great business, and we are excited to have it within the IFF portfolio. 
With that, I would like to turn over to Alison."

It is a great time to be part of a company with the history that IFF has, especially as we embark on Vision 2020, where you're looking toward building greater differentiation, accelerating profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. I've been fortunate enough to speak briefly with some of you, but for those of you who I have not met, let me quickly go through my background.
I joined IFF from Covance, a global drug development company with $2.5 billion in sales and 12,500 employees located in 60 countries where, as a Chief Financial Officer, I was responsible for all financial management, including financial reporting and analytics, capital allocation and a strategic planning.
During my tenure, there are several areas I'm proud of, but most notably, the fact that we accelerated revenue growth, improved operating performance, streamline processes and develop talent. These are all areas that I believe are transferable to IFF, and I'm excited to get started.
Part of my time at Covance, I spent 19 years with AT&T and held leadership roles of increasing responsibility, among them, leading finance for a $30 billion division as Vice President, Forecasting Performance and Investment Analysis. I look forward to getting to know many of you over the next few months as I get acclimated to the company and support the execution of Vision 2020. 
To provide a greater level of transparency, I thought I would lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to adjusted currency neutral results, highlighting the impact of currency and showing results with and without the acquisition of Ottens. 
Focusing in on the second column. Q2 was a challenging quarter from a currency perspective as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. From a sales perspective, the translation impact represented approximately 8 percentage points.
On an adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS basis, despite our natural hedge, given our considerable operations in Europe in currency hedging program, the volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our adjusted operating profit by 8 percentage points and adjusted EPS by approximately 11 percentage points. Including the acquisition of Ottens, which you can see in the third column, currency neutral sales increased 5%. Adjusted operating profit, 7%, and adjusted EPS, 10%.
This included a lower tax rate due to higher earnings from lower tax jurisdictions, lower loss provisions and lower repatriation costs in 2015 and the benefit of lower shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.
The acquisition, which only included 2 months worth of business, added about one point to the top line and with a slight benefit to adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. Excluding the acquisition, our organic business performed well and was in line with the guidance given at our June 2 Investor Day. We managed to achieve good leverage down the P&L, with sales improving 4%, adjusted operating profit, up 7% and adjusted operating expense increasing 9%, all in a currency-neutral basis.
Before moving forward, I want to take a moment to note that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens acquisition represented about $1.2 million in the quarter. If we added this back to understand the cash component of the business, growth from the profit in EPS perspective would have improved another 1% to 8% and 11%, respectively. 
As we begin to execute to Vision 2020, M&A is expected to play a larger role. Going forward, we will continue to provide analyst investors with visibility to the amortization of intangibles of acquisitions so you have a better idea of what the actual cash generation is of the business. From an evaluation perspective, we hope it provides an understanding of the returns of any deals we pursue. 
Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency neutral sales grew 7%, including approximately 3 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced store-based growth with the strongest results in Beverage and Savory. Greater Asia was up 6%, driven by mid-single-digit gains in Savory, Beverage and Dairy. 
On a country perspective, strong growth was a key in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This performance more than offset a slight decline in China, where we temporarily stopped production to new install odor abatement equipment. The plant has since reopened, and we continue to ramp up production, working with the government to ensure we are in full compliance. 
As of last week, our backlog of orders returned to normal levels, and we are either servicing all the camps in our plant in China or other facilities around the world.
Keeping with the subject of China, we have recently been notified by Chinese authorities of the compliance issue pertaining to the emission of odors in our Fragrance Ingredients plant. We are working to address these issues by making investments in additional odor abatement equipment, similar to what we did in Flavors, but expect to operate at a reduced capacity until the is installed and fully operational some time in Q4. Our full year 2015 guidance, which I will touch on in a moment, is inclusive of this matter, both from a top line and cost perspective based on returning to normal production later this year.
Turning back to Flavors. In our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, sales increased 6%, led by double-digit gain in Savory and mid-single-digit growth in Beverage. 
As Andreas mentioned, the Middle East and Africa reported our highest growth, improving over 20%, driven by strong new win performance. North America improved 5% as a result of additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy.
Excluding the transaction, the core North American business was soft as we previously communicated at our Investor Day, principally due to underlying trends with select customers. Latin America increased 14% as all categories reported positive growth. 
The double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the seventh consecutive quarter, and Savory and Dairy also grew double digits as a result of strong new win performance.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 1% as top line growth, productivity and cost control initiatives were reduced by a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. 
Q2 operating profit margin was also impacted by approximately 50 basis points or about 2 percentage points in terms of growth relating to China. Based on what we know today, we would expect a similar impact through the remainder of the year, which is included in our full year 2015 guidance that I will discuss momentarily.
Fragrance currency neutral sales improved 4%, led by double-digit growth in Europe, Africa and Middle East region and a mid-single-digit improvement in Latin America, driven by Consumer Fragrances. 
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was up 2% as Europe, Africa and Middle East grew 17% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins and volume growth. This strong growth more than offset softness in Latin America, where economic conditions, particularly in Brazil, have an impact on discretionary spending. While the economy is soft, we continue to see our win rate remain high, which ultimately will continue to support our market leadership position.
With the 15th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continue to grow, up 6%, led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care, thanks, in large part, to our strong technology and high single-digit growth in Home Care. 
In addition, Hair Care increased high single digits as a result of new win performance. As previously communicated, Fragrance Ingredients was weak, down 3% as we made a strategic decision not to engage in lower-margin businesses, and more importantly, to supply and further strengthen our Fragrance Compounds business as our internal demand for our own ingredients is up double digits. It should be repeated that this weakness is primarily related to one customer, whom, if we exclude the rest of our portfolio, would be up mid-single digits.
On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 5%, driven by volume growth, continued cost savings initiatives and continued productivity program. Segment profit margin on a currency-neutral basis increased of 20 basis points to 20.2%.
From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figure through the end of Q2 was down 120 basis points to approximately 29% of our trailing 12-month sales. Most of our gains came from lower payables as our days payable outstanding increased 15% versus the same period a year ago.
The net result of our working capital improvement and net income growth led to an $11 million increase in operating cash flow to $166 million and a 35% improvement excluding pension contributions.
We are also making progress on our share buyback program. Year-to-date, through the end of July, we have spent a total of nearly $60 million of buying back roughly 525,000 shares at a price of $112. 
At our Investor Day, we've provided an update on our uses of cash. We said we wanted to remain an attractive investment for our shareholders for providing a consistent competitive return of cash. Leveraging our strong cash flow generation and commitment to Vision 2020, we increased our targeted cash return to shareholders to 50% to 60% of adjusted net income. As a follow-up to that, late last week, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in dividend. This increase provides us with a more competitive yielded while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. In addition, our board authorized an incremental of $250 million share repurchase through the end of 2017 on top of $50 million remaining under the current authorization.
At the current market price, this new program, plus the remaining authorization, would enable the repurchase of the more than 2.5 million shares or approximately 3% of the shares currently outstanding. This combination is expected to lead to an approximate 55% payout ratio of our estimated adjusted net income in 2015, while still providing financial flexibility for M&A.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015. We will now provide guidance inclusive of Ottens and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisition on a preliminary basis. We expect currency-neutral sales to grow approximately 6%, including approximately 2% points -- 2 percentage points related to acquisitions. Fragrance Ingredients is expected to remain soft as we have 2 more quarters we're managing through pressure from the one customer I noted earlier. 
In Fine Fragrance, we expect a modest improvement in the back half of the year as economic softness in the large Fragrance market of Brazil could have an effect on our results. In addition, we expect to see decelerating trends in our Europe, Africa and Middle East region versus the strong first half due to order patterns and higher ration rates on last year's wins. 
The solid trends seen in Q2 for Flavors are expected to continue in the second half with an improvement in Flavors North America anticipated in Q3. We expect this top line growth, combined with our continued cost control, to lead to approximately 9% adjusted profit growth, operating profit growth, and about 10% adjusted EPS growth, assuming a 24.5% to 25% full year tax rate, all on a currency-neutral basis. This guidance includes approximately $8 million relating to the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions. If we exclude this impact, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS would grow approximately 100 basis points higher.
Like many U.S. multinational companies, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will impact our results. In this chart, we are highlighting the expected profit impact of key currencies within our foreign exchange basket by multiplying the year-over-year percentage change through July of 2015 by the portion it represents under our operating profit. As you can see, the weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure, is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies, while small in terms of profitability exposure, have all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring our profitability.
Mitigating these exposure, we expect a gain from our transactional euro hedging program, which I identified on the last bar of the chart it. 
As discussed in Q1, the benefits of this program will be more back-half-weighted based on the phasing of our program. The net result is we expect foreign exchange movements to have approximately 7 percentage point impact on sales and are approximately 5 percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit on a full year 2015 basis. Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately 7% percentage-point drag from currency.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to rise about 4%, inclusive of approximately a 5-percentage-point headwind of currency. 
Before turning the call back over to Andreas, I just want to reiterate how pleased I am to be part of IFF. I look forward to making positive contribution in the coming months as we continue to create incremental shareholder value.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing comments."

And I know you grew very strongly in the first quarter, but even if you average it out, it means that maybe you grew 3% on a local currency basis excluding acquisitions. And last year you were down 4%. And your comparisons in the fourth quarter are becoming difficult again because there was volume growth of 7%. And obviously, there are some implications to the -- to EBIT level as well because your sales -- your overall Flavor sales this quarter dropped $3 million but your EBIT was down $7 million. And so I was wondering whether you can sort of like shed some thought on that as like, what the issues are on the North American Flavors business and why you're confident that, outside of cost control, things should be better in the back half of the year? And then secondly, I was wondering like how much of your share repurchase program you may complete in '15 and in '16?"

H1, year-to-date, our number for North America, we are up. We are growing low single-digit. We had challenges in the second quarter indeed, and particularly, as outlined before in the category of Savory. We also recognize that the larger accounts, the very large international accounts, where we have a very high index in North America, they are not growing as fast as the smaller, more agile companies, which are probably more the medium manufacturers in the food and beverage industry. It's exactly the reason and part of the strategic rationale why IFF had a very strong interest, and we're still very pleased and privileged to have Ottens being part of our portfolio. It will give us a vehicle where we can do for should ourselves, where we can the agility, the speed, the responsiveness and the ownership for those accounts to make tailored solutions, which have a faster growth rate in North America. So overall, I feel confident that we will be posting full year growth, excluding Ottens like-for-like still. And I believe together with Ottens, we will further accelerate in the quarters to come.

And I outlined once at the Investor's Day, as soon as we are partnering at a very early stage with our customers, our win rates and the chance that we are really submitting a value creation and value addition to them is much higher. Nowadays, our customers, they are not looking for vendors and suppliers anymore, they are really looking for to partners. And we see this is a great opportunity. When it comes to North America, what you outlined with Ottens, we all said we want to create a vehicle for us to truly differentiate ourselves, to keep the agility, the speed, the ownership. But the downfall, the very long-standing history. Ottens has been here in North America and to back it together with latest technology from IFF. We affirm the belief that this will help us to accelerate our growth rates to penetrate into a segment that is growing faster of what we believe than the very large accounts here in North America and see it as a great opportunity.

I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. I also want to take this opportunity to reiterate our Vision 2020 strategy for those of you who were not able to attend our recent investor day, and then provide an update on the execution of our 4-pillar strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including the specifics on each business unit and take us through our outlook for the balance of the year. Before opening the call to questions, I will come back to finish up with some comments.
Our financial results for the second quarter remain solid as we delivered results in line with the guidance we've provided at our recent Investor Day. Currency-neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 1 percentage point relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors.  Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins, which remains strong, as both businesses reported solid growth. Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that, when combined with slower research, selling and admin expenses, led to 40 basis points improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin. Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved by 10% as we gained additional leverage below the line with lower effective tax rate and a year-over-year decrease in average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.
As we are now at the midpoint of 2015, I felt it was appropriate to highlight our first half results. As you can see on this slide, all our key metrics are at or above our currency neutral long-term targets of 4% to 6% sales growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth. Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 6%, with 8% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong sales growth, benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing RSA cost leverage. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11% in the first half of 2015.
At our Investor Day in June, we unveiled our Vision 2020 strategy, which focuses on building greater differentiation, accelerated profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. Our strategy has 4 pillars: The first one, win where we compete. Our goal to achieve the #1 or 2 market position in key markets and categories and with specific customers. For example, in North America, our home market, we have an opportunity to increase our market share. We also identified that we want to win in Africa and Middle East, the new frontier in emerging markets, relatively small now but one of the fastest-growing areas in the world. There are also categories, such as Home Care and Fine Fragrances as well as several customers which I cannot name but are growing well. 
The second pillar, innovating first. We are also looking to strengthen our position and drive differentiation and priority R&D platforms. During our strategy review process, we evaluated our investment in both existing and new platforms. A disciplined approach starts with our ability to determine the market size and, based on the consumer need, states.  Next, we evaluate our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account the technical likelihood of success and commercial potential. We then conducted a full evaluation of the technologies degree or fit within our strategy and made the decision to focus on the highest-return opportunities. This includes doubling down and focusing on key initiatives, such as delivery systems, modulation, new molecules and naturals across both businesses.
The third one, become our customer partner of choice. IFF has always been committed to growing our customer intimacy. In Vision 2020, our goal is to take that one step further so that we attain commercial excellence by further provider our customers with in-depth local consumer understanding, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service and the highest-quality products. This, in turn, should allow us to become an essential partner and ultimately lead to incremental business opportunities for our customers as well as IFF.
The fourth pillar is strength and expanding the portfolio. As you have seen over the past couple of months, we actively pursued value-creating sub-partnerships, collaboration and acquisition, both within our industry and adjacencies. These opportunities, some of which I will touch on in a moment, will allow us to tap areas of expertise beyond the walls of IFF, leading to more innovation and ultimately, additional growth.
The 3 enablers to the strategy include: talent in organizations with some investment in our people in R&D; continuous improvements as a relentless focus on finding efficiency and streaming processes to invest in the business; and sustainability strengthening sustainable practices and becoming leader within our industry. While we are still early in days of execution, we are seeing that our identified strategies, imperatives are the right ones. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are seeing accelerated growth. We continue to leverage our long-standing presence in the emerging markets as they grew 7% on a currency neutral base led by 22% increase in the Middle East and Africa and strong growth in India, Brazil and Argentina.  We also improved our market share in North America, achieving the #2 position in Flavors after successfully closing the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. 
Home Care. Another strategic priority for us has increased high single digits globally on a currency-neutral basis. Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continue to drive growth. The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverages continued in the second quarter, led by our encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery system in Flavors. In Fragrances, Fabric Care grew mid-teens on a currency-neutral basis, driven by our encapsulation technology. We're expanding this technology into other categories, such as Toiletries, Home Care and personal wash, which all grew double digits in the second quarter. In Flavors, Latin America continued its double-digit trend for the seventh consecutive quarter led by our proprietary delivery system. We are very pleased with our sales of sweetness and savory modulation portfolio improved strong double-digits, an example that we are providing our customers with innovative solution that win in the marketplace with consumers.
Our continued commitment to provide our customers with in-depth consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service and highest-quality products allow us to capture the growth potential of faster-growing regional accounts, most noticeably in Flavors in the second quarter, which outpaced the growth of global accounts. We broadened our product offering, expanding it to more rapidly growing cosmetic actives with the recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, offering our customers greater option to support their strategic growth initiatives in skin and hair care.
In addition, in Fragrance Ingredients, we launched and market Amber Xtreme, a unique and innovative or effective ingredient that was previously captive for the exclusive use of IFF perfumers and is now available for both use within the Fragrance industry. In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, we successfully completed the Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer cosmetic acquisitions. We recently signed a partnership with Duke University, focusing on finding effective flavor modulators that are novel to our industry. And we are collaborating with University of Liverpool to enhance our delivery system capabilities in Fragrances.
Before turning the call over to Alison, I wanted to provide some additional commentary on our recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is headquartered in Québec City, Canada, with operations in France and Australia. They develop, manufacture and market innovative ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industry. Their products are designed to maintain the body's natural reactions, strengthen its defense against environmental aggressions, delay the signs of aging and address other contemporary cosmetic challenges. Some of the benefits of the active ingredients include: wrinkle reduction, skin firming and protection from free radicals, among others.
We targeted Lucas Meyer as a partner as it is an award-winning company with strong proprietary portfolio and great customer relationships. We believe they have a strong fit with IFF's core competencies and strategic assets including a similar customer base, allowing us to build greater customer intimacy and drive penetration into the skincare and hair care businesses through an expanding product offerings.  Innovation is critical to both industries, and we expect that we can cross-leverage shared expertise in analytical research, sensory science and consumer insights.  We also can combine IFF's industry-leading natural products, LMR with Lucas Meyer's Southern Cross Botanicals platform. And they have a strong brand recognition, one that stands for the highest level of quality and trust.
The acquisition will allow us to enter an attractive and fast-growing market. With approximately $44 million in annual sales and EBITDAR margins much higher than in the Flavors and Fragrances history, we delivered Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is sustainable on a stand-alone basis and also a great foundation for further consolidation in cosmetics actives. It's truly a great business, and we are excited to have it within the IFF portfolio. 
With that, I would like to turn over to Alison."

I would like to start out by saying how happy I am to be here at IFF. It is a great time to be part of a company with the history that IFF has, especially as we embark on Vision 2020, where you're looking toward building greater differentiation, accelerating profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. I've been fortunate enough to speak briefly with some of you, but for those of you who I have not met, let me quickly go through my background.
I joined IFF from Covance, a global drug development company with $2.5 billion in sales and 12,500 employees located in 60 countries where, as a Chief Financial Officer, I was responsible for all financial management, including financial reporting and analytics, capital allocation and a strategic planning. During my tenure, there are several areas I'm proud of, but most notably, the fact that we accelerated revenue growth, improved operating performance, streamlined processes and developed talent. These are all areas that I believe are transferable to IFF, and I'm excited to get started. 
Prior to my time at Covance, I spent 19 years with AT&T and held leadership roles of increasing responsibility, among them, leading finance for a $30 billion division as Vice President, Forecasting Performance and Investment Analysis. I look forward to getting to know many of you over the next few months as I get acclimated to the company and support the execution of Vision 2020.  
To provide a greater level of transparency, I thought I would lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to adjusted currency neutral results, highlighting the impact of currency and showing results with and without the acquisition of Ottens. Focusing in on the second column. Q2 was a challenging quarter from a currency perspective as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. From a sales perspective, the translation impact represented approximately 8 percentage points. On an adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS basis, despite our natural hedge, given our considerable operations in Europe and currency hedging program, the volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our adjusted operating profit by 8 percentage points and adjusted EPS by approximately 11 percentage points. Including the acquisition of Ottens, which you can see in the third column, currency neutral sales increased 5%. Adjusted operating profit, 7%, and adjusted EPS, 10%. This included a lower tax rate due to higher earnings from lower tax jurisdictions, lower loss provisions and lower repatriation costs in 2015 and the benefit of lower shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.
The acquisition, which only included 2 months' worth of business, added about 1 point to the top line and with a slight benefit to adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. Excluding the acquisition, our organic business performed well and was in line with the guidance given at our June 2 Investor Day. We managed to achieve good leverage down the P&L, with sales improving 4%, adjusted operating profit, up 7% and adjusted EPS increasing 9%, all in a currency-neutral basis.
Before moving forward, I wanted to take a moment to note that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens acquisition represented about $1.2 million in the quarter. If we added this back to understand the cash component of the business, growth from the profit in EPS perspective would have improved another 1% to 8% and 11%, respectively. As we begin to execute to Vision 2020, M&A is expected to play a larger role. Going forward, we will continue to provide analyst investors with visibility to the amortization of intangibles of acquisitions so you have a better idea of what the actual cash generation is of the business. From an evaluation perspective, we hope it provides an understanding of the returns of any deals we pursue. 
Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency neutral sales grew 7%, including approximately 3 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest results in Beverage and Savory. Greater Asia was up 6%, driven by mid-single-digit gains in Savory, Beverage and Dairy. 
On a country perspective, strong growth was achieved in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This performance more than offset a slight decline in China, where we temporarily stopped production to new install odor abatement equipment. The plant has since reopened, and we continue to ramp up production, working with the government to ensure we are in full compliance.  As of last week, our backlog of orders returned to normal levels, and we are either servicing all accounts from our plant in China or other facilities around the world.
Keeping with the subject of China, we have recently been notified by Chinese authorities of the compliance issue pertaining to the emission of odors in our Fragrance Ingredients plant. We are working to address these issues by making investments in additional odor abatement equipment, similar to what we did in Flavors, but expect to operate at a reduced capacity until the equipment is installed and fully operational sometime in Q4. Our full year 2015 guidance, which I will touch on in a moment, is inclusive of this matter, both from a top line and cost perspective based on returning to normal production later this year.
Turning back to Flavors. In our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, sales increased 6%, led by double-digit gain in Savory and mid-single-digit growth in Beverage.  As Andreas mentioned, the Middle East and Africa reported our highest growth, improving over 20%, driven by strong new win performance. North America improved 5% as a result of additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy. Excluding the transaction, the core North American business was soft as we previously communicated at our Investor Day, principally due to underlying trends with select customers. Latin America increased 14% as all categories reported positive growth.  The double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the seventh consecutive quarter, and Savory and Dairy also grew double digits as a result of strong new win performance.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 1% as top line growth, productivity and cost control initiatives were reduced by a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors.  Q2 operating profit margin was also impacted by approximately 50 basis points or about 2 percentage points in terms of growth relating to China. Based on what we know today, we would expect a similar impact through the remainder of the year, which is included in our full year 2015 guidance that I will discuss momentarily.
Fragrance currency neutral sales improved 4%, led by double-digit growth in Europe, Africa and Middle East region and a mid-single-digit improvement in Latin America, driven by Consumer Fragrances.  From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was up 2% as Europe, Africa and Middle East grew 17% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins and volume growth. This strong growth more than offset softness in Latin America, where economic conditions, particularly in Brazil, have an impact on discretionary spending. While the economy is soft, we continue to see our win rate remain high, which ultimately will continue to support our market leadership position. For the 15th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continued to grow, up 6%, led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care, thanks, in large part, to our strong technology and high single-digit growth in Home Care. 
In addition, Hair Care increased high single digits as a result of new win performance. As previously communicated, Fragrance Ingredients was weak, down 3% as we made the strategic decision not to engage in lower-margin businesses, and more importantly, to supply and further strengthen our Fragrance Compounds business as our internal demand for our own ingredients is up double digits. It should be repeated that this weakness is primarily related to one customer, whom, if we exclude the rest of our portfolio, would be up mid-single digits. On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 5%, driven by volume growth, continued cost savings initiatives and continued productivity program. Segment profit margin on a currency-neutral basis increased of 20 basis points to 20.2%.
From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figure through the end of Q2 was down 120 basis points to approximately 29% of our trailing 12-month sales. Most of our gains came from lower payables as our days payable outstanding increased 15% versus the same period a year ago. The net result of our working capital improvement and net income growth led to an $11 million increase in operating cash flow to $166 million and a 35% improvement excluding pension contributions.
We are also making progress on our share buyback program. Year-to-date, through the end of July, we have spent a total of nearly $60 million in buying back roughly 525,000 shares at a price of $112.  At our Investor Day, we provided an update on our uses of cash. We said we wanted to remain an attractive investment for our shareholders by providing a consistent competitive return of cash. Leveraging our strong cash flow generation and commitment to Vision 2020, we increased our targeted cash return to shareholders to 50% to 60% of adjusted net income. As a follow-up to that, late last week, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in dividend. This increase provides us with a more competitive yield while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. 
In addition, our board authorized an incremental $250 million share repurchase through the end of 2017 on top of $50 million remaining under the current authorization. At the current market price, this new program, plus the remaining authorization, would enable the repurchase of the more than 2.5 million shares or approximately 3% of the shares currently outstanding. This combination is expected to lead to an approximate 55% payout ratio of our estimated adjusted net income in 2015, while still providing financial flexibility for M&A.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015. We will now provide guidance inclusive of Ottens and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisition on a preliminary basis. We expect currency-neutral sales to grow approximately 6%, including approximately 2% points -- 2 percentage points related to acquisitions. Fragrance Ingredients is expected to remain soft as we have 2 more quarters where we're managing through pressure from the one customer I noted earlier.  In Fine Fragrance, we expect a modest improvement in the back half of the year as economic softness in the large Fragrance market of Brazil could have an effect on our results. In addition, we expect to see decelerating trends in our Europe, Africa and Middle East region versus the strong first half due to order patterns and higher ration rates on last year's wins. 
The solid trends seen in Q2 for Flavors are expected to continue in the second half with an improvement in Flavors North America anticipated in Q3. We expect this top line growth, combined with our continued cost control, to lead to approximately 9% adjusted profit -- operating profit growth, and about 10% adjusted EPS growth, assuming a 24.5% to 25% full year tax rate, all on a currency-neutral basis. This guidance includes approximately $8 million relating to the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions. If we exclude this impact, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS would grow approximately 100 basis points higher.
Like many U.S. multinational companies, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will impact our results. In this chart, we are highlighting the expected profit impact of key currencies within our foreign exchange basket by multiplying the year-over-year percentage change through July of 2015 by the portion it represents under our operating profit. As you can see, the weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure, is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies, while small in terms of profitability exposure, have all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring profitability. Mitigating this exposure, we expect a gain from our transactional euro hedging program, which I identified on the last bar of the chart. 
As discussed in Q1, the benefits of this program will be more back-half-weighted based on the phasing of our program. The net result is we expect foreign exchange movements to have approximately 7 percentage point impact on sales and approximately 5 percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit on a full year 2015 basis. Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately 7% percentage-point drag from currency. Adjusted operating profit is expected to rise about 4%, inclusive of approximately a 5-percentage-point headwind of currency. 
Before turning the call back over to Andreas, I just want to reiterate how pleased I am to be part of IFF. I look forward to making positive contribution in the coming months as we continue to create incremental shareholder value.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing comments."

In Fine Fragrance, we are facing with some of the launch that took place last year that were not as successful as expected. So we had a very, very strong pipeline last year. And we have some reorder linked to this wins from last year. So it's putting pressure on our top line. But obviously, as you know, most of the activity and market share growth in North America is taking place with European brands.

In addition, similar how we structured the quarter conference call I want to provide an update on the execution of our 4 pillar Vision 2",1635,"Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. In addition, similar how we structured the quarter conference call I want to provide an update on the execution of our 4 pillar Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including the specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statements and our outlook for the balance of the year.
I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the third quarter accelerated versus our second quarter performance, both in terms of currency neutral sales and currency neutral operating profit growth, as we continue to benefit from diversity of our business as well as our recent acquisitions. 
Currency neutral sales in the third quarter improved 7%, including approximately 3 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer cosmetics. Organic top line performance, which increased 4% this quarter continue to be driven by new wins, particularly in Fragrance Compounds with a contribution of new wins were at the highest level in nearly 2 years.
This favorable to profitability as adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS post 10% on a currency-neutral basis. On a year-to-date basis, results remained strong. As currency neutral sales growing 6% comprised of 8% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. 
For the first 9 months in 2015, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 9% on currency-neutral basis, driven by sales growth, the benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing and cost leverage. 
Complementing our expansion in gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin, lower interest expense, a more favorable effect of tax rate and a reduction of our shares outstanding led to an 11% increase on our currency neutral adjusted EPS.
On a strategic perspective, I would like to talk about a couple of areas. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position defined by #1 or 2 market share position, we believe we are taking it with steps to deliver on our Division of accelerated growth. 
In North America Flavors team has done a nice job integrating our recent activation of Ottens Flavors, leveraging their go-to-market strategy, which focuses on winning this key regional accounts in the U.S. Our Flavors North America business was up 19%. 
In Flavors Latin America, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well as evidence with its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. In the third quarter, growth was very strong, up 20% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Within Fragrance, North America Fragrance Compounds grew 7% with 8% growth in Consumer Fragrances and a 4% growth in Fine Fragrances. The quarter's subcategory performance that were most notable in North America were Hair Care and Home Care, both of which grew double digits, plus Fabric Care, which grew high single digits.
In the third quarter, China Fragrances, another area where we have ambitions to accelerate gross, was 6% on a currency-neutral basis as we continue to have success with many of the strong regional Consumer Fragrances brands. 
From a category perspective, Home Care, another area of focus for us, improved high single digits globally on a currency natural basis led by double-digit growth in North America and Latin America. 
Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrance continues to drive growth with strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the third quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery systems in Flavors.
Fabric Care grew double digits on a currency natural basis in the third quarter with all geographic markets posting strong growth. This is a direct result of our differentiated encapsulation technology. 
Given our success in Fabric Care, we have begun to expand into other categories as well. In the third quarter, while still early in terms of strategic execution, we have seen strong results in encapsulation-related sales and Toiletries and Home Care, both, which grew double digits. 
Supporting the expansion of this technology into more are categories, our R&D team developed the next-generation capsule technology that allows us to further penetrate personal care applications. This technology should allow us to efficiently customer solutions to deliver Fragrance at the points desired by consumers.
In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering price, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next-generation Fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently launched 2 new highly anticipated ingredients to our perfumers, customer food, which is a high impact complex fruity with spicy undertones and Crystal, which is watery refresh note, to be used is internally by our perfumers as exclusive IFF molecules, which we are not selling externally.
And as we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to commercialize 2 additional molecules, which will bring our commercialize molecules to 4 this year. If successful, this would effectively put us on track to double our annual Fragrance molecule output average order plus decade [ph] providing us with greater confidence in our accelerated growth ambition.
As I mentioned moments ago in Flavors, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well. This technology is expanding beyond just Latin America this proprietary the delivery system related to sales going strong double digits globally. 
Sales of our sweetness and savor modulation portfolio continue to produce strong results, increasing strong double digits. 
At categories where we had the most success were Savory, Dairy and Beverage as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of the consumers who are looking for better-for-you products, including reduced sugar and salt. 
To complement this, I'm pleased to announce that we have also commercialize a new natural place modulator, the second one this year, which is a [indiscernible] designed to reduce the salt perception without changing the product's acidity particularly useful for yogurts and juice applications. This addition will strengthen our modulation capabilities as it provides our Flavors a more competitive to build winning solutions.
Building on a very robust technology pipeline is critical. The third quarter is an example that we are making strong progress against key initiatives that will lead to greater differentiation and ultimately accelerated growth.
In addition to the strikes we have made from market share and perspective, we also make progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. To meet the growing trends in naturals in October 2015, IFF LMR Naturals received its fourth For Life social responsibility designation, this time in corporation with our Haiti. The For Life recognizes an organization's adherence to specific sustainability criteria, including transparency, environmental responsibility, fair working conditions and positive relations with producers and local communities. This recognition comes after certification of IFF-LMR Naturals for the supply chain in Turkey and is basel supply chain in Madagascar.
When it comes to sustainability, we won't accept the status quo while. Recently, we begin the first Flavors and Fragrance company to join DFS and growing consortium of a multinational companies committed to ensuring sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.
We also are recognized by the CDP earning a perfect score of 100 in disclosure and in A performance for its strategies and actions to mitigate climate change. Sustainability is a foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, and we are committed to embedding business throughout our business practices and our corporate culture for the years to come.
We are won North American innovation award with a one of our largest Flavors customers, which recognize the partners for their leadership. In addition, Estée Lauder also presented us with the supplier's excellence award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top-performing business partners.
I'm pleased to also announce that at the 2015 in cosmetics Asia Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won the Gold award for the innovation the best active Ingredients with the XO be, a ingredient designed to rapidly improve dull skin for healthy looking complexion in only 7 days and also won the Gold award of innovation best possible Ingredients with, an Ingredients scientifically measured think there is a tick next developed by specialists and psychology and neuroscience, which provides positive emotion upon application.
With a focus on the future and in terms of the business participation in years to come, we also reaffirm an expanded core with key Flavors customers 2 based in North America and one globally and also a large Fragrance customer in the third quarter.
As you know, [indiscernible] are paramount to winning future business within our industry. Being added to a near [indiscernible] that we are able to bring the right R&D capabilities consumer insights, regulatory requirements and customers to resonate at to create a winning products in the marketplace.
During the second and third quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions, which focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio. I'm pleased to reported that both acquisitions are performing very well. Ottens Flavors organic sales on a stand-alone basis increased low double digits, above our North America-based business, which improved substantially. And Lucas Meyer's cosmetics achieved strong double digit currency neutral sales growth on a stand-alone basis. We believe these results are good indication that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance in terms of growth and returns.
Following the end of the third quarter, we also announced the partnership with the [indiscernible] communications to pioneer the digital future of scent, combining certain [indiscernible] software platform with the IFF technology and expertise. The collaboration anticipated to bring mobile scent experiences to consumers. And while this is an initial step, we believe the technologies developed by Vapor Communications will play an important role in our larger digital scent journey in Vision 2020.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Alison who will take you through the financials in greater detail."
281407,314308707,899076,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2015",2015-11-10,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Looking at our third quarter results, similar to what I did on our Q2 conference call, I want to continue to lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to our adjusted currency neutral results.In the first column, which is",2120,"Thank you, Andreas. Looking at our third quarter results, similar to what I did on our Q2 conference call, I want to continue to lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to our adjusted currency neutral results.
In the first column, which is inclusive of currency, sales contracted by 1%, while adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted EPS grew 5%.
Consistent with what we communicated previously, in the third quarter, we benefited from our euro transactional hedging program, which ultimately protected our euro-denominated profit. Including this benefit, our growth rate in terms of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS accelerated to 7% and 5% versus the 1% and 4% we reported in the first half, respectively. Yet, even with the benefits of hedging, foreign exchange still proved to be a headwind in the third quarter as the U.S. dollar remained strong against many global currencies. 
From a sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS perspective, currency represented an 8, 3 and 5 percentage point impact respectively. 
On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to deliver strong results, achieving leverage within our P&L with the sales improving 7% and adjusted operating profit going 10%. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by gross margin expansion and cost leverage, which led to an approximately 50 basis point improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS also improved by 10% as the year-over-year decrease in our average shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program offset a slightly higher effective tax rate and an increase in interest expense relating to both of our acquisitions. The acquisitions we made earlier this year are adding to our performance, evidenced that we are investing in strategic value-add opportunities that deliver high return
In the third quarter, the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer's added approximately 3 points to currently currency neutral sales growth, about 2 points to currency neutral adjusted operating profit and 3 points to currency neutral adjusted EPS growth. It should be noted that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens and Lucas Meyer acquisition represented about $3.5 million in the quarter.
If we add this back to understand the cash component of the business, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth would have improved another 2 percentage points to 12%, respectively, on a currency-neutral basis.
[indiscernible] here, I would like to provide you with some insight into the trends we saw throughout the quarter. In September, while at the sell side Investor Conference, I made some cautionary comments relating to our organic business. Following the Chinese currency devaluation, we saw several customers it take a more cautious approach to managing their inventory, which ultimately meant sequential softness as we progress through the quarter. This perpetuated, particularly in emerging markets, which while still positive up 3% in Q3 were slower than our first half performance of 8%, despite relatively strong performance in Latin America. And while we remain fully committed to the long-term growth of these key market, in the short-term, we are working to manage the uncertainty and focusing of the leverage we can pull to deliver results and strengthen our business.
Fortunately, we experienced strong orders in the last week the quarter leading to the 4% organic growth rate we reported in Q3 ahead of where we thought we would finish the quarter.
Turning to business unit performance. Flavors posted its 43rd consecutive quarter of growth, increasing 8%, including approximately 4.5 percentage points relating to the acquisitions of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest results in Beverage and Dairy.
In our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, sales increased 4%, led by high single-digit growth in Beverage. Western Europe reported the highest growth, improving 9% driven by strong performance.
North America grew 19%, reflecting additional sales and related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy. If we exclude the benefit of Ottens organic performance improved sequentially versus Q2, up low single-digits.
Latin America increased 20% as all categories reported positive growth. The strong double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the eighth consecutive quarter, led by our proprietary delivery system. Savory and Dairy also grew double digits as a result of strong new win performance, which leverages the proprietary delivery systems as well as our modulation portfolio.
Greater Asia remains constant as growth in Indonesia, India, Singapore and Japan was offset by softness in China, which was primarily driven by a challenging economic environment your
Flavors currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 9% as gross margin expansion and cost and productivity benefits more than offset the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. This led to a 10 basis point improvement in operating profit margin, despite incremental cost in Q3 relating to the China issue. If we exclude this impact, our operating margin would have expended by 80 basis points in the third quarter or growth would have been 12%. It should be noted however, that we expect a portion of this expense to continue as we work through this issue. Specifically, in Q4, we would expect a similar impact in terms of expense as we experienced in Q3. 
Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 6%, including approximately 2 percentage points associated with the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics with all regions posting growth, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit improvement in Greater Asia.
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance was up 1% led by Europe, Africa and the Middle East, which improved 5% as a result of very strong pipeline of new wins, including Olympia by Popper upon, by Proctor & Gamble, by from L'Oreal and Jimmy Choo by
In Latin America, economic conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to have an impact on discretionary spending and ultimately, our fine Fragrance performance. Yet, while sales are down, they improved versus the second quarter and even as economies fall, we continue to see our win rate remain high, which we believe will support our market leadership position us of the economy stabilizes.
I also wanted to put our Fine Fragrance results in Greater Asia into perspective relative to our global Fragrance business. Unfortunately, Greater Asia Fine Fragrances represented approximately 2% of our global fine Fragrance sales, which means quarterly order patterns can have a substantial impact on growth rates as it did in Q1 with Fine Fragrance in Greater Asia was up almost 40%.
And as the market relatively small in terms of per capita uses now, we believe it will increase over time as we stated in our Vision 2020 strategy. 
For the 16th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continue to grow, up 7% with mid- to high single digits in every region and broad-based category growth led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care and high single-digit growth in Hair Care.
In Fabric, thanks in large part to a local knowledge of the consumer and our encapsulated technology, growth was strongest in Greater Asia where we are winning with local customers. And in Hair Care, growth was of the best in Latin America as we have the ability to offer exceptional Fragrances in nontraditional category said that with the consumer's desire for lower-cost alternatives.
Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 6%, driven by the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, which closed on July 30. Sales cosmetic active grew high double digit in Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and the U.S., all as a result of new wins. 
Our base Fragrance Ingredients business, which as a reminder are the external sales that we do not use for our internal company's predictions, remain soft, reflecting more challenging conditions, including our largest Fragrance Ingredients customer, rationalizing their portfolio as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by high single-digit internal demand growth.
On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 15%, driven by volume growth and benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. This performance, plus lower incentive compensation expense, was over 150 basis point improvement in operating profit margin. 
From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital level continue to show improvement as a percent of sales versus the same period of 2014 as our 5 quarter rolling average figure through the end of the third quarter was down 80 basis points to approximately 28.8% of our trailing 12-month sales.
All of our gains versus the first 9 months of 2014 came from lower payables as our days payable outstanding increased 9% versus the same period a year ago. 
Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the third quarter was $295 million, including an incremental $27 million pension contributions over this year. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, operating cash flow would have increased $322 million or 40 basis points in terms of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales and 13.6% during the first 9 months of 2014 to 14% for the equivalent period in 2015.
Looking at our uses of cash. Capital expenditure on a year-to-date basis is $67 million or 2.9% of sales as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives, principally as we finish our plants in Turkey and Indonesia. And while we are a little low on the capital spend year-to-date relative to our full year guidance, we expect to finish approximately 4.5% as spending traditionally falls through during the fourth quarter each year.
For cash returned to shareholders, we expect to continue to deliver a total payout ratio in line with our 50% to 60% target, all while maintaining financial flexibility to capitalize organic growth opportunities and value-creating M&A. 
Dividend payments year-to-date have been $114 million following our 20% increase this past August. Share repurchases at the end of the quarter were $81 million, allowing us to buy back approximately 726,000 shares at an average price of $111.88 per share. Please note that as of Friday, we have repurchased approximately $21 million of shares since the end of the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $102 million.
From a guidance perspective, we are reconfirming our full year 2015 guidance despite the challenging year-ago fourth quarter comparison, which includes approximately 200 basis points of growth related to the 53rd week as well as continued to market uncertainty, which is leading to volatility in order patterns for many of our multinational customers.
Despite continued growth in Latin America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East driven by new wins, our core Flavors business is expected to be soft in the fourth quarter. 
In North America, we expect pressure due a to higher level of volume erosion as a businesses want in previous years are not performing at the same levels that they have historically. We are also seeing general weakness in North America with several of our food and beverage customers reporting volume challenges. 
In Greater Asia, we expect similar trends in the third quarter as we believe economic uncertainty in China will continue to impact our business.
In core Fragrances, we expect continued pressure in Fragrance Ingredients, primarily related to the largest customer continuing its rationalization of their portfolio. 
In Fragrance Compounds, we expect that our strong year-ago comparison, the weakness in the Brazilian economy and our strong year-to-date performance, particularly in Consumer Fragrances, will lead to growth moderating in Q4. Fortunately, we expect to benefit from our recent acquisition, which we believe should lead to moderate currency neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter.
In terms of profitability, on a full year basis, we continue to believe we can achieve approximately 9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The drivers of the profitability performance includes top line growth, benefit of productivity initiatives, lower incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of acquisition.
Stretching our performance to include the impact of currency, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will have an impact. The weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our large currency exposure at about 40% of operating profit is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies, while small in terms of profitability exposure, has all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring profitability. Mitigating this exposure, we expect approximately a 3 percentage point gain from our transactional euro hedging program. Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately a 7 percentage point impact from currency as we do not hedge our translational exposure. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect about a 4% increase, despite an approximately 5 percentage point headwind of currency. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas."

I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. In addition, similar how we structured the quarter 2 conference call, I want to provide an update on the execution of our 4-pillar Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including the specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and our outlook for the balance of the year.
I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the third quarter accelerated versus our second quarter performance, both in terms of currency-neutral sales and currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth, as we continue to benefit from diversity of our business as well as our recent acquisitions. 
Currency-neutral sales in the third quarter improved 7%, including approximately 3 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Organic top line performance, which increased 4% this quarter, continue to be driven by new wins, particularly in Fragrance Compounds where the contribution of new wins were at the highest level in nearly 2 years.
This was favorable to profitability as adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS both grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis. On a year-to-date basis, results remained strong, as currency-neutral sales growing 6% comprised of 8% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. 
For the first 9 months in 2015, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 9% on currency-neutral basis, driven by sales growth, the benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing and our sales cost leverage. 
Complementing our expansion in gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin, lower interest expense, a more favorable effect of tax rate and a reduction of our shares outstanding led to an 11% increase on our currency-neutral adjusted EPS.
On a strategic perspective, I would like to talk about a couple of areas. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position defined by #1 or 2 market share position, we believe we are taking the right steps to deliver on our ambition of accelerated growth. 
In North America, the Flavors team has done a nice job integrating our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors, leveraging their defined go-to-market strategy, which focuses on winning these key regional accounts in the U.S. Our Flavors North America business was up 19%. 
In Flavors Latin America, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well as evident with its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. In the third quarter, growth was very strong, up 20% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Within Fragrance, North America Fragrance Compounds was 7%, with 8% growth in Consumer Fragrances and a 4% growth in Fine Fragrance. The quarter's [ph] subcategory performance that were most notable in North America were Hair Care and Home Care, both of which grew double digits, plus Fabric Care, which grew high single digits.
In the third quarter, China Fragrances, another area where we have ambitions to accelerate gross, was 6% on a currency-neutral basis as we continue to have success with many of the strong regional Consumer Fragrance brands. 
From a category perspective, Home Care, another area of focus for us, improved high single digits globally on a currency-natural basis led by double-digit growth in North America and Latin America. 
Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrance continues to drive growth, with strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the third quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery systems in Flavors.
Fabric Care grew double digits on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter with all geographic markets posting strong growth. This is a direct result of our differentiated encapsulation technology. 
Given our success in Fabric Care, we have begun to expand into other categories as well. In the third quarter, while still early in terms of strategic execution, we have seen strong results in encapsulation-related sales and Toiletries and Home Care, both, which grew double digits. 
Supporting the expansion of this technology into more categories, our R&D team developed the next-generation capsule technology that allows us to further penetrate personal care applications. This technology should allow us to efficiently customize solutions to deliver Fragrance at the points desired by consumers.
In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next-generation fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently launched 2 new, highly anticipated ingredients to our perfumers: customer food [ph] , which is a high-impact complex fruity note with spicy undertones, and Crystalyx, which is a watery [ph] refresh note, to be used is internally by our perfumers as exclusive IFF molecules, which we are not selling externally.
And as we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to commercialize the 2 additional molecules, which would bring our commercialize molecules to 4 this year. If successful, this would effectively put us on track to double our annual Fragrance molecule output average order plus decayed, providing us with greater confidence in our accelerated growth ambition.
As I mentioned moments ago in Flavors, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well. This technology is expanding beyond just Latin America, this proprietary delivery system related sales growing strong double digits globally. 
Sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continue to produce strong results, increasing strong double digits. 
The categories where we had the most success were Savory, Dairy and Beverage, as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of the consumers who are looking for better-for-you products, including reduced sugar and salt. 
To complement this, I'm pleased to announce that we have also commercialized a new natural taste modulator, the second one this year, which is a [indiscernible] designed to reduce the salt perception without changing the product's acidity, particularly useful for yogurts and juice applications. This addition will strengthen our modulation capabilities as it provides our Flavors a more competitive palate to build winning solutions.
Building on a very robust technology pipeline is critical. The third quarter is an example that we are making strong progress against key initiatives that will lead to greater differentiation and ultimately, accelerated growth.
In addition to the strides we have made from market share and innovation perspective, we also made progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. To meet the growing trends in Naturals, in October 2015, IFF LMR Naturals received its 4th For Life Social Responsibility designation, this time in cooperation with Vetiver partner in Haiti. The For Life designation recognizes an organization's adherence to specific sustainability criteria, including transparency, environmental responsibility, fair working conditions and positive relations with producers and local communities. This recognition comes after certification of IFF-LMR Naturals for the rose supply chain in Turkey and its patchouli and basil supply chain in Madagascar.
 
When it comes to sustainability, we won't accept the status quo. Recently, we became the first Flavors and Fragrance company to join DFS and enter a new, growing consortium of a multinational companies committed to ensuring sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.
We also are recognized by the CDP earning a perfect score of 100 in disclosure and an A in performance for its strategies and actions to mitigate climate change. Sustainability is a foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, and we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout business throughout our business practices and our corporate culture for the years to come.
We also won the North American innovation award with one of our largest Flavors customers, which we recognized as partners for their thought leadership. In addition, Estée Lauder also presented us with their Supplier's Excellence Award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top-performing business partners.
I'm pleased to also announce that at the 2015 in-cosmetics Asia, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won the Gold award for the Innovation Zone Best Active Ingredients with Exo-P, a competitive ingredient designed to rapidly improve dull skin for healthy looking complexion in only 7 days, and also won the Gold award of r Innovation Zone Best Functional Ingredient with Lecigel, an ingredient scientifically measured using various techniques developed by specialists in psychology and neuroscience, which provides a positive emotion upon application.
With a focus on the future and in terms of the business participation in the years to come, we also reaffirmed and expanded our core list status with key Flavors customers, 2 based in North America and 1 globally, and also a large Fragrances customer in the third quarter.
As you know, core lists are paramount to winning future business within our industry. Being added to a new core list shows that we are able to bring the right R&D capabilities, consumer insights, regulatory requirements and customers' trust needed to create the winning products in the marketplace.
During the second and third quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions, with focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio. I'm pleased to report that both acquisitions are performing very well. Ottens Flavors' organic sales on a standalone basis increased low double digits, above our North America-based business, which improved substantially. And Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics achieved strong double digit currency neutral sales growth on a standalone basis. We believe these results are good indication that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance in terms of growth and returns.
Following the end of the third quarter, we also announced the partnership with Vapor Communications to pioneer the digital future of scent, combining certain Vapor software and hardware scent platform with IFF scent technology and expertise. The collaboration is anticipated to bring mobile scent experiences to consumers. And while this is an initial step, we believe the technologies developed by Vapor Communications will play an important role in our larger digital scent journey in Vision 2020.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Alison, who will take you through the financials in greater detail."
281407,314308707,899619,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2015",2015-11-10,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Looking at our third quarter results, similar to what I did on our Q2 conference call, I want to continue to lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to our adjusted currency-neutral results.In the first column, which is",2121,"Thank you, Andreas. Looking at our third quarter results, similar to what I did on our Q2 conference call, I want to continue to lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to our adjusted currency-neutral results.
In the first column, which is inclusive of currency, sales contracted by 1%, while adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted EPS grew 5%.
Consistent with what we communicated previously, in the third quarter, we benefited from our euro transactional hedging program, which ultimately protected our euro-denominated profit. Including this benefit, our growth rate in terms of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS accelerated to 7% and 5% versus the 1% and 4% we reported in the first half, respectively. Yet, even with the benefits of hedging, foreign exchange still proved to be a headwind in the third quarter as the U.S. dollar remained strong against many global currencies. 
From a sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS perspective, currency represented an 8, 3 and 5 percentage point impact, respectively. 
On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to deliver strong results, achieving leverage within our P&L with the sales improving 7% and adjusted operating profit growing 10%. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by gross margin expansion and cost leverage, which led to an approximately 50-basis-point improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS also improved by 10% as the year-over-year decrease in our average shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program offset a slightly higher effective tax rate and an increase in interest expense relating to both of our acquisitions. The acquisitions we made earlier this year are adding to our performance, evidenced that we are investing in strategic value-add opportunities that deliver high return. 
In the third quarter, the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyers added approximately 3 points to currently currency neutral sales growth, about 2 points to currency neutral adjusted operating profit and 3 points to currency neutral adjusted EPS growth. It should be noted that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens and Lucas Meyer acquisition represented about $3.5 million in the quarter.
If we add this back to understand the cash component of the business, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth would have improved another 2 percentage points to 12%, respectively, on a currency-neutral basis.
[indiscernible] here, I would like to provide you with some insight into the trends we saw throughout the quarter. In September, while at a sell side Investor Conference, I made some cautionary comments relating to our organic business. Following the Chinese currency devaluation, we saw several customers take a more cautious approach to managing their inventory, which ultimately meant sequential softness as we progress through the quarter. This perpetuated, particularly in emerging markets, which while still positive up 3% in Q3 were slower than our first half performance of 8%, despite relatively strong performance in Latin America. And while we remain fully committed to the long-term growth of these key market, in the short-term, we are working to manage the uncertainty and focusing on the leverage we can pull to deliver results and strengthen our business.
Fortunately, we experienced strong orders in the last week of the quarter leading to the 4% organic growth rate we reported in Q3 ahead of where we thought we would finish the quarter.
Turning to business unit performance. Flavors posted its 43rd consecutive quarter of growth, increasing 8%, including approximately 4.5 percentage points relating to the acquisitions of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest results in Beverage and Dairy.
In our Europe, Africa and Middle East regions, sales increased 4%, led by high single-digit growth in Beverage. Western Europe reported the highest growth, improving 9% driven by strong new win performance.
North America grew 19%, reflecting additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy. If we exclude the benefit of Ottens organic performance improved sequentially versus Q2, up low single-digits.
Latin America increased 20% as all categories reported positive growth. The strong double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the eighth consecutive quarter, led by our proprietary delivery system. Savory and Dairy also grew double digits as a result of strong new win performance, which leverages that proprietary delivery systems as well as our modulation portfolio.
Greater Asia remains constant, as growth in Indonesia, India, Singapore and Japan was offset by softness in China, which was primarily driven by a challenging economic environment.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 9% as gross margin expansion and cost and productivity benefits more than offset the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. This led to a 10-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin, despite incremental costs in Q3 relating to the China issue. If we exclude this impact, our operating margin would have expanded by 80 basis points in the third quarter or growth would have been 12%. It should be noted however, that we expect a portion of this expense to continue as we work through this issue. Specifically, in Q4, we would expect the similar impact in terms of expense as we experienced in Q3. 
Fragrances' currency neutral sales improved 6%, including approximately 2 percentage points associated with the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics with all regions posting growth, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America/and mid-single-digit improvement in Greater Asia.
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance was up 1% led by Europe, Africa and the Middle East, which improved 5% as a result of very strong pipeline of new wins including Olympia by Popper upon, [indiscernible] by Procter & Gamble, La Via Est Belle by Lancome from L'Oreal and Jimmy Choo by [indiscernible] 
In Latin America, economic conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to have an impact on discretionary spending and ultimately, our Fine Fragrance performance. Yet, while sales were down, they improved versus the second quarter. And even as economies fall, we continue to see our win rate remain high, which we believe will support our market leadership position as the economy stabilizes.
I also wanted to put our Fine Fragrance results in Greater Asia into perspective relative to our global Fragrance business. Proportionately, Greater Asia Fine Fragrances represented approximately 2% of our global Fine Fragrance sales, which means quarterly order patterns can have a substantial impact on growth rates as it did in Q1 when Fine Fragrance in Greater Asia was up almost 40%.
And as the market is relatively small in terms of per capita uses now, we believe it will increase over time as we stated in our Vision 2020 strategy. 
For the 16th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continue to grow, up 7%, with mid- to high single digits in every region and broad-based category growth led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care and high single-digit growth in Hair Care.
In Fabric, thanks in large part to a local knowledge of the consumer and our encapsulated technology, growth was as strongest in Greater Asia where we are winning with local customers. And in Hair Care, growth was of the best in Latin America, as we have the ability to offer exceptional Fragrances in nontraditional category that meets the consumer's desire for lower-cost alternatives.
Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 6%, driven by the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, which closed/on July 30. Sales related to cosmetic actives grew high double digits in Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and the U.S., all a result of new wins. 
Our base Fragrance Ingredients business, which as a reminder, are the external sales that we do not use for our internal company's production remains soft, reflecting more challenging work conditions, including our largest Fragrance Ingredients customer, rationalizing their portfolio as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by high single-digit internal demand growth.
On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency-neutral segment's profit improved approximately 15%, driven by volume growth and benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. This performance, plus lower incentive compensation expense, was over 150-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin. 
From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement as a percentage of sales versus the same period in 2014 as our 5-quarter rolling average figure through the end of the third quarter was down 80 basis points to approximately 28.8% of our trailing 12-month sales.
All of our gains versus the first 9 months of 2014 came from lower payables, as our days payable outstanding increased 9% versus the same period a year ago. 
Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the third quarter was $295 million, including an incremental $27 million pension contributions so far this year. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, operating cash flow would have increased $322 million or 40 basis points in terms of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales and 13.6% during the first 9 months of 2014 to 14% for the equivalent period in 2015.
Looking at our uses of cash. Capital expenditure on a year-to-date basis is $67 million or 2.9% of sales as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives, principally as we finish our plants in Turkey and Indonesia. And while we are a little low on the capital spend year-to-date relative to our full year guidance, we expect to finish approximately 4.5% as spending traditionally falls through during the fourth quarter each year.
For cash returned to shareholders, we expect to continue to deliver a total payout ratio in line with our 50% to 60% target, all while maintaining financial flexibility to capitalize the planned organic growth opportunities and value-creating M&A. 
Dividend payments year-to-date has been $114 million, following our 20% increase this past August. Share repurchases at the end of the quarter were $81 million, allowing us to buy back approximately 726,000 shares at an average price of $111.88 per share. Please note that as of Friday, we have repurchased approximately $21 million of shares since the end of the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $102 million.
From a guidance perspective, we are reconfirming our full year 2015 guidance despite the challenging year-ago fourth quarter comparison, which includes approximately 200 basis points of growth related to the 53rd week as well as continued market uncertainty, which is leading to volatility in order patterns for many of our multinational customers.
Despite continued growth in Latin America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East, driven by new wins, our core Flavors business is expected to be soft in the fourth quarter. 
In North America, we expect pressure due a to higher level of volume erosion as businesses we won in previous years are not performing at the same levels that they have historically. We are also seeing general line weakness in North America with several of our food and beverage customers reporting volume challenges. 
In Greater Asia, we expect similar trends through the third quarter as we believe the economic uncertainty in China will continue to impact our business.
In core Fragrances, we expect continued pressure in Fragrance Ingredients, primarily related to the largest customer continuing its rationalization of their portfolio. 
In Fragrance Compounds, we expect that our strong year-ago comparison, the weakness in the Brazilian economy and our strong year-to-date performance, particularly in Consumer Fragrances, will lead to growth moderating in Q4. Fortunately, we expect to benefit from our recent acquisitions, which we believe should lead to moderate currency neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter.
In terms of profitability, on a full year basis, we continue to believe we can achieve approximately 9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The drivers of the profitability performance includes top line growth, benefits of productivity initiatives, lower incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of acquisition.
Stretching our [ph] performance to include the impact of currency, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will have an impact. The weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our large currency exposure, at about 40% of operating profit, is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies, while small in terms of profitability exposure, has all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring profitability. Mitigating this exposure, we expect approximately a 3 percentage point gain from our transactional euro hedging program. Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately a 7-percentage-point impact from currency as we do not hedge our translational exposure. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect about a 4% increase, despite an approximately 5 percentage point headwind of currency. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas."

Once finished, I will ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including the specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and our outlook for the balance of the year.
I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the third quarter accelerated versus our second quarter performance, both in terms of currency-neutral sales and currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth, as we continue to benefit from diversity of our business as well as our recent acquisitions. 
Currency-neutral sales in the third quarter improved 7%, including approximately 3 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Organic top line performance, which increased 4% this quarter, continue to be driven by new wins, particularly in Fragrance Compounds where the contribution of new wins were at the highest level in nearly 2 years.
This was favorable to profitability as adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS both grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis. On a year-to-date basis, results remained strong, as currency-neutral sales growing 6% comprised of 8% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. 
For the first 9 months in 2015, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 9% on currency-neutral basis, driven by sales growth, the benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing and our sales cost leverage. 
Complementing our expansion in gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin, lower interest expense, a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction of our shares outstanding led to an 11% increase in our currency-neutral adjusted EPS.
On a strategic perspective, I would like to talk about a couple of areas. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position defined by #1 or 2 market share position, we believe we are taking the right steps to deliver on our ambition of accelerated growth. 
In North America, the Flavors team has done a nice job integrating our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors, leveraging their defined go-to-market strategy, which focuses on winning with key regional accounts in the U.S. Our Flavors North America business was up 19%. 
In Flavors Latin America, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well as evident with its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. In the third quarter, growth was very strong, up 20% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Within Fragrance, North America Fragrance Compounds was 7%, with 8% growth in Consumer Fragrances and a 4% growth in Fine Fragrance. The quarter's 3 subcategory performance that were most notable in North America were Hair Care and Home Care, both of which grew double digits, plus Fabric Care, which grew high single digits.
In the third quarter, China Fragrances, another area where we have ambitions to accelerate growth, was 6% on a currency-neutral basis as we continue to have success with many of the strong regional Consumer Fragrance brands. 
From a category perspective, Home Care, another area of focus for us, improved high single digits globally on a currency-natural basis led by double-digit growth in North America and Latin America. 
Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrance continues to drive growth, with strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the third quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery systems in Flavors.
Fabric Care grew double digits on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter with all geographic markets posting strong growth. This is a direct result of our differentiated encapsulation technology. 
Given our success in Fabric Care, we have begun to expand into other categories as well. In the third quarter, while still early in terms of strategic execution, we have seen strong results in encapsulation-related sales in Toiletries and Home Care, both which grew double digits. 
Supporting the expansion of this technology into more categories, our R&D team developed the next-generation capsule technology that allows us to further penetrate personal care applications. This technology should allow us to efficiently customize solutions to deliver Fragrance at the points desired by consumers.
In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next-generation fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently launched 2 new, highly anticipated ingredients to our perfumers: Cosmo Fruit [ph], which is a high-impact complex fruity note with spicy undertones, and Crystal Fizz [ph], which is a watery fresh [indiscernible] note, to be used is internally by our perfumers as exclusive IFF molecules, which we are not selling externally.
And as we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to commercialize 2 additional molecules, which would bring our commercialize molecules to 4 this year. If successful, this would effectively put us on track to double our annual Fragrance molecule output average order plus decayed, providing us with greater confidence in our accelerated growth ambition.
As I mentioned moments ago in Flavors, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well. This technology is expanding beyond just Latin America, with proprietary delivery system related sales growing strong double digits globally. 
Sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continue to produce strong results, increasing strong double digits. 
The categories where we had the most success were Savory, Dairy and Beverage, as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of the consumers who are looking for better-for-you products, including reduced sugar and salt. 
To complement this, I'm pleased to announce that we have also commercialized a new natural taste modulator, the second one this year, which is a sour masker designed to reduce the sour perception without changing the product's acidity, particularly useful for yogurts and juice applications. This addition will strengthen our modulation capabilities as it provides our Flavors a more competitive palate to build winning solutions.
Building on a very robust technology pipeline is critical. The third quarter is an example that we are making strong progress against key initiatives that will lead to greater differentiation and ultimately, accelerated growth.
In addition to the strides we have made from market share and innovation perspective, we also made progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. To meet the growing trends in Naturals, in October 2015, IFF LMR Naturals received its 4th For Life Social Responsibility designation, this time in cooperation with our Vetiver partner in Haiti. The For Life designation recognizes an organization's adherence to specific sustainability criteria, including transparency, environmental responsibility, fair working conditions and positive relations with producers and local communities. This recognition comes after certification of IFF-LMR Naturals for the rose supply chain in Turkey and its patchouli and basil supply chain in Madagascar.
 
When it comes to sustainability, we won't accept the status quo. Recently, we became the first Flavors and Fragrance company to join TfS and enter a new, growing consortium of multinational companies committed to ensuring sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.
We also are recognized by the CDP earning a perfect score of 100 in disclosure and an A in performance for its strategies and actions to mitigate climate change. Sustainability is a foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, and we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our business practices and our corporate culture for the years to come.
We also won the North American innovation award with one of our largest Flavors customers, which we recognized as partners for their thought leadership. In addition, Estée Lauder also presented us with their Supplier's Excellence Award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top-performing business partners.
I'm pleased to also announce that at the 2015 in-cosmetics Asia, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won the Gold award for the Innovation Zone Best Active Ingredients with Exo-P, a patented ingredient designed to rapidly improve dull skin for healthy looking complexion in only 7 days, and also won the Gold award of Innovation Zone Best Functional Ingredient with Lecigel, an ingredient scientifically measured using various techniques developed by specialists in psychology and neuroscience, which provides a positive emotion upon application.
With a focus on the future and in terms of business participation in the years to come, we also reaffirmed and expanded our core list status with key Flavors customers, 2 based in North America and 1 globally, and also a large Fragrances customer in the third quarter.
As you know, core lists are paramount to winning future business within our industry. Being added to a new core list shows that we are able to bring the right R&D capabilities, consumer insights, regulatory requirements and customers' trust needed to create the winning products in the marketplace.
During the second and third quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions, with focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio. I'm pleased to report that both acquisitions are performing very well. Ottens Flavors' organic sales on a standalone basis increased low double digits, above our North America-based business, which improved substantially. And Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved strong double digit currency neutral sales growth on a standalone basis. We believe these results are good indication that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance in terms of growth and returns.
Following the end of the third quarter, we also announced the partnership with Vapor Communications to pioneer the digital future of scent, combining certain Vapor software and hardware scent platform with IFF scent technology and expertise. The collaboration is anticipated to bring mobile scent experiences to consumers. And while this is an initial step, we believe the technologies developed by Vapor Communications will play an important role in our larger digital scent journey in Vision 2020.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Alison, who will take you through the financials in greater detail."
281407,314308707,899956,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2015",2015-11-10,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Looking at our third quarter results, similar to what I did on our Q2 conference call, I want to continue to lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to our adjusted currency-neutral results.In the first column, which is",2131,"Thank you, Andreas. Looking at our third quarter results, similar to what I did on our Q2 conference call, I want to continue to lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to our adjusted currency-neutral results.
In the first column, which is inclusive of currency, sales contracted by 1%, while adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted EPS grew 5%.
Consistent with what we communicated previously, in the third quarter, we benefited from our euro transactional hedging program, which ultimately protected our euro-denominated profit. Including this benefit, our growth rate in terms of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS accelerated to 7% and 5% versus the 1% and 4% we reported in the first half, respectively. Yet, even with the benefits of hedging, foreign exchange still proved to be a headwind in the third quarter as the U.S. dollar remained strong against many global currencies. 
From a sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS perspective, currency represented an 8, 3 and 5 percentage point impact, respectively. 
On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to deliver strong results, achieving leverage within our P&L with sales improving 7% and adjusted operating profit growing 10%. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by gross margin expansion and cost leverage, which led to an approximately 50-basis-point improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS also improved by 10% as the year-over-year decrease in our average shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program offset a slightly higher effective tax rate and an increase in interest expense relating to both of our acquisitions. The acquisitions we made earlier this year are adding to our performance, evidence that we are investing in strategic value-add opportunities that deliver high returns. 
In the third quarter, the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer's added approximately 3 points to currency neutral sales growth, about 2 points to currency neutral adjusted operating profit and 3 points to currency neutral adjusted EPS growth. It should be noted that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens and Lucas Meyer acquisition represented about $3.5 million in the quarter.
If we add this back to understand the cash component of the business, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth would have improved another 2 percentage points to 12%, respectively, on a currency-neutral basis.
[indiscernible] here, I would like to provide you with some insight into the trends we saw throughout the quarter. In September, while at a sell side Investor Conference, I made some cautionary comments relating to our organic business. Following the Chinese currency devaluation, we saw several customers take a more cautious approach to managing their inventory, which ultimately meant sequential softness as we progress through the quarter. This perpetuated, particularly in emerging markets, which while still positive, up 3% in Q3, were slower than our first half performance of 8%, despite relatively strong performance in Latin America. And while we remain fully committed to the long-term growth of these key market, in the short-term, we are working to manage the uncertainty and focusing on the leverage we can pull to deliver results and strengthen our business.
Fortunately, we experienced strong orders in the last week of the quarter leading to the 4% organic growth rate we reported in Q3 ahead of where we thought we would finish the quarter.
Turning to business unit performance. Flavors posted its 43rd consecutive quarter of growth, increasing 8%, including approximately 4.5 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest results in Beverage and Dairy.
In our Europe, Africa and Middle East regions, sales increased 4%, led by high single-digit growth in Beverage. Western Europe reported the highest growth, improving 9% driven by strong new win performance.
North America grew 19%, reflecting additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy. If we exclude the benefit of Ottens, organic performance improved sequentially versus Q2, up low single-digits.
Latin America increased 20% as all categories reported positive growth. The strong double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the eighth consecutive quarter, led by our proprietary delivery system. Savory and Dairy also grew double digits as a result of strong new win performance, which leverages that proprietary delivery systems as well as our modulation portfolio.
Greater Asia remained constant, as growth in Indonesia, India, Singapore and Japan was offset by softness in China, which was primarily driven by a challenging economic environment.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit improved approximately 9% as gross margin expansion and cost and productivity benefits more than offset the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. This led to a 10-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin, despite incremental costs in Q3 relating to the China odor issue. If we exclude this impact, our operating margin would have expanded by 80 basis points in the third quarter or growth would have been 12%. It should be noted however, that we expect a portion of this expense to continue as we work through this issue. Specifically, in Q4, we would expect the similar impact in terms of expense as we experienced in Q3. 
Fragrances' currency-neutral sales improved 6%, including approximately 2 percentage points associated with the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics with all regions posting growth, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit improvement in Greater Asia.
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance was up 1% led by Europe, Africa and the Middle East, which improved 5% as a result of very strong pipeline of new wins including Olympea by Pooge [ph] from Paco Rabanne, Boss the scent by Procter & Gamble, La Via Est Belle by Lancome from L'Oreal and Jimmy Choo Illicit by Interparfums. 
In Latin America, economic conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to have an impact on discretionary spending and ultimately, our Fine Fragrance performance. Yet, while sales were down, they improved versus the second quarter. And even as the economy is soft, we continue to see our win rate remain high, which we believe will support our market leadership position as the economy stabilizes.
I also wanted to put our Fine Fragrance results in Greater Asia into perspective relative to our global Fragrance business. Proportionately, Greater Asia Fine Fragrances represented approximately 2% of our global Fine Fragrance sales, which means quarterly order patterns can have a substantial impact on growth rates as it did in Q1 when Fine Fragrance in Greater Asia was up almost 40%.
And as the market is relatively small in terms of per capita uses now, we believe it will increase over time as we stated in our Vision 2020 strategy. 
For the 16th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continue to grow, up 7%, with mid- to high single digits in every region and broad-based category growth led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care and high single-digit growth in Hair Care.
In Fabric, thanks in large part to our local knowledge of the consumer and our encapsulated technology, growth was its strongest in Greater Asia where we are winning with local customers. And in Hair Care, growth was the best in Latin America, as we have the ability to offer exceptional Fragrances in nontraditional category that meets the consumer's desire for lower-cost alternatives.
Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 6%, driven by the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, which closed on July 30. Sales related to cosmetic and actives grew high double digits in Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and the U.S., all a result of new wins. 
Our base Fragrance Ingredients business, which as a reminder, are the external sales that we do not use for our internal compounds production remains soft, reflecting more challenging work conditions, including our largest Fragrance Ingredients customer, rationalizing their portfolio as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by high single-digit internal demand growth.
On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 15%, driven by volume growth and benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. This performance, plus lower incentive compensation expense, led to over 150-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin. 
From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement as a percentage of sales versus the same period in 2014 as our 5-quarter rolling average figure through the end of the third quarter was down 80 basis points to approximately 28.8% of our trailing 12-month sales.
All of our gains versus the first 9 months of 2014 came from lower payables, as our days payable outstanding increased 9% versus the same period a year ago. 
Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the third quarter was $295 million, including an incremental $27 million pension contribution so far this year. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, operating cash flow would have increased $322 million or 40 basis points in terms of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales and 13.6% during the first 9 months of 2014 to 14% for the equivalent period in 2015.
Looking at our uses of cash. Capital expenditure on a year-to-date basis has been $67 million or 2.9% of sales as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives, principally as we finish our plants in Turkey and Indonesia. And while we are a little low on the capital spend year-to-date relative to our full year guidance, we expect to finish approximately 4.5% as spending traditionally flows through during the fourth quarter each year.
For cash returned to shareholders, we expect to continue to deliver a total payout ratio in line with our 50% to 60% target, all while maintaining financial flexibility to capitalize the planned organic growth opportunities and value-creating M&A. 
Dividend payments year-to-date have been $114 million, following our 20% increase this past August. Share repurchases at the end of the quarter were $81 million, allowing us to buy back approximately 726,000 shares at an average price of $111.88 per share. Please note that as of Friday, we have repurchased approximately $21 million of shares since the end of the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $102 million.
From a guidance perspective, we are reconfirming our full year 2015 guidance despite the challenging year-ago fourth quarter comparison, which includes approximately 200 basis points of growth related to the 53rd week as well as continued market uncertainty, which is leading to volatility in order patterns for many of our multinational customers.
Despite continued growth in Latin America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East, driven by new wins, our core Flavor business is expected to be soft in the fourth quarter. 
In North America, we expect pressure due a to higher level of volume erosion as businesses we won in previous years are not performing at the same levels that they have historically. We are also seeing general line weakness in North America with several of our food and beverage customers reporting volume challenges. 
In Greater Asia, we expect similar trends through the third quarter as we believe the economic uncertainty in China will continue to impact our business.
In core Fragrances, we expect continued pressure in Fragrance Ingredients, primarily related to the largest customer continuing its rationalization of their portfolio. 
In Fragrance Compounds, we expect that our strong year-ago comparison, the weakness in the Brazilian economy and our strong year-to-date performance, particularly in Consumer Fragrances, will lead to growth moderating in Q4. Fortunately, we expect to benefit from our recent acquisitions, which we believe should lead to moderate currency neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter.
In terms of profitability, on a full year basis, we continue to believe we can achieve approximately 9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The drivers of our profitability performance includes top line growth, benefits of productivity initiatives, lower incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of acquisition.
Stretching our [ph] performance to include the impact of currency, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will have an impact. The weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our large currency exposure, at about 40% of operating profit, is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies, while small in terms of profitability exposure, have all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring profitability. Mitigating this exposure, we expect approximately a 3 percentage point gain from our transactional euro hedging program. Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately a 7-percentage-point impact from currency as we do not hedge our translational exposure. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect about a 4% increase, despite an approximately 5 percentage point headwind of currency. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas."

What we see is that for some of our, particularly our global customers or other volumes are slowing, but it's actually not one-fits-all answer because we see in some areas like still Latin America on the Flavors side, we see strong growth as in the third quarter, which is really, really double-digit. We see countries in Asia with strong growth for both businesses. And we see Europe at least on for our business recovering as well. So at the end of the day, it's a very mixed picture region-by-region. The only thing which is probably universal is that the volume is, for some of the global customers, is really challenged. So that's how we would comment on that one. So it's very different and it depends also on the technologies and let me elaborate on that. If you have a technology which helps the customers to grow the business like our sweetness modulation for example, which we are selling very well, or the encapsulation on the Fragrance side, then the wins are strong and that even against the market trend make great strides. I know it's probably not a general satisfying answer, but it is a very diverse picture we are giving this year."
