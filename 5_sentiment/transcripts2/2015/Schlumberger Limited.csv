Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.50.

Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.50. This represents an increase of $0.01 sequentially and is $0.15 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded $1.8 billion of pretax charges. These charges are primarily related to actions we have taken to meet the challenges of the current market conditions. The $806 million of charges relating to the restructuring of the WesternGeco seismically are as we announced last month. We have recorded $296 million of severance cost associated with the headcount reduction of approximately 9,000. This reduction, which will largely be completed by the end of the first quarter, will bring our headcount more in line with the currently anticipated activity levels. In Venezuela, effective December 31, 2014, we changed the exchange rate we apply for our bolivar denominated transactions from VEB 6.32 to VEB 50 per dollar, which is in line with the CCAP 2 exchange rate resulting in a $472 million charge. We believe that this rate now best represents the economics of our business activity in Venezuela. Going forward, this charge will reduce the U.S. dollar amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses. Had we applied this exchange rate throughout all of 2014, we would have reduced our full year EPS by approximately $0.08. 
The last item relates to a $199 million write-down on unconventional integrated project in the Eagle Ford as a result of the decline in oil prices. Fourth quarter revenue of $12.6 billion was flat sequentially. This reflected approximately $260 million of year end software product and multiclient sales, which were weaker than what we typically experience in the fourth [ph] quarter. Pretax operating income of $2.8 million decreased 1% sequentially while the pretax operating margins decreased by just 19 basis points to 22%. This level of margin is consistent with the same period last year. Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter reservoir characterization group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 3% sequentially while the margins increased by 95 basis points to 30.9%. The revenue decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal drop in marine seismic activity while wireline experienced declines in Russia due to the seasonality and the weakening of the ruble. These decreases were partially offset by year end multiclient and software sales. The margin increase reflected a more favorable revenue mix as a result of the year end sales. 
[indiscernible] through fourth quarter revenue of $4.7 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined by 94 basis points to 20.7%. These decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable currency effects and activities declines in Russia that impacted the Drilling & Measurements and as well as lower IPN activity in Mexico. Fourth quarter production in group revenue was just under $5 billion increased 5% sequentially from higher Well Services activity in both Western Canada and U.S. land. Year end sales of completion on Artificial Lift products also contributed to the increase. Pretax margins were essentially flat at 18.3%. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.1% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion, representing an improvement of $458 million as compared to the end of Q3. We spent $1.1 billion on our stock buyback program during Q4. This represented 12.1 million shares at an average price of $90.22. 
Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of almost $1 billion. From a cash flow perspective, we generated $11.2 billion of cash flow from operations during fall of 2014. During the same period, we generated a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. This represents $700 million increase over 2013 [ph] and means that we converted 54% [ph] of our 2014 earnings, excluding charges and credits into free cash flow. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities, which we did by completing various acquisitions and investing $4 billion in CapEx, $1.1 billion in multiclient and SPM projects, while at the same time, returning $6.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. 
During the full year 2014, we repurchased 47.5 million shares at an average price of $98.38 for a total of $4.7 billion while paying out almost $2 billion in dividends. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase on our annual dividend to $2 per share. This is now the fifth consecutive year that we have increased our dividend, and this results in doubling of over the 5-year period. This new level of dividend reflects our confidence in our ability to continue to generate superior cash flows and return excess cash to our shareholders even in the face of market challenges.  
As it relates to 2015, our strong balance sheet will continue -- will also allow us to be opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of market conditions to make strategic acquisitions and investments.  CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investment, is expected to be approximately $3 billion in 2015. We expect the ATR for the full year 2015 to be in the low to mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings. Now I turn the conference over to Paal."

In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East & Asia.

In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East & Asia. In other international area, Latin America revenues improved slightly on higher activity in Venezuela and Colombia while Europe CIS and Africa fell as the ruble weakened the seasonal decline activity started in Russia. Europe/CIS/Africa declined further from the downward trend in oil prices, which curtails customer activity and reduced rig count in the North Sea and parts of West Africa. Overall fourth quarter revenue was flat with the previous quarter but grew 6% year-on-year. Pretax operating income decreased 1% sequentially and grew 7% year-on-year while pretax operating margins were essentially flat, dripping [ph] 19 basis points sequentially but rising 13 basis point year-on-year. 
This performance ended the year in which Schlumberger revenue climbed to a new high in spite of significant headwinds including activity challenges in a number of GeoMarkets, geopolitical unrest in Libya and Iraq, international sanctions in Russia and reducing customer spend. Still our global footprint broad business portfolio and strong execution capabilities provided the required resilience to outperform even in this environment. 
Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to more than $6.2 billion. This represents an increase of 13% over 2013 and a conversion of 84% for the full year's earnings into free cash flow. During the quarter, we continued our active stock buyback program, buying back $1.1 billion in stock to keep us on track to complete the $10 billion program during the stated 2.5 year period. As a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our continuing ability to generate free cash flow, the board of directors just approve the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend, which means that we have doubled our dividend payment for the past 5 years. 
By geography, our North American results set a new record for the area as revenue grew 2% sequentially. Land activity improved in spite of that sequential rig count as new technology introductions and operational efficiencies drove performance. Drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico return to normal, and grew by 12% sequentially, totaling the impact of new currents in the third quarter, while multiclient seismic sales also improved although ending up significantly down compared to the same quarter last year. Sequential revenue gains were led by the Production Group on higher pressure pumping activity on land in both the U.S. and Canada and further supported by very strong uptake of the BroadBand family of stimulation technologies that are growing at 4x the rate of HiWAY at the same stage of its introduction. North America margins increased by a further 24 basis points in Q4 to reach 19.6% driven by stronger activity and new technology update, solid execution and further supply chain cost improvements. Lower oil prices have already recreated pricing pressure on land for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services, and we are actively working with our customers in all basins to help lower the overall drilling and completion costs. 
In addition to general pricing discussions, our customer interactions are focused on how we can better work together and how we can create savings from new technologies and work close as well as from improved operational planning and efficiency. Looking forward, in North America, we see a relatively flat first quarter for offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico as well as solid activity in Canada. However, the dramatic foreign oil prices has already launched a reduction of around 400 in U.S. Land compared to the October peak, and we expect that the trend of activity reductions and pricing pressure to continue in the first quarter. 
In our International business, strength in the Middle East & Asia and solid performance in Latin America was offset by significant revenue reductions in Europe, CIS and Africa. As a result, revenues slipped 1% sequentially but improved 1% year-on-year while pretax operating income decreased 2% sequentially but grew 4% year-on-year. Full year performance in the international market was strong in spite of E&P capital expense remaining flat to 2013. 
Year-on-year, revenue grew by 4%. Operating income by 12%, with incremental margins of 69%. International margins, which ended the year at 24%, grew 168 basis points versus 2013, and we generated more than 70% of our global operating income in the international market in the past year.  The significant drop in oil prices have put pressure on our customers to further reduce their cost per barrel, and we are actively engaged with most of them to find ways to generate the required cost savings while maintaining a very strong focus on the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide. 
Within the international area, performance was led by the Middle East & Asia with sequential revenue grew by 4% and pretax operating margins increased by 71 basis points to 28.3% driven by activity growth in the Middle East while activity in Asia was largely unchanged. Year-on-year revenue increased 6% and margins grew by 213 basis points. In the Middle East region, activity reached a new record in Saudi Arabia led by growth from a number of key projects, and we expect to see continued strong levels of both rig-related and rig-led activity in the coming year. Kuwait was also strong on land seismic activity and year-end product and software sales, while Oman continues to be driven by Wireline Services and hydraulic fracturing work. Activity was again higher at the United Arab Emirates, particularly for well construction technologies, both offshore and on the island drilling project. In Iraq, activity was steady in the north as an improved security environment had allowed operations to slowly resume. However, the overall activity levels still remains significantly below pre-conflict levels. In the south, we saw modest activity improvements although new project start-ups continue to be delayed. Southeast Asia remains flat with the third quarter as strength in shale gas development on land in China offset modest activity declines in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. China was also boosted by increased product sales during the fourth quarter and strong offshore activity in Bohai Bay. In Malaysia, work has begun in the new construction project on the Boha Field where we have now been conducting integrated project and production management operations for more than 10 years. This is another example of the value that long-term relationships bring to integrated operations. 
In Latin America, revenue improved 1% sequentially while pretax operating margins fell 103 [ph] basis points to 20.9% as growth in Colombia and Venezuela was offset by weakness in Mexico and delays in Argentina and Brazil. Year-on-year revenue grew by 3% while pretax operating margins slipped by 31 basis points. In Venezuela, growth was driven by new technology and workflow deployments for PDVSA as well as increased activity in the through a series of new project start-ups. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget constraints and seasonal weather effect impacting offshore activity. The lower customer spend mainly impacted land development activity although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in the area, activity in Brazil was solid on land but offshore work was lower as IOC projects were completed and drilling delays were experienced on existing projects. In Argentina, growth slowed in the fourth quarter although activity for unconventional resources group and the HiWAY technology continuing to penetrate the market. 
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell by 7% sequentially with margins declining by 112 basis points to 22.3%. Compared with the same quarter last year, Europe/CIS and Africa revenues fell by 5% while margins slipped by 21 basis points. In Russia, weakness in the ruble and the onset of winter weather led to the lower results. The North Sea activity also declined on lower rig count in both Norway and the U.K. as customers reduced activity in response to lower oil prices.  In other parts of the Europe Africa and CIS Area, activity was stronger in North Africa with increasing activity for unconventional resources in Algeria and Tunisia. This was partly offset by very weak activity in Libya where we now have successfully restructured our operations in line with the lower activity. In Angola, activity decreased following the peak in exploration seen in the third quarter, while elsewhere in Sub-Sahara Africa activity was strong in Congo, and we also secured additional work in Chad and Gavan. 
Before leaving the Europe/CIS/Africa area, I would also like to mention that we were awarded a full [ph] year contract for drilling and well services by Statoil for the U.K. Mariner development east of Shetland. Mariner is one of the largest project developments on the U.K. Continental Shelf in the last 10 years, and the 22 distinct services at Schlumberger will provide offer considerable opportunities for integration in this unique project. 
In terms of the outlook for the international market, as far as the Middle East and parts of Latin America, we do expect a reduction in spend levels for all customers groups in the coming year although we believe that the activity and pricing impact will be less than what is projected in North American land. It is also worth while to keep in mind that E&P spending in international market was already flat in 2014 with a corresponding drop in discovered reserves and in oil production capacity. So a further reduction in spend levels in 2015 will likely accelerate these trends. 
Turning to the overall macro outlook for 2015. GDP growth rates softened somewhat in the fourth quarter, and at 3%, growth is still projected to be our event 2014 confirming that the global recovery remains intact, and as a result, the amount for oil is again expected to increase by around 1 million barrels per day in 2015.  Looking at the supply side, the growth in global oil production capacity of around 1 million barrels per day over the past year matches the growth in demand. So the overall oil market is actually still relatively well-balanced from a capacity standpoint. The dramatic fall in oil prices is instead a result of higher marketing supply in the second half of 2014 from North America and also from OPEC who have shifted focus from protecting oil prices to protecting market share. In response to the fall in oil prices, the industry is currently in the process of significantly reducing E&P investments, which will lead to a reduction in supply as decline rates impact current production capacity and lower exploration and development activity delay supply additions. 
In a scenario of continuing economic growth and increasing demand for oil, the lower E&P investment levels will lead to a tightening of the oil market with the first indication being the reduce production capacity in the international markets in 2014 following a year of flat E&P investment. In this uncertain environment, we continue to focus on what we can control, and we have already taken significant steps to restructure and rightsize our business to match the reduced E&P investment levels. We are further convinced that performance must now be driven by an accelerated change in the way we work through our transformation program. The delivery of new technology that improves the performance of our customers reservoirs, the increases in efficiency and reliability that reduce overall finding development and production costs and the opportunities for growth as greater integration bring are all significant drivers of our own and our customers' performance. The technical performance targets of our transformation program is independent of the macro environment, and we are in 2015 actually looking to further accelerate the implementation of the program. 
In terms of technology, we still expect new technology sales at premium pricing to contribute more than 25% of our revenue while the also target integration related activity where we had unique capabilities will exceed 30% of our total activity. In terms of reliability and efficiency, we are in 2015 aiming to make further progress towards our target of a tenfold reduction in unproductive time, doubling energy utilization, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of support costs, which will all help to significantly lower our operating costs. 
Part of our transformation program requires us to work differently with our customers in order to fully realize the value for both them and for us. Given the current business environment, we have engaged with many of them in recent months to drive forward these changes with very positive response. Still given the level of the oil price and the industry-wide focus on reducing E&P investments, we clearly have a challenging year in front of us. In this environment, we have our entire organization fully focused on continuing to engaging our customers to understand any changes to their plans. We have the resources productivity in line with the targets and playbooks we have established and to manage commercial discussions according to the priorities we have put in place for each of the over 80 countries where we operate. We own our strong execution focus, we also see the coming year as flushed with opportunities for us, which we intend to fully capitalize on as we look to strengthen the company going forward. With our wide geographical footprint, extensive business portfolio and clear financial strength, we remain confident in our ability to outperform any part of the cycle, including the current market conditions. 
Thank you. We will now open up for questions."

So if you look at the high level macro view that we have, nothing has really changed from what we said in the Q3 call.

So if you look at the high level macro view that we have, nothing has really changed from what we said in the Q3 call. So looking at GDP at 3%, we're still looking at solid growth overall in 2015, and all the is also going to be up. So as we said in Q3, the issue is really on the supply side, where I think it's very important that we separate between global production capacity and market supply. So if you look at the global production capacity in 2014, it grew by about 1 million barrels a day, which is equal to the growth in demand. So the significant drop in oil prices is not driven by this overcapacity but rather by the higher marketed supply, which is coming from North America and from OPEC. So we believe that the supply side is currently going through a significant change where the key low-cost producers have shifted focus from affecting price to now protect market share. And the consequence of this is that, at least for a period of time, this is going to make the high-cost producers become the new producers where the activity is going to be even more driven by the variations in oil price and the economics of the -- of their projects. And the tool used to drive this change to the supply side is the lower oil price, which is what we're seeing now. So the main new element from the Q3 call is that OPEC decided not to cut production. So the reduction in the market marketed supply would have to come from lower E&P investments, and that's really the only offtake to our macro view."

And the weakening supply will either come first from North America or from international. I think the signs we need to look at our different from the 2 regions. Given the strong growth momentum in North America, I think what the markets will be looking for here is a slowing year-over-year growth, while given the flat investment levels in international market in 2014, capacity will be reduced in 2014.

So I think most likely we are going to face a situation in North America land with lower activity more focused on the lower cost reduction areas for a while, and that's what I have say."

And while we share your view that the contraction internationally is going to be more benign than in North America, it's still going to be fairly consequential.

What we have passed our senior management team in the quite free cash flow meetings we've had over the past quarter, there are really 3 high level things. Firstly, the increased importance of staying very, very close to our customers. Firstly, to actively support their efforts to reduce their cost levels, but also to make sure that we very clearly understand their plans and changes to their plans. That's the first one. The second is what you alluded to that we stay focused on what we control, and that is to proactively adjust costs to activity levels and factoring in the benefits from the transformation and are also having a clear plan on how we're going to navigate the commercial landscape in terms of activity in pricing discussions with our customers, but also very importantly, to continue to focus on deliver safe and high-quality operations, which is essential to our performance but also to our customers' performance. And the third one, which we are also balancing into the total picture, is to capture the opportunities that we see in the current environment. And we see the current environment as being flushed with opportunities for us. Firstly, to gain market share in light of our 2 main competitors looking to combine. Secondly, to accelerate the transformation. Our organization is now pulling very hard on it, and we also see our customers being very open to adjust how we work with them and how we interact with them to gain some of the benefits. And then the third one is inorganic growth. We see lots of opportunities for this based on our strong cash flow and also by our very strong balance sheet.

I just mentioned in Brazil, there seems to be potentially further cuts in Brazil, and I think there is still a bit lack of visibility in Angola, but I would say 5% to 10% decline in activity is what we expect, which is more in line with what we absorbed in 2014.

In North America land, that has been the situation. I would say that we are seeing, or in 2014, we did see a growing offtake and a growing appetite to apply new technologies to drive both higher production and lower cost to improve cost per barrel. So I would say the BroadBand family of stimulation technologies is a very good example of this. HiWAY was one of the first kind of major technology innovations on the frac side in terms of fluids for quite a while. As we introduced it in 2011, it grew very fast, but with the BroadBand family, which was introduced in the earlier parts of 2014, this is currently growing at 4x the pace. So part of this is that we have engaged our customers in a slightly different way this time around for BroadBand, and we have met, myself and my team included, with a range of our customers at the CEO, COO level to lay out firstly, what the technology does but also to give them introductory offers to basically demonstrate what the technologies can do.

301966,275102247,746759,"Schlumberger Limited, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2015",2015-01-16,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.50. This represents an increase of $0.01 sequentially and is $",910,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.50. This represents an increase of $0.01 sequentially and is $0.15 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $1.8 billion of pretax charges. These charges are primarily related to actions we have taken to meet the challenges of the current market conditions. The $806 million of charges relating to the restructuring of the WesternGeco seismically are as we announced last month. We have recorded $296 million of severance cost associated with the headcount reduction of approximately 9,000. This reduction, which will largely be completed by the end of the first quarter, will bring our headcount more in line with the currently anticipated activity levels. 
In Venezuela, effective December 31, 2014, we changed the exchange rate we apply to our bolivar-denominated transactions from VEB 6.32 to VEB 50 per dollar, which is in line with the SICAD II exchange rate, resulting in a $472 million charge. We believe that this rate now best represents the economics of our business activity in Venezuela. Going forward, this charge will reduce the U.S. dollar amount of local currency-denominated revenues and expenses. Had we applied this exchange rate throughout all of 2014, we would have reduced our full year EPS by approximately $0.08. The last item relates to a $199 million write-down of an unconventional integrated project in the Eagle Ford as the result of the decline in oil prices. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $12.6 billion was flat sequentially. This reflected approximately $260 million of year-end software, product and multiclient sales, which were weaker than what we typically experience in the fourth quarter. Pretax operating income of $2.8 billion decreased 1% sequentially while the pretax operating margins decreased by just 19 basis points to 22%. This level of margin is consistent with the same period last year. 
Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 3% sequentially while the margins increased by 95 basis points to 30.9%. The revenue decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal drop in marine seismic activity while Wireline experienced declines in Russia due to the seasonality and the weakening of the ruble. These decreases were partially offset by year-end multiclient and software sales. The margin increase reflected a more favorable revenue mix as a result of the year-end sales. 
Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.7 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined by 94 basis points to 20.7%. These decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable currency effects and activities declines in Russia that impacted the Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO as well as lower IPM activity in Mexico. 
Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of just under $5 billion increased 5% sequentially on higher Well Services activity in both Western Canada and U.S. land. Year-end sales of Completions and Artificial Lift products also contributed to the increase. Pretax margins were essentially flat at 18.3%.  
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.1% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion, representing an improvement of $458 million as compared to the end of Q3. We spent $1.1 billion on our stock buyback program during Q4. This represented 12.1 million shares at an average price of $90.22.  
Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of almost $1 billion. From a cash flow perspective, we generated $11.2 billion of cash flow from operations during all of 2014. During the same period, we generated a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. This represents $700 million increase over 2013 and means that we converted 84% of our 2014 earnings, excluding charges and credits into free cash flow. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities, which we did by completing various acquisitions and investing $4 billion in CapEx, $1.1 billion in multiclient and SPM projects while at the same time returning $6.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.  
During the full year 2014, we repurchased 47.5 million shares at an average price of $98.38 for a total of $4.7 billion while paying out almost $2 billion in dividends. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase on our annual dividend to $2 per share. This is now the fifth consecutive year that we have increased our dividend. And it results in doubling over the 5-year period. This new level of dividend reflects our confidence in our ability to continue to generate superior cash flows and return excess cash to our shareholders even in the face of market challenges.  
As it relates to 2015, our strong balance sheet will continue -- will also allow us to be opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of market conditions to make strategic acquisitions and investments. CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investment, is expected to be approximately $3 billion in 2015. We expect the ETR for the full year 2015 to be in the low to mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings. And now I turn the conference over to Paal."
301966,275102247,746759,"Schlumberger Limited, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2015",2015-01-16,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East & Asia.

In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East & Asia. In other International Area, Latin America revenues improved slightly on higher activity in Venezuela and Colombia while Europe/CIS/Africa fell as the ruble weakened and the seasonal declined activity started in Russia. Europe/CIS/Africa declined further from the downward trend in oil prices which curtailed customer activity and reduced rig count in the North Sea and parts of West Africa. 
Overall, fourth quarter revenue was flat with the previous quarter but grew 6% year-on-year. Pretax operating income decreased 1% sequentially and grew 7% year-on-year while pretax operating margins were essentially flat, slipping 19 basis points sequentially but rising 13 basis point year-on-year. This performance ended the year in which Schlumberger revenue climbed to a new high in spite the significant headwinds, including activity challenges in a number of GeoMarkets, geopolitical unrest in Libya and Iraq, international sanctions in Russia and reducing customer spend. Still our global footprint, broad business portfolio and strong execution capabilities provided the required resilience to outperform even in this environment.  
Looking at our corporate financial performance. We generated more than $2.4 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to more than $6.2 billion. This represents an increase of 13% over 2013 and a conversion of 84% of the full year's earnings into free cash flow. During the quarter, we continued our active stock buyback program, buying back $1.1 billion in stock to keep us on track to complete the $10 billion program within the stated 2.5-year period. As a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our continuing ability to generate free cash flow, the Board of Directors just approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend, which means that we have doubled our dividend payment over the past 5 years.  
By geography, our North American results set a new record for the area as revenue grew 2% sequentially. Land activity improved in spite of flat sequential rig count as new technology introductions and operational efficiencies drove performance. Also drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico returned to normal and grew by 12% sequentially, following the impact of loop currents in the third quarter while multiclient seismic sales also improved although ending up significantly down compared to the same quarter of last year. 
Sequential revenue gains were led by the Production Group on higher pressure pumping activity on land in both the U.S. and Canada and further supported by very strong uptake of the BroadBand family of stimulation technologies that are growing at 4x the rate of HiWAY at the same stage of its introduction. North America margins increased by a further 24 basis points in Q4 to reach 19.6%, driven by stronger activity and new technology update, solid execution and further supply chain cost improvements. Lower oil prices have already recreated pricing pressure on land for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services. And we are actively working with our customers in all basins to help lower their overall drilling and completion costs.  
In addition to general pricing discussions, our customer interactions are focused on how we can better work together and how we can create savings from new technologies and workflows as well as from improved operational planning and efficiency. Looking forward in North America, we see a relatively flat first quarter for offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico as well as solid activity in Canada. However, the dramatic fall in oil prices has already led to a reduction of around 400 rigs in U.S. land compared to the October peak. And we expect that the trend of activity reductions and pricing pressure to continue in the first quarter.  
In our international business, strength in the Middle East & Asia and solid performance in Latin America was offset by significant revenue reductions in Europe/CIS/Africa. As a result, revenues slipped 1% sequentially but improved 1% year-on-year while pretax operating income decreased 2% sequentially but grew 4% year-on-year. Full year performance in the international market was strong in spite of E&P capital expense remaining flat with 2013. Year-on-year, revenue grew by 4%, operating income by 12% with incremental margins of 69%. International margins, which ended the year at 24%, grew 168 basis points versus 2013, and we generated more than 70% of our global operating income in the international market in the past year. The significant drop in oil prices have put pressure on our customers to further reduce their cost per barrel, and we are actively engaged with most of them to find ways to generate the required cost savings while maintaining a very strong focus on the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide.  
Within the International Area, performance was led by the Middle East & Asia, where sequential revenue grew by 4% and pretax operating margins increased by 71 basis points to 28.3%, driven by activity growth in the Middle East while activity in Asia was largely unchanged. Year-on-year revenue increased 6% and margins grew by 213 basis points. In the Middle East region, activity reached a new record in Saudi Arabia, led by growth from a number of key projects, and we expect to see continued strong levels of both rig-related and rigless activity in the coming year. Kuwait was also strong on land seismic activity and year-end products and software sales while Oman continued to be driven by Wireline services and hydraulic fracturing work. Activity was again higher at the United Arab Emirates, particularly for well construction technologies, both offshore and on the island drilling project. In Iraq, activity was steady in the north as an improved security environment has allowed operations to slowly resume. However, the overall activity level still remains significantly below preconflict levels. In the south, we saw modest activity improvements, although new project startups continued to be delayed. 
Southeast Asia remained flat with the third quarter as strength in shale gas development on land in China offset modest activity declines in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. China was also boosted by increased product sales during the fourth quarter and strong offshore activity in Bohai Bay. In Malaysia, work has begun on a new well construction project on the Bokor field, where we have now been conducting integrated project and production management operations for more than 10 years. This is another example of the value that long-term relationships bring to integrated operations.  
In Latin America, revenue improved 1% sequentially while pretax operating margins fell 102 basis points to 20.9% as growth in Colombia and Venezuela was offset by weakness in Mexico and delays in Argentina and Brazil. Year-on-year revenue grew by 3% while pretax operating margin slipped by 31 basis points. In Venezuela, growth was driven by new technology and workflow deployments for PDVSA as well as increased activity in the Faja through a series of new project startups. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget constraints and seasonal weather effects impacting offshore activity. The lower customer spend mainly impacted land development activity, although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in the area, activity in Brazil was solid on land, but offshore work was lower as IOC projects were completed and drilling delays were experienced on existing projects. In Argentina, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, although activity for unconventional resources group and the HiWAY technology continuing to penetrate the market.  
In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue fell by 7% sequentially with margins declining by 112 basis points to 22.3%. Compared with the same quarter last year, Europe/CIS/Africa revenue fell by 5% while margin slipped by 21 basis points. In Russia, weakness in the ruble and the onset of winter weather led to the lower result. The North Sea activity also declined on lower rig count in both Norway and the U.K. as customers reduced activity in response to lower oil prices. In other parts of the Europe/Africa/CIS Area, activity was stronger in North Africa with increasing activity for unconventional resources in Algeria and Tunisia. This was partly offset by very weak activity in Libya, where we now have successfully restructured our operations in line with the lower activity. In Angola, activity decreased following the peak in exploration seen in the third quarter while elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, activity was strong in Congo and we also secured additional work in Chad and Gabon.  
Before leaving the Europe/CIS/Africa Area, I would also like to mention that we were awarded a 4-year contract for drilling and well services by Statoil for the U.K. Mariner development east of Shetland. Mariner is one of the largest project developments on the U.K. Continental Shelf in the last 10 years. And the 22 distinct services that Schlumberger will provide offer considerable opportunities for integration in this unique project.  
In terms of the outlook for the international market, outside of the Middle East and parts of Latin America, we do expect a reduction in spend levels for all customer groups in the coming year, although we believe that the activity and pricing impact will be less than what is projected in North America land. It is also worthwhile to keep in mind that E&P spending in the international market was already flat in 2014 with a corresponding drop in discovered reserves and in oil production capacity. So a further reduction in spend levels in 2015 will likely accelerate these trends.  
Turning to the overall macro outlook for 2015. GDP growth rates softened somewhat in the fourth quarter. But at 3%, growth is still projected to be higher than 2014, confirming that the global recovery remains intact. And as a result, the amount for oil is again expected to increase by around 1 million barrels per day in 2015. Looking at the supply side, the growth in global oil production capacity of around 1 million barrels per day over the past year matches the growth in demand. So the overall oil market is actually still relatively well-balanced from a capacity standpoint. The dramatic fall in oil prices is instead a result of higher marketed supply in the second half of 2014 from North America and also from OPEC, who have shifted focus from protecting oil prices to protecting market share. In response to the fall in oil prices, the industry is currently in the process of significantly reducing E&P investments, which will lead to a reduction in supply as decline rates impact current production capacity and lower exploration and development activity delay supply additions.  
In a scenario of continuing economic growth and increasing demand for oil, the lower E&P investment levels will lead to a tightening of the oil market with the first indication being the reduced production capacity in the international markets in 2014 following a year of flat E&P investment. In this uncertain environment, we continue to focus on what we can control. And we have already taken significant steps to restructure and rightsize our business to match the reduced E&P investment levels. We are further convinced that performance must now be driven by an accelerated change in the way we work through our transformation program. The delivery of new technology that improves the performance of our customers' reservoirs, the increases in efficiency and reliability that reduce overall finding, development and production costs and the opportunities for growth that greater integration bring are all significant drivers of our own and our customers' performance. The technical performance targets of our transformation program is independent of the macro environment. And we are, in 2015, actually looking to further accelerate the implementation of the program.  
In terms of technology, we still expect new technology sales at premium pricing to contribute more than 25% of our revenue while we also target integration-related activity, where we have unique capabilities to exceed 30% of our total activity. In terms of reliability and efficiency, we are, in 2015, aiming to make further progress towards our target of a tenfold reduction in unproductive time, a doubling in asset utilization, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of support costs, which will all help to significantly lower our operating costs.  
Part of our transformation program requires us to work differently with our customers in order to fully realize the value for both them and for us. Given the current business environment, we have engaged with many of them in recent months to drive forward these changes with very positive response. Still given the level of the oil price and the industry-wide focus on reducing E&P investments, we clearly have a challenging year in front of us. In this environment, we have our entire organization fully focused on continuously engaging our customers to understand any changes to their plans, to tailor resources to activity in line with targets and playbooks we have established and to manage commercial discussions according to the priorities we have put in place for each of the over 80 countries where we operate. 
Beyond our strong execution focus, we also see the coming year as flushed with opportunity for us, which we intend to fully capitalize on as we look to further strengthen the company going forward. With our wide geographical footprint, extensive business portfolio and clear financial strength, we remain confident in our ability to outperform in any part of the cycle, including the current market condition. Thank you. We will now open up for questions."

So if you look at the high-level macro view that we have, nothing has really changed from what we said in the Q3 call. So looking at GDP at 3%, we're still looking at solid growth overall in 2015.

So looking at GDP at 3%, we're still looking at solid growth overall in 2015. And oil demand is also going to be up. So as we said in Q3, the issue is really on the supply side, where I think it's very important that we separate between global production capacity and marketed supply. So if you look at the global production capacity in 2014, it grew by about 1 million barrels a day, which is equal to the growth in demand. So the significant drop in oil prices is not driven by this overcapacity but rather by the higher marketed supply, which is coming from North America and from OPEC. So we believe that the supply side is currently going through a significant change, where the key low-cost producers have shifted focus from protecting price to now protect market share. And the consequence of this is that, at least for a period of time, this is going to make the high-cost producers become the new swing producers, where their activity is going to be even more driven by the variations in oil price and the economics of their project. And the tool used to drive this change to the supply side is the lower oil price, which is what we're seeing now. So the main new element from the Q3 call is that OPEC decided not to cut production. So the reduction in the marketed supply will have to come from lower E&P investments. And that's really the only offtake to our macro view."

And the weakening supply will either first come from North America or from international. I think the signs we need to look at are different from the 2 regions.

So here, I think we are looking for further reduction in absolute supply. So I think these are the 2 main signals to look for."

Now from our experience, making a large transaction to build and leverage scale, it has a series of challenge. And in general, everything takes much longer than you initially think. And in addition to this, all the extra work that is involved with making a sort of transaction easily distracts you from running the base business. So as I've been saying, we look at this transaction as an opportunity with a capital O for us. And we do intend to capitalize on it, and this is again linked to the gaining of market share. In the international market, I would say, in many countries, our market share has been limited by a glass ceiling. And this glass ceiling has been put in place by customers to make sure that there is enough work to make a third player viable. Now if the other 2 key players were to combine into 1, then I think this glass ceiling can easily be broken, and that's why we are -- we're basically going through pretty much all our contracts in all the international countries we operate in to make sure we have targeted plans for how we would look to capitalize on this market share opportunity if and when the transaction closes."

Well, if you look at in the first quarter, even for the first quarter, there is still significant visibility challenges.

And the last part, which is kind of new this year, is further activity and pricing impact from the reduced E&P CapEx spend. So what is done is we have tailored our cost base for revenues to be around the levels for the first quarter of last year. So this involves a range of cost measures taken in Q4, including the release of the 9,000 people that we quoted.

301966,275102247,746822,"Schlumberger Limited, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2015",2015-01-16,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.50. This represents an increase of $0.01 sequentially and is $",912,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.50. This represents an increase of $0.01 sequentially and is $0.15 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $1.8 billion of pretax charges. These charges are primarily related to actions we have taken to meet the challenges of the current market conditions. The $806 million of charges relating to the restructuring of the WesternGeco seismically are as we announced last month. We have recorded $296 million of severance cost associated with the headcount reduction of approximately 9,000. This reduction, which will largely be completed by the end of the first quarter, will bring our headcount more in line with the currently anticipated activity levels. 
In Venezuela, effective December 31, 2014, we changed the exchange rate we apply to our bolivar-denominated transactions from VEB 6.30 to VEB 50 per dollar, which is in line with the SICAD II exchange rate, resulting in a $472 million charge. We believe that this rate now best represents the economics of our business activity in Venezuela. Going forward, this charge will reduce the U.S. dollar amount of local currency-denominated revenues and expenses. Had we applied this exchange rate throughout all of 2014, it would have reduced our full year EPS by approximately $0.08. The last item relates to a $199 million write-down of an unconventional integrated project in the Eagle Ford as the result of the decline in oil prices. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $12.6 billion was flat sequentially. This reflected approximately $260 million of year-end software, product and multiclient sales, which were weaker than what we typically experience in the fourth quarter. Pretax operating income of $2.8 billion decreased 1% sequentially while pretax operating margins decreased by just 19 basis points to 22%. This level of margin is consistent with the same period last year. 
Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins increased by 95 basis points to 30.9%. The revenue decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal drop in marine seismic activity while Wireline experienced declines in Russia due to the seasonality and the weakening of the ruble. These decreases were partially offset by year-end multiclient and software sales. The margin increase reflected a more favorable revenue mix as a result of the year-end sales. 
Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.7 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined by 94 basis points to 20.7%. These decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable currency effects and activities declines in Russia that impacted the Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO as well as lower IPM activity in Mexico. Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of just under $5 billion increased 5% sequentially on higher Well Services activity in both Western Canada and U.S. land. Year-end sales of Completions and Artificial Lift products also contributed to the increase. Pretax margins were essentially flat at 18.3%.  
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.1% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion, representing an improvement of $458 million as compared to the end of Q3. We spent $1.1 billion on our stock buyback program during Q4. This represented 12.1 million shares at an average price of $90.22.  
Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of almost $1 billion. From a cash flow perspective, we generated $11.2 billion of cash flow from operations during all of 2014. During the same period, we generated a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. This represents a $700 million increase over 2013 and means that we converted 84% of our 2014 earnings, excluding charges and credits into free cash flow. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities, which we did by completing various acquisitions and investing $4 billion in CapEx, $1.1 billion in multiclient and SPM projects, while at the same time returning $6.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.  
During the full year 2014, we repurchased 47.5 million shares at an average price of $98.38 for a total of $4.7 billion while paying out almost $2 billion in dividends. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase on our annual dividend to $2 per share. This is now the fifth consecutive year that we have increased our dividend. And it results in doubling the 5 -- over the 5-year period. This new level of dividend reflects our confidence in our ability to continue to generate superior cash flows and return excess cash to our shareholders even in the face of market challenges.  
As it relates to 2015, our strong balance sheet will continue -- will also allow us to be opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of market conditions to make strategic acquisitions and investments. CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investment, is expected to be approximately $3 billion in 2015. We expect the ETR for the full year 2015 to be in the low to mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings. 
And now I turn the conference over to Paal."

In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East and Asia.

In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East and Asia. In other International Area, Latin America revenues improved slightly on higher activity in Venezuela and Colombia while Europe/CIS/Africa fell as the ruble weakened and the seasonal decline in activity started in Russia. Europe/CIS/Africa declined further from the downward trend in oil prices which curtailed customer activity and reduced rig count in the North Sea and parts of West Africa. 
Overall, fourth quarter revenue was flat with the previous quarter but grew 6% year-on-year. Pretax operating income decreased 1% sequentially and grew 7% year-on-year while pretax operating margins were essentially flat, slipping 19 basis points sequentially but rising 13 basis points year-on-year. This performance ended the year in which Schlumberger revenue climbed to a new high in spite the significant headwinds, including activity challenges in a number of GeoMarkets, geopolitical unrest in Libya and Iraq, international sanctions in Russia and reducing customer spend. Still our global footprint, broad business portfolio and strong execution capabilities provided the required resilience to outperform even in this environment.  
Looking at our corporate financial performance. We generated more than $2.4 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to more than $6.2 billion. This represents an increase of 13% over 2013 and a conversion of 84% of the full year's earnings into free cash flow. During the quarter, we continued our active stock buyback program, buying back $1.1 billion in stock to keep us on track to complete the $10 billion program within the stated 2.5-year period. As a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our continuing ability to generate free cash flow, the Board of Directors just approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend, which means that we have doubled our dividend payment over the past 5 years.  
By geography, our North American results set a new record for the area as revenue grew 2% sequentially. Land activity improved in spite of flat sequential rig count as new technology introductions and operational efficiencies drove performance. Offshore drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico returned to normal and grew by 12% sequentially, following the impact of loop currents in the third quarter while multiclient seismic sales also improved although ending up significantly down compared to the same quarter of last year. 
Sequential revenue gains were led by the Production Group on higher pressure pumping activity on land in both the U.S. and Canada and further supported by very strong uptake of the BroadBand family of stimulation technologies that are growing at 4x the rate of HiWAY at the same stage of its introduction. North America margins increased by a further 24 basis points in Q4 to reach 19.6%, driven by stronger activity and new technology update, solid execution and further supply chain cost improvements. Lower oil prices have already created pricing pressure on land for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services. And we are actively working with our customers in all basins to help lower their overall drilling and completion costs.  
In addition to general pricing discussions, our customer interactions are focused on how we can better work together and how we can create savings from new technologies and workflows as well as from improved operational planning and efficiency. Looking forward in North America, we see a relatively flat first quarter for offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico as well as solid activity in Canada. However, the dramatic fall in oil prices has already led to a reduction of around 400 rigs in U.S. land compared to the October peak. And we expect the trend of activity reductions and pricing pressure to continue in the first quarter.  
In our international business, strength in the Middle East & Asia and solid performance in Latin America was offset by significant revenue reductions in Europe/CIS/Africa. As a result, revenues slipped 1% sequentially but improved 1% year-on-year while pretax operating income decreased 2% sequentially but grew 4% year-on-year. Full year performance in the international market was strong in spite of E&P CapEx spend remaining flat with 2013. Year-on-year, revenue grew by 4%, operating income by 12% with incremental margins of 69%. International margins, which ended the year at 24%, grew 168 basis points versus 2013, and we generated more than 70% of our global operating income in the international market in the past year. The significant drop in oil prices has put pressure on our customers to further reduce their cost per barrel, and we are actively engaged with most of them to find ways to generate the required cost savings while maintaining a very strong focus on the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide.  
Within the International Area, performance was led by the Middle East & Asia, where sequential revenue grew by 4% and pretax operating margins increased by 71 basis points to 28.3%, driven by activity growth in the Middle East while activity in Asia was largely unchanged. Year-on-year revenue increased 6% and margins grew by 213 basis points. In the Middle East region, activity reached a new record in Saudi Arabia, led by growth from a number of key projects, and we expect to see continued strong levels of both rig-related and rigless activity in the coming year. Kuwait was also strong on land seismic activity and year-end products and software sales while Oman continued to be driven by Wireline services and hydraulic fracturing work. Activity was again higher at the United Arab Emirates, particularly for well construction technologies, both offshore and on the island drilling project. In Iraq, activity was steady in the north as an improved security environment has allowed operations to slowly resume. However, the overall activity level still remains significantly below pre-conflict levels. In the south, we saw modest activity improvements, although new project startups continued to be delayed. 
Southeast Asia remained flat with the third quarter as strength in shale gas development on land in China offset modest activity declines in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. China was also boosted by increased product sales during the fourth quarter and strong offshore activity in Bohai Bay. In Malaysia, work has begun on a new well construction project on the Bokor field, where we have now been conducting integrated project and production management operations for more than 10 years. This is another example of the value that long-term relationships bring to integrated operations.  
In Latin America, revenue improved 1% sequentially while pretax operating margins fell 102 basis points to 20.9% as growth in Colombia and Venezuela was offset by weakness in Mexico and delays in Argentina and Brazil. Year-on-year revenue grew by 3% while pretax operating margin slipped by 31 basis points. In Venezuela, growth was driven by new technology and workflow deployments for PDVSA as well as increased activity in the Faja through a series of new project startups. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget constraints and seasonal weather effects impacting offshore activity. The lower customer spend mainly impacted land development activity, although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in the area, activity in Brazil was solid on land, but offshore work was lower as IOC projects were completed and drilling delays were experienced on existing projects. In Argentina, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, although activity for unconventional resources group and the HiWAY technology continuing to penetrate the market.  
In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue fell by 7% sequentially with margins declining by 112 basis points to 22.3%. Compared with the same quarter last year, Europe/CIS/Africa revenue fell by 5% while margin slipped by 21 basis points. In Russia, weakness in the ruble and the onset of winter weather led to the lower result. The North Sea activity also declined on lower rig count in both Norway and the U.K. as customers reduced activity in response to lower oil prices. In other parts of the Europe/Africa/CIS Area, activity was stronger in North Africa with increasing activity for unconventional resources in Algeria and Tunisia. This was partly offset by very weak activity in Libya, where we now have successfully restructured our operations in line with the lower activity. In Angola, activity decreased following the peak in exploration seen in the third quarter while elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, activity was strong in Congo and we also secured additional work in Chad and Gabon.  
Before leaving the Europe/CIS/Africa Area, I would also like to mention that we were awarded a 4-year contract for drilling and well services by Statoil for the U.K. Mariner development east of Shetland. Mariner is one of the largest project developments on the U.K. Continental Shelf in the last 10 years. And the 22 distinct services that Schlumberger will provide offer considerable opportunities for integration in this unique project.  
In terms of the outlook for the international market, outside of the Middle East and parts of Latin America, we do expect a reduction in spend levels for all customer groups in the coming year, although we believe that the activity and pricing impact will be less than what is projected in North America land. It is also worthwhile to keep in mind that E&P spending in the international market was already flat in 2014 with a corresponding drop in discovered reserves and in oil production capacity. So a further reduction in spend levels in 2015 will likely accelerate these trends.  
Turning to the overall macro outlook for 2015. GDP growth rates softened somewhat in the fourth quarter. But at 3%, growth is still projected to be higher than 2014, confirming that the global recovery remains intact. And as a result, demand for oil is again expected to increase by around 1 million barrels per day in 2015. Looking at the supply side, the growth in global oil production capacity of around 1 million barrels per day over the past year matches the growth in demand. So the overall oil market is actually still relatively well-balanced from a capacity standpoint. The dramatic fall in oil prices is instead a result of higher marketed supply in the second half of 2014 from North America and also from OPEC, who have shifted focus from protecting oil prices to protecting market share. In response to the fall in oil prices, the industry is currently in the process of significantly reducing E&P investments, which will lead to a reduction in supply as decline rates impact current production capacity and lower exploration and development activity delay supply additions.  
In a scenario of continuing economic growth and increasing demand for oil, the lower E&P investment levels will lead to a tightening of the oil market with the first indication being the reduced production capacity in the international markets in 2014 following a year of flat E&P investment. In this uncertain environment, we continue to focus on what we can control. And we have already taken significant steps to restructure and rightsize our business to match the reduced E&P investment levels. We are further convinced that performance must now be driven by an accelerated change in the way we work through our transformation program. The delivery of new technology that improves the performance of our customers' reservoirs, the increases in efficiency and reliability that reduce overall finding, development and production costs and the opportunities for growth that greater integration bring are all significant drivers of our own and our customers' performance. The technical performance targets of our transformation program is independent of the macro environment. And we are, in 2015, actually looking to further accelerate the implementation of the program.  
In terms of technology, we still expect new technology sales at premium pricing to contribute more than 25% of our revenue while we also target integration-related activity, where we have unique capabilities to exceed 30% of our total activity. In terms of reliability and efficiency, we are, in 2015, aiming to make further progress towards our targets of a tenfold reduction in unproductive time, a doubling in asset utilization, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of support costs, which will all help to significantly lower our operating costs.  
Part of our transformation program requires us to work differently with our customers in order to fully realize the value for both them and for us. Given the current business environment, we have engaged with many of them in recent months to drive forward these changes with very positive response. Still given the level of the oil price and the industry-wide focus on reducing E&P investments, we clearly have a challenging year in front of us. In this environment, we have our entire organization fully focused on continuously engaging our customers to understand any changes to their plans, to tailor resources to activity in line with the targets and playbooks we have established and to manage commercial discussions according to the priorities we have put in place for each of the over 80 countries where we operate. 
Beyond our strong execution focus, we also see the coming year as flushed with opportunity for us, which we intend to fully capitalize on as we look to further strengthen the company going forward. With our wide geographical footprint, extensive business portfolio and clear financial strength, we remain confident in our ability to outperform in any part of the cycle, including the current market condition. Thank you. We will now open up for questions."

So if you look at the high-level macro view that we have, nothing has really changed from what we said in the Q3 call. So looking at GDP at 3%, we're still looking at solid growth overall in 2015. And oil demand is also going to be up. So as we said",280,"Okay. So if you look at the high-level macro view that we have, nothing has really changed from what we said in the Q3 call. So looking at GDP at 3%, we're still looking at solid growth overall in 2015. And oil demand is also going to be up. So as we said in Q3, the issue is really on the supply side, where I think it's very important that we separate between global production capacity and marketed supply. So if you look at the global production capacity in 2014, it grew by about 1 million barrels a day, which is equal to the growth in demand. So the significant drop in oil prices is not driven by this overcapacity but rather by the higher marketed supply, which is coming from North America and from OPEC. So we believe that the supply side is currently going through a significant change, where the key low-cost producers have shifted focus from protecting price to now protect market share. And the consequence of this is that, at least for a period of time, this is going to make the high-cost producers become the new swing producers, where their activity is going to be even more driven by the variations in oil price and the economics of their project. And the tool used to drive this change to the supply side is the lower oil price, which is what we're seeing now. So the main new element from the Q3 call is that OPEC decided not to cut production. So the reduction in the marketed supply will have to come from lower E&P investments. And that's really the only offtake to our macro view."

And the weakening supply will either first come from North America or from international. I think the signs we need to look at are different from the 2 regions. Given the strong growth momentum in North America, I think what the market will be looking for here is a slowing year-over-year growth while given the flat investment levels in international market in 2014, capacity already reduced in 2014. So here, I think we are looking for further reduction in absolute supply. So I think these are the 2 main signals to look for."

Firstly, the increased importance of staying very, very close to our customers, firstly, to actively support their efforts to reduce their cost levels but also to make sure that we very clearly understand their plans and changes to their plans. That's the first one. The second one is what you alluded to that we stay focused on what we control, and that is to proactively adjust costs to activity levels and factoring in the benefits from the transformation and also having a clear plan on how we're going to navigate the commercial landscape in terms of activity and pricing discussions with our customers but also very importantly, to continue to focus on deliver safe and high-quality operations, which is essential to our performance but also to our customers' performance. And the third one, which we are also balancing into the total picture, is to capture the opportunities that we see in the current environment. And we see the current environment as being flush with opportunity for us. Firstly, to gain market share in light of our 2 main competitors looking to combine. Secondly, to accelerate the transformation. Our organization is now pulling very hard on it, and we also see our customers being very open to adjust how we work with them and how we interact with them to gain some of the benefits. And then the third one is inorganic growth. We see lots of opportunities for this based on our strong cash flow and also by our very solid balance sheet.

So as I've been saying, we look at this transaction as an opportunity with a capital O for us. And we do intend to capitalize on it, and this is again linked to the gaining of market share. In the international market, I would say, in many countries, our market share has been limited by a glass ceiling. And this glass ceiling has been put in place by our customers to make sure that there is enough work to make a third player viable. Now if the other 2 players were to combine into 1, then I think this glass ceiling can easily be broken, and that's why we're basically going through pretty much all our contracts in all the international countries we operate in to make sure we have targeted plans for how we would look to capitalize on this market share opportunity if and when the transaction closes."

And the last part, which is kind of new this year, is further activity and pricing impact from the reduced E&P CapEx spend. So what we've done is we have tailored our cost base for revenues to be around the levels for the first quarter of last year. So this involves a range of cost measures taken in Q4, including the release of the 9,000 people that we quoted. So I would say I'm comfortable with our cost structure with respect to this base case of Q1 activity around revenue levels of Q1 of last year. Now if activity is stronger, we have means to cover it. And if it is lower, we have the ability to quickly cut more."

HiWAY was one of the first kind of major technology innovations on the frac side in terms of fluids for quite a while. As we introduced it in 2011, it grew very fast. But with the BroadBand family, which was introduced in the earlier part of 2014, this is currently growing at 4x the pace. So part of it is that we have engaged our customers in a slightly different way this time around for BroadBand. And we have met, myself and my team included, with a range of our customers at the CEO, COO level to lay out, firstly, what the technology does but also to give them introductory offers to basically demonstrate what these technologies can do.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $1.06.

First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $1.06. This represents decreases of $0.44 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $439 million of pretax charges. This includes $390 million of charges associated with the headcount reduction of 11,000 as well as an incentivized leave of absence program. This program provides us with some flexibility as we manage the uncertainties of the current environment. 
In Venezuela, during the first quarter, the SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 50 to the U.S. dollar was eliminated and replaced with a new system known as SIMADI. The SIMADI rate was approximately VEF 192 as of the end of the quarter. As a result, we recorded $49 million of devaluation charge during the first quarter. 
After this charge, the U.S. dollar value of our bolivar-denominated net assets is not material. Therefore, any further devaluations of the bolivar will not have a significant impact on our results. 
Our first quarter revenue of $10.2 billion decreased 19% sequentially while pretax operating margin decreased 255 basis points. Approximately 25% of the sequential revenue decline was attributable to the currency effect and the absence of the year-end increase in product, software and multiclient sales that we experienced last quarter. The remaining decrease was driven by activity and price declines. 
Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margin declined 255 basis points sequentially, which resulted in decremental margins of only 33%. This is a result of calm and proactive cost management across the organization. 
It's worth noting that although our revenue was significantly impacted by the fall in value of many currencies, this phenomenon does not have a significant impact on our pretax operating income. This reflects the benefit of our local cost structure, which largely serves as a natural hedge against currency movements on our bottom line. 
Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion decreased 21% sequentially while margins decreased 447 basis points to 25.7%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower multiclient and software sales and the fall in higher-margin exploration activity. 
Drilling Group revenue of $4 billion decreased 15% sequentially while margin only declined 80 basis points. These declines were primarily driven by the severe rig count drop in North America. 
Production Group revenue of $3.8 billion decreased 22% sequentially, and margins fell by 389 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and pricing pressure in North America land. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 20.9% in the first quarter compared to 21.4% in the previous quarter. This decrease reflects the fact that we generated a smaller portion of our pretax income in North America during Q1. 
As we progress throughout the year, the ETR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. We generated almost $1.8 billion of tax flow from operations, and net debt increased $100 million during the quarter to $5.5 billion. This is all despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual associated employee compensation as well as the payment of $245 million in severance during the quarter. 
Even with the challenges of the current market, we still anticipate generating very strong free cash flow. This is because during the downturn, we continued to reduce our investments in CapEx, and working capital requirements will also come down. This combination should more than offset the decrease in earnings. 
During the quarter, we spent $719 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares at an average price of $82.98. We spent $606 million on CapEx. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SBM investments, is now expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal."
301966,288829425,790102,"Schlumberger Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure.

Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure. International activity was lower as customers cut budgets in response to lower commodity prices and was also impacted by the normal seasonal effects in the northern hemisphere and the fall of certain local currencies against the U.S. dollar. 
In spite of these top line headwinds, we have been able to minimize the impact in our pretax operating margins through calm and proactive cost management and by further accelerating our transformation program. This is reflected in our first quarter international margins, which are essentially flat sequentially and are up year-over-year. 
We have also delivered better decrementals than any previous downturn with sequential decremental margins as low as 33% with North America and the international areas achieving 39% and 25%, respectively. The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly North America, has been almost unprecedented, and we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar. 
And while we thought we had adequate plans in place going into the quarter, activities declined even faster than expected, which required us to revise our plans accordingly. This made managing the quarter challenging, including the decision to further reduce our workforce by 11,000 employees, bringing the total personnel reduction to 20,000 or around 15% compared to the peak of the third quarter of 2014. 
Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow before restructuring payments during the first quarter. And we remain confident in our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions, and we expect to maintain the cash quality of our earnings by continuing to convert 75% or more of our net income into free cash flow. 
By geography, our North American revenues decreased 25% sequentially, which was significantly lower than the 32% drop in land rig count. Operating margins in North America decreased 670 basis points sequentially to 12.9%. In spite of the severe activity and pricing declines, sequential decrementals were limited to 39% as we maintained -- as we remain focused on flawless execution and proactive cost management. 
In U.S. land, drilling and stimulation activity was down in all basins while activity also dropped significantly in Canada when the reduction in rig count was further impacted by the early spring break up. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter although we are seeing a steady change in service mix from exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts from most of our customers. 
On land in North America, pricing pressure was greatest for hydraulic fracturing services although some of this impact was mitigated to increase new technology offtake, particularly for our BroadBand stimulation services and infinity completions products. 
In spite of this, market pricing for certain products and services has already reached unsustainable levels. However, we are being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss-making contract. 
We continue to work with our customers to have lower drilling and completion cost while focusing on the savings that new workflows and technologies can bring. We are doing this through our technology integration groups that have the full range of shale expertise spanning formation valuation, drilling stimulus and completions. The experts of these integration groups are located in the shale basins in North America land and have both the scientific understanding of how to optimize shale developments and also an in-depth knowledge of our complete technology offering, which they combined to design the best solution for each reservoir and each well. 
The track record we have established over the past 5 years has now given us the confidence to propose a range of new business models to our customers, where we initially have solved the incremental costs linked to our workflows and technologies in return for an upside based on the actual production results. 
One example of that our unique sales technology is HiWAY, which helps customers increase production and ultimate recovery while using less water and proppant. In the period between 2012 and 2014, wells completed with HiWAY technology in the Eagle Ford showed a 26% increase in the first 3 months of production compared to well stimulated with conventional treatment. 
HiWAY technology also helps save around 1.4 billion gallons of fracturing fluid and about 2.8 billion pounds of proppant in more than 1,000 wells. The success of the HiWAY technology is now being complemented and extended by the rapid uptake of BroadBand Sequence, which has already shown remarkable performance for a range of customers in both new well completions and in re-fracturing of old wells. 
In the international markets, revenue declined 16% sequentially, driven by seasonal weather impact, currency effect and customer spending cuts. But despite the severity of the sequential revenue decline and the unfavorable shift in revenue mix, we managed to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins, which was essentially flat with the previous quarter at 24.1%. 
This performance was achieved by strong execution, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program, which together are able to offset the margin impact from both reduced activity and the pricing pressure we're receiving from all customer groups. 
In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margin and by always aiming to trade any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms. 
Within the international areas, Middle East & Asia revenue declined by 13% sequentially while pretax operating margin improved by 30 basis points to 28.6%. Performance was impacted by a double-digit sequential drop in revenue in the Asia Pacific region and by lower product and software sales but was partially offset by robust activity in the ETC region. 
Year-on-year revenue decreased 5%, and margins grew by 230 basis points. 
In the Middle East region, our lonesome turnkey project in Saudi Arabia gained momentum during the first quarter, and we expect solid drilling activity going forward, together with more fracturing and rigless work. In the United Arab Emirates, the relevant activity on the north island of the project has now started with more regulations planned over the next few quarters. On this project, Schlumberger has been awarded a 5-year contract for the supply of integrated well construction services with further details provided in our earnings press release. 
Activity in the rest of the DTC countries was also strong in the first quarter while in Iraq, revenues in the north remain muted at around half of the peak levels seen in 2014, and activity in the South of the country was steady around the level seen in the fourth quarter. 
In Southeast Asia, activity in China was seasonally lower in the first quarter, but activity also declined in the rest of the region as customer budget cuts continued to be implemented. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 20% sequentially while pretax operating margin improved 59 basis points to 21.5%. Revenue was impacted by decreased activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia as customer budgets were cut and also by the fall in the value of the Venezuelan bolivar. Still, these effects were partially offset by slight activity increases in Venezuela, Argentina and Ecuador. Year-on-year revenue decreased 6%, and margins grew by 39 basis points. 
In Venezuela, activity continued to improve with and with the several of the joint ventures in the Faja while activity is also ramping up in Trinidad. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on the combination of customer budget cuts as well as seasonal weather effects that mainly impacted offshore activity. The reduced spend mainly affected land development activity although some exploration work was also delayed. 
Elsewhere in Latin America, offshore activity in Brazil remains weak with the deepwater slowdown continuing as pressure of announced budget cuts early in the quarter. In Argentina, activity remains resilient in the first quarter, driven by stimulation work and continued new technology offtake in the and with new project start-ups offsetting the completion of others. 
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 17% sequentially with margins declining by 133 basis points to 21%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 12%, and margins grew by 66 basis points. The revenue decline was mainly due to continued weakness in the ruble and lower seasonal activity in Russia. 
In the U.K. North Sea, exploration activity fell to its lowest level in recent history as customer spending decelerated while rig counts in the Norwegian sector appears to have reached a bottom. In Sub-Saharan Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially across the region. In Algeria, activity was flat sequentially while work in Libya was limited to offshore locations with onshore operations largely shut down for the quarter. 
Looking at the industry as a whole. The current financial challenges will not disappear even if oil prices were to recover to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is, therefore, forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce cost and create more project value, and we see a much closer collaboration between operators and large service companies as a significant opportunity to create technical solutions that will achieve these objectives. 
At Schlumberger, we are ready to enter into these parts of collaboration, and based on our technical and financial strength, we are also prepared to promote more risk-based contract models where we are compensated based on the solutions we have designed as well as on the performance of our execution. And these contract structures are currently being tabled with a number of customers as part of the ongoing commercial discussions. 
Turning to the 2015 outlook. Visibility still remains limited. However, we expect the largest drop in E&P investments to occur in North America, where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30%. 
We further believe that a recovery in U.S. land drilling activity would be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells build and as the re-fracturing market expands. We also anticipate that our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels, hence, extending the period of weak pricing. 
In the international market, we expect 2015 E&P spend to fall around 15%, which will create challenges in terms of productivity and pricing levels but considerably less than the headwind seen in North America. The reduction in international spend will be seen primarily through lower activity levels but also with some pricing impact for basic technologies and with the continuation of the already observed shift from exploration-related services towards more development activity. 
In terms of geography, we expect the DTC space of the Middle East to increase investments in 2015 as the core part of OPEC prepares to reduce market share as the rest of the global supply base continues to weaken. 
Elsewhere, we expect to see a double-digit reduction in E&P investment levels in Latin America led by Mexico and Brazil, in Europe and Africa led by the North Sea and Sub-Sahara Africa and in Asia led by China, Malaysia and Australia. 
In Russia, conventional land activity in Western Siberia continues to be resilient, but the overall revenue contribution from Russia will remain subdued until there is a meaningful recovery in the ruble exchange rate. While the global foreign activity level is severe, we remain focused on things we can control, which are our customer resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide. 
We remain confident in our ability to weather the storm better than our surroundings based on our favorable international leverage, our fair technology leadership in North America shale and the acceleration of our transportation program. These elements will together create the platform that should allow us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers in the coming quarters and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity while delivering unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

While on the supply side, we continue to see the market share battle playing out globally. Now the key question as we discussed before is when and where the large cuts in E&P investment is going to show up in the supply numbers, and the latest production data for March is now showing the first signs of a pricing in supply, and we're basically looking at 3 main indicators. The first one is the new core OPEC spare capacity, which was down by 400,000 barrels in March to 2.5 million barrels. The other one is the one you alluded to, which is the non-NAM and OPEC production, which showed a slight weakening in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. And given the reduction in E&P spend internationally, we expect this weakening to continue throughout this year. And the third one, which everyone is looking at, is the U.S. monthly sequential production, which is now showing the first signs of flattening. So based on this as we said in January, we expect the global supply to continue to tighten in the second half of this year. So we make no change to our view on the macro."

So if you look at how we are driving business performance today, which a lot of the focus is around managing decrementals, there's really 3 key components that are part of driving this performance. First is the transformation of the mindset of our entire organization, where we have in the past couple of years taken teamwork and the tightness of the chain of command to a completely new levels. This allows us now to plan and execute and also to adjust with great pace and agility, and this is the process that has been going on for number of years, and I think it really demonstrated our capabilities coming from this transformation and in the first quarter. Now the second is just diligent focus on basic cost and resource management, and this includes both our internal cost structures as well as the third-party spend. And although we did well in the first quarter in this area as well, these efforts are going to continue into the second quarter. And then the third one is really the one that you're referring to, which is the structural transformation of how we run the entire company. And here, we said we would be in the sixth to seventh inning in 2017. I would say that today, we are totally in the third inning, if you want to stick to baseball terminology. It's a multiyear program.

You've also referenced it several times being prepared to move to more risk-based business models, and specifically, the significant opportunity associated with the refracking of older wells.

And then the other part is around how do you effectively do the re-fracturing while minimizing the costs. So we have through our engineered completion shale information valuation capabilities as well as BroadBand Sequence now established broad technology offering. So in terms of how many wells, I would say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for re-fracturing increases, and this is both shale liquids and shale gas. In terms of the market potential, I think you're talking billions in terms of revenue opportunities over an extended period of time, but this is quite a significant market opportunity. And I think the key here is that we are still confident in our ability to identify the right candidates and execute the re-fracturing work that we are prepared to take significant risks in terms of how we go about doing this work.

The drilling intensity is obviously generally far below what we are seeing today in North America land, but that basically because in many -- in most of the other basins, we are still working within the conventional resource base. And as you move from the conventional towards more unconventional, you will also generally see an increase in drilling intensity from that. I would say even in the conventional basins, there is a growing drilling intensity, which we are then looking to capitalize to the subsurface integration of the bottom of assembly as well as now going forward with our focusing on establishing our rig of the future."

Exploration is the first thing that can be cut, which is not going to have a short-term and immediate impact on production. Looking at the current levels of exploration spend today, it is clearly unsustainable. I don't think it's going to get fixed or improved anytime soon or at least not in 2015, but it is very clear that this level of exploration spend is not going to continue for many years."

So the over workflow starts with us basically getting the well and the well data from the operator. Our team of experts is then reviewing hundreds of candidates wells, and we are picking the ones that we believe has the highest potential for increasing production after refracking treatment. So they're looking at the completion. They're looking at whatever information of valuation data we have and coming up with a candidate selection. In terms of the actual physical work execution at the well site, the first thing we need to do is to pull the pump out of the well and then prepare the well. But beyond that, it's just hooking up the fracturing treatment, and we basically pump a normal fracturing job. But with the BroadBand Sequence space into the job generally then throwing off the existing proliferations that have already been fracked to be able to analyze the pressure in the well to fracturing the additional perforations that initially weren't fracked when the well was first completed. So the key enablers here are the ability of our subsurface experts to identify the right well candidate and in addition to that, the BroadBand Sequence the technology, where we can actually diverge fracturing fluid into the proliferations that have been properly been fractured in the first place."

Actually if you look at the performance going back to 2012, we posted 35% incremental to 2012, 42% in 2013 and 69% in 2014. So the fact that we have very good handle of drilling in the International business in and environment where we've been thinking really headwinds to throughout this period both an exploration in deepwater in seismic and also the significant IOC spend cuts even starting in 2014 I think these incrementals clearly show that the decrementals we are posting in Q1 is just the continuation a multiyear run of improving business performance."

Now in the context of refrack, and I'm just trying to connect the dots because if there's a significant amount of refrack that's going to happen, I would have personally thought that, that would lead to a more rapid capacity absorption period and potentially, a faster recovery period in terms of pricing because they're going to get all this backlog of refrack. So can you just -- I might be a little bit slow. Can you help me kind of connect the dots on how refracking won't lead to an acceleration of capacity absorption and get your thoughts on that would be great."

Firstly, help the customers identify the right candidate; and secondly, have technologies that make the cost base of the refracturing feasible and economical. And based on this work we've done in terms of identifying candidates, doing 5 refracs for a range of customers already, the economics based on the BroadBand Sequence technology is actually quite attractive in between refrack -- refracking an old well or drilling a new well. So I think it would be limited for the companies that have that capability. Now even if there were a range of companies that could do this, I still think that this market overall in terms of absorbing capacity isn't going to fix the problem. So if you look at the overall activity that we had last year, where we had about 2,000 rigs operating, we're down now below 1,000. If you take a pick anywhere in between the 2 numbers of where the recovery's going to come back, no matter what number you pick, I think it's very fair that's going to be significant overcapacity in the market, and that means that pricing that is now already at very low levels is not going to improve in that situation. So refracks is an opportunity for the companies that has the right technology to do it. I don't think it's going to have a big enough impact to fix the overall capacity issue in North America land, but it'll be I think a very good avenue of growth for the companies that can identify the right candidate and also have the technology to effectively refrack while keeping costs low enough to make it economical."

Obviously, with these significant spend reductions, that's always going to be there. I think the difference we are seeing at this stage is that based on these incrementals that I referenced just in the previous question, our ability to continuously drive performance to how we execute internationally and leveraging the scale we have of operations and also have a steady contribution from the transformation, that is what is allowing us to hold margins the way they are. We have significantly outperformed our competitors in margins over the previous 2, 3 years, and this has nothing to do with pricing. We win every bid on lowest price for basic technologies in any country around the world. The only thing that differentiates us from the competition is that we are able to translate this revenue into higher margins basically based on how we run the company. So we are always winning any bid on the lowest price, and we are always -- we have to be commercially competitive, but the key here is the internal of the company and how we run and execute. And I think that ability has improved significantly over the past 3, 4 years, and that's why we hope that we should be able to manage both decrementals and overall margins better this time around in the international market than what we've done in previous cycles."

So before we close, I would like to thank all of you for participating in today's call. As questions have indicated, the Oilfield Services market is quite challenging at the moment, and I think it's useful to summarize the 3 most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the past quarter has been challenging to manage, but by being able to quickly adjust plans and by continuing to focus on what we control, we have delivered significantly better decremental margins compared to previous cycles, and our international leverage and the acceleration of our transformation program are, together, creating a strong platform for our financial outperformance also going forward. Secondly, we believe that the industry needs to think differently in order to reduce project costs and increase project value, and we see closer collaboration between operators and the large service companies as a key element in achieving this goal, and this closer collaboration should also include more performance-based contracting models, which were fully prepared to enter into. And last, while we continue to actively manage cost and resources throughout this downturn by streamlining overall structures and reducing fleet capacity, we can quickly add back capacity when opportunities arise to take on more work through the efficiency gains created by our transformation program and through our unmatched recruiting and training machine, which is fully intact. That concludes the call for today. Thank you."

301966,288829425,790170,"Schlumberger Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $1.06.

First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $1.06. This represents decreases of $0.44 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded $439 million of pretax charges. This includes $390 million of charges associated with the headcount reduction of 11,000 as well as an incentivized leave of absence program. This program provides us with some flexibility as we manage the uncertainties of the current environment. 
In Venezuela, during the first quarter, the SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 50 to the U.S. dollar was eliminated and replaced with a new system known as SIMADI. The SIMADI rate was approximately VEF 192 as of the end of the quarter. As a result, we recorded $49 million of devaluation charge during the first quarter. After this charge, the U.S. dollar value of our bolivar-denominated net assets is not material. Therefore, any further devaluations of the bolivar will not have a significant impact on our results. 
Our first quarter revenue of $10.2 billion decreased 19% sequentially while pretax operating margin decreased 255 basis points. Approximately 25% of the sequential revenue decline was attributable to the currency effect and the absence of the year-end increase in product, software and multiclient sales that we experienced last quarter. The remaining decrease was driven by activity and price declines. Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margin declined 255 basis points sequentially, which resulted in decremental margins of only 33%. This is a result of prompt and proactive cost management across the organization. It's worth noting that although our revenue was significantly impacted by the fall in value of many currencies, this phenomenon does not have a significant impact on our pretax operating income. This reflects the benefit of our local cost structure, which largely serves as a natural hedge against currency movements on our bottom line. 
Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion decreased 21% sequentially while margins decreased 447 basis points to 25.7%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower multiclient and software sales and the fall in higher-margin exploration activity. The Drilling Group revenue of $4 billion decreased 15% sequentially while margins only declined 80 basis points. These declines were primarily driven by the severe rig count drop in North America. Production Group revenue of $3.8 billion decreased 22% sequentially and margins fell by 389 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and pricing pressure in North America land. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 20.9% in the first quarter compared to 21.4% in the previous quarter. This decrease reflects the fact that we generated a smaller portion of our pretax income in North America during Q1. As we progress throughout the year, the ETR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. We generated almost $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and net debt increased $100 million during the quarter to $5.5 billion. This is all despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual associated employee compensation as well as the payment of $245 million in severance during the quarter. 
Even with the challenges of the current market, we still anticipate generating very strong free cash flow. This is because during the downturn, we continued to reduce our investments in CapEx and working capital requirements will also come down. This combination should more than offset the decrease in earnings. During the quarter, we spent $719 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares at an average price of $82.98. We spent $606 million on CapEx. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is now expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal."
301966,288829425,790170,"Schlumberger Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure.

Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure. International activity was lower as customers cut budgets in response to lower commodity prices and was also impacted by the normal seasonal effects in the Northern Hemisphere and the fall of certain local currencies against the U.S. dollar. 
In spite of these top line headwinds, we have been able to minimize the impact in our pretax operating margins through prompt and proactive cost management and by further accelerating our transformation program. This is reflected in our first quarter international margins, which are essentially flat sequentially and are up year-over-year. We have also delivered better decrementals than in any previous downturn with sequential decremental margins as low as 33% with North America and the International Areas achieving 39% and 25%, respectively. 
The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly North America, has been almost unprecedented, and we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar. And while we thought we had adequate plans in place going into the quarter, activities declined even faster than expected, which required us to revise our plans accordingly. This made managing the quarter challenging, including the decision to further reduce our workforce by 11,000 employees, bringing the total personnel reduction to 20,000 or around 15% compared to the peak of the third quarter of 2014. 
Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow before restructuring payments during the first quarter. And we remain confident in our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions. And we expect to maintain the cash quality of our earnings by continuing to convert 75% or more of our net income into free cash flow. 
By geography, our North American revenue decreased 25% sequentially, which was significantly lower than the 32% drop in land rig count. Operating margins in North America decreased 670 basis points sequentially to 12.9%. In spite of the severe activity and pricing declines, sequential decrementals were limited to 39% as we maintained -- as we remained fully focused on flawless execution and proactive cost management. In U.S. land, drilling and stimulation activity was down in all basins while activity also dropped significantly in Canada, where the reduction in rig count was further impacted by the early spring breakup. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter, although we are seeing a steady change in service mix from exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts from most of our customers. 
On land in North America, pricing pressure was greatest for hydraulic fracturing services, although some of this impact was mitigated to increase new technology uptake, particularly for our BroadBand stimulation services and Infinity completions products. In spite of this, market pricing for certain products and services has already reached unsustainable levels. However, we are being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss-making contracts. 
We continue to work with our customers to have lower drilling and completion costs while focusing on the savings that new workflows and technologies can bring. We are doing this through our technology integration groups that have the full range of shale expertise spanning formation valuation, drilling stimulation and completions. The experts making up these integration groups are located in the various shale basins in North America land and have both the scientific understanding of how to optimize shale developments and also an in-depth knowledge of our complete technology offering, which they combine to design the best solution for each reservoir and each well. 
The track record we have established over the past 5 years has now given us the confidence to propose a range of new business models to our customers, where we initially have solved the incremental costs linked to our workflows and technologies in return for an upside based on the actual production results. One example of our unique sales technology is HiWAY, which helps customers increase production and ultimate recovery while using less water and proppants. In the period between 2012 and 2014, wells completed with HiWAY technology in the Eagle Ford showed a 26% increase in the best 3 months of production compared to wells stimulated with conventional treatments. HiWAY technology also helps save around 1.4 billion gallons of fracturing fluid and about 2.8 billion pounds of proppant in more than 1,000 wells. The success of the HiWAY technology is now being complemented and extended by the rapid uptake of BroadBand Sequence, which has already shown remarkable performance for a range of customers in both new well completions and in refracturing of old wells. 
In the international markets, revenue declined 16% sequentially, driven by seasonal weather impact, currency effects and customer spending cuts. But despite the severity of the sequential revenue decline and the unfavorable shift in revenue mix, we managed to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins, which was essentially flat with the previous quarter at 24.1%. This performance was achieved by strong execution, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program, which together were able to offset the margin impact from both reduced activities and the pricing pressure we were seeing from all customer groups. In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margins and by always aiming to trade any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms. 
Within the International Areas, Middle East & Asia revenue declined by 13% sequentially while pretax operating margin improved by 30 basis points to 28.6%. Performance was impacted by a double-digit sequential drop in revenue in the Asia Pacific region and by lower product and software sales but was partially offset by robust activity in the GCC region. Year-on-year revenue decreased 5% and margins grew by 230 basis points. 
In the Middle East region, our long-term turnkey project in Saudi Arabia gained momentum during the first quarter, and we expect solid drilling activity going forward, together with more fracturing and rigless work. In the United Arab Emirates, development activity on the North island of the SARB project has now started with more rig additions planned over the next few quarters. On this project, Schlumberger has been awarded a 5-year contract for the supply of integrated well construction services with further details provided in our earnings press release. 
Activity in the rest of the GCC countries was also strong in the first quarter while in Iraq, revenues in the north remained muted at around half of the peak levels seen in 2014 and activity in the south of the country was steady around the levels seen in the fourth quarter. In Southeast Asia, activity in China was seasonally lower in the first quarter. But activity also declined in the rest of the region as customer budget cuts continued to be implemented. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 20% sequentially while pretax operating margin improved 59 basis points to 21.5%. Revenue was impacted by decreased activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia as customer budgets were cut and also by the fall in the value of the Venezuelan bolivar. Still, these effects were partially offset by slight activity increases in Venezuela, Argentina and Ecuador. Year-on-year revenue decreased 6% and margins grew by 39 basis points. 
In Venezuela, activity continued to improve with PDVSA and with several of the joint ventures in the Faja while activity is also ramping up in Trinidad. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget cuts as well as seasonal weather effects that mainly impacted offshore activity. The reduced spend mainly affected land development activity, although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in Latin America, offshore activity in Brazil remains weak with the deepwater slowdown continuing as Petrobras announced budget cuts early in the quarter. In Argentina, activity remains resilient in the first quarter, driven by stimulation work and continued new technology uptake in the Vaca Muerta and with new project startups offsetting the completion of others. 
In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue fell 17% sequentially with margins declining by 133 basis points to 21%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 12% and margins grew by 66 basis points. The revenue decline was mainly due to continued weakness in the ruble and lower seasonal activity in Russia. In the U.K. North Sea, exploration activity fell to its lowest level in recent history as customer spending decelerated while rig counts in the Norwegian sector appears to have reached a bottom. In Sub-Saharan Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially across the region. In Algeria, activity was flat sequentially while work in Libya was limited to offshore locations with onshore operations largely shut down for the quarter. 
Looking at the industry as a whole. The current financial challenges will not disappear even if oil prices were to recover to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is, therefore, forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce costs and create more project value. And we see a much closer collaboration between operators and large service companies has a significant opportunity to create technical solutions that will achieve these objectives. At Schlumberger, we are ready to enter into these types of collaborations. And based on our technical and financial strength, we are also prepared to promote more risk-based contract models, where we are compensated based on the solutions we have designed as well as on the performance of our execution. And these contract structures are currently being tabled with a number of customers as part of the ongoing commercial discussions. 
Turning to the 2015 outlook. Visibility still remains limited. However, we expect the largest drop in E&P investments to occur in North America, where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30%. We further believe that a recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells builds and as the refracturing market expands. We also anticipate that our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels, hence, extending the period of weak pricing. 
In the international market, we expect 2015 E&P spend to fall around 15%, which will create challenges in terms of both productivity and pricing levels but considerably less than the headwinds seen in North America. The reduction in international spend will be seen primarily through lower activity levels but also with some pricing impact for basic technologies and with the continuation of the already observed shift from exploration-related services towards more development activity. 
In terms of geography, we expect the GCC space of the Middle East to increase investments in 2015 as the core part of OPEC prepares to recoup market share as the rest of the global supply base continues to weaken. Elsewhere, we expect to see a double-digit reduction in E&P investment levels in Latin America led by Mexico and Brazil, in Europe and Africa led by the North Sea and Sub-Sahara Africa and in Asia led by China, Malaysia and Australia. In Russia, conventional land activity in Western Siberia continues to be resilient, but the overall revenue contribution from Russia will remain subdued until there is a meaningful recovery in the ruble exchange rate. 
While the global foreign activity level is severe, we remain focused on the things we can control, which are our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide. We remain confident in our ability to weather the storm better than our surroundings based on our favorable international leverage, our fair technology leadership in North America shale and the acceleration of our transformation program. These elements will together create the platform that should allow us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers in the coming quarters and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity while delivering unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

And I was actually [indiscernible] in the latest IEA report to now be about 1.1 million barrels per day. While in the supply side, we continue to see the market share battle playing out globally. Now the key question, as we discussed before, is when and where the large cuts in E&P investment is going to show up in the supply numbers. And the latest production data for March is now showing the first signs of a tightening in supply. And we are basically looking at 3 main indicators. The first one is the core OPEC spare capacity, which was down by 400,000 barrels in March to 2.5 million barrels. The other one is the one you alluded to, which is the non-NAM and OPEC production, which showed a slight weakening in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. And given the reduction in E&P spend internationally, we expect this weakening to continue throughout this year. And the third one, which everyone is looking at, is the U.S. monthly sequential production, which is now showing the first signs of flattening. So based on this, as we said in January, we expect the global supply to continue to tighten in the second half of this year. So really no major change to our view on the macro."

So if you look at how we are driving business performance today, which a lot of the focus is around managing decrementals, there's really 3 key components that are part of driving this performance. First is the transformation of the mindset of our entire organization, where we have in the past couple of years, taken teamwork and the tightness of the chain of command to a completely new levels. So this allows us now to plan and execute and also to adjust with great pace and agility, right? And this is the process that has been going on for a number of years. And I think it really demonstrated our capabilities coming from this transformation and in the first quarter. Now the second is just diligent focus on basic cost and resource management. And this includes both our internal cost structures as well as the third-party spend. And although we did well in the first quarter in this area as well, these efforts are going to continue into the second quarter. And then the third one is really the one that you're referring to, which is the structural transformation of how we run the entire company. And here, we said we will be in the sixth to seventh inning in 2017. I would say that today, we are totally in the third inning, if you want to stick to baseball terminology. It's a multiyear program. It's going to bring steady contribution to our performance. And we are today actively looking to accelerate the pace of this implementation. And there's a great pull from the entire organization now to accelerate this. And I'm very pleased with the overall progress in terms of how we are doing."

So in terms of how many wells, I would say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for refracturing increases. And this is both shale liquids and shale gas. In terms of the market potential, I think you're talking billions in terms of revenue opportunities over an extended period of time. But this is quite a significant market opportunity. And I think the key here is that we are still confident in our ability to identify the right candidates and execute the refracturing work that we are prepared to take significant risks in terms of how we go about doing this work.

And you also mentioned a host of markets that you didn't identify but significantly lower than the U.S. with regard to drilling intensity.

The drilling intensity is obviously generally far below what we are seeing today in North America land, but that's basically because in many -- in most of the other basins, we are still working within the conventional resource base. And as you move from the conventional towards more unconventional, you will also generally see an increase in drilling intensity from that. But I would say even in the conventional basins, there is a growing drilling intensity, which we are then looking to capitalize on both through the subsurface integration of the bottom well assembly as well as now going forward with our focusing on establishing our rig of the future."

But I think given the capabilities that we have, I think we are underutilized today and we have a lot more to contribute, even into the design elements of the work that is related to our expertise. And I think by being invited to the table to contribute, complementing what they are doing, I think we can achieve improvements in design and engineer cost out of the system before we go to implementation. And by factoring in our implementation or execution capabilities in the design, I think we can also simplify and streamline the execution part of the work as well. So this is something that we are going to offer, Jim. Some of our customers might take us up on it and some of the others might not. And for the ones that are not, we will continue to work the way we're currently doing.

Obviously, with lower oil prices, it's a really challenging market right now. Somebody even said the IOC business model is broken. It looks to us like maybe a couple of years, this could be in a slowdown here. So I'm just kind of wondering, this is a pretty big part of your business. Schlumberger is oil. The services part in your scheme of things isn't a huge part. Can you just help us -- give us a little bit of a road map for how you think some of the IOCs are going to navigate through the deepwater and exploration and how you see this kind of progressing in order to get this fixed?"

Now given the level of development cost today as well as given the level of recovery factors that we're seeing today, the cost per barrel for these type of developments is challenged. So there has to be a change in overall in how these developments are done. We have to got the cost down and we also have to drive recovery up. And if you can do both, I think a large part of the reserve base and the discovery base that we have established over the past decade in deepwater can and will be developed. So I think this is the challenge that the industry has. And we are prepared to contribute towards finding the right solutions. And I think when the industry really puts their mind to something, we will find a solution and it will be sorted out. As to exploration, I think the playbook we're seeing now is the normal one. Exploration is the first thing that can be cut, which is not going to have a short-term and immediate impact on production. Looking at the current levels of exploration spend today, it is clearly unsustainable. I don't think it's going to get fixed or improved anytime soon or at least not in 2015. But it is very clear that this level of exploration spend is not going to continue for many years."

Now with that said, I think there is a core part of the North America shale liquids that is viable even at the current oil prices and this will continue to be developed. Now as we go forward, as the industry continues to improve, I would say both on the cost side, although a lot of it has already been done but even more so on the production per well, I think that can be a growing part of the, I would say, Tier 2 and Tier 3 acreage that can be developed. But as of now, I think we are limited more to the Tier 1 acreage at these type of oil prices. And that's why we're saying that given the cash flow constraints, we don't expect that rig counts are going to come back to the previous levels of around 2,000. It's going to come back to somewhere in between the current levels and where it was.

So the overall workflow starts with us basically getting the well files and the well data from the operator.

So they're looking at the completion. They're looking at whatever formation evaluation data we have, and then coming up with a candidate selection. Now in terms of the actual physical work execution at the well site, the first thing we need to do is to pull the pump out of the well, and then prepare the well. But beyond that, it's just hooking up the fracturing treatment. And we basically pump a normal fracturing job. But with the BroadBand Sequence fills spaced into the job generally then flooding off the existing perforations that have already been fracked to be able to elevate the pressure in the wells to fracture the additional perforations that initially weren't fracked when the well was first completed. So the key enablers here are the ability of our subsurface experts to identify the right well candidate, and in addition to that, the BroadBand Sequence technology, where we can then actually divert fracturing fluid into the perforations that haven't properly been fractured in the first place."

Actually, if you look at the performance going back to 2012, we posted 35% incrementals in 2012, 42% in 2013 and 69% in 2014. So the fact that we have very good handle of growing the international business in an environment where we've been facing growing headwinds throughout this period, both in exploration, in deepwater, in seismic and also with significant IOC spend cuts, even starting in 2014, I think these incrementals clearly show that the decrementals we're posting in Q1 is just the continuation a multiyear run of improving business performance."

And based on this work we've done in terms of identifying candidates, doing 5 refracs for a range of customers already, the economics based on the BroadBand Sequence technology is actually quite attractive in between refracking an old well or drilling a new well. So I think it would be limited to the companies that have that capability. Now even if there were a range of companies that could do this, I still think that this market overall in terms of absorbing capacity isn't going to fix the problem. So if you look at the overall activity that we had last year, where we had about 2,000 rigs operating, we're down now below 1,000. If you take a pick anywhere in between the 2 numbers of where the recovery is going to come back, no matter what number you pick, I think it's very fair there's going to be significant overcapacity in the market. And that means that pricing that is now already at very low levels is not going to improve in that situation. So refrac is an opportunity for the companies that has the right technology to do it. I don't think it's going to have a big enough impact to fix the overall capacity issue in North America land. But it'll be, I think, a very good avenue of growth for the companies that can identify the right candidates and also have the technology to effectively refrac while keeping costs low enough to make it economical."

And then if you do the algebra, it implies sequential growth internationally in the back half of this year. But my question really comes down to international margins. Because last cycle, we saw international margins sort of bleed lower, even as revenue started increasing. What's your thought process? Or how do you think this cycle plays out? Are we in a different position, where as revenue increases, we could actually have slightly higher margins? Or is the negative pricing impact going to sort of bleed through again?"

Obviously, with these significant spend reductions, that's always going to be there. I think the difference we are seeing at this stage is that based on these incrementals that I referenced just in the previous question, our ability to continuously drive performance to how we execute internationally and leveraging the scale we have of operations and also have a steady contribution from the transformation, that is what is allowing us to hold margins the way they are. We have significantly outperformed our competitors in margins over the previous 2, 3 years. And this has got nothing to do with pricing. We win every bid on lowest price for basic technologies in any country around the world. The only thing that differentiates us from the competition is that we are able to translate this revenue into higher margins basically based on how we run the company. So we are always winning any bid on the lowest price and we are always -- we have to be commercially competitive. But the key here is the internal guts of the company and how we run and execute. And I think that ability has improved significantly over the past 3, 4 years. And that's why we hope that we should be able to manage both decrementals and overall margins better this time around in the international market than what we've done in previous cycles."

As your questions have indicated, the oilfield services market is quite challenging at the moment. And I think it's useful to summarize the 3 most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the past quarter has been challenging to manage. But by being able to quickly adjust plans and by continuing to focus on what we control, we have delivered significantly better decremental margins compared to previous cycles and our international leverage and the acceleration of our transformation program are together creating a strong platform for financial outperformance also going forward. Second, we believe that the industry needs to think differently in order to reduce project cost and increase project value. And we see closer collaboration between operators and the large service companies as a key element in achieving this goal. And this closer collaboration should also include more performance-based contracting models, which we are fully prepared to enter into. And last, while we continue to actively manage cost and resources throughout this downturn by streamlining overhead structures and reducing fleet capacity, we can quickly add back capacity when opportunities arise to take on more work through the efficiency gains created by our transformation program and through our unmatched recruiting and training machine, which is fully intact. That concludes the call for today. Thank you."

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $1.06.

First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $1.06. This represents decreases of $0.44 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded $439 million of pretax charges. This includes $390 million of charges associated with the headcount reduction of 11,000 as well as an incentivized leave of absence program. This program provides us with some flexibility as we manage the uncertainties of the current environment. 
In Venezuela, during the first quarter, the SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 50 to the U.S. dollar was eliminated and replaced with a new system known as SIMADI. The SIMADI rate was approximately VEF 192 as of the end of the quarter. As a result, we recorded $49 million of devaluation charge during the first quarter. After this charge, the U.S. dollar value of our bolivar-denominated net assets is not material. Therefore, any further devaluations of the bolivar will not have a significant impact on our results. 
Our first quarter revenue of $10.2 billion decreased 19% sequentially while pretax operating margin decreased 255 basis points. Approximately 25% of the sequential revenue decline was attributable to the currency effect and the absence of the year-end increase in product, software and multiclient sales that we experienced last quarter. The remaining decrease was driven by activity and price declines. 
Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margin declined 255 basis points sequentially, which resulted in decremental margins of only 33%. This is a result of prompt and proactive cost management across the organization. It's worth noting that although our revenue was significantly impacted by the fall in value of many currencies, this phenomenon does not have a significant impact on our pretax operating income. This reflects the benefit of our local cost structure, which largely serves as a natural hedge against currency movements on our bottom line. 
Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion decreased 21% sequentially while margins decreased 447 basis points to 25.7%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower multiclient and software sales and the fall in higher-margin exploration activity. The Drilling Group revenue of $4 billion decreased 15% sequentially while margins only declined 80 basis points. These declines were primarily driven by the severe rig count drop in North America. Production Group revenue of $3.8 billion decreased 22% sequentially and margins fell by 389 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and pricing pressure in North America land. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 20.9% in the first quarter compared to 21.4% in the previous quarter. This decrease reflects the fact that we generated a smaller portion of our pretax income in North America during Q1. As we progress throughout the year, the ETR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. We generated almost $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and net debt increased $100 million during the quarter to $5.5 billion. This is all despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual [ph] associated with employee compensation as well as the payment of $245 million in severance during the quarter. 
Even with the challenges of the current market, we still anticipate generating very strong free cash flow. This is because during the downturn, we continued to reduce our investments in CapEx and working capital requirements will also come down. This combination should more than offset the decrease in earnings. During the quarter, we spent $719 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares at an average price of $82.98. We spent $606 million on CapEx. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is now expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal."
301966,288829425,790253,"Schlumberger Limited, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure.

Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure. International activity was lower as customers cut budgets in response to lower commodity prices and was also impacted by the normal seasonal effects in the Northern Hemisphere and the fall of certain local currencies against the U.S. dollar. 
In spite of these top line headwinds, we have been able to minimize the impact to our pretax operating margins through prompt and proactive cost management and by further accelerating our transformation program. This is reflected in our first quarter international margins, which are essentially flat sequentially and are up year-over-year. We have also delivered better decrementals than in any previous downturn with sequential decremental margins as low as 33% with North America and the International Areas achieving 39% and 25%, respectively. 
The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly North America, has been almost unprecedented, and we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar. And while we thought we had adequate plans in place going into the quarter, activities declined even faster than expected, which required us to revise our plans accordingly. This made managing the quarter challenging, including the decision to further reduce our workforce by 11,000 employees, bringing the total personnel reduction to 20,000 or around 15% compared to the peak of the third quarter of 2014. 
Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow before restructuring payments during the first quarter. And we remain confident in our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions. And we expect to maintain the cash quality of our earnings by continuing to convert 75% or more of our net income into free cash flow. 
By geography, our North American revenue decreased 25% sequentially, which was significantly lower than the 32% drop in land rig count. Operating margins in North America decreased 670 basis points sequentially to 12.9%. In spite of the severe activity and pricing declines, sequential decrementals were limited to 39% as we maintained -- as we remained fully focused on flawless execution and proactive cost management. In U.S. land, drilling and stimulation activity was down in all basins while activity also dropped significantly in Canada, where the reduction in rig count was further impacted by the early spring breakup. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter, although we are seeing a steady change in service mix from exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts from most of our customers. 
On land in North America, pricing pressure was greatest for hydraulic fracturing services, although some of this impact was mitigated to increase new technology uptake, particularly for our BroadBand stimulation services and Infinity completions products. In spite of this, market pricing for certain products and services has already reached unsustainable levels. However, we are being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss-making contracts. 
We continue to work with our customers to have lower drilling and completion costs while focusing on the savings that new workflows and technologies can bring. We are doing this through our technology integration groups that cover the full range of shale expertise spanning formation valuation, drilling stimulation and completions. The experts making up these integration groups are located in the various shale basins in North America land and have both the scientific understanding of how to optimize shale developments and also an in-depth knowledge of our complete technology offering, which they combine to design the best solution for each reservoir and each well. 
The track record we have established over the past 5 years has now given us the confidence to propose a range of new business models to our customers, where we initially have solved the incremental costs linked to our workflows and technologies in return for an upside based on the actual production results. One example of our unique sales technology is HiWAY, which helps customers increase production and ultimate recovery while using less water and proppant. 
In the period between 2012 and 2014, wells completed with HiWAY technology in the Eagle Ford showed a 26% increase in the best 3 months of production compared to wells stimulated with conventional treatments. HiWAY technology also helps save around 1.4 billion gallons of fracturing fluid and about 2.8 billion pounds of proppant in more than 1,000 wells. The success of the HiWAY technology is now being complemented and extended by the rapid uptake of BroadBand Sequence, which has already shown remarkable performance for a range of customers in both new well completions and in refracturing of old wells. 
In the international markets, revenue declined 16% sequentially, driven by seasonal weather impact, currency effects and customer spending cuts. But despite the severity of the sequential revenue decline and the unfavorable shift in revenue mix, we managed to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins, which were essentially flat with the previous quarter at 24.1%. This performance was achieved by strong execution, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program, which together were able to offset the margin impact from both reduced activities and the pricing pressure we were seeing from all customer groups. In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margins and by always aiming to trade any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms. 
Within the International Areas, Middle East & Asia revenue declined by 13% sequentially while pretax operating margin improved by 30 basis points to 28.6%. Performance was impacted by a double-digit sequential drop in revenue in the Asia-Pacific region and by lower product and software sales but was partially offset by robust activity in the GCC region. Year-on-year revenue decreased 5% and margins grew by 230 basis points. 
In the Middle East region, our long-term turnkey project in Saudi Arabia gained momentum during the first quarter, and we expect solid drilling activity going forward, together with more fracturing and rigless work. In the United Arab Emirates, development activity on the north island of the SARB project has now started with more rig additions planned over the next few quarters. On this project, Schlumberger has been awarded a 5-year contract for the supply of integrated well construction services with further details provided in our earnings press release. 
Activity in the rest of the GCC countries was also strong in the first quarter while in Iraq, revenues in the north remained muted at around half of the peak levels seen in 2014 and activity in the south of the country was steady around the levels seen in the fourth quarter. In Southeast Asia, activity in China was seasonally lower in the first quarter. But activity also declined in the rest of the region as customer budget cuts continued to be implemented. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 20% sequentially while pretax operating margin improved 59 basis points to 21.5%. Revenue was impacted by decreased activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia as customer budgets were cut and also by the fall in the value of the Venezuelan bolivar. Still, these effects were partially offset by slight activity increases in Venezuela, Argentina and Ecuador. Year-on-year revenue decreased 6% and margins grew by 39 basis points. 
In Venezuela, activity continued to improve with PDVSA and with several of the joint ventures in the Faja while activity is also ramping up in Trinidad. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget cuts as well as seasonal weather effects that mainly impacted offshore activity. The reduced spend mainly affected land development activity, although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in Latin America, offshore activity in Brazil remains weak with the deepwater slowdown continuing as Petrobras announced budget cuts early in the quarter. In Argentina, activity remains resilient in the first quarter, driven by stimulation work and continued new technology uptake in the Vaca Muerta and with new project startups offsetting the completion of others. 
In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue fell 17% sequentially with margins declining by 133 basis points to 21%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 12% and margins grew by 66 basis points. The revenue decline was mainly due to continued weakness in the ruble and lower seasonal activity in Russia. In the U.K. North Sea, exploration activity fell to its lowest level in recent history as customer spending decelerated while rig counts in the Norwegian sector appears to have reached a bottom. In Sub-Saharan Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially across the region. In Algeria, activity was flat sequentially while work in Libya was limited to offshore locations with onshore operations largely shut down for the quarter. 
Looking at the industry as a whole. The current financial challenges will not disappear even if oil prices were to recover to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is, therefore, forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce costs and create more project value. And we see much closer collaboration between operators and large service companies as a significant opportunity to create technical solutions that will achieve these objectives. At Schlumberger, we are ready to enter into these types of collaborations. And based on our technical and financial strength, we are also prepared to promote more risk-based contract models, where we are compensated based on the solutions we have designed as well as on the performance of our execution. And these contract structures are currently being tabled with a number of customers as part of the ongoing commercial discussions. 
Turning to the 2015 outlook. Visibility still remains limited. However, we expect the largest drop in E&P investments to occur in North America, where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30%. We further believe that a recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells builds and as the refracturing market expands. We also anticipate that our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels, hence, extending the period of weak pricing. 
In the international market, we expect 2015 E&P spend to fall around 15%, which will create challenges in terms of both productivity and pricing levels but considerably less than the headwinds seen in North America. The reduction in international spend will be seen primarily through lower activity levels but also with some pricing impact for basic technologies and with the continuation of the already observed shift from exploration-related services towards more development activity. 
In terms of geography, we expect the GCC space of the Middle East to increase investments in 2015 as the core part of OPEC prepares to recoup market share as the rest of the global supply base continues to weaken. Elsewhere, we expect to see a double-digit reduction in E&P investment levels in Latin America led by Mexico and Brazil, in Europe and Africa, led by the North Sea and Sub-Sahara Africa, and in Asia, led by China, Malaysia and Australia. In Russia, conventional land activity in Western Siberia continues to be resilient, but the overall revenue contribution from Russia will remain subdued until there is a meaningful recovery in the ruble exchange rate. 
While the global foreign activity level is severe, we remain focused on the things we can control, which are our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide. We remain confident in our ability to weather the storm better than our surroundings based on our favorable international leverage, our fair technology leadership in North America shale and the acceleration of our transformation program. These elements will together create the platform that should allow us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers in the coming quarters and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity while delivering unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

While in the supply side, we continue to see the market share battle playing out globally. Now the key question, as we discussed before, is when and where the large cuts in E&P investment is going to show up in the supply numbers. And the latest production data for March is now showing the first signs of a tightening in supply. And we are basically looking at 3 main indicators. The first one is the core OPEC spare capacity, which was down by 400,000 barrels in March to 2.5 million barrels. The other one is the one you alluded to, which is the non-NAM and OPEC production, which showed a slight weakening in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. And given the reduction in E&P spend internationally, we expect this weakening to continue throughout this year. And the third one, which everyone is looking at, is the U.S. monthly sequential production, which is now showing the first signs of flattening. So based on this, as we said in January, we expect the global supply to continue to tighten in the second half of this year. So really no major change to our view on the macro."

So if you look at how we are driving business performance today, which a lot of the focus is around managing decrementals, there's really 3 key components that are part of driving this performance. First is the transformation of the mindset of our entire organization, where we have in the past couple of years, taken teamwork and the tightness of the chain of command to a completely new levels. So this allows us now to plan and execute and also to adjust with great pace and agility, right? And this is the process that has been going on for a number of years. And I think it really demonstrated our capabilities coming from this transformation and in the first quarter. Now the second is just diligent focus on basic cost and resource management. And this includes both our internal cost structures as well as the third-party spend. And although we did well in the first quarter in this area as well, these efforts are going to continue into the second quarter. And then the third one is really the one that you're referring to, which is the structural transformation of how we run the entire company. And here, we said we will be in the sixth to seventh inning in 2017. I would say that today, we are probably in the third inning, if you want to stick to baseball terminology. It's a multiyear program. It's going to bring steady contribution to our performance. And we are today actively looking to accelerate the pace of this implementation. And there's a great pull from the entire organization now to accelerate this. And I'm very pleased with the overall progress in terms of how we are doing."

So first of all, with regard to a question regarding business model, you've referenced this in your earnings release. You've also referenced it several times being prepared to move to more risk-based business models, and specifically, the significant opportunity associated with the refracking of older wells. So what kind of uptake are you seeing with regard to the refracking opportunity?

And that's based on our understanding of the existing completions and the potential that these still hold. And then the other part is around how do you effectively do the refracturing while minimizing the costs. So we have, through our engineered completion shale and formation evaluation capabilities as well as BroadBand Sequence, now established that broad technology offering. So in terms of how many wells, I would say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for refracturing. And this is both shale liquids and shale gas. In terms of the market potential, I think you're talking billions in terms of revenue opportunities over an extended period of time. But this is quite a significant market opportunity. And I think the key here is that we are still confident in our ability to identify the right candidates and execute the refracturing work that we are prepared to take significant risks in terms of how we go about doing this work. We are, in many cases, if we can select the candidates, prepared to foot the entire bill for the refracturing work, and then get paid back in production."

You had, again referencing back to this presentation that you did a couple of weeks ago, the global drilling intensity slide in which you juxtaposed the 2014 production numbers from the big 3 liquids producers, roughly the same at about 11 million barrels per day but significantly different levels of drilling activity to generate that output, 36,000 wells U.S., 8,700 for Russia and 399 for Saudi Arabia. And you also mentioned a host of markets that you didn't identify but significantly lower than the U.S. with regard to drilling intensity. So you stated that basically required level of drilling intensity for many of these markets to keep production flat. But the question I had is not only to keep production flat, but the production -- the flexibility and the wherewithal to increase production with increased drilling intensity. Can you speak to that, please?"

That's the basic message. So I think you're seeing that increased drilling intensity happening in many basins around the world today. The drilling intensity is obviously generally far below what we are seeing today in North America land, but that's basically because in many -- in most of the other basins, we are still working within the conventional resource base. And as you move from the conventional towards more unconventional, you will also generally see an increase in drilling intensity from that. But I would say even in the conventional basins, there is a growing drilling intensity, which we are then looking to capitalize on both through the subsurface integration of the bottom well assembly as well as now going forward with our focusing on establishing our rig of the future."

Now given the level of development cost today as well as given the level of recovery factors that we're seeing today, the cost per barrel for these type of developments is challenged. So there has to be a change, in overall, in how these developments are done. We have to get the cost down and we also have to drive recovery up. And if you can do both, I think a large part of the reserve base and the discovery base that we have established over the past decade in deepwater can and will be developed. So I think this is the challenge that the industry has. And we are prepared to contribute towards finding the right solutions. And I think when the industry really puts their mind to something, we will find a solution and it will be sorted out. As to exploration [ph], I think the playbook we're seeing now is the normal one. Exploration is the first thing that can be cut, which is not going to have a short-term and immediate impact on production. Looking at the current levels of exploration spend today, it is clearly unsustainable. I don't think it's going to get fixed or improved anytime soon or at least not in 2015.

But as of now, I think we are limited more to the Tier 1 acreage at these type of oil prices. And that's why we're saying that given the cash flow constraints, we don't expect that rig counts are going to come back to the previous levels of around 2,000. It's going to come back to somewhere in between the current levels and where it was.

Now in terms of the actual physical work execution at the well site, the first thing we need to do is to pull the pump out of the well, and then prepare the well. But beyond that, it's just hooking up the fracturing treatment. And we basically pump a normal fracturing job, but with the BroadBand Sequence fills spaced into the job generally then flooding off the existing perforations that have already been fracked to be able to elevate the pressure in the wells to fracture the additional perforations that initially weren't fracked when the well was first completed.

Actually, if you look at the performance going back to 2012, we posted 35% incrementals in 2012, 42% in 2013 and 69% in 2014. So the fact that we have very good handle of growing the international business in an environment where we've been facing growing headwinds throughout this period, both in exploration, in deepwater, in seismic and also with significant IOC spend cuts, even starting in 2014, I think these incrementals clearly show that the decrementals we're posting in Q1 is just the continuation a multiyear run of improving business performance."

Now in the context of refrac -- and I'm just trying to connect the dots because if there's a significant amount of refrac that's going to happen, I would have personally thought that, that would lead to a more rapid capacity absorption period and potentially a faster recovery period in terms of pricing because they're going to get all this backlog of refrac. So can you just -- I might be a little bit slow. Can you help me kind of connect the dots on how refracking won't lead to an acceleration of capacity absorption?

And based on this work we've done in terms of identifying candidates, doing trial refracs for a range of customers already, the economics based on the BroadBand Sequence technology is actually quite attractive in between refracking an old well or drilling a new well. So I think it would be limited to the companies that have that capability. Now even if there were a range of companies that could do this, I still think that this market overall in terms of absorbing capacity isn't going to fix the problem. So if you look at the overall activity that we had last year, where we had about 2,000 rigs operating, we're down now below 1,000. If you take a pick anywhere in between the 2 numbers of where the recovery is going to come back, no matter what number you pick, I think it's very fair there's going to be significant overcapacity in the market. And that means that pricing that is now already at very low levels is not going to improve in that situation. So refrac is an opportunity for the companies that have the right technology to do it. I don't think it's going to have a big enough impact to fix the overall capacity issue in North America land. But it'll be, I think, a very good avenue of growth for the companies that can identify the right candidates and also have the technology to effectively refrac while keeping costs low enough to make it economical."

Obviously, with these significant spend reductions, that's always going to be there. I think the difference we are seeing at this stage is that based on these incrementals that I referenced just in the previous question, our ability to continuously drive performance to how we execute internationally and leveraging the scale we have of operations and also have a steady contribution from the transformation, that is what is allowing us to hold margins the way they are. We have significantly outperformed our competitors in margins over the previous 2, 3 years. And this has got nothing to do with pricing. We win every bid on lowest price for basic technologies in any country around the world. The only thing that differentiates us from the competition is that we are able to translate this revenue into higher margins basically based on how we run the company. So we are always winning any bid on the lowest price and we are always -- we have to be commercially competitive. But the key here is the internal guts of the company and how we run and execute. And I think that ability has improved significantly over the past 3, 4 years. And that's why we hope that we should be able to manage both decrementals and overall margins better this time around in the international market than what we've done in previous cycles."

But by being able to quickly adjust plans and by continuing to focus on what we control, we have delivered significantly better decremental margins compared to previous cycles and our international leverage and the acceleration of our transformation program are, together, creating a strong platform for financial outperformance also going forward. Second, we believe that the industry needs to think differently in order to reduce project cost and increase project value. And we see closer collaboration between operators and the large service companies as a key element in achieving this goal. And this closer collaboration should also include more performance-based contracting models, which we are fully prepared to enter into. And last, while we continue to actively manage cost and resources throughout this downturn by streamlining overhead structures and reducing fleet capacity, we can quickly add back capacity when opportunities arise to take on more work through the efficiency gains created by our transformation program and through our unmatched recruiting and training machine, which is fully intact.

Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $0.88. This represents decreases of $0.18 sequentially and $0.49 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our second quarter revenue of $9 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margins only declined by 49 basis points sequentially. This resulted in the incremental margins of just 23%, which is a result of continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. 
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.4 billion decreased 5% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by Wireline and testing as a result of lower exploration spending. Pretax operating margins decreased 84 basis points to 26.5% as an impact of the lower exploration activities was offset by increased higher-margin software sales. 
Drilling Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 11%, primarily due to the further significant drop in the North America rig count. Margins remained resilient at 19.5% as a strong cost management limited the margin decline to only 44 basis points.
Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 18% sequentially as both activity and pricing for pressure pumping services in North America fell dramatically. Despite this severe revenue decline, margins only fell by 179 basis points to 12.8%. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.1% in the second quarter. This was essentially flat when compared to the previous quarter. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the second quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first half of 2015, we have generated $4.1 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $200 million during the second quarter and almost $0.5 billion during the first 6 months of the year. 
Net debt increased $111 million during the quarter to $5.6 billion. During the quarter, we spent $520 million to repurchase 5.8 million shares at an average price of $19 [ph] per share. We spent $587 million on CapEx during the second quarter. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.

Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the recount declined accelerated and by further pricing erosion in both",2582,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the recount declined accelerated and by further pricing erosion in both North America and the International area. North America revenue fell 27% sequentially while International revenue was 5% lower as customer budget cuts and pricing concessions impacted results for a full quarter. Despite the challenging market conditions, overall pretax operating margins were maintained well above the levels of previous downturns as we continue to proactively manage costs and resources, carefully navigate the commercial landscape and further accelerating our transformational program throughout the organization. The success of this approach can be seen in a double-digit pretax operating margin in North America and an International margin of 24.5%, which is 35 basis points up sequentially and 44 basis points up year-over-year. 
In the first half of 2015, year-over-year revenue has now dropped 26% in North America and 14% internationally. These levels exceed those of the 2009 downturn in both pace and size. Still, we have delivered first half incremental margins of 37% in North America and just 18% in the International area. These incremental margins represent a marked improvement over figures from the last downturn, which were in excess of 70%, particularly as we begin to approach what we believe is the market bottom. 
While the market remains tough, we also believe we have been successful in adapting to a rapidly changing situation as far as the size of our workforce is concerned. The absence of charges in the second quarter is evidence of this as the adjustments made in the second quarter were absorbed in our normal operating costs. 
In terms of corporate financial performance, we also generated almost $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter. This figure, which represents a conversion rate of 132% of the quarter's earnings into free cash flow, demonstrates our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions. 
Looking at our results on a geographical basis. North American revenue decreased 27% sequentially as figured rate [indiscernible] 25% sequential decrease seen in the first quarter, and again significantly lower than the fall and the land rig count, which was down 40% sequentially in North America land. 
In spite of this drop, operating margins in North America decreased by only 268 basis points sequentially, leading our margins 465 basis points higher than the same period of the 2009 downturn. The strength of this performance was underpinned by our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing impact of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management altogether limiting this sequential decremental margins to 20%. 
In U.S. land, activity was down in all basins in the second quarter, with the recount dropping below 860 for most of the month of June. In addition to the significant reduction in rig count, poor weather conditions with floods in Texas, Arkansas and Alaska also drove activity lower in the second quarter. The dramatic reduction in activity in U.S. land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry, with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels, in particular for pressure pumping, where many companies now are desperately fighting to survive. 
Our approach to the market remained unchanged in the second quarter, where we concentrate our activity in core areas and for key customers and where beyond this proceed with stacking of equipment rather than operating with large losses. 
We continue to maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term service capacity, and we are working closely with our customers develop reduced cost per barrel through better operational efficiency and reliability and through the application of new technology, workflows and business models. 
Based on this approach, we will ramp up our activity for opportunities that bring the required returns. The strength of our technology portfolio, the range of our workflow solutions and the depth of our shale understanding also enables us to pursue performance-based contracts, where we initially underwrite the incremental cost of our technology and where we recover this cost plus the performance upside from incremental well production. 
In Western Canada, activity was also down significantly in the second quarter, with the rig count falling by 66% sequentially, impacted by the early spring breakup and with the recovery expected to be limited during the summer months. Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater rig activity was down in the second quarter, and activity was also impacted by loop currents, while pack eyes [ph] of Eastern Canada also impacted our drilling and seismic operations in the second quarter. 
Offshore revenue was further impacted by the expected shift in service mix from exploration to development and completions as well as increasing pricing pressure. However, the primary driver for offshore success continues to be risk reduction and project performance, and we are, therefore, fully engaged with our customers to help reduce overall AFE costs through better project planning and execution. 
In the International markets, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, driven by further budget cuts from our customers as well as further pricing concession. For the first half of the year, revenue has now dropped 14% compared to last year at figure that is more than double the 5% fall experience over the same timeframe in the 2009 downturn. 
Second quarter operating margins at 24.5% was up 35 basis points sequentially and 44 basis points year-over-year as first half decremental margins were held to 18% compared to 73% over the same period in the 2009 downturn. These results fully demonstrate our leadership in the International markets, which is built on flawless execution from the entire organization, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program focused on workforce productivity, asset utilization and reduction in unit support costs. 
In this environment, we focus on carefully balancing market share growth with protection of operating margin and by negotiating pricing concessions in return for additional work, integration opportunities or improved contract terms, knowing from experience that any permanent pricing compressions that we make will be very hard to recover even as market conditions improve. 
Within the International area, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 5% sequentially while pretax operating margins improved 8 basis points to 28.7%. Activity remained robust in the GCC region, however, strength in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was not sufficient to offset weakness in the Asia Pacific region. 
Year-on-year revenue decreased by 13% while margins expanded by 87 basis points. 
In the Middle East region, our lump sum turn-key project in Saudi Arabia continued to gain momentum during the quarter. However, our overall results were not immune to the customer pricing concessions we gave in the first quarter. In the United Arab Emirates, drilling and production related activity increased as work on the [indiscernible] North Island project ramped up and with further rig additions expected over the coming quarters. 
Drilling activity was also stronger and Kuwait as the rig count increased in line with the country's strategic production targets while unique land seismic activity grew with the improved operational productivity. 
In Iraq, revenues in the North declined further in the second quarter while activity in the [indiscernible] countries remained flat sequentially but is expected increase in the second half of the year on the back of the recent contract wins. 
In Southeast Asia, activity fell in Australia as projects were completed both on land and offshore while activity in Malaysia declined as customer budget reductions affected both OpEx and CapEx investment. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially while pretax operating margins improved 81 basis points to 22.3%. Revenue was impacted once again by decreasing activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, however, somewhat offset by increased activity in Venezuela. 
Year-on-year revenue decreased 17%, and margins grew by 111 basis points. 
In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly in the second quarter on further customer budget cuts that impacted both onshore and offshore activity. And in spite of new contract wins for both seismic and integrated well construction, the outlook for the second half of the year remains challenging. 
At the same time, the energy reform continues to progress on plan with the first major license award being announced in the third quarter. 
Offshore activity in Brazil remained weak with the deepwater rig count being down significantly versus the first quarter. While in Columbia, the activity slowdown continued and now affects all product line. In the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarkets, increased activity was driven by exploration work in Surinam and Guyana, while joint ventures in the Faja region of Venezuela continued to ramp up. 
Elsewhere in South America, revenue in Argentina remained resilient as growth in conventional activity partially offset pricing pressure for unconventional services. At the same time, SPM activity remained strong in Ecuador as the Shushufindi project continued to perform in line with expectations and with activity and production starting up on the new [indiscernible] SPM project. 
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 5% sequentially with margins edging up by 29 basis points to 21.3%. Year-on-year, revenue decreased 26% and margins dropped by 85 basis points. 
Within the area, revenue increase in Russia and Central Asia, driven by the seasonal recovery of conventional land activity and as the rubble strengthened somewhat. 
In the North Sea, the shift from exploration to development-related activity continued while customer budget pressure both in the U.K. and Norway resulted in lower sales of new technology. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially as customer budget pressure resulted in several active rigs being demobilized. 
And in Algeria, activity was slightly up sequentially while work in Libya was limited as the security situation remained very challenging. 
1 year ago, at our 2014 Investor Conference, we told you about our transformation program, which is designed to provide a new approach to how we run our business in order to enable fundamentally better performance. Our transformation leverages the drivers of technology innovation, equipment reliability, process efficiency and system integration, altogether delivering better management of costs, better quality of product and service delivery and better generation of free cash flow. 
While we set goals for new technologies and increasing element of service integration, we also target a tenfold reduction in customer nonproductive time and doubling an asset utilization, a 25% reduction in inventory day, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of unit support costs. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made 1 year later. 
While the transformation was designed to deliver our performance in any part of the cycle, the current market conditions have enable us to improve customer dialogue and to accelerate the program throughout our global organization. The strength of our International margin so far this year is one demonstration of the performance impact from our transformation, while the resilience in our North America margins is another proof point. 
In terms of costs, our figures show that we are managing all aspects very well, including both fixed and variable compensation as well as the cost of product and service delivery. In terms of quality, the investments we have made in training, new technology and enabling systems are now really starting to pay off as can be seen by our second quarter quality results, where we set the new record low in terms of nonproductive time incurred for our customers. 
Last, in terms of cash, the reduction in CapEx intensity and the discipline we have shown with respect to managing working capital have delivered a very strong free cash flow in the first half of the year with a cash conversion rate of 98%, including severance payment, which is well above our 75% target. 
Turning now to the overall outlook for the second half of the year. Visibility still remains limited, however, some tentative signs of change are emerging. 
On the supply side of the oil market, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high-cost producers is still playing out with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show. Within OPEC, production in the second quarter was at the highest level for 3 years as market and supply was again increased at the expense of lower  core spare capacity, which in June dropped to 2.3 million barrels per day. 
In addition to this, non-NAM, non-OPEC production weakened in the first half of the year by 650,000 barrels per day, driven by Brazil and Mexico with a further softening expected in the second half of the year as the lower investment levels in many regions start to take full effect. 
Against these supply figures, global oil demand growth continues to strengthen with the IEA having revised its 2015 estimate up to 1.4 million barrels per day during the second quarter. These factors all point to a potential tightening in the global supply-demand balance in the coming quarters. 
Turning to our industry. The largest drop in E&P investments is, as expected, occurring in North America, where 2015 spend will now largely be done by more than 35%, driven by both pricing and activity on land. We do believe that the North American rig count has now reached bottom but that will only see a slow increase in drilling and completion activity in the second half of the year, which will not make any material dent in the massive overcapacity that has been created. This again means that it would be little to no improvement in pricing levels, and hence, the market will still remain Valley challenging for the foreseeable future. 
In the International market, E&P spending is now expected to fall more than 15%, driven by lower activity in most regions and further amplified by a very strong dollar, in particular, versus the Russian ruble and the Venezuelan bolivar. 
Given the nature of the business in the International market, we do not expect any upward adjustment to existing customer budget for the second half of 2015. Instead, we see a continuation of the trends from the first half with very low exploration activity, tight management of development-related spend and continued pricing pressure for our products and services. 
However, we do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016 for exploration and development-related activity. 
In the midst of the current market challenges, we remain focused on the things we can control, including our cost and resources base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide to our customers. The success of this approach is enabling us to maintain solid International margins despite a significant drop in activity and, at the same time, also allowing us to maximize our performance in North America. We remain very confident in our capacity to weather the current downturn better than our surroundings and also significantly better than what we had done in previous downturns. Our global strength, our technology differentiation and our accelerated corporate transformation is creating a great platform for us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity to deliver unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
And at the same time, this financial strength positions us well to take advantage of increasing market opportunities, resulting from the current market environment. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for Q&A."

And we've also said that with a certain lag, as the large cuts in E&P investments are going to show up in the supply numbers. And we see it, in particular, in non-NAM and OPEC, which has shown a gradual weakening over the first 6 months of this year. U.S. monthly sequential margin is flattening, and the core OpEx spare capacity was also down to only 2.3 million [ph] barrels in June -- million barrels per day. So I think the tightening that we've been foreshadowing, we're still relatively confident that, that will happen in the second half of the year."

It's going to be impacting in both regions in Q3 beyond where we are in Q2, but I think that's relatively larger in North America. As to our ability to offset this, the transformation and the general way that we are managing the company and the focus we have on cost and resource management, through this, we are going to continue to create a financial leverage over the coming years. And we are going to take that leverage out in two forms: we will take it out through market share gains by being able to be even more competitive on price; and secondly, we'll take the other part out through very strong incrementals when we grow or alternatively, very strong decremental when we shrink. So what we talked about in 2014 at the Investor Day in terms of what the transformation represents for the company, say, in the next 5-year horizon, it is there. We are accelerating the impact from it. And we see this leverage as something that we will continuously take out in the coming years. So fundamentally, I think, the performance that we are posting is sustainable. It's not going to be a straight line, but overall, what we're doing now is not a fluke."

So with the dialogs we have with customers, both on geo-engineer completions or on refracturings, in terms of more sophisticated fracturing fluid systems like BroadBand, it is very clear that the appetite to use new technology and more sophisticated technology is growing. Now some of the customers would take on that technology on a more of a standard type of contract where we will still get a premium over what basic commodity type of technologies we give, while other customers will also like to go into a more risk-based contract setup. We are fine either way. We are looking to create technology differentiation, and I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to push that forward in the coming quarters even in this business environment."

And like you said, the overall impact on transformation, which we started several years earlier in North America is part of driving this. We started that transformation and reorganization back in 2010. I would say, our North American organization has also been a very proactive when it comes to cost and resource management. And as we just talked about earlier on one of the questions there, the uptake of new technology, both in North America and International, the rate of uptake, given the downturn, is actually quite strong and actually much higher than what we have seen in any previous downturns. So I think on that come down to the fact that a lot of the technologies, new technology we now have out, have very clear cost and efficiency angles to them, which means that they sell equally easy in the downturn as they do in the upturn."

But nothing on the horizon as we see today. Still a very tough market. And we see this very, very clearly in some of our key high-tech product lines, where our exploration revenue over the past 6 quarters has actually dropped by 35%. So I don't think we're too far away from bottom because it's not that much left to cut. But the comeback, I think, is still a little bit out in time.

Now this is slightly lower than the 25% target that we laid out last year. But given where we are in the cycle, this is dramatically higher than what we have seen in any previous cycle, right? So yes, we are selling significantly higher rate of new technology in this part of the cycle versus previous. And as I said earlier, this is down to, I think, the fact that we have a very flush new technology portfolio and offering. And I think we have been doing a better job in clearly demonstrating to our customers what these new technologies bring in terms of lower cost of barrel, in terms of efficiency, in terms of higher production. And this is again why I think the uptake, although it's slightly down from where it was in the second half of 2014, it is still holding off very, very well."

And it could potentially  represent bottom when it comes to revenue. Now if you look at Q1, we saw a 19% special decline. In Q2, we saw a 12% sequential decline in revenue. So for the third quarter, we expect something in the range of 5%, 6% further decline in sequential revenue. Now if you look at the two main parts of the world, in North America, we do expect a slight increase on activity on land. But again, we see this being offset by weakening also offshore activity and further pricing pressure both on land and offshore. And internationally, no major change. We think the overall weak activity is going to continue, and also there's going to be sustained pricing pressure. In addition, we have the slowing down of activity for part of Q2 the Middle East and also the maintenance season in the North sea. Now if you look at the cycle, so far, we have proactively manage costs to protect margins. And I think we demonstrated that we are pretty quick on our feet, and we can manage this very, very well. At this stage, our structure costs and our fuel capacity is really tailored to our Q2 activity level. But for now, we have decided to preserve our current structure for Q3, and this is in order to be ready for increased activity as we go forward. So provided that this is for a limited period of time, we are prepared to live with the temporary margin impact that carrying these slightly elevated levels of resources is going to have. It's not going to be a huge impact on margins, but it's going to be a little bit more than what we could have managed if we were to cut even deeper. So if you look at EPS, it's going to come down in Q3. And I think the current consensus of $0.77 is a pretty realistic number."

Before we close, I'd like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the market evolution in the second quarter was the continuation of what we saw in the first quarter. With North America land rig count falling further and with pricing pressure increasing in both North America and International markets. In response to this, we have proactively managed what remains our and subsequently delivered our best cost and cash performance so for in any downturn. Second, our strong performance has been amplified by declaration of our transformation program, which is being actively implemented throughout our global organization and which has enabled us to increase pretax operating margins in the International area, and maintain double-digit margins in North America. Third, we believe that we now have seen the bottom of the rig count decline in North America and that North America land activity will see a slow increase in the second half of the year, while will service pricing is expected to decline further in the third quarter as defined for market share continues to play out. In the International markets, we expect [indiscernible] to the E&P CapEx spend for the remainder of the 2015, as the trend of lower expression activity, tight management of development spend and sustained pricing pressure is likely subsequent. Based on this, the third quarter could potentially represent the bottom of the cycle in terms of earnings per share and as the pace of the revenue drop is up to slow and as we continue our steadfast efforts to maximize operating margins in both North America and International markets. And with the streamlining of our cost and resource base, on that taken in the past 9 months, together with declaration of our transformation program, we remain very optimistic about our ability to deliver unmatched incremental margins as soon as E&P investments that show any signs of growth.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $0.88.

Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $0.88. This represents decreases of $0.18 sequentially and $0.49 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our second quarter revenue of $9 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margins only declined by 49 basis points sequentially. This resulted in decremental margins of just 23%, which is a result of continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. 
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.4 billion decreased 5% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by Wireline and Testing as a result of lower exploration spending. Pretax operating margins decreased 84 basis points to 26.5% as the impact of the lower exploration activities was offset by increased higher-margin software sales. 
Drilling Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 11%, primarily due to the further significant drop in the North America rig count. Margins remained resilient at 19.5% as a strong cost management limited the margin decline to only 44 basis points.
Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 18% sequentially as both activity and pricing for pressure pumping services in North America fell dramatically. Despite the severe revenue decline, margins only fell by 179 basis points to 12.8%. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.1% in the second quarter. This was essentially flat when compared to the previous quarter. 
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the second quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first half of 2015, we have generated $4.1 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $200 million during the second quarter and almost $0.5 billion during the first 6 months of the year. 
Net debt increased $111 million during the quarter to $5.6 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $520 million to repurchase 5.8 million shares at an average price of $90 per share. 
We spent $587 million on CapEx during the second quarter. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal."
301966,295442334,834376,"Schlumberger Limited, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2015",2015-07-17,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the rig count declined accelerated and by further pricing erosion in bot",2592,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the rig count declined accelerated and by further pricing erosion in both North America and the International Areas. North America revenue fell 27% sequentially while International revenue was 5% lower as customer budget cuts and pricing concessions impacted results for a full quarter. 
Despite the challenging market conditions, overall pretax operating margins were maintained well above the levels of previous downturns as we continue to proactively manage costs and resources, carefully navigate the commercial landscape and further accelerate our transformational program throughout the organization. The success of this approach can be seen in a double-digit pretax operating margin in North America and an International margin of 24.5%, which is 35 basis points up sequentially and 44 basis points up year-over-year. 
In the first half of 2015, year-over-year revenue has now dropped 26% in North America and 14% internationally. These levels exceed those of the 2009 downturn in both pace and size. Still, we have delivered first half decremental margins of 37% in North America and just 18% in the International Area. These decremental margins represent a marked improvement over equivalent figures from the last downturn, which were in excess of 70%, particularly as we begin to approach what we believe is the market bottom. 
While the market remains tough, we also believe we have been successful in adapting to a rapidly changing situation as far as the size of our workforce is concerned. The absence of charges in the second quarter is evidence of this as the adjustments made in the second quarter were absorbed in our normal operating costs. 
In terms of corporate financial performance, we also generated almost $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter. This figure, which represents a conversion rate of 132% of the quarter's earnings into free cash flow, demonstrates our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions. 
Looking at our results on a geographical basis. North American revenue decreased 27% sequentially as figure greater than the 25% sequential decrease seen in the first quarter and again significantly lower than the fall in the land rig count, which was down 40% sequentially in North America land. In spite of this drop, operating margins in North America decreased by only 268 basis points sequentially, leaving our margins 465 basis points higher than the same period of the 2009 downturn. 
The strength of this performance was underpinned by our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing impact of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management, all together limiting the sequential decremental margins to 20%. 
In U.S. land, activity was down in all basins in the second quarter with the rig count dropping below 860 for most of the month of June. In addition to the significant reduction in rig count, poor weather conditions with floods in Texas, Arkansas and Alaska also drove activity lower in the second quarter. The dramatic reduction in activity in U.S. land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels, in particular for pressure pumping where many companies now are desperately fighting to survive. 
Our approach to the market remained unchanged in the second quarter where we concentrate our activity in core areas and for key customers, and where we're beyond this, proceed with stacking of equipment rather than operating with large losses. 
We continue to maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term service capacity, and we are working closely with our customers to help reduce cost per barrel through better operational efficiency and reliability and through the application of new technology, workflows and business models. Based on this approach, we will ramp up our activity for opportunities that bring the required returns. 
The strength of our technology portfolio, the range of our workflow solutions and the depth of our shale understanding also enables us to pursue performance-based contracts where we initially underwrite the incremental cost of our technology and where we recover this cost plus the performance upside from incremental well production. 
In Western Canada, activity was also down significantly in the second quarter with the rig count falling by 66% sequentially, impacted by the early spring breakup and with the recovery expected to be limited during the summer months. 
Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater rig activity was down in the second quarter, and activity was also impacted by loop currents while pack ice off Eastern Canada also impacted our drilling and seismic operations in the second quarter. Offshore revenue was further impacted by the expected shift in service mix from exploration to development and completions as well as increasing pricing pressure. However, the primary driver for offshore success continues to be risk reduction and project performance and we are therefore fully engaged with our customers to help reduce overall AFE costs through better project planning and execution. 
In the International markets, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, driven by further budget cuts from our customers as well as further pricing concession. For the first half of the year, revenue has now dropped 14% compared to last year, a figure that is more than double the 5% fall experienced over the same time frame in the 2009 downturn. Second quarter operating margins at 24.5% was up 35 basis points sequentially and 44 basis points year-over-year as first half decremental margins were held to 18% compared to 73% over the same period in the 2009 downturn. 
These results fully demonstrate our leadership in the International markets, which is built on flawless execution from the entire organization, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program focused on workforce productivity, asset utilization and reduction in unit support costs. 
In this environment, we focus on carefully balancing market share growth with protection of operating margin and by negotiating pricing concessions in return for additional work, integration opportunities or improved contract terms, knowing from experience that any permanent pricing concessions that we make will be very hard to recover even as market conditions improve. 
Within the International Areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 5% sequentially while pretax operating margins improved 8 basis points to 28.7%. Activity remained robust in the GCC region. However, strength in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was not sufficient to offset weakness in the Asia Pacific region. Year-on-year revenue decreased by 13% while margins expanded by 87 basis points. 
In the Middle East region, our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia continued to gain momentum during the quarter. However, our overall results were not immune to the customer pricing concessions we gave in the first quarter. 
In the United Arab Emirates, drilling and production-related activity increased as work on the SARB North island project ramped up and with further rig additions expected over the coming quarters. 
Drilling activity was also stronger and Kuwait as the rig count increased in line with the country's strategic production targets while unique land seismic activity grew with the improved operational productivity. 
In Iraq, revenues in the North declined further in the second quarter while activity in the South country remained flat sequentially, but is expected increase in the second half of the year on the back of recent contract wins. 
In Southeast Asia, activity fell in Australia as projects were completed both on land and offshore while activity in Malaysia declined as customer budget reductions affected both OpEx and CapEx investment. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially while pretax operating margins improved 81 basis points to 22.3%. Revenue was impacted once again by decreasing activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, however, somewhat offset by increased activity in Venezuela. Year-on-year revenue decreased 17% and margins grew by 111 basis points. 
In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly in the second quarter on further customer budget cuts that impacted both onshore and offshore activity. And in spite of new contract wins for both seismic and integrated well construction, the outlook for the second half of the year remains challenging. At the same time, the energy reform continues to progress on plan with the first major license award being announced in the third quarter. 
Offshore activity in Brazil remained weak with the deepwater rig count being down significantly versus the first quarter while in Colombia the activity slowdown continued and now affects all product line. 
In the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarkets, increased activity was driven by exploration work in Suriname and Guyana while joint ventures in the Faja region of Venezuela continued to ramp up. 
Elsewhere in South America, revenue in Argentina remained resilient as growth in conventional activity partially offset pricing pressure for unconventional services. At the same time, SPM activity remained strong in Ecuador as the Shushufindi project continued to perform in line with expectations and with activity and production starting up on the new Camana [ph] SPM project. 
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 5% sequentially with margins edging off by 29 basis points to 21.3%. Year-on-year, revenue decreased 26% and margins dropped by 85 basis points. 
Within the area, revenue increased in Russia and Central Asia driven by the seasonal recovery of conventional land activity and as the ruble strengthened somewhat. 
In the North Sea, the shift from exploration to development-related activity continued while customer budget pressure both in the U.K. and Norway resulted in lower sales of new technology. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially as customer budget pressure resulted in several active rigs being demobilized. 
And in Algeria, activity was slightly up sequentially while work in Libya was limited as the security situation remained very challenging. 
1 year ago, at our 2014 Investor Conference, we told you about our transformation program, which is designed to provide a new approach to how we run our business in order to enable fundamentally better performance. Our transformation leverages the drivers of technology innovation, equipment reliability, process efficiency and system integration, all together delivering better management of costs, better quality of product and service delivery and better generation of free cash flow. 
While we set goals for new technologies and increasing element of service integration, we also target a tenfold reduction in customer nonproductive time, a doubling in asset utilization, a 25% reduction in inventory days, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of unit support costs. I am very pleased with the progress we have made 1 year later. 
While the transformation was designed to deliver our performance in any part of the cycle, the current market conditions have enabled us to increase customer dialogue and to accelerate the program throughout our global organization. The strength of our International margin so far this year is one demonstration of the performance impact from our transformation while the resilience in our North American margins is another proof point. 
In terms of costs, our figures show that we are managing all aspects very well including both fixed and variable compensation as well as the cost of product and service delivery. 
In terms of quality, the investments we have made in training, new technology and our enabling systems are now really starting to pay off as can be seen by our second quarter quality results where we set a new record low in terms of nonproductive time incurred for our customers. 
Last, in terms of cash, the reduction in CapEx intensity and the discipline we have shown with respect to managing working capital have delivered a very strong free cash flow in the first half of the year with a cash conversion rate of 98%, including severance payment, which is well above our 75% target. 
Turning now to the overall outlook for the second half of the year. Visibility still remains limited, however, some tentative signs of change are emerging. 
On the supply side of the oil market, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high-cost producers is still playing out with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show. Within OPEC, production in the second quarter was at the highest level for 3 years as marketed supply was again increased at the expense of lower core spare capacity, which in June dropped to 2.3 million barrels per day. 
In addition to this, non-NAM, non-OPEC production weakened in the first half of the year by 650,000 barrels per day driven by Brazil and Mexico with a further softening expected in the second half of the year as the lower investment levels in many regions start to take full effect. 
Against these supply figures, global oil demand growth continues to strengthen with the IEA having revised its 2015 estimate up to 1.4 million barrels per day during the second quarter. These factors all point to a potential tightening in the global supply-demand balance in the coming quarters. 
Turning to our industry. The largest drop in E&P investments is, as expected, occurring in North America where 2015 spend will now largely be down by more than 35% driven by both pricing and activity on land. We do believe that the North American rig count has now reached bottom, but that we will only see a slow increase in drilling and completion activity in the second half of the year, which will not make any material dent in the massive overcapacity that has been created. This again means that there would be little to no improvement in pricing levels, and hence, the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future. 
In the International market, E&P spending is now expected to fall more than 15% driven by lower activity in most regions and further amplified by a very strong dollar, in particular, versus the Russian ruble and the Venezuelan bolivar. 
Given the nature of the business in the International markets, we do not expect any upward adjustment to existing customer budgets for the second half of 2015. Instead, we see a continuation of the trends from the first half with very low exploration activity, tight management of development-related spend and continued pricing pressure for our products and services. 
However, we do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016 both for exploration and development-related activity. 
In the midst of the current market challenges, we remain focused on the things we can control, including our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide to our customers. The success of this approach is enabling us to maintain solid International margins despite a significant drop in activity and at the same time also allowing us to maximize our performance in North America. 
We remain very confident in our capacity to weather the current downturn better than our surroundings and also significantly better than what we have done in previous downturns. Our global strength, our technology differentiation and our accelerated corporate transformation is creating a great platform for us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity to deliver unmatched levels of free cash flow. And at the same time, this financial strength positions us well to take advantage of increasing market opportunities, resulting from the current market environment. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for Q&A."

As to our ability to offset this, the transformation and the general way that we are managing the company and the focus we have on cost and resource management, through this, we are going to continue to create a financial leverage over the coming years and we are going to take that leverage out in two forms: we will take it out through market share gains by being able to be even more competitive on price; and secondly, we'll take the other part out through very strong incrementals when we grow, or alternatively, very strong decrements when we shrink.

We are accelerating the impact from it. And we see this leverage as something that we will continuously take out in the coming years. So fundamentally, I think, the performance that we are posting is sustainable. It's not going to be a straight line, but overall, what we are doing now is not a fluke."

So I think I would mention two specific things here. I think, firstly, what is very positive at this stage is that customers are more and more starting to buy in to the fact that we have technologies and workflows that can create more value. That is what we've been investing in for the past 5 years and that is how we wanted to try to create technical differentiation in the largely commoditized North American market. So with the dialogues we have with customers, both on geoengineered completions, on refracturing in terms of more sophisticated fracturing fluid systems like BroadBand, it is very clear that the appetite to use new technology and more sophisticated technology is growing. Now some of the customers would take on that technology on a more of a standard type of contract where we will still get a premium over what basic commodity type of technologies we'll give while other customers will also like to go into a more risk-based contract setup. We are fine either way. We are looking to create technology differentiation and I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to push that forward in the coming quarters even in this business environment."

In terms of the deepwater project, I think, yes, there are some projects that are being delayed and some projects being canceled, if possible. But I think in general, these are long-term investments. Many of them are already deeply committed. So we don't see any kind of dramatic impact at this stage on the projects that are in the pipeline. Now going forward, in terms of sanctioning new projects, I think it's going to be very important for the industry to be able to -- the service industry, together with our customers, to be able to come up with technical solutions and field development plan that significantly reduces cost per barrel. And if we can do that, which is the overall objective for the industry, I think we can make many of the pending deepwater projects also economically viable in the future."

So obviously, we had a clean quarter this quarter. There are no charges in it. So this is basically straight-line business performance in the second quarter. And like you said, the overall impact on transformation, which we started several years earlier in North America is part of driving this. We started that transformation and reorganization back in 2010. I would say, our North American organization has also been a very proactive when it comes to cost and resource management. And as we just talked about earlier on one of the questions there, the uptake of new technology, both in North America and International, the rate of uptake, given the downturn, is actually quite strong and actually much higher than what we have seen in any previous downturns. So I think on that come down to the fact that a lot of the technologies, new technologies we now have out, have very clear cost and efficiency angles to them, which means that they sell equally easy in the downturn as they do in the upturn."

We could potentially start seeing something towards the second half of '16 if there is a kind of a gradual uptick of the oil price to at least, plus/minus $70. But nothing on the horizon as we see it today. It's still a very tough market and we see this very, very clearly in some of our key high-tech product lines where our exploration revenue over the past 6 quarters has actually dropped by 35%. So I don't think we are too far away from bottom because it's not that much left to cut. But the comeback, I think, is still a little bit out in time. But if you look at the level of spend today versus what is required for the industry to replace reserves and to find new oil field development, we're obviously way under investing.

Now if you look at Q1, we saw a 19% sequential decline. In Q2, we saw a 12% sequential decline in revenue. So for the third quarter, we expect something in the range of 5%, 6% further decline in sequential revenue. Now if you look at the two main parts of the world: in North America, we do expect a slight increase on activity on land. But again, we see this being offset by weakening also offshore activity and further pricing pressure both on land and offshore. And internationally, no major change. We think the overall weak activity is going to continue and also there's going to be sustained pricing pressure. In addition, we have the slowing down of activity for part of Q3 in the Middle East and also the maintenance season in the North Sea. Now if you look at this cycle, so far, we have proactively managed costs to protect margins. And I think we've demonstrated that we are pretty quick on our feet and we can manage this very, very well. At this stage, our structural costs and our field capacity is really tailored to our Q2 activity level. But for now, we have decided to preserve our current structure for Q3 and this is in order to be ready for increased activity as we go forward. So provided that this is for a limited period of time, we are prepared to live with the temporary margin impact that carrying these slightly elevated levels of resources is going to have. It's not going to be a huge impact on margins, but it's going to be a little bit more than what we could have managed if we were to cut even deeper. So if you look at EPS, it's going to come down in Q3 and I think the current consensus of $0.77 is a pretty realistic number."

I don't want to be too presumptuous, but then I would assume that you wouldn't want to sit for too much longer than 1 quarter with some sort of a margin drag. So can we maybe infer from your comments you're expecting an increase in activity, generally speaking, in the fourth quarter, that'd be for North America and then maybe International as soon as the first quarter of next year?"

We decided to be rather decisive in rightsizing the workforce for the downturn we are facing and that includes both rightsizing and streamlining the support structure as well as the fleet capacity. So I think what you can read into the comments on the fact that we are prepared to carry slightly more costs into Q3 and this is not a significant part, it's slightly more. That is that we are, indeed, looking to be ready for growth in activity. Now I can't say 100% certain that it's going to come in Q4 or Q1, but what we are saying is that we believe we are getting close to bottom. We believe that we have demonstrated very clearly our ability to manage costs and resources. And in the event the upturn is a couple of quarters away, we are prepared to carry the costs and I think that would be a much better management of our resources to enable us to be well prepared and positioned for the growth. And in the event it's pushed out a bit more, we can also do further adjustments. That's relatively easy, we've shown that we can do it. So yes, you can infer that we are looking and searching for the uptake and that we think that we are pretty close to bottom."

We will internationally as well carry, I would say, slightly more resources than what is necessary for the third quarter. We see revenue coming down still a little bit from the second quarter level and we could have shed some more resources to be prepared for that. I think the only reason why the margins would come down, I would say, in general, would be that we are carrying slightly more resources. There is also further pricing effect that comes into it. But obviously, offsetting this is the continued impact from transformation, right? So I would say, if we decided to go forward and completely align resources to activity, we should be able to absorb a large part of the pricing. I think the way we're going now, you could potentially see a little bit of margin drop in Q3, but that will be more by design, the fact that we are willing to carry a bit more resources rather than not being able to effectively maintain it."

So before we close, I'd like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the market evolution in the second quarter was the continuation of what we saw in the first quarter with North America land rig count falling further and with pricing pressure increasing in both North America and International markets. In response to this, we have proactively managed what remains under our control and subsequently delivered our best cost and cash performance so far in any downturn. 
Second, our strong performance has been amplified by the acceleration of our transformation program, which is being actively implemented throughout our global organization and which has enabled us to increase pretax operating margins in the International Areas and maintain double-digit margins in North America. 
Third, we believe that we now have seen the bottom of the rig count decline in North America and that North America land activity will see a slow increase in the second half of this year while service pricing is expected to decline further in the third quarter as the fight for market share continues to play out. In the International markets, we expect no upwards revision to E&P CapEx spend for the remainder of the 2015 as the trend of lower exploration activity, tight management of development spend and sustained pricing pressure is likely still to continue. 
Based on this, the third quarter could potentially represent the bottom of the cycle in terms of earnings per share as the pace of the revenue drop is set to slow and as we continue our steadfast efforts to maximize operating margins in both North America and international markets. And with the streamlining of our cost and resource base undertaken in the past 9 months, together with the acceleration of our transformation program, we remain very optimistic about our ability to deliver unmatched incremental margins as soon as E&P investments start to show any signs of growth. That concludes today's call. Thank you very much for attending."

Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $0.88. This represents decreases of $0.18 sequentially and $0.49 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our second quarter revenue of $9 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margins only declined by 49 basis points sequentially. This resulted in decremental margins of just 23%, which is a result of continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. 
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.4 billion decreased 5% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by Wireline and Testing as a result of lower exploration spending. Pretax operating margins decreased 84 basis points to 26.5% as the impact of the lower exploration activities was offset by increased higher-margin software sales. 
Drilling Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 11%, primarily due to the further significant drop in the North America rig count. Margins remained resilient at 19.5% as a strong cost management limited the margin decline to only 44 basis points.
Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 18% sequentially as both activity and pricing for pressure pumping services in North America fell dramatically. Despite the severe revenue decline, margins only fell by 179 basis points to 12.8%. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.1% in the second quarter. This was essentially flat when compared to the previous quarter. 
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the second quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first half of 2015, we have generated $4.1 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $200 million during the second quarter and almost $0.5 billion during the first 6 months of the year. 
Net debt increased $111 million during the quarter to $5.6 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $520 million to repurchase 5.8 million shares at an average price of $90 per share. 
We spent $587 million on CapEx during the second quarter. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.

Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the rig count decline accelerated and by further pricing erosion in both",2591,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the rig count decline accelerated and by further pricing erosion in both North America and the International Area. North America revenue fell 27% sequentially while International revenue was 5% lower as customer budget cuts and pricing concessions impacted results for a full quarter. 
Despite the challenging market conditions, overall pretax operating margins were maintained well above the levels of previous downturns as we continue to proactively manage costs and resources, carefully navigate the commercial landscape and further accelerate our transformation program throughout the organization. The success of this approach can be seen in a double-digit pretax operating margin in North America and an International margin of 24.5%, which is 35 basis points up sequentially and 44 basis points up year-over-year. 
In the first half of 2015, year-over-year revenue has now dropped 26% in North America and 14% Internationally. These levels exceed those of the 2009 downturn in both pace and size. Still, we have delivered first half decremental margins of 37% in North America and just 18% in the International Area. These decremental margins represent a marked improvement over equivalent figures from the last downturn, which were in excess of 70%, particularly as we begin to approach what we believe is the market bottom. 
While the market remains tough, we also believe we have been successful in adapting to a rapidly changing situation as far as the size of our workforce is concerned. The absence of charges in the second quarter is evidence of this as the adjustments made in the second quarter were absorbed in our normal operating costs. 
In terms of corporate financial performance, we also generated almost $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter. This figure, which represents a conversion rate of 132% of the quarter's earnings into free cash flow, demonstrates our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions. 
Looking at our results on a geographical basis. North American revenue decreased 27% sequentially as figure greater than the 25% sequential decrease seen in the first quarter and again significantly lower than the fall in the land rig count, which was down 40% sequentially in North America land. In spite of this drop, operating margins in North America decreased by only 268 basis points sequentially, leaving our margins 465 basis points higher than the same period of the 2009 downturn. 
The strength of this performance was underpinned by our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing impact of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management, all together limiting the sequential decremental margins to 20%. 
In U.S. land, activity was down in all basins in the second quarter with the rig count dropping below 860 for most of the month of June. In addition to the significant reduction in rig count, poor weather conditions with floods in Texas, Arkansas and Alaska also drove activity lower in the second quarter. The dramatic reduction in activity in U.S. land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels, in particular for pressure pumping where many companies now are desperately fighting to survive. 
Our approach to the market remained unchanged in the second quarter where we concentrate our activity in core areas and for key customers, and where we're beyond this, proceed with stacking of equipment rather than operating with large losses. 
We continue to maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term service capacity, and we are working closely with our customers to help reduce cost per barrel through better operational efficiency and reliability and through the application of new technology, workflows and business models. Based on this approach, we will ramp up our activity for opportunities that bring the required returns. 
The strength of our technology portfolio, the range of our workflow solutions and the depth of our shale understanding also enables us to pursue performance-based contracts where we initially underwrite the incremental cost of our technology and where we recover this cost plus the performance upside from incremental well production. 
In Western Canada, activity was also down significantly in the second quarter with the rig count falling by 66% sequentially, impacted by the early spring breakup and with the recovery expected to be limited during the summer months. 
Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater rig activity was down in the second quarter, and activity was also impacted by loop currents while pack ice off Eastern Canada also impacted our drilling and seismic operations in the second quarter. Offshore revenue was further impacted by the expected shift in service mix from exploration to development and completions as well as increasing pricing pressure. However, the primary driver for offshore success continues to be risk reduction and project performance and we are therefore fully engaged with our customers to help reduce overall AFE costs through better project planning and execution. 
In the International markets, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, driven by further budget cuts from our customers as well as further pricing concession. For the first half of the year, revenue has now dropped 14% compared to last year, a figure that is more than double the 5% fall experienced over the same time frame in the 2009 downturn. Second quarter operating margins at 24.5% was up 35 basis points sequentially and 44 basis points year-over-year as first half decremental margins were held to 18% compared to 73% over the same period in the 2009 downturn. 
These results fully demonstrate our leadership in the International markets, which is built on flawless execution from the entire organization, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program focused on workforce productivity, asset utilization and reduction in unit support costs. 
In this environment, we focus on carefully balancing market share growth with protection of operating margin and by negotiating pricing concessions in return for additional work, integration opportunities or improved contract terms, knowing from experience that any permanent pricing concessions that we make will be very hard to recover even as market conditions improve. 
Within the International Areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 5% sequentially while pretax operating margins improved 8 basis points to 28.7%. Activity remained robust in the GCC region. However, strength in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was not sufficient to offset weakness in the Asia Pacific region. Year-on-year revenue decreased by 13% while margins expanded by 87 basis points. 
In the Middle East region, our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia continued to gain momentum during the quarter. However, our overall results were not immune to the customer pricing concessions we gave in the first quarter. 
In the United Arab Emirates, drilling and production-related activity increased as work on the SARB North island project ramped up and with further rig additions expected over the coming quarters. 
Drilling activity was also stronger and Kuwait as the rig count increased in line with the country's strategic production targets while unique land seismic activity grew with the improved operational productivity. 
In Iraq, revenues in the North declined further in the second quarter while activity in the South country remained flat sequentially, but is expected increase in the second half of the year on the back of recent contract wins. 
In Southeast Asia, activity fell in Australia as projects were completed both on land and offshore while activity in Malaysia declined as customer budget reductions affected both OpEx and CapEx investment. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially while pretax operating margins improved 81 basis points to 22.3%. Revenue was impacted once again by decreasing activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, however, somewhat offset by increased activity in Venezuela. Year-on-year revenue decreased 17% and margins grew by 111 basis points. 
In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly in the second quarter on further customer budget cuts that impacted both onshore and offshore activity. And in spite of new contract wins for both seismic and integrated well construction, the outlook for the second half of the year remains challenging. At the same time, the energy reform continues to progress on plan with the first major license award being announced in the third quarter. 
Offshore activity in Brazil remained weak with the deepwater rig count being down significantly versus the first quarter while in Colombia the activity slowdown continued and now affects all product line. 
In the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarkets, increased activity was driven by exploration work in Suriname and Guyana while joint ventures in the Faja region of Venezuela continued to ramp up. 
Elsewhere in South America, revenue in Argentina remained resilient as growth in conventional activity partially offset pricing pressure for unconventional services. At the same time, SPM activity remained strong in Ecuador as the Shushufindi project continued to perform in line with expectations and with activity and production starting up on the new Camana [ph] SPM project. 
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 5% sequentially with margins edging off by 29 basis points to 21.3%. Year-on-year, revenue decreased 26% and margins dropped by 85 basis points. 
Within the area, revenue increased in Russia and Central Asia driven by the seasonal recovery of conventional land activity and as the ruble strengthened somewhat. 
In the North Sea, the shift from exploration to development-related activity continued while customer budget pressure both in the U.K. and Norway resulted in lower sales of new technology. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially as customer budget pressure resulted in several active rigs being demobilized. 
And in Algeria, activity was slightly up sequentially while work in Libya was limited as the security situation remained very challenging. 
1 year ago, at our 2014 Investor Conference, we told you about our transformation program, which is designed to provide a new approach to how we run our business in order to enable fundamentally better performance. Our transformation leverages the drivers of technology innovation, equipment reliability, process efficiency and system integration, all together delivering better management of costs, better quality of product and service delivery and better generation of free cash flow. 
While we set goals for new technologies and increasing element of service integration, we also target a tenfold reduction in customer nonproductive time, a doubling in asset utilization, a 25% reduction in inventory days, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of unit support costs. I am very pleased with the progress we have made 1 year later. 
While the transformation was designed to deliver our performance in any part of the cycle, the current market conditions have enabled us to increase customer dialogue and to accelerate the program throughout our global organization. The strength of our International margin so far this year is one demonstration of the performance impact from our transformation while the resilience in our North American margins is another proof point. 
In terms of costs, our figures show that we are managing all aspects very well including both fixed and variable compensation as well as the cost of product and service delivery. 
In terms of quality, the investments we have made in training, new technology and enabling systems are now really starting to pay off as can be seen by our second quarter quality results where we set a new record low in terms of nonproductive time incurred for our customers. 
Last, in terms of cash, the reduction in CapEx intensity and the discipline we have shown with respect to managing working capital have delivered a very strong free cash flow in the first half of the year with a cash conversion rate of 98%, including severance payment, which is well above our 75% target. 
Turning now to the overall outlook for the second half of the year. Visibility still remains limited, however, some tentative signs of change are emerging. 
On the supply side of the oil market, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high-cost producers is still playing out with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show. Within OPEC, production in the second quarter was at the highest level for 3 years as marketed supply was again increased at the expense of lower core spare capacity, which in June dropped to 2.3 million barrels per day. 
In addition to this, non-NAM, non-OPEC production weakened in the first half of the year by 650,000 barrels per day driven by Brazil and Mexico with a further softening expected in the second half of the year as the lower investment levels in many regions start to take full effect. 
Against these supply figures, global oil demand growth continues to strengthen with the IEA having revised its 2015 estimate up to 1.4 million barrels per day during the second quarter. These factors all point to a potential tightening in the global supply-demand balance in the coming quarters. 
Turning to our industry. The largest drop in E&P investments is, as expected, occurring in North America where 2015 spend will now largely be down by more than 35% driven by both pricing and activity on land. We do believe that the North American rig count has now reached bottom, but that we will only see a slow increase in drilling and completion activity in the second half of the year, which will not make any material dent in the massive overcapacity that has been created. This again means that there would be little to no improvement in pricing levels, and hence, the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future. 
In the International market, E&P spending is now expected to fall more than 15% driven by lower activity in most regions and further amplified by a very strong dollar, in particular, versus the Russian ruble and the Venezuelan bolivar. 
Given the nature of the business in the International markets, we do not expect any upward adjustment to existing customer budgets for the second half of 2015. Instead, we see a continuation of the trends from the first half with very low exploration activity, tight management of development-related spend and continued pricing pressure for our products and services. 
However, we do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016 both for exploration and development-related activity. 
In the midst of the current market challenges, we remain focused on the things we can control, including our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide to our customers. The success of this approach is enabling us to maintain solid International margins despite a significant drop in activity and at the same time also allowing us to maximize our performance in North America. 
We remain very confident in our capacity to weather the current downturn better than our surroundings and also significantly better than what we have done in previous downturns. Our global strength, our technology differentiation and our accelerated corporate transformation is creating a great platform for us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity to deliver unmatched levels of free cash flow. And at the same time, this financial strength positions us well to take advantage of increasing market opportunities, resulting from the current market environment. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for Q&A."

We've been saying now, I think, for a number of quarters that we see solid oil demand growth, and again, this was revised upwards again this year to 1.4 million barrels during the second quarter. And we've also said that with a certain lag, the large cuts in E&P investments are going to show up in the supply numbers and we see it, in particular, in non-NAM and OPEC, which has showed a gradual weakening over the first 6 months of this year, U.S. monthly sequential production is flattening and the core OPEC spare capacity was also down to only 2.3 million barrels in June -- million barrels per day. So I think the tightening that we've been foreshadowing, we are still relatively confident that, that would happen in the second half of the year."

There's going to be impact in both regions in Q3 beyond where we are in Q2, but I think that is relatively larger in North America. 
As to our ability to offset this, the transformation and the general way that we are managing the company and the focus we have on cost and resource management, through this, we are going to continue to create a financial leverage over the coming years and we are going to take that leverage out in two forms: we will take it out through market share gains by being able to be even more competitive on price; and secondly, we'll take the other part out through very strong incrementals when we grow, or alternatively, very strong decrementals when we shrink. So what we talked about in 2014 at the Investor Day in terms of what the transformation represents for the company, say, in the next 5-year horizon, it is there. We are accelerating the impact from it. And we see this leverage as something that we will continuously take out in the coming years. So fundamentally, I think, the performance that we are posting is sustainable. It's not going to be a straight line, but overall, what we are doing now is not a fluke."

So with the dialogues we have with customers, both on geoengineered completions, on refracturing and in terms of more sophisticated fracturing fluid systems like BroadBand, it is very clear that the appetite to use new technology and more sophisticated technology is growing. Now some of the customers would take on that technology on a more of a standard type of contract where we will still get a premium over what basic commodity type of technologies will give. While other customers will also like to go into a more risk-based contract setup. We are fine either way. We are looking to create technology differentiation and I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to push that forward in the coming quarters even in this business environment."

Many of them are already deeply committed. So we don't see any kind of dramatic impact at this stage on the projects that are in the pipeline. Now going forward, in terms of sanctioning new projects, I think it's going to be very important for the industry to be able to -- the service industry, together with our customers, to be able to come up with technical solutions and field development plans that significantly reduces cost per barrel.

We started that transformation and reorganization back in 2010. I would say, our North American organization has also been a very proactive when it comes to cost and resource management. And as we just talked about earlier on one of the questions there, the uptake of new technology, both in North America and International, the rate of uptake, given the downturn, is actually quite strong and actually much higher than what we have seen in any previous downturns. So I think on that come down to the fact that a lot of the technologies -- new technologies we now have out, have very clear cost and efficiency angles to them, which means that they sell equally easy in the downturn as they do in the upturn."

We could potentially start seeing something towards the second half of '16 if there is a kind of a gradual uptick of the oil price to at least, plus/minus $70. But nothing on the horizon as we see it today. It's still a very tough market and we see this very, very clearly in some of our key high-tech product lines where our exploration revenue over the past 6 quarters has actually dropped by 35%. So I don't think we are too far away from bottom because it's not that much left to cut. But the comeback, I think, is still a little bit out in time.

So this is not a sustainable situation. So the uptick will have to come. It's just that we don't see it on the immediate horizon."

Now this is slightly lower than the 25% target that we laid out last year. But given where we are in the cycle, this is dramatically higher than what we had seen in any previous cycle, right? So yes, we are selling significantly higher rate of new technology in this part of the cycle versus previous. And as I said earlier, this is down to, I think, the fact that we have a very flush new technology portfolio and offering. And I think we have been doing a better job in clearly demonstrating to our customers what these new technologies bring in terms of lower cost per barrel, in terms of efficiency, in terms of higher production. And this is again why I think the uptake, although it's slightly down from where it was in the second half of 2014, it is still holding up very, very well."

So in terms of revenue, we expect that the sequential drop is going to slow in Q3 and it could potentially  represent bottom when it comes to revenue. Now if you look at Q1, we saw a 19% sequential decline. In Q2, we saw a 12% sequential decline in revenue. So for the third quarter, we expect something in the range of 5%, 6% further decline in sequential revenue. Now if you look at the two main parts of the world: in North America, we do expect a slight increase on activity on land. But again, we see this being offset by weakening also offshore activity and further pricing pressure both on land and offshore. And internationally, no major change. We think the overall weak activity is going to continue and also there's going to be sustained pricing pressure. In addition, we have the slowing down of activity for part of Q3 in the Middle East and also the maintenance season in the North Sea. Now if you look at this cycle, so far, we have proactively managed costs to protect margins. And I think we've demonstrated that we are pretty quick on our feet and we can manage this very, very well. At this stage, our structural costs and our field capacity is really tailored to our Q2 activity level. But for now, we have decided to preserve our current structure for Q3 and this is in order to be ready for increased activity as we go forward. So provided that this is for a limited period of time, we are prepared to live with the temporary margin impact that carrying these slightly elevated levels of resources is going to have. It's not going to be a huge impact on margins, but it's going to be a little bit more than what we could have managed if we were to cut even deeper. So if you look at EPS, it's going to come down in Q3 and I think the current consensus of $0.77 is a pretty realistic number."

In terms of geography, you see it more or less everywhere, both on land and offshore actually, but we've seen it in some of the large markets in Latin America, Sub-Sahara Africa, the North Sea.

So before we close, I'd like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the market evolution in the second quarter was the continuation of what we saw in the first quarter with North America land rig count falling further and with pricing pressure increasing in both North America and International markets. In response to this, we have proactively managed what remains under our control and subsequently delivered our best cost and cash performance so far in any downturn. 
Second, our strong performance has been amplified by the acceleration of our transformation program, which is being actively implemented throughout our global organization and which has enabled us to increase pretax operating margins in the International Areas and maintain double-digit margins in North America. 
Third, we believe that we now have seen the bottom of the rig count decline in North America and that North America land activity will see a slow increase in the second half of this year while service pricing is expected to decline further in the third quarter as the fight for market share continues to play out. In the International markets, we expect no upwards revision to E&P CapEx spend for the remainder of the 2015 as the trend of lower exploration activity, tight management of development spend and sustained pricing pressure is likely still to continue. 
Based on this, the third quarter could potentially represent the bottom of the cycle in terms of earnings per share as the pace of the revenue drop is set to slow and as we continue our steadfast efforts to maximize operating margins in both North America and international markets. And with the streamlining of our cost and resource base undertaken in the past 9 months, together with the acceleration of our transformation program, we remain very optimistic about our ability to deliver unmatched incremental margins as soon as E&P investments start to show any signs of growth. That concludes today's call. Thank you very much for attending."

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. .
Third quarter earnings per share was $0.78. This represent decreases of $0.10 sequentially and $0.71 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion decreased 6% sequentially. Almost 40% of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pretax operating margins only declined by 101 basis points sequentially. This was due to the continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. 
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 5% sequentially, as decreases in exploration spending impacted both Wireline and Testing Services internationally. Despite the revenue decline, pretax margin -- operating margins remained essentially flat at 26.3%. 
Drilling Group revenue of $3.3 billion decreased 7% primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 94 basis points to 18.6%. 
Production Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 5% sequentially, while margins declined 173 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by pricing and activity declines in West services. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 20% in the third quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 1 percentage point due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world as well as the mix of earnings amongst the International GeoMarkets. 
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first 3 quarters of 2015, we have generated $6.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $150 million during the third quarter and $600 million during the first 9 months of the year. Net debt improved $400 million during the quarter to $5.2 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $545 million to repurchase 6.9 million shares at an average price of $78.76. Subsequent to the announcement of our transaction with Cameron in August, we have been repurchasing the maximum number of shares allowable under the SEC's regulations. 
We filed our S-4 registration statement relating to the acquisition 2 weeks ago today. It's worth highlighting that once the SEC declares our registration statement, effective and the proxy statement is mailed, we will be prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our stock until the Cameron shareholder vote. 
We spent $590 million on CapEx during the third quarter. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal."
301966,310708854,877437,"Schlumberger Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger third quarter revenue fell 6% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. North America revenue fell 4% sequent",2313,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger third quarter revenue fell 6% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. 
North America revenue fell 4% sequentially as we maintain focus on balancing margins and market share, while International revenue was 7% lower as customer budget cuts and service pricing erosion impacted results. Still in the midst of what may well turn out to be the most severe downturn in several decades, our operating margins were maintained at levels much higher than in previous downturns. 
In North America, pretax operating margins were held at 8.9% in spite of an additional drop in activity and pricing, both offshore and on-land, while  the International margins dropped to 23.7% as customer budget cuts, activity cancellations and lower service pricing took further effect. 
In the first 9 months of 2015, year-over-year revenue has dropped 34% in North America and 18% internationally, yet we have delivered 9-month of decremental operating margins of 34% in North America and 23% internationally, which represent a strong performance improvement over the 2009 downturn. 
We have delivered these results by proactively and decisively managing our cost and resource base, carefully navigating the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share and, at the same time, accelerating our internal transformation program. 
We also generated more than $1.7 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, which represents a conversion rate of 170% of the quarter's earnings. Our ability to generate significant free cash flow even in this part of the cycle is a major competitive edge, which we actively use to pursue new business opportunities as well as targeted M&A activity. 
In terms of M&A, our main focus in recent months has been the proposed acquisition of Cameron announced on August 26, which will open up a significant growth opportunity for us as we look to establish the industry's first complete drilling and production systems, spanning both the surface and the subsurface. In addition, we also completed the acquisition of Houston-based T&T Engineering, which specializes in design of land rig systems as well as Utah-based Novatek, which is the leader in the field of synthetic diamond innovations. 
We also signed a letter of intent for a joint venture with the part of the Bauer Group from Germany in the further evolution of our Land Rig of the Future strategy. And finally, we entered into an agreement with IBM to jointly provide integrated production of services, combining our production software platform with IBM's enterprise asset management services in an end-to-end offering. 
Looking at our results on a geographical basis. North American revenue decreased 4% sequentially, a figure considerably less than the 27% sequential decrease seen in the second quarter and better than the 7% drop in the average horizontal rig count. On-land, the revenue growth was driven by lower hydraulic fracturing activity and additional pricing pressure for both products and services. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, revenue declined on lower multiclient seismic sales, exploration rigs transferring the drilling and publishing activities as well as pricing concessions, which were partly offset by higher new technology sales. 
In Western Canada, rig count almost doubled sequentially, following the early spring breakup, but was still down by roughly 52% year-over-year. In spite of these headwinds, operating margins in North America decreased by only 136 basis points sequentially to 8.9%, and this strong performance is a direct result of our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing effects of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management. 
As service pricing in U.S. land fell further in the third quarter, we continued our approach of concentrating activity in core areas and for key customers while proceeding to stack equipment rather than operating at a loss. 
In the rare event we select to pursue work at what we consider noncommercial prices, we view this as an investment decision and apply the same justification and approval process used for any other reinvestment we do in our business. This has led us to move equipment and crews between basins as we look to balance market share with margins and as we pursue new technology opportunities. 
We believe that this approach has enabled us to protect our profitability in North America land and has also helped us maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term ability to service our customers in this market. 
In the International markets, revenue declined 7% sequentially due to further customer budget cuts, rapidly changing activity, driven by disruptions, delays and cancellations as well as by further pricing concessions. Third quarter International operating margins of 23.7% was down 72 basis points sequentially and 83 basis points year-over-year. Our 9-month decremental margins were still held to 23%, which represents a marked improvement over the 61% from the corresponding period in the 2009 downturn, which is a testament to both the strength of our International business and how well our organization is executing. 
Within the International Areas, Middle East & Asia revenue declined by 8% sequentially, while pretax operating margins decreased 171 basis points to 27%. Activity in the Middle East remained robust during the quarter, particularly in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, but pricing concessions, changes to the activity mix as well as project delays had a negative impact on revenue and profitability. 
Year-over-year, area revenue decreased 20%, while margins dropped by 61 basis points. Our lump sum turn-key project in Saudi Arabia continued to progress well, and with steady improvement in drilling efficiency, well deliveries are now ahead of planned levels. In the United Arab Emirates, robust drilling production and seismic activity was boosted by further rig additions, and we also recorded strong sales of Petrel and ECLIPSE software. Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait as rig count increased. However, this was partially offset by operational delays and an activity shutdown in the [indiscernible] zone. 
In Iraq, we mobilized 2 rigs for the Sabriyah lump sum turn-key project with the first well already completed, while revenue from the other operations in the country remained flat with the second quarter. 
In Southeast Asia, activity was lower throughout the region, driven by a further drop in work offshore Australia as projects ended, lower rig count in Malaysia, reduced deepwater exploration and development work in the South China Sea and continuing NOC budget cuts on-land in China. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pretax operating margins fell 159 basis points to 20.7%. 
In Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, activity was further hit by a combination of delays and budget reductions, while Columbia was weaker due to increased pricing pressure. These effects were, however, partially offset by steady activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. 
Year-over-year, area revenue decreased 30%, and operating margins decreased by 120 basis points. 
In Mexico, revenue dropped again in the third quarter and now stands at an 8-year low, as the significant budget cuts further impacted activity and profitability. At the same time, we began multiclient seismic operations in the Gulf of [indiscernible], and awards for the second and third license rounds of the Energy Reform Act remained on schedule. 
Offshore activity continued to decline in Brazil, and budget reductions impacted both equipment rentals and operations. And in addition to this, revenue was also hit by the weakening of the real. 
In Venezuela, activity was steady for both [indiscernible] and for the heavy oil joint ventures in [indiscernible], while in Ecuador, SPM activity was flat as the [indiscernible] project continued to perform in line with expectations. 
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 6% sequentially, while pretax operating margins increased 92 basis points to 22.2%. Year-over-year revenue decreased 31%, and margins dropped by 125 basis points. 
Within the area, the bright spot in the third quarter was Russia & Central Asia, where revenue continued to increase with peak summer drilling activity in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This increase was, however, partially offset by a weaker ruble. 
In the North Sea, increased drilling in the U.K. sector was insufficient to counter lower activity in the remote areas and was further offset by reduced activity in Norway from project delays and cancellations as well as currency weakness. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity increased in Gabon in the third quarter but was considerably lower in the rest of the region, as operations were halted in [indiscernible], exploration work dropped to a new low in Angola and offshore projects were canceled in Nigeria. 
In Algeria Tanisha, activity was also down in the third quarter, while in Libya, our operations continues to be limited to one offshore rig. 
Turning next to the overall market outlook. We see 2 clear trends emerging. First, as we enter the last quarter of the year, the global oil market is still way down by fares of reduced growth in China and the timing and magnitude of additional Iranian exports. However, the fundamental balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid global GDP growth and by weakening supply, as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments start to take full effect. 
We expect this trend to continue, and as the oil markets try to recognize this magnitude of the industry's annual production replacement challenge, this will gradually translate into improvements in oil prices going forward. 
Second, in spite of the expected improvement in oil prices, the market outlook for oil fuel services looks challenging for the coming quarters, as we expect additional reductions in activity and further pressure on service pricing. This is driven by the financial pressure on many of our customers, where a year very low oil prices is now exhausting available cash flow and corresponding capital spending and also leading them to take a very conservative view on 2016 E&P budgets. 
In addition to this, the winter season will have a normal, negative impact on activity, which in the fourth quarter is unlikely to be offset by the usual year-end sales of software, products and multiclient licenses. 
Based on this industry outlook, we expect E&P investments to fall for a second successive year in 2016, which is the first time since the 1986 downturn when the spare capacity cushion was more than 10 million barrels per day. In spite of the need for the industry to increase investment levels to mitigate the pending impact on global supply, we instead see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between the expected improvement in oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investments and Oilfield Services activity. This timing gap will increase response time is a direct consequence of the dramatic cuts in E&P investments, which have clearly damaged the oil industry's financial strength and investment appetite as well as the operating capacity and capability. 
So while our macro view has not changed in terms of a tightening supply and demand balance and an expected improvement in oil prices, we have to factor in that the likely recovery in our activity levels now seems to be a 2017 event. 
We communicated in our previous earnings call that we were prepared to live with our existing cost base going forward, provided we were close to the bottom of the market and that the activity recovery was only a couple of quarters out. As a result, we carried our cost base forward into Q3, which have some negative impact on our operating margins. And we did not report any exceptional restructuring charges in the quarter. 
The likely timing gap between the oil price recovery and the subsequent increase in Oilfield Services activity, in combination with the more conservative spending outlook from our customers, is causing us to now take further action. 
We have, therefore, decided to proceed with a further round of capacity and overhead reductions, which will result in a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. This charge will cover severance costs for additional headcount reductions, reflecting both our updated activity outlook for 2016 and a further streamlining of our support structure. 
In addition and as part of our internal transformation program, we are now ready to initiate a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and as tradition network, which will also result in a charge in the fourth quarter. Here we will see some opportunities to streamline our engineering, manufacturing and sustaining infrastructure by consolidating sites into clusters, both in central locations and in the field, while at the same time, further modernize our processes by introducing state-of-the-art manufacturing automation, in line with the best companies in other high-tech industries. 
These changes to our manufacturing and distribution network are closely coordinated with the integration plans for Cameron, which are already well-advanced and which will be quickly implemented once the transaction has closed. 
So far in this downturn, we have proactively and effectively managed our cost and resource base, carefully navigated the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share, at the same time, as we have actively accelerated our internal transformation program. 
With the above actions, we are continuing this prudent approach with the aim of protecting and expanding our solid financial performance into 2016, which is shaping up to be another challenging year for the oil rigs services industry. 
We further believe our ability to respond to higher E&P investments and oilfield activity in 2017 will be improved by protecting our financial strength in 2016 rather than carrying excessive costs and inefficiencies as we await the recovery of the Oilfield Services market. 
Overall, we remain very confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. And through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our transformation program, we are creating a significant financial leverage that will enable us to increase market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

And we expect very limited year-end sales of product software and multiclient. So EPS will drop, but due to the lack of the visibility we have, I'm not really ready to commit to a number. But I would also say that Q1, in spite of Q4 not having this year-end sales, we also see Q1 being below Q4."

So there's a delay, I believe, between an improvement in oil prices and the decision to increase budgets.

So I think, there is -- the market is underestimating how long this period is going to take.

But obviously, we can accelerate and haven't even further impact on this as we close the transaction and take full management of OneSubsea. But I'm very pleased with the progress that OneSubsea has made and in the close working with we have with OneSubsea from the Schlumberger site. But if think over time and maybe not already in 2016, there is significant cost reduction potential in the -- for the deepwater, I think both when it comes to the well cost as well as for the overall infrastructure. I think we can simplify, we can standardize, we can engineer costs out of the system. And what that will allow, if you can bring reduce the cost by, say, 30%, you can potentially drill 4 wells for the price of 3, which again will help you increase production and recovery from the deepwater fields, which obviously will help the lower cost and improve the economics. So we are in a very we're early innings in terms of driving down costs for deepwater, both production and the drilling part of it. And I think what we are doing now with the Cameron acquisition is going to address both of those subdimensions."

So I'm expecting that even with still further headwinds in terms of top line in 2016, we should be able to continue to hold the decrementals at a very respectable level. Whether they're going to be at 23% or slightly higher, it is difficult to say. But in terms of offsetting activity reductions through cost-cutting, I think we've proven that we can do that. And beyond that, it is not much leverage we can generate from the transformation to offset pricing mix. So both of those are -- we are very active on trying to deliver both of those type of results.

Similarly, we are also looking to consolidate how we do global distribution, going more from a global and low-cost setup to a much more regional setup in terms of how we manage that.

Now in terms of multi-scaling, this is part of how we are continuing to drive people productivity. There is many other aspects of what we do there. We have remote operations as another key part of this as well, where we can centralize much more of our expertise and have them oversee more jobs centrally rather than being at the well site as well. So all of these elements are key part of the transformation program, and we are still not at the halfway point of rolling this out globally and for it to have the full impact on our operations and our results. So there's still a lot of runway left in both the multi-scaling, the remote operations and what we're going to do on manufacturing and distribution as well as all the other parts of the transformation.

First, while the business environment clearly got worse in the third quarter, our focus on cost management and transformation has enabled us to deliver strong financial performance and generate significantly liquidity, which is a clear competitive edge in this part of the cycle. Second, our forward visibility has again been reduced and we'll constantly revert back to managing the company quarter-by-quarter. This means for the capacity in overhead reductions in the fourth quarter as we adjust resources to a lower activity outlook. At the same time, we will continue to accelerate our transformation program, with the next step being a significant restructuring of our goal and manufacturing and distribution network, which will further monetize.
Of our company. And third, our outlook for the oil market remains unchanged, with the continuing tightening of the supply and demand balance as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments starts to take full effect, ultimately leading to an increasing oil prices. Given the conservative view, our customers are taking on 2016 investment levels and the generous state of industry following a year of low oil prices, , we see increasing likely to the timing gap between higher oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investments in oilfield activity. In this environment, we could see to proactively manage our business to preserve our financial strength in the 2016, which will allow us to better navigate the market uncertainty and to respond faster to new business opportunities and ultimately, higher activity.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.
Third quarter earnings per share was $0.78. These represent decreases of $0.10 sequentially and $0.71 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion decreased 6% sequentially. Almost 40% of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pretax operating margins only declined by 101 basis points sequentially. This was due to the continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. 
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 5% sequentially as decreases in exploration spending impacted both Wireline and Testing Services internationally. Despite the revenue decline, pretax margin -- operating margins remained essentially flat at 26.3%. 
Drilling Group revenue of $3.3 billion decreased 7% primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 94 basis points to 18.6%. 
Production Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 5% sequentially while margins declined 173 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by pricing and activity declines in West services. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 20% in the third quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 1 percentage point due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world as well as the mix of earnings amongst the International GeoMarkets. 
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first 3 quarters of 2015, we have generated $6.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $150 million during the third quarter and $600 million during the first 9 months of the year. 
Net debt improved $400 million during the quarter to $5.2 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $545 million to repurchase 6.9 million shares at an average price of $78.76. Subsequent to the announcement of our transaction with Cameron in August, we have been repurchasing the maximum number of shares allowable under the SEC's regulations. 
We filed our S-4 registration statement relating to the acquisition 2 weeks ago today. It's worth highlighting that once the SEC declares our registration statement effective and the proxy statement is mailed, we will be prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our stock until the Cameron shareholder vote. 
We spent $590 million on CapEx during the third quarter. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.

Schlumberger third quarter revenue fell 6% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. North America revenue fell 4% sequent",2320,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger third quarter revenue fell 6% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. 
North America revenue fell 4% sequentially as we maintained focus on balancing margins and market share while International revenue was 7% lower as customer budget cuts and service pricing erosion impacted results. Still in the midst of what may well turn out to be the most severe downturn in several decades, our operating margins were maintained at levels much higher than in previous downturns. 
In North America, pretax operating margins were held at 8.9% in spite of an additional drop in activity and pricing, both offshore and on land, while the International margins dropped to 23.7% as customer budget cuts, activity cancellations and lower service pricing took further effect. 
In the first 9 months of 2015, year-over-year revenue has dropped 34% in North America and 18% internationally, yet we have delivered 9-month of decremental operating margins of 34% in North America and 23% internationally, which represent a strong performance improvement over the 2009 downturn. 
We have delivered these results by proactively and decisively managing our cost and resource base, carefully navigating the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share, and at the same time, accelerating our internal transformation program. 
We also generated more than $1.7 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, which represents a conversion rate of 170% of the quarter's earnings. Our ability to generate significant free cash flow even in this part of the cycle is a major competitive edge, which we actively use to pursue new business opportunities as well as targeted M&A activity. 
In terms of M&A, our main focus in recent months has been the proposed acquisition of Cameron announced on August 26, which will open up a significant growth opportunity for us as we look to establish the industry's first complete drilling and production systems, spanning both the surface and the subsurface. In addition, we also completed the acquisition of Houston-based T&T Engineering, which specializes in design of land rig systems as well as Utah-based Novatek, which is the leader in the field of synthetic diamond innovations. 
We also signed a letter of intent for a joint venture with the part of the Bauer Group from Germany in a further evolution of our land rig of the future strategy. 
And finally, we entered into an agreement with IBM to jointly provide integrated production optimization services, combining our production software platform with IBM's enterprise asset management services in an end-to-end offering. 
Looking at our results on a geographical basis. North American revenue decreased 4% sequentially, a figure considerably less than the 27% sequential decrease seen in the second quarter and better than the 7% drop in the average horizontal rig count. On land, the revenue growth was driven by lower hydraulic fracturing activity and additional pricing pressure for both products and services. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, revenue declined on lower multiclient seismic sales, exploration rigs transferring to drilling and completion activities as well as pricing concessions, which were partly offset by higher new technology sales. 
In Western Canada, rig count almost doubled sequentially, following the early spring breakup, but was still down by roughly 52% year-over-year. In spite of these headwinds, operating margins in North America decreased by only 136 basis points sequentially to 8.9% and this strong performance is a direct result of our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing effects of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management. 
As service pricing in U.S. land fell further in the third quarter, we continued our approach of concentrating activity in core areas and for key customers while proceeding to stack equipment rather than operating at a loss. 
In the rare event we select to pursue work at what we consider noncommercial prices, we view this as an investment decision and apply the same justification and approval process used for any other reinvestment we do in our business. This has led us to move equipment and crews between basins as we look to balance market share with margins and as we pursue new technology opportunities. 
We believe that this approach has enabled us to protect our profitability in North America land and has also helped us maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term ability to service our customers in this market. 
In the International markets, revenue declined 7% sequentially due to further customer budget cuts; rapidly changing activity, driven by disruptions, delays and cancellations; as well as by further pricing concessions. Third quarter International operating margins of 23.7% was down 72 basis points sequentially and 83 basis points year-over-year. Our 9-month decremental margins were still held to 23%, which represents a marked improvement over the 61% from the corresponding period in the 2009 downturn, which is a testament to both the strength of our International business and how well our organization is executing. 
Within the International Areas, Middle East & Asia revenue declined by 8% sequentially while pretax operating margins decreased 171 basis points to 27%. Activity in the Middle East remained robust during the quarter, particularly in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, but pricing concessions, changes to the activity mix as well as project delays had a negative impact on revenue and profitability. 
Year-over-year, area revenue decreased 20% while margins dropped by 61 basis points. Our lump sum turn-key project in Saudi Arabia continued to progress well, and with steady improvement in drilling efficiency, well deliveries are now ahead of planned levels. 
In the United Arab Emirates, robust drilling production and seismic activity was boosted by further rig additions and we also recorded strong sales of Petrel and ECLIPSE software. 
Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait as rig count increased. However, this was partially offset by operational delays and an activity shutdown in the neutral zone. 
In Iraq, we mobilized 2 rigs for the Zubair lump sum turnkey project with the first well already completed while revenue from the other operations in the country remained flat with the second quarter. 
In Southeast Asia, activity was lower throughout the region, driven by a further drop in work offshore Australia as projects ended, lower rig count in Malaysia, reduced deepwater exploration and development work in the South China Sea and continuing NOC budget cuts on land in China. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pretax operating margins fell 159 basis points to 20.7%. 
In Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, activity was further hit by a combination of delays and budget reductions while Colombia was weaker due to increased pricing pressure. These effects were, however, partially offset by steady activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. 
Year-over-year, area revenue decreased 30%, and operating margins decreased by 120 basis points. 
In Mexico, revenue dropped again in the third quarter and now stands at an 8-year low as the significant budget cuts further impacted activity and profitability. At the same time, we began multiclient seismic operations in the Gulf of Campeche, and awards for the second and third license rounds of the energy reform act remained on schedule. 
Offshore activity continued to decline in Brazil and budget reductions impacted both equipment rentals and field operations. And in addition to this, revenue was also hit by the weakening of the real. 
In Venezuela, activity was steady for both PDVSA and for the heavy oil joint ventures in Faja, while in Ecuador, SPM activity was flat as the Shushufindi project continued to perform in line with expectations. 
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 6% sequentially while pretax operating margins increased 92 basis points to 22.2%. Year-over-year revenue decreased 31% and margins dropped by 125 basis points. Within the area, the bright spot in the third quarter was Russia and Central Asia where revenue continued to increase with peak summer drilling activity in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This increase was, however, partially offset by a weaker ruble. 
In the North Sea, increased drilling in the U.K. sector was insufficient to counter lower activity in the remote areas and was further offset by reduced activity in Norway from project delays and cancellations as well as currency weakness. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity increased in Gabon in the third quarter, but was considerably lower in the rest of the region as operations were halted in Chad, exploration work dropped to a new low in Angola and offshore projects were canceled in Nigeria. 
In Algeria and Tunisia, activity was also down in the third quarter, while in Libya, our operations continues to be limited to one offshore rig. 
Turning next to the overall market outlook. We see 2 clear trends emerging. First, as we enter the last quarter of the year, the global oil market is still way down by fears of reduced growth in China and the timing and magnitude of additional Iranian exports. However, the fundamental balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid global GDP growth and by weakening supply as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments start to take full effect. We expect this trend to continue, and as the oil markets further recognize this, the magnitude of the industry's annual production replacement challenge, this will gradually translate into improvements in oil prices going forward. 
Second, in spite of the expected improvements in oil prices, the market outlook for oil field services looks challenging for the coming quarters as we expect additional reductions in activity and further pressure on service pricing. This is driven by the financial pressure on many of our customers where a year very low oil prices is now exhausting available cash flow and corresponding capital spending and also leading them to take a very conservative view on 2016 E&P budgets. 
In addition to this, the winter season will have the normal, negative impact on activity, which in the fourth quarter is unlikely to be offset by the usual year-end sales of software, products and multiclient licenses. 
Based on this industry outlook, we expect E&P investments to fall for a second successive year in 2016, which is the first time since the 1986 downturn when the spare capacity cushion was more than 10 million barrels per day. In spite of the need for the industry to increase investment levels to mitigate the pending impact on global supply, we instead see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between the expected improvement in oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investments and oil field services activity. This timing gap or increased response time is a direct consequence of the dramatic cuts in E&P investments, which have clearly damaged the oil industry's financial strength and investment appetite as well as the operating capacity and capability. 
So while our macro view has not changed in terms of a tightening supply-and-demand balance and an expected improvement in oil prices, we have to factor in that the likely recovery in our activity levels now seems to be a 2017 event. 
We communicated in our previous earnings call that we were prepared to live with our existing cost base going forward, provided we were close to the bottom of the market and that the activity recovery was only a couple of quarters out. As a result, we carried our cost base forward into Q3, which have some negative impact on our operating margins. And we did not report any exceptional restructuring charges in the quarter. 
The likely timing gap between the oil price recovery and the subsequent increase in oil field services activity, in combination with a more conservative spending outlook from our customers, is causing us to now take further action. 
We have, therefore, decided to proceed with a further round of capacity and overhead reductions, which will result in a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. This charge will cover severance costs for additional headcount reductions, reflecting both our updated activity outlook for 2016 and a further streamlining of our support structure. 
In addition and as part of our internal transformation program, we are now ready to initiate a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will also result in a charge in the fourth quarter. Here we will seize opportunities to streamline our engineering, manufacturing and sustaining infrastructure by consolidating sites into clusters, both in central locations and in the field while at the same time further modernize our processes by introducing state-of-the-art manufacturing automation, in line with the best companies in other high-tech industries. 
These changes to our manufacturing and distribution network are closely coordinated with the integration plans for Cameron, which are already well advanced and which will be quickly implemented once the transaction has closed. 
So far, in this downturn, we have proactively and effectively managed our cost and resource base, carefully navigated the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share at the same time as we have actively accelerated our internal transformation program. 
With the above actions, we are continuing this prudent approach with the aim of protecting and expanding our solid financial performance into 2016, which is shaping up to be another challenging year for the oil field services industry. 
We further believe that our ability to respond to higher E&P investments in oil field activity in 2017 will be improved by protecting our financial strength in 2016 rather than carrying excessive costs and inefficiencies as we await the recovery of the oil field services market. 
Overall, we remain very confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings, and through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our transformation program, we are creating a significant financial leverage that will enable us to increase market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

And internationally, we have started to see signs of weakening supply as well. I think in all these 3 main sources of supply, while production is starting to come down, I think there are also significant efforts to maximize production within each of these basins by, in some cases, taking more short-term actions to maximize production, which might actually have a negative impact on long-term recovery. I think there's only a limited period that this can be done. And while the various players exhaust these type of opportunities, if investments aren't increased, I think you'll see a further acceleration of the drop in production."

Any, I think -- any improvement in oil prices, I think will be to initially -- is going to go towards strengthening the balance sheet. And then the oil companies will likely assess how sustainable are these increases in oil prices before they start investing. So there's a delay, I believe, between an improvement in oil prices and the decision to increase budgets, and then there's going to be further delay between increasing budgets and realizing that into higher oilfield activity. And that is going to be delayed in between higher oil activity and higher production. So I think there is -- the market is underestimating how long this period is going to take. And just the fact that the industry is again looking to reduce investments when we have the significant ending supply impact coming just shows that I think we are -- even have an increasing chance of a potential spike in oil prices if investments aren't increased in time."

The Q3 exploration rig count was down about 25% year-over-year, and the seismic spend was also down in excess of 30%, and that's following a pretty low year in 2014 as well. So it is very challenging for exploration activity for us, but again, the impact of this is still fully absorbed in our results, which are still reasonably good.

But I think, over time, and maybe not already in 2016, there is significant cost reduction potential in the -- for the deepwater, I think, both when it comes to the well cost, as well as for the overall infrastructure. I think we can simplify. We can standardize. We can engineer costs out of the system. And what that will allow, if you can, for instance, reduce the well cost by, say, 30%, you can potentially drill 4 wells for the price of 3, which again will help you increase production and recovery from the deepwater fields, which obviously will help to lower cost [indiscernible] and improve the economics. So I think we are in very, very early innings in terms of driving down costs for deepwater, both production and then the drilling part of it, and I think what we are doing now with the Cameron acquisition is going to address both of those dimensions."

So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the 3 most important points we have discussed. First, while the business environment clearly got worse in the third quarter, our focus on cost management and transformation has enabled us to deliver strong financial performance and generate significantly liquidity, which is a clear competitive edge in this part of the cycle. Second, our forward visibility has again been reduced, and we will constantly revert back to managing the company quarter-by-quarter. This means that further on, our capacity and overhead reductions in the fourth quarter, as we adjust resources to a lower activity outlook, at the same time, we will continue to accelerate our transformation program, with the next step being a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will further modernize a core part of our company. And third, our outlook for the oil market remains unchanged, with the continuing tightening of the supply and demand balance as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments start to take full effect, ultimately, leading to an increase in oil prices. Given the conservative view, our customers are taking on 2016 investment levels and the generous state of the industry following a year of low oil prices, we see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between higher oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investments in oilfield activity. In this environment, we continue to proactively manage our business to preserve our financial strength into 2016, which will allow us to better navigate the market uncertainty and to respond faster to new business opportunities, and ultimately, higher activity.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.Third quarter earnings per share was $0.78. This represent decreases of $0.10 sequentially and $0.71 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our third quart",473,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.
Third quarter earnings per share was $0.78. This represent decreases of $0.10 sequentially and $0.71 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion decreased 6% sequentially. Almost 40% of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pretax operating margins only declined by 101 basis points sequentially. This was due to the continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. 
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 5% sequentially as decreases in exploration spending impacted both Wireline and Testing Services internationally. Despite the revenue decline, pretax margin -- operating margins remained essentially flat at 26.3%. 
Drilling Group revenue of $3.3 billion decreased 7% primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 94 basis points to 18.6%. 
Production Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 5% sequentially while margins declined 173 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by pricing and activity declines in Well Services. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 20% in the third quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 1 percentage point due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world as well as the mix of earnings amongst the International GeoMarkets. 
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first 3 quarters of 2015, we have generated $6.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $150 million during the third quarter and $600 million during the first 9 months of the year. 
Net debt improved $400 million during the quarter to $5.2 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $545 million to repurchase 6.9 million shares at an average price of $78.76. Subsequent to the announcement of our transaction with Cameron in August, we have been repurchasing the maximum number of shares allowable under the SEC's regulations. 
We filed our S-4 registration statement relating to the acquisition 2 weeks ago today. It's worth highlighting that once the SEC declares our registration statement effective and the proxy statement is mailed, we will be prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our stock until the Cameron shareholder vote. 
We spent $590 million on CapEx during the third quarter. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal."
301966,310708854,877558,"Schlumberger Limited, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger third quarter revenue fell 6% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. North America revenue fell 4% sequent",2321,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Schlumberger third quarter revenue fell 6% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. 
North America revenue fell 4% sequentially as we maintained focus on balancing margins and market share while International revenue was 7% lower as customer budget cuts and service pricing erosion impacted results. Still in the midst of what may well turn out to be the most severe downturn in several decades, our operating margins were maintained at levels much higher than in previous downturns. 
In North America, pretax operating margins were held at 8.9% in spite of an additional drop in activity and pricing, both offshore and on land, while the International margins dropped to 23.7% as customer budget cuts, activity cancellations and lower service pricing took further effect. 
In the first 9 months of 2015, year-over-year revenue has dropped 34% in North America and 18% internationally, yet we have delivered 9-month decremental operating margins of 34% in North America and 23% internationally, which represent a strong performance improvement over the 2009 downturn. 
We have delivered these results by proactively and decisively managing our cost and resource base, carefully navigating the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share, and at the same time, accelerating our internal transformation program. 
We also generated more than $1.7 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, which represents a conversion rate of 170% of the quarter's earnings. Our ability to generate significant free cash flow even in this part of the cycle is a major competitive edge, which we actively use to pursue new business opportunities as well as targeted M&A activity. 
In terms of M&A, our main focus in recent months has been the proposed acquisition of Cameron announced on August 26, which will open up a significant growth opportunity for us as we look to establish the industry's first complete drilling and production systems, spanning both the surface and the subsurface. In addition, we also completed the acquisition of Houston-based T&T Engineering, which specializes in design of land rig systems as well as Utah-based Novatek, which is the leader in the field of synthetic diamond innovation. 
We also signed a letter of intent for a joint venture with a part of the Bauer Group from Germany in a further evolution of our land rig of the future strategy. 
And finally, we entered into an agreement with IBM to jointly provide integrated production optimization services, combining our production software platform with IBM's enterprise asset management services in an end-to-end offering. 
Looking at our results on a geographical basis. North American revenue decreased 4% sequentially, a figure considerably less than the 27% sequential decrease seen in the second quarter and better than the 7% drop in the average horizontal rig count. On land, the revenue growth was driven by lower hydraulic fracturing activity and additional pricing pressure for both products and services. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, revenue declined on lower multiclient seismic sales, exploration rigs transferring to drilling and completion activities as well as pricing concessions, which were partly offset by higher new technology sales. 
In Western Canada, rig count almost doubled sequentially, following the early spring breakup, but was still down by roughly 52% year-over-year. In spite of these headwinds, operating margins in North America decreased by only 136 basis points sequentially to 8.9% and this strong performance is a direct result of our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing effects of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management. 
As service pricing in U.S. land fell further in the third quarter, we continued our approach of concentrating activity in core areas and for key customers while proceeding to stack equipment rather than operating at a loss. 
In the rare event we select to pursue work at what we consider noncommercial prices, we view this as an investment decision and apply the same justification and approval process used for any other reinvestment we do in our business. This has led us to move equipment and crews between basins as we look to balance market share with margins and as we pursue new technology opportunities. 
We believe that this approach has enabled us to protect our profitability in North America land and has also helped us maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term ability to service our customers in this market. 
In the International markets, revenue declined 7% sequentially due to further customer budget cuts; rapidly changing activity, driven by disruptions, delays and cancellations; as well as by further pricing concessions. Third quarter International operating margins of 23.7% was down 72 basis points sequentially and 83 basis points year-over-year. Our 9-month decremental margins were still held to 23%, which represents a marked improvement over the 61% from the corresponding period in the 2009 downturn, which is a testament to both the strength of our International business and how well our organization is executing. 
Within the International Areas, Middle East & Asia revenue declined by 8% sequentially while pretax operating margins decreased 171 basis points to 27%. Activity in the Middle East remained robust during the quarter, particularly in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, but pricing concessions, changes to the activity mix as well as project delays had a negative impact on revenue and profitability. 
Year-over-year, area revenue decreased 20% while margins dropped by 61 basis points. Our lump sum turn-key project in Saudi Arabia continued to progress well, and with steady improvements in drilling efficiency, well deliveries are now ahead of planned levels. 
In the United Arab Emirates, robust drilling production and seismic activity was boosted by further rig additions and we also recorded strong sales of Petrel and ECLIPSE software. 
Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait as rig count increased. However, this was partly offset by operational delays and an activity shutdown in the neutral zone. 
In Iraq, we mobilized 2 rigs for the Zubair lump sum turnkey project with the first well already completed while revenue from the other operations in the country remained flat with the second quarter. 
In Southeast Asia, activity was lower throughout the region, driven by a further drop in work offshore Australia as projects ended, lower rig count in Malaysia, reduced deepwater exploration and development work in the South China Sea and continuing NOC budget cuts on land in China. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pretax operating margins fell 159 basis points to 20.7%. 
In Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, activity was further hit by a combination of delays and budget reductions while Colombia was weaker due to increased pricing pressure. These effects were, however, partially offset by steady activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. 
Year-over-year, area revenue decreased 30%, and operating margins decreased by 120 basis points. 
In Mexico, revenue dropped again in the third quarter and now stands at an 8-year low as the significant budget cuts further impacted activity and profitability. At the same time, we began multiclient seismic operations in the Gulf of Campeche, and awards for the second and third license rounds of the energy reform act remain on schedule. 
Offshore activity continued to decline in Brazil as budget reductions impacted both equipment rentals and field operations. And in addition to this, revenue was also hit by the weakening of the real. 
In Venezuela, activity was steady for both PDVSA and for the heavy oil joint ventures in the Faja, while in Ecuador, SPM activity was flat as the Shushufindi project continued to perform in line with expectations. 
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 6% sequentially while pretax operating margins increased 92 basis points to 22.2%. Year-over-year revenue decreased 31% and margins dropped by 125 basis points. Within the area, the bright spot in the third quarter was Russia and Central Asia where revenue continued to increase with peak summer drilling activity in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This increase was, however, partially offset by a weaker ruble. 
In the North Sea, increased drilling in the U.K. sector was insufficient to counter lower activity in the remote areas and was further offset by reduced activity in Norway from project delays and cancellations as well as currency weakness. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity increased in Gabon in the third quarter, but was considerably lower in the rest of the region as operations were halted in Chad, exploration work dropped to a new low in Angola and offshore projects were canceled in Nigeria. 
In Algeria and Tunisia, activity was also down in the third quarter, while in Libya, our operations continues to be limited to one offshore rig. 
Turning next to the overall market outlook. We see 2 clear trends emerging. First, as we enter the last quarter of the year, the global oil market is still weighed down by fears of reduced growth in China and the timing and magnitude of additional Iranian exports. However, the fundamental balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid global GDP growth and by weakening supply as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments start to take full effect. We expect this trend to continue, and as the oil markets further recognize this, the magnitude of the industry's annual production replacement challenge, this will gradually translate into improvements in oil prices going forward. 
Second, in spite of the expected improvements in oil prices, the market outlook for oil field services looks challenging for the coming quarters as we expect additional reductions in activity and further pressure on service pricing. This is driven by the financial pressure on many of our customers where a year of very low oil prices is now exhausting available cash flow and corresponding capital spending and also leading them to take a very conservative view on 2016 E&P budgets. 
In addition to this, the winter season will have the normal, negative impact on activity, which in the fourth quarter is unlikely to be offset by the usual year-end sales of software, products and multiclient licenses. 
Based on this industry outlook, we expect E&P investments to fall for a second successive year in 2016, which is the first time since the 1986 downturn when the spare capacity cushion was more than 10 million barrels per day. In spite of the need for the industry to increase investment levels to mitigate the pending impact on global supply, we instead see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between the expected improvement in oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investments and oil field services activity. This timing gap or increased response time is a direct consequence of the dramatic cuts in E&P investments, which have clearly damaged the oil industry's financial strength and investment appetite as well as the operating capacity and capability. 
So while our macro view has not changed in terms of a tightening supply-and-demand balance and an expected improvement in oil prices, we have to factor in that the likely recovery in our activity levels now seems to be a 2017 event. 
We communicated in our previous earnings call that we were prepared to live with our existing cost base going forward, provided we were close to the bottom of the market and that the activity recovery was only a couple of quarters out. As a result, we carried our cost base forward into Q3, which had some negative impact on our operating margins. And we did not report any exceptional restructuring charges in the quarter. 
The likely timing gap between the oil price recovery and the subsequent increase in oil field services activity, in combination with a more conservative spending outlook from our customers, is causing us to now take further action. 
We have, therefore, decided to proceed with a further round of capacity and overhead reductions, which will result in a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. This charge will cover severance costs for additional headcount reductions, reflecting both our updated activity outlook for 2016 and a further streamlining of our support structure. 
In addition and as part of our internal transformation program, we are now ready to initiate a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will also result in a charge in the fourth quarter. Here we will seize opportunities to streamline our engineering, manufacturing and sustaining infrastructure by consolidating sites into clusters, both in central locations and in the field while at the same time further modernize our processes by introducing state-of-the-art manufacturing automation, in line with the best companies in other high-tech industries. 
These changes to our manufacturing and distribution network are closely coordinated with the integration plans for Cameron, which are already well advanced and which will be quickly implemented once the transaction has closed. 
So far, in this downturn, we have proactively and decisively managed our cost and resource base, carefully navigated the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share at the same time as we have actively accelerated our internal transformation program. 
With the above actions, we are continuing this prudent approach with the aim of protecting and extending our solid financial performance into 2016, which is shaping up to be another challenging year for the oil field services industry. 
We further believe that our ability to respond to higher E&P investments in oil field activity in 2017 will be improved by protecting our financial strength in 2016 rather than carrying excessive costs and inefficiencies as we await the recovery of the oil field services market. 
Overall, we remain very confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings, and through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our transformation program, we are creating a significant financial leverage that will enable us to increase market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

There is a continued shift from spare capacity into marketed supply. In North America, the production is coming down more or less as expected as well. And internationally, we are starting to see signs of a weakening supply as well. I think in all these 3 main sources of supply, while production is starting to come down, I think there are also significant efforts to maximize production within each of these basins by, in some cases, taking more short-term actions to maximize production, which might actually have a negative impact on long-term recovery.

Any, I think -- any improvement in oil prices, I think will be to initially -- is going to go towards strengthening the balance sheet. And then the oil companies will likely assess how sustainable are these increases in oil prices before they start investing. So there's a delay, I believe, between an improvement in oil prices and the decision to increase budgets, and then there's going to be further delay between increasing budgets and realizing that into higher oilfield activity. And then there's going to be a delay in between higher oil activity and higher production. So I think there is -- the market is underestimating how long this period is going to take. And just the fact that the industry is again looking to reduce investments when we have the significant pending supply impact coming just shows that I think we are -- even have an increasing chance of a potential spike in oil prices if investments aren't increased in time."

The focus on driving costs down is on development, and exploration is basically eliminated. That's how I think many customers look at it. There is -- there are significant cuts in exploration activity, and they continue both for seismic and for drilling. The Q3 exploration rig count was down about 25% year-over-year, and the seismic spend was also down in excess of 30%, and that's following a pretty low year in 2014 as well. So it is very challenging for exploration activity for us, but again, the impact of this is still fully absorbed in our results, which are still reasonably good. So yes, in summary, they -- our customers are more or less cutting completely exploration, and focusing a lot more in driving further costs out of the development."

But I'm very pleased with the progress that OneSubsea has made and the close working relationship we've had with OneSubsea from the Schlumberger side. But I think, over time, and maybe not already in 2016, there is significant cost reduction potential in the -- for the deepwater, I think, both when it comes to the well cost, as well as for the overall infrastructure. I think we can simplify. We can standardize. We can engineer costs out of the system. And what that will allow, if you can, for instance, reduce the well cost by, say, 30%, you can potentially drill 4 wells for the price of 3, which again will help you increase production and recovery from the deepwater fields, which obviously will help to lower cost per barrel and improve the economics. So I think we are in very, very early innings in terms of driving down costs for deepwater, both production and then the drilling part of it, and I think what we are doing now with the Cameron acquisition is going to address both those dimensions."

We have been very good at managing our International business. So I'm expecting that even with still further headwinds in terms of top lines in 2016, we should be able to continue to hold the decrementals at a very respectable level. Whether they're going to be at 23% or slightly higher, it's a bit difficult to say. But in terms of offsetting activity reductions through cost-cutting, I think we've proven that we can do that, and beyond that, it is how much leverage we can generate from the transformation to offset pricing. So both of those are -- we are very active on trying to deliver both of those type of results, and we are going to go very hard at it for 2017 -- sorry, 2016 to continue to deliver strong decrementals internationally."

On the transformation around the global manufacturing and distribution, the charge we are taking is for consolidating facilities, moving much more towards campuses and clusters, and also the introduction of some new automation manufacturing type of technology. Similarly, we are also looking to consolidate how we do global distribution, going more from a global and local setup to a much more regional setup in terms of how we manage that. So the process of getting it done, we have already embarked on. And there are some charges associated with this that we will take in the fourth quarter, and we will continue implementing our program in 2016 and 2017. So I'm not going to be able to give you a specific impact on margins and what this is going to generate for us, although that we are -- we are very excited about doing this. It's going to modernize a core part of the company, and it's going to make us even more competitive in the international markets. Now in terms of multiskilling, this is part of how we are continuing to drive people productivity. There is many other aspects of what we do there. We have remote operations as another key part of this as well, where we can centralize much more of our expertise and have them oversee more jobs centrally rather than being at the well site as well. So all of these elements are a key part of the transformation program, and we are still not at the halfway point of rolling this out globally and for it to have the full impact on our operations and our results. So there's still a lot of runway left in both the multiskilling, the remote operations and what we're going to do on manufacturing and distribution, as well as all the other parts of the transformation.

All right. So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the 3 most important points we have discussed. First, while the business environment clearly got worse in the third quarter, our focus on cost management and transformation has enabled us to deliver strong financial performance and generate significant liquidity, which is a clear competitive edge in this part of the cycle. Second, our forward visibility has again been reduced, and we will consequently revert back to managing the company quarter-by-quarter. This means a further round of capacity and overhead reductions in the fourth quarter, as we adjust resources to a lower activity outlook. At the same time, we will continue to accelerate our transformation program, with the next step being a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will further modernize a core part of our company. And third, our outlook for the oil market remains unchanged, with a continuing tightening of the supply and demand balance as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments start to take full effect, ultimately, leading to an increase in oil prices. Given the conservative view our customers are taking on 2016 investment levels and the general state of the industry following a year of low oil prices, we see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between higher oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investment in oilfield activity. In this environment, we continue to proactively manage our business to preserve our financial strength into 2016, which will allow us to better navigate the market uncertainty and to respond faster to new business opportunities, and ultimately, higher activity. Thank you for participating."
