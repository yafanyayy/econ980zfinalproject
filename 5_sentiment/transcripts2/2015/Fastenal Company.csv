Before I start, I'd like to just say thank you to the Fastenal members on the call. I know there's a lot of you that tuned into this, and we're so appreciative of the work that you did in the fourth quarter. So just a great job, and I'd like to report that it was a good quarter for our company, 13.8% sales growth, that's 15% -- or 15.7% on the daily average. and there's be some questions, I'm sure, on Christmas, and December was in line with the rest of the quarter. We just thought it was the right thing to do to take the 26th off. 20.1% on earnings growth, and that equated to 28% incremental margin growth, which again, these are strong numbers for our company. 
And how we got there really was we continued to work hard on our gross margin. But in this quarter, we really focused our attention on our expenses. And the Fastenal company and the members, I got to tell you, really did a nice job looking at all different types of expenses, and we really clamped down. 
And one thing that really came out is our ability to manage our labor. Historically, our daily average is going to decline somewhere around 10% from the end of October to the end of the year. We know that. And what we simply did is we turned down the hours or pulled back the hours and we looked at the timing of Thanksgiving, Christmas, et cetera, and just with the natural decline in our daily average. But we continue to add people at the company at part-time ranks. And I would say in 2015, with a good economy, we are committed to putting selling energy into our stores.  And I just, again, let me talk internally, we are committed to a store-based model. We are committed to the fact that we really believe being close to our customers, offering a high level of service is really the best way to really approach the industrial market. 
The other question we get is if you're going to add 10% to 15% more hours in the store, can you afford it? That really equates to about a 7% net effect on the labor dollar impact. And so it's a good model for us. It really bodes well for our stores and for most importantly, our customers. So strong quarter, we continued to stay disciplined on the gross margin. And there's pressure there, but we really like the momentum and the direction we are moving. With that, I'll turn it over to Dan."

I think our press release is self-explanatory on the quarter. We published monthly numbers. And I think as Lee touched on, our sales trends remain strong throughout the quarter, bode well as we go into 2015. I tried to highlight on the bottom Page 1, Page 2, a handful of bullets of things that I think were important to the business. One of them, I wanted to touch -- and some of these commentary is based on questions that I might get. And so I did want to touch on the headcount patterns as we were going through the fourth quarter, specially at the store level as we talked in the past about the investment in selling energy and adding hours. 
The one position we were in this year that we really weren't in last year is we are in a position to much more acutely manage the expense because we weren't in a ramp-up mode. We were in a manage-the-business mode. And so we did a much better job of managing our expenses in the fourth quarter. We were able to dial up and down the variable components of our expense, a big piece of that being store-based labor, to really match the needs of the business and really the needs of the customers to serve the customer. 
One item that I typically touch on or get questions on is the table we have on 'pathway to profit'. I think it's a good way to assess some of the underlying things going on in our business. And one of the things that is always helpful I think us appreciate how we look at our business. And one thing that we do is we're an organization that rewards our personnel internally, whether that be people at the store, at by the district level, in the distribution center or some other support roles. We reward folks based on our ability to grow the business. We reward more for growth sales than we do from maintenance sales, as an example. We reward for managing, containing the costs of our business and growing the profits of the business. So those are the things that really critical when we look at how we compensate. 
And so one thing to keep in mind when we look at that 'pathway to profit' table over the 3 years, because I always look at different buckets and my job is looking at 150,000-plus store or I look at the last 2 groups combined because they help me understand what's really going on in the business. And I am pleased to say when I look at 2014, I look at that group, the number of the -- the level of profitability, the components of the profitability make a lot of sense to me and position us well to go forward. One thing you'll notice is the profit in that group slipped slightly from a year ago. Now we're largely beyond the noise we've had in the past months, what's going on in gross margin year-over-year. So it's really about how are we managing expenses of the business and investing to grow the business. 
When I look at that slight leakage, what really drove it is a decision we made a year ago to dramatically expand our district and regional leadership. We went from roughly 230 district managers to shy of 300. We expanded the key accounts teams. We expanded our ability to manage the business and grow the business. 
The other thing that happens is if you look at the business this year, as Lee mentioned, we grew at 20.1%, our top line, 15.7% on daily, about 14% on an absolute basis. A year ago, those numbers were 9% pretax growth and about 7.5% sales growth. So what -- the other component of our P&L that changed dramatically is folks at the district level, folks at the regional level, our teams throughout the organization were paid a premium to grow our earnings. Bonuses and store compensation were up meaningfully from a year ago. And so when I look at that, we picked up about 70 basis points of expense because of the fact we're now growing earnings at 20% versus 9%. And I don't want to get too deep into the weeds here, but that's -- but despite that 70 basis points, our profitability in that group only went down 20. The other 50 is 'pathway to profit' leverage, which is not only did we improve the profitability of the organization because the mix changed, but the underlying health of the business improved. And where we did get deterioration, it's because of the investments we made, a, and the way our incentive compensation works, b. And I think that's a winning combination.
With that, again, I think our press release broadly gives most people more details than they about the world with Fastenal. With that, I'll stop. And Will, if you have anything you want to add, I'll turn over to Q&A"

It isn't so much that the gap has narrowed, it's  the performance of the other 60% has improved, and it's raised our company number.

I'm wondering about is as of those secular changes continue, as they have for the past several decades, are there offsets of that will allow you to remain in that range?

And like I talked about in -- on the last call, if I look at our stores that are -- that do more than 100,000 a month in sales, at the time, that was about just over 1,000 of our 2,700 stores. That group operates at a lower gross margin. I think it was about 70 basis points lower than the company does. And so as we move from 100 to 110 to 130 to 160,000 average store over the next few years, because we're only nominally adding units, so that meets our average store size is going to grow. I would expect our gross margin to compress, and right now, I would expect it to be closer to 50 than that say 51 or 50.5 that we just reported, because of the impact of that. But as I also talked about, giving up 70 basis points, you give up -- pick up about 450 basis points in operating leverage, and that's the secret."

That says a lot to the health of our OEM manufacturing customer out there. So I think that has a very good trends going into the new year. When I think of our Canadian business -- and I know enough some -- about a lot of the details, I get myself in the trouble in the conversation. To me, the biggest issue we have with our Canadian business right now isn't how well it's growing. It's the value of the currency. That business grew for us in the mid-single -- in the mid-double digit, excuse me, here when im x looking at the last few months. But what shines through on our company level, when you look at it in USD, it cuts that down by almost 2/3 because of deflation in the currency. But the underlying business up there is -- for us, is healthy. One thing to keep in mind when you look at our business in Canada, it is weighted towards the eastern part of the country. We went in Ontario first, and because we were expanding from basically the Great Lakes states in the U.S. when we first entered Canada in mid-'90s. So have a big chunk of business that's in Ontario province and then, out towards the . It was later that we more expanded into Western Canada from the standpoint of where our arts.

We think we're going to continue to do well in it for a long time. And part of it is what we learned is, although Kennametal is a very good supplier, they don't have full spectrum of what the customers need, and neither does any of the other suppliers. So we have developed relationships with a wide range of suppliers and most we were enjoying very good growth through Fastenal. So we're still very committed and believe it's a great opportunity for the future of Fastenal. The making that makes sense.

And our operating cash flow this year was  even high by our norm because we basically had operating cash up essentially in line with earnings. Part of that was the fact that our friends in Washington, D.C. saw fit to continue the bonus depreciation and a few other things there. So we didn't get that tax bill coming and that defers deferrals that off.

Before I start, I'd like to just say thank you to the Fastenal members on the call. I know there's a lot of you that tuned into this, and we're so appreciative of the work that you did in the fourth quarter. So just a great job. And now I'd like to report that it was a good quarter for our company: 13.8% sales growth. That's 15% -- or 15.7% on the daily average. And there'll be some questions, I'm sure, on Christmas. And December was in line with the rest of the quarter. We just thought it was the right thing to do to take the 26th off. 20.1% on earnings growth, and that equated to 28% incremental margin growth, which, again, these are strong numbers for our company.
And how we got there really was we continued to work hard on our gross margin. But in this quarter, we really focused our attention on our expenses. And the Fastenal Company and the members, I got to tell you, really did a nice job looking at all different types of expenses, and we really clamped down. 
And one thing that really came out is our ability to manage our labor. Historically, our daily average is going to decline somewhere around 10% from the end of October to the end of the year. We know that. And what we simply did is we turned down the hours or pulled back the hours when we looked at the timing of Thanksgiving, Christmas, et cetera, and just with the natural decline in our daily average. But we continue to add people at the company and especially in the part-time ranks. And I would say in 2015, with a good economy, we are committed to putting selling energy into our stores.  And I just, again, when we talk internally, we are committed to a store-based model. We are committed to the fact that we really believe being close to our customers, offering a high level of service is really the best -- is the best way to really approach the industrial market.
The other question we get is if you're going to add 10% to 15% more hours in the store, can you afford it? That really equates to about a 7% net effect on the labor dollar impact. And so it's a good model for us. It really bodes well for our stores and for, most importantly, our customers. So strong quarter. We continued to stay disciplined in -- on the gross margin. And there's pressure there, but we really like the momentum and the direction we're moving.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan."

I think the -- our press release is certainly self-explanatory on the quarter. We published monthly numbers. And I think as Lee touched on, our sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter. We think that bodes well as we go into 2015. I tried to highlight on the bottom of Page 1, top of Page 2, the -- a handful of bullets of things that I think were important to the business. One of them, I wanted to -- and some of this commentary is based on questions that I might get. And so I did want to touch on the headcount patterns as we were going through the fourth quarter, especially at the store level, as we've talked in the past, about the investment in selling energy and adding hours.
The one position we were in this year that we really weren't in last year is we are in a position to much more acutely manage the expense because we weren't in a ramp-up mode. We were in a manage-the-business mode. And so we did a much better job of managing our expenses. As we went through the fourth quarter, we were able to dial up and down the variable components of our expense, a big piece of that being store-based labor, to really match the needs of the business and really the needs of the customer, to serve the customer. 
One item that I typically touch on or get questions on is the table we have on 'pathway to profit'. I think that's a good way to assess some of the underlying things going on in our business. And one of the things that is always helpful, I think, is to appreciate how we look at our business. And one thing that we do is we're an organization that rewards our personnel internally, whether that be people at the store, at the district level, in the distribution center or at some other support roles. We reward folks based on our ability to grow the business. We reward more for growth sales than we do for maintenance sales, as an example. We reward for managing, containing the costs of our business and growing the profits of the business. So those are 3 things that are really critical when we look at how we compensate.
And so one thing to keep in mind when we look at that 'pathway to profit' table over the 3 years -- because I always look at different buckets and my poster child is always looking at the 150,000-plus store or I look at the last 2 groups combined because they help me understand what's really going on in the business.
And I'm pleased to say when I look at 2014 and I look at that group, the number of the -- level of profitability, the components of the profitability make a lot of sense to me and position us well to go forward. One thing you'll notice is the profit in that group slipped slightly from a year ago. Now we're largely beyond the noise we've had in the past months, so what's going on with gross margin year-over-year. So it's really about how are we managing the expenses of the business and investing to grow the business.
When I look at that slight leakage, what really drove it is a decision we made a year ago to dramatically expand our district and regional leadership. We went from roughly 230 district managers, just shy of 300. We expanded the key accounts teams. We expanded our ability to manage the business and grow the business.
The other thing that happens is if you look at the business this year -- Lee just mentioned we grew at 20.1%; our top line, 15.7% on daily, about 14% on an absolute basis. A year ago, those numbers were 9% pretax growth and about 7.5% sales growth. So what the other component of our P&L that changed dramatically is folks at the district level, folks at the regional level. Our teams throughout the organization were paid a premium to grow our earnings. Bonuses and store compensation were up meaningfully from a year ago. And so when I look at that, we picked up about 70 basis points of expense because of the fact we're now growing earnings at 20% versus 9%. And I don't want to get too deep into the weeds here, but that's -- but despite that 70 basis points, our profitability in that group only went down 20. The other 50 is 'pathway to profit' leverage, which not only did we improve the profitability of the organization because the mix changed, but the underlying health of the business improved. And where we did get deterioration, it's because of the investments we made, a; and the way our incentive compensation works, b. And I think that's a winning combination.
With that, again, I think our press release broadly gives most people more details than they want to know about the world within Fastenal. With that, I'll stop. And Will, if you have anything you want to add or let's turn it over to Q&A."

Our utilization will be high in the first quarter of our transportation. And as it looks right now, fuel costs will be down. So however you get the gross margin, it's great. So exclusive brands, tailwind there on the fuel. And also our fastener business is doing a little bit better.

And the offset to that, some of the pieces you normally don't count on and Lee just touched on it and then Will touched on it earlier is you have some SG&A that's going the other way in the short term.

I know you're down at Florida, so you don't always appreciate this anymore, now that you're no longer from the Midwest, but it's cold up here.

Not saying we are going to add 15%, but the math says we can add 15% more hours in our stores. And that would translate into just under 7% labor, not including bonuses, so the base labor to fuel that or just support that 15% more hours. And those are the scenarios we're looking at. So that gives us a tremendous amount of leverage when you look at that labor is, by far, our biggest expense. We can add the hours with only -- just under half of the expense as a percentage.

What I'm wondering about is as those secular changes continue, as they have for the past several decades, are there offsets that will allow you to remain in that range? Or is it just we reached a point where gross margins could potentially just be lower and we have to rely on better cost leverage?"

Because I think that's really the underlying cause of a lot of what we're talking about. Our average store size gets bigger because we're more and more successful with our larger customers and we drive some key accounts into those individual stores. And that's what pushes a store from 80,000 to 100,000 or from 100,000 to 150,000 or 150,000 to 200,000. Over time, you have some $40,000 and $50,000 a month customers and -- or maybe an $80,000 a month customer. But you have some big business that's coming into those stores. And like I talked about in the -- on the last call, if I look at our stores that are -- that do more than $100,000 a month in sales -- so at the time, that was about just over 1,000 of our 2,700 stores. That group operates at a lower gross margin. I think it was about 70 basis points lower than the company does. And so as we move from 100,000 to 110,000 to 130,000 to 160,000 average store over the next few years, because we're only nominally adding units, so that means our average store size is going to grow, I would expect our gross margin to compress. And right now, I would expect it to be closer to 50 than that, say, 51 or 50.5 that we just reported because of the impact of that. But as I also talked about, giving up that 70 basis points, you give up -- you pick up about 450 basis points in operating leverage, and that's the secret."

We started the year with our fastener business growing low singles, 1%, 1.5% in the first quarter, 1.9% in the fourth quarter last year. That says a lot to the health of our OEM manufacturing customer out there. So I think that has very good trends going into the new year. When I think of our Canadian business -- and I know enough some -- about a lot of the details, I sometimes get myself in trouble in the conversation. To me, the biggest issue we have with our Canadian business right now isn't how well it's growing. It's the value of the currency. That business grew for us in the mid-single -- in the mid-double digits, excuse me, here when I'm looking at the last few months. But what shines through on our company level, when you look at it in USD, it cuts that down by almost 2/3 because of the deflation in the currency. But the underlying business up there is -- for us, it's healthy. Now one thing to keep in mind when you look at our business in Canada, it is weighted towards the eastern part of the country. We went in Ontario first, and because we were expanding from basically the Great Lakes states in the U.S. when we first entered Canada in the mid-'90s. So we have a big chunk of business that's in the Ontario province and then out towards the Maritimes. It was later that we more expanded into Western Canada from the standpoint of where our dollars are. And in that business, the eastern part of the country is stronger than the western part. Obviously, the western part is much more linked to extractive industries."

People, I think, have too high of an expectation going in, thinking we are going to be as big as MSC overnight, and that doesn't happen. But our metalworking business has grown not double digit, but almost double digit above the Fastenal growth over the last -- over -- in 2014. It even did better than 2013. And we've grown a very nice size business. We're doing well with it. We think the upside is great. It's just hard to grow a business that right now represents about 10 -- just under 10% of our total revenue. So it's a meaningful size business. So it's hard to grow at more than 20-plus percent year-over-year with a business that big. So we're very committed. We think we're going to continue to do well in it for a long time. And part of what we learned is that although Kennametal is a very good supplier, they don't have full spectrum of what the customers need and neither does any of the other suppliers. So we have developed relationships with a wide range of suppliers, and most of them are enjoying very good growth through Fastenal. So we're still very committed and believe it's a great opportunity for the future of Fastenal. The main thing that makes sense is our fastener and MRO customers, most of those are using metalworking products. We already have developed relationships. Now we have to develop the product relationship in this specific area."

And our operating cash flow this year was  even high by our norm because we basically had operating cash essentially in line with earnings. Part of that was the fact that our friends in Washington, D.C. saw fit to continue the bonus depreciation and a few other things there. So we didn't get that tax bill coming, and that defers that off.

Before I start, I'd like to just say thank you to the Fastenal members on the call. I know there's a lot of you that tune into this, and we're so appreciative of the work that you did in the fourth quarter. So just a great job. And now I'd like to report that it was a good quarter for our company: 13.8% sales growth. That's 15% -- or 15.7% on the daily average. And there'll be some questions, I'm sure, on Christmas. And December was in line with the rest of the quarter. We just thought it was the right thing to do to take the 26th off. 20.1% on earnings growth, and that equated to 28% incremental margin growth, which, again, these are strong numbers for our company.
And how we got there really was we continued to work hard on our gross margin. But in this quarter, we really focused our attention on our expenses. And the Fastenal Company and the members, I got to tell you, really did a nice job looking at all different types of expenses, and we really clamped down. 
And one thing that really came out is our ability to manage our labor. Historically, our daily average is going to decline somewhere around 10% from the end of October to the end of the year. We know that. And what we simply did is we turned down the hours or pulled back the hours when we looked at the timing of Thanksgiving, Christmas, et cetera, and just with the natural decline in our daily average. But we continue to add people at the company and especially in the part-time ranks. And I would say in 2015, with a good economy, we are committed to putting selling energy into our stores.  And I just, again, when we talk internally, we are committed to a store-based model. We are committed to the fact that we really believe being close to our customers, offering a high level of service, is really the best -- is the best way to really approach the industrial market.
The other question we get is if you're going to add 10% to 15% more hours in the store, can you afford it? That really equates to about a 7% net effect on the labor dollar impact. And so it's a good model for us. It really bodes well for our stores and for, most importantly, our customers. So strong quarter. We continue to stay disciplined in -- on the gross margin. And there's pressure there, but we really like the momentum and the direction we're moving.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan."

I think the -- our press release is certainly self-explanatory on the quarter. We published monthly numbers. And I think as Lee touched on, our sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter. We think that bodes well as we go into 2015. I tried to highlight on the bottom of Page 1, top of Page 2, the -- a handful of bullets of things that I think were important to the business. One of them, I wanted to -- and some of this commentary is based on questions that I might get. And so I did want to touch on the headcount patterns as we were going through the fourth quarter, especially at the store level, because we've talked in the past about the investment in selling energy and adding hours.
The one position we were in this year that we really weren't in last year is we are in a position to much more acutely manage the expense because we weren't in a ramp-up mode. We were in a manage-the-business mode. And so we did a much better job of managing our expenses. As we went through the fourth quarter, we were able to dial up and down the variable components of our expense, a big piece of that being store-based labor, to really match the needs of the business and really the needs of the customer, to serve the customer. 
One item that I typically touch on or get questions on is the table we have on 'Pathway to Profit'. I think that's a good way to assess some of the underlying things going on in our business. And one of the things that is always helpful, I think, is to appreciate how we look at our business. And one thing that we do is we're an organization that rewards our personnel internally, whether that be people at the store, at the district level, in a distribution center or in some other support roles. We reward folks based on our ability to grow the business. We reward more for growth sales than we do for maintenance sales, as an example. We reward for managing, containing the costs of our business and growing the profits of the business. So those are the 3 things that are really critical when we look at how we compensate.
And so one thing to keep in mind when we look at that 'Pathway to Profit' table over the 3 years -- because I always look at different buckets and my poster child is always looking at the $150,000-plus store or I look at the last 2 groups combined because they help me understand what's really going on in the business.
And I'm pleased to say when I look at 2014 and I look at that group, the number of the -- level of profitability, the components of the profitability make a lot of sense to me and position us well to go forward. One thing you'll notice is the profit in that group slipped slightly from a year ago. Now we're largely beyond the noise we've had in the past months, so what's going on with gross margin year-over-year. So it's really about how are we managing the expenses of the business and investing to grow the business.
When I look at that slight leakage, what really drove it is a decision we made a year ago to dramatically expand our district and regional leadership. We went from roughly 230 district managers, just shy of 300. We expanded the key accounts teams. We expanded our ability to manage the business and grow the business.
The other thing that happens is if you look at the business this year -- Lee just mentioned we grew at 20.1%, our top line; 15.7% on daily, about 14% on an absolute basis. A year ago, those numbers were 9% pretax growth and about 7.5% sales growth. So what the other component of our P&L that changed dramatically is folks at the district level, folks at the regional level, our teams throughout the organization, were paid a premium to grow our earnings. Bonuses and store compensation were up meaningfully from a year ago. And so when I look at that, we picked up about 70 basis points of expense because of the fact we're now growing earnings at 20% versus 9%. And I don't want to get too deep into the weeds here, but that's -- but despite that 70 basis points, our profitability in that group only went down 20. The other 50 is 'Pathway to Profit' leverage, which not only did we improve the profitability of the organization because the mix changed, but the underlying health of the business improved. And where we did get deterioration, it's because of the investments we made, a; and the way our incentive compensation works, b. And I think that's a winning combination.
With that, again, I think our press release probably gives most people more details than they want to know about the world within Fastenal. With that, I'll stop. And Will, if you have anything you want to add, or let's turn it over to Q&A."

Because when I look at our bonus pools, our incentive comp, it really stepped up. When I look at it in the 4 quarters of this year, it really stepped up when we got into second quarter. And in the first quarter, it was a pretty healthy number, too, but it really stepped up. And so I think that layer of added expense is really in our numbers, when I look at the totality of '15. And I think it positions us well. And the offset to that, some of the pieces you normally don't count on, and Lee just touched on it and then Will touched on it earlier, is you have some SG&A that's going the other way in the short term. I mean, we have some nice benefit coming into the first quarter as it relates to energy. I know you're down in Florida, so you don't always appreciate this anymore, now that you're no longer from the Midwest, but it's cold up here. And energy prices for heating a lot of our locations in the northern half of the country and throughout Canada is a meaningful piece, too. So it gives us some tailwind coming into the first part of the year."

But if you -- the biggest component, by far, of our SG&A, as you know, is our labor. And with the plan that Lee and his team have laid out for adding the vast majority of our new selling energy -- or not selling energy but store energy, so our salespeople can get out by hiring college students, we can add 15%. Not saying we are going to add 15%, but the math says we can add 15% more hours in our stores. And that would translate into just under 7% labor, not including bonuses, so the base labor to fuel that or just support that 15% more hours. And those are the scenarios we're looking at. So that gives us a tremendous amount of leverage when you look at that labor is, by far, our biggest expense. We can add the hours with only -- just under half of the expense as a percentage. That's where a lot of it comes from. And it allows us to be very bullish out there with our customers and serve our customers at a very high level."

So I know that historically, even though National Accounts have moved up in the mix and non-fasteners as a percentage of the mix, you've been able to maintain that level. What I'm wondering about is as those secular changes continue, as they have for the past several decades, are there offsets that will allow you to remain in that range? Or is it just we've reached a point where gross margins could potentially just be lower and we have to rely on better cost leverage?"

Because I think that's really the underlying cause of a lot of what we're talking about. Our average store size gets bigger because we're more and more successful with our larger customers and we drive some key accounts into those individual stores. And that's what pushes a store from $80,000 to $100,000 or from $100,000 to $150,000 or $150,000 to $200,000. Over time, you have some $40,000 and $50,000 a month customers and -- or maybe an $80,000 a month customer. But you have some big business that's coming into those stores. And like I talked about in the -- on the last call, if I look at our stores that are -- that do more than $100,000 a month in sales -- so at the time, that was about just over 1,000 of our 2,700 stores. That group operates at a lower gross margin. I think it was about 70 basis points lower than the company does. And so as we move from $100,000 to $110,000 to $130,000 to $160,000 average store over the next few years, because we're only nominally adding units, so that means our average store size is going to grow, I would expect our gross margin to compress. And right now, I would expect it to be closer to 50 than that, say, 51 or 50.5 that we just reported because of the impact of that. But as I also talked about, giving up that 70 basis points, you give up -- you pick up about 450 basis points in operating leverage, and that's the secret."

And Lee or Will, if you want to chime in, feel free. First off, on the end market piece, the manufacturing, that business really improved for us, and I think that really shines through in the fact that we exit the year with our fastener business growing double digit. We started the year with our fastener business growing low singles, 1%, 1.5% in the first quarter, 1.9% in the fourth quarter of last year. That says a lot to the health of our OEM manufacturing customer out there. So I think that has very good trends going into the new year. When I think of our Canadian business, and I know enough of some -- about a lot of the details, I sometimes get myself in trouble in the conversation. To me, the biggest issue we have with our Canadian business right now isn't how well it's growing. It's the value of the currency. That business grew for us in the mid-single -- in the mid-double digits, excuse me, here when I'm looking at the last few months. But what shines through on our company level, when you look at it in USD, it cuts that down by almost 2/3 because of the deflation in the currency. But the underlying business up there is -- for us, it's healthy. Now one thing to keep in mind when you look at our business in Canada, it is weighted towards the eastern part of the country. We went into Ontario first, and because we were expanding from basically the Great Lakes states in the U.S. when we first entered Canada in the mid-'90s. So we have a big chunk of business that's in the Ontario province and then out towards the Maritimes. It was later that we more expanded into Western Canada from the standpoint of where our dollars are. And in that business, the eastern part of the country is stronger than the western part. Obviously, the western part is much more linked to extractive industries."

And we've grown a very nice size business. We're doing well with it. We think the upside is great. It's just hard to grow a business that right now represents about 10 -- just under 10% of our total revenue. So it's a meaningful size business. So it's hard to grow at more than 20-plus percent year-over-year with a business that big. So we're very committed. We think we're going to continue to do well in it for a long time. And part of what we learned is that although Kennametal is a very good supplier, they don't have the full spectrum of what the customers need and neither does any of the other suppliers. So we have developed relationships with a wide range of suppliers, and most of them are enjoying very good growth through Fastenal. So we're still very committed and believe it's a great opportunity for the future of Fastenal. The main thing that makes sense is our fastener and MRO customers, most of those are using metalworking products. We already have developed relationships.

But there's a tremendous amount of opportunity out there, and we think that the opportunity is as good as it's ever been. And that's why we're so focused, as Lee talked earlier, about staying close to our customers, using our same-day store model to grow our business and take market share."

And I think it puts us in a great position to generate very, very strong cash flow. And our operating cash flow this year was even high by our norm because we basically had operating cash essentially in line with earnings. Part of that was the fact that our friends in Washington, D.C. saw fit to continue the bonus depreciation and a few other things there. So we didn't get that tax bill coming, and that defers that off. But really a strong operating cash flow year, and I think we have a great position for next year, because a lot of those investments in distribution are in the rearview mirror rather than in the windshield."

[indiscernible] when you look at it, it's really 2 stories, one things we can control and things we cannot control. Obviously, the things outside of our control, the currency, weather, oil and gas and the port situation in California. But the things we can control, I think when I look at the Fastenal team, I think it was a solid quarter. With that being said, I will always say this when we see single-digit revenue growth, we're not satisfied nor are we happy. But with 8.8% growth, we did some things, and I think have talked to the Fastenal team when you look at some different areas. 
When I look at the fact that we stabilized our gross margins and I know there's been questions there, but I look at the fact that we were able to do some things there and a lot of that is truly execution when you really look at what our people are doing at the point of transaction. The second thing, we challenged our Fastenal team to really live within our means and what I mean by that, that's an old-school BK philosophy that if we don't need it, don't buy it. And you saw that play out in the first quarter when you look at meal, travel and entertainment. We made a conscious decision to spend our money on labor in the stores. We said no to things that may sound nice and may actually help us long-term in some regards but today, we made a decision to invest in our stores, to fuel our growth, to drive profits, and that's what you saw play out on the expense side, even when you take out the tailwind on the fuel. 
The other thing, some other highlights, we grew earnings 14%. That's a nice leverage when you consider we're at 8.8% on the daily average growth. More importantly, and more impressive, I think is the team was able to put up 32.2% incremental margin growth. Again, a number that I think most companies would just -- would be thrilled with. 
When you look at the added energy in the store, I want to -- this is where we really got to get down to what's truly happening boots on the ground. From the end of Q3 2014 up until the end of Q1 2015, we've added 1,000 people into our stores. Now most of those heads came in the last half of Q1. January, folks, I got to tell you, January, coupled with the weather, the fact that the kids aren't back-to-school, it's a rough month for recruiting. But in the second half of February, in the month of March, that's when we started to see the team really start to bring people into the stores. And we'll continue that to looking at a few of our stores. When I look -- I talk about our large stores, our stores with a high number of customer, we would just say a lot of traffic. We're looking at adding products into some of those stores to also build invoice, build the customer satisfaction, all the things that we try to do everyday. 
The other thing and lastly, I think, a shout-out ready to Nick's team on the inventory side coming in at 8 67 [ph] with inventory at 8 69 [ph] a year ago, really is, again, a testament to the Fastenal team and what we can do when we put our minds to it. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan."

Those of you that were wondering I used to refer Nick and the team on the supply chain and really nice job of managing the inventory in a tough environment. I'm going -- typical to prior quarters, I'm going to reiterate a few of the points made, and then touch on a few additional. I have the opportunity to talk a lot of folks in the Wall Street community over the course of the months. And one confusion there's a been and what we talked about in the January call, just want to reiterate here, and that is, Lee touched on it and we really are focused on adding energy into the store to free up the time of our sales people to get out and sell more. And as Lee mentioned in the last 12 months, we've added more than 1,000 people, 1,067 to be exact and we intend to keep adding people to the store level. And internally, the way we've described to our folks is, we've just under 300 district managers in the organization. And we would like to be in a position for each of those district managers to, on a net basis, add an employee into their business each month. And most of that hiring is going to be part-time. We continue to want to beef up our ranks on the part-time. It's really a means for us to recruit long-term because we go into 2- and 4-year, 2-year at technical colleges, 4-year state colleges, we recruit people with a year or 2 years off to school with the hopes that when they graduate, they come work for us full time and we can really hit the ground running and we have a daughter to put a lot of training into them during their entire cycle with Fastenal. 
So if we added 300 people a month and say did it for hopefully 9 months, 10 months in the year, maybe 9 months but you'd be adding about 15% to your FTE base in the business. So you add 3,000 people, they work about a little less than 20 hours a week. So you start with a group of 10,000 FTE, you had 1,500 on that 15%. I don't know if when the dust settles at the end of the year if we'll hit that 15% number or if we'll be closer to 12% or 13%. The economy dictate a little bit how hard we push on that. But that's our intention to invest heavily into time in the store and free up our salespeople who are quite frankly the best and industry, free up their time to get out and sell. 
And as Lee touched on, quite a few of those came in the last really 2 months. In the first quarter here we added about 614 people into our store locations. 
A little bit in the release, starting on Page 5, talk about the environment. Tough environment out there. Our sales growth softened as we got deeper into the quarter. Weather hit us hard in the January, February time frame, oil and gas and some of our customers that are involved with export markets, the currencies are -- U.S. -- strong U.S. dollars not helping export. So our business did weakened as we went through the quarter. 
You really see it showing up in the industrial, the production side of our business and as we talk about in the release, the best way to think about that is on the fastener side. Our fasteners grew about 6% for the quarter, they were growing 10% and 11% in the third and fourth quarter of last year. So that business really slowed down. We don't -- we didn't loose any customers but those customers are producing fewer widgets.
are producing fewer widgets and therefore, they need fewer fasteners. The non-fastener business still maintained double-digit growth. It did weakened. It will move directionally with the other business. But that is a much -- that's a more resilient piece of business for us and part of it really stems the fact that it's heavily influenced by our vending initiative over the last 5 years.
The page -- starting on Page 10, we talk about the earnings. And probably, the things that jump up for me when I look at it personally is I frankly think it's a pretty impressive report. And I'm the first one to let our folks know when we've had a weak quarter. I'm also the first one to let them know we've had a strong quarter. And I think from an execution standpoint, we put on a nice report because we actually hit it well. I mean, we added, in last 12 months, over 1,000 people into our stores, we've managed our labor expenses well. We managed our nonlabor expenses even better. We were helped obviously by the fuel and gas prices in our business but that is a known item for everybody. But even outside of that, we did a wonderful job managing our business. 
Finally, cash flow. Cash flow was very strong, partly as Lee touched on, we did a nice job with our inventory but a strong performance looking at all aspects of the cash flow statement. 
Some things that might be worth pointing out late yesterday, we announced our second quarter dividend of $0.28 a share. That is consistent with our dividend in the first quarter. Late March, we announced that our board had increased our repurchase authorization for buying back stock to 4 million shares. Just to give you a brief history on that, in January, they established a 2 million share authorization. From mid-February until the latter part of March, we spent and bought back 2 million shares. We spent roughly $82 million. We bought back stock at just under $41 a share. This depleted that authority. Therefore, we asked our board, and they agreed, to establish a $4 million authorization to use going forward. We have been in the process of increasing our credit facility, so we're in a position to exercise that if the market sees fit and we'll see how that plays out. 
I think the report is pretty straightforward this quarter. There's not a lot of noise to it. Obviously, the top line weakening is probably the noteworthy thing again, everybody had seen the January, February numbers, so there's no surprises there. 
And I have one item I'll throw out as a reminder, and then we'll switch over to question-and-answer and that reminder is, just a reminder folks, our annual meeting is next Tuesday at 10 a.m. 
With that, we'll turn it over to Q&A."

The flip side of that coin is, if we're visiting a $50,000, you don't have very many $20,000 and $30,000 month customer in that store. I'd be surprised if you have even have one. You visit $150,000 and you could have several, you could have 3 customers doing $20,000 and $30,000 a month. And those customers, first off, they have more ability to negotiate pricing but more importantly than that, we have the ability to go after that business from a different way because that market is a little difference. And so you've offer business because you have more predictability of what you need is and you can be a little sharper with your pencil because you know that those revenue dollars are more importantly than those gross profit dollars. While there's some added expense to serving them, you're still in the same building. You're still the same semi-delivering product. And so when we move from $100,000, if you look at all of our stores over $100,000, our average store in that group is about $165,000 a month. Our gross margin in that group and I'm just reiterating what we talked about earlier, our gross margin of that group is about 90 to 100 basis points lower than the rest of our stores. However, our operating expenses dropped off around 450 basis points. So that $165,000 has profit relative to sales dollars, it's 350 basis points higher, but there's some trade-up. You've given up a little bit of gross margin, you're picking up in operating leverage. We like that trade-offs and so as we move -- once we popped above $100,000 a month in sales, as we move further away from $100,000 a month, I would expect our gross margin to decline. And I'll take that trade-up of $1 here for $4.50 over there."

If you look at our stores that deliver $100,000 a month, that's half our revenue. And so our overall profits are up 100 a basis points from last year. That group was a big piece of that equation. I removed it for a couple of reasons, I think one thing when we started the pathway to profit back in 2007, we dramatically expanded some of the information we disclosed really because it was a big change for Fastenal. 5 years ago, when we introduced the industrial vending, we expanded a bunch of our disclosures because again, that was a big change for Fastenal and one thing we like to be in a position to do always with our shareholders is be able to think out loud, openly and honestly, honestly we feel about what we're doing. I kind of got -- I started the signal last year that I was going to pull back some of the disclosures not because we wanted to disclose less, but we want to make sure that all the stuff that we disclosed doesn't create noise and the takeaway from the message. And it's really -- because you want to focus on here the major things, and hear the minor things. And so what we're trying to pare it back a little bit so we have little bit more concise report.

Where we do have contracts that are tied to a CRU or some type of index, it usually mirrors the turn of our inventory. So really when I look at the gross margin and I try to touch on that in the release, the improvement in gross margin, there's always a seasonal lift that occurs. And the real impact is, we have a fixed cost with our trucking network. That truck has gone -- our [indiscernible] from Minnesota. Another truck [indiscernible] every morning. Whether that truck is getting 10 packages or 20 packages, cost of truck is the same. And so in -- from October to November and December, our volumes will drop off meaningfully because of the seasonality of the business. And so that fixed cost of that truck weighs a little heavily -- more heavily on the sales. When our sales snapped up in the first quarter, that truck still costs us the same, I'm ignoring fuel here for a second, that truck costus us the same, but we're delivering 10% more boxes. And so that lift is always there and that [indiscernible] always there in the fourth quarter. I think what is more important about our gross margin is, we did more than that. We got the lift that's there. It was added a little bit as you've mentioned because our fuel cost came in less than, say, a year ago. Less than even fourth quarter, although that delta is smaller. But more importantly, we did a better job pricing our product and sourcing our product. A lot of our sourcing is done at the store level, which is fairly unique for industrial distributors in general because we're very entrepreneurial in our nature. And it's really looking at everybody square in the eye and challenging everybody, you know what we need to stop this and stabilize and we did a little bit better than that."

And so it makes challenging as we go through the year. At the end of the day though, I really look at that in at a longer-term perspective than just that because I try to understand what are the long-term drivers of our gross margin because that really the things that you focus on. And the long-term drivers of our gross margin really gets down to business and product mix. So customer mix coming with customers at sizes. One thing that we've done a nice job in recent years and by recent years I'm saying the last 15, but we've done a nice job of leveraging this infrastructure that is Fastenal, the store base of Fastenal and growing our large business quite aggressively. That continues to outgrow the rest of the business. Not because we're losing opportunities in the smaller customer base, it's because we're underrepresented in the large customer base. And so we continue to grow a little bit faster there. To me, long-term, the growth in that large customer base as well as the residual impact to our product mix, that ultimately drives our gross margin. And as we see, as our revenue base grows and our gross margin does decline a bit, we do a very nice job of our business model leveraging that cost and doing a nice job with the pretax, which really at the end of the day is of all the numbers in the P&L, really the only one that matters the one at the bottom of the page. Every else above that is just discussion points. But it still healthy to appreciate the points and understand how that differs from business. But ultimately, it gets down to what our customer mix and what's our product mix within these customers."

And so the fact that we positioned ourselves with a great store network, staffed with great people, a distribution and support infrastructure behind the scenes to support the day-to-day activities. Last 5 years, we've built the, basically $0.5 billion a year business selling products through vending machines and all those things support a multilocation customer who wants to have products available for their employees, but doesn't have waste, that's where vending comes in, who wants to have a supplier base that can support them, not in one location or 5 location, but all 20 locations."

It was a -- when you look at it, it's really 2 stories, one of things we can control and things we cannot control. Obviously, the things outside of our control: the currency, weather, oil and gas and the port situation in California. But the things we can control, I think when I look at the Fastenal team, I think it was a solid quarter. With that being said, I will always say this, that when we see single-digit revenue growth, we're not satisfied nor are we happy. But with 8.8% growth, we did some things, and I think hats off to the Fastenal team, when you look at some different areas. 
When I look at the fact that we stabilized our gross margins, and I know there's been questions there, but I look at the fact that we were able to do some things there. And a lot of that is truly execution when you really look at what our people are doing at the point of transaction. The second thing is we challenged our Fastenal team to really live within our means. And what I mean by that, that's an old-school BK philosophy that if we don't need it, don't buy it. And you saw that play out in the first quarter when you look at meal, travel and entertainment. We made a conscious decision to spend our money on labor in the stores. We said no to things that may sound nice and may actually help us long term in some regards. But today, we made a decision to invest in our stores, to fuel our growth, to drive profits, and that's what you saw play out on the expense side, even when you take out the head -- or the tailwind on the fuel. 
The other thing, some other highlights. We grew earnings 14%. That's a nice leverage when you consider we're at 8.8% on the daily average growth. More importantly and more impressive, I think, is the team was able to put up 32.2% incremental margin growth, again, a number that I think most companies would just -- would be thrilled with. 
When you look at the added energy in the store, I want to -- this is where we really got to get down to what's truly happening, boots on the ground. From the end of Q3 2014 up until the end of Q1 2015, we've added 1,000 people into our stores. Now most of those heads came in the last half of Q1. January -- folks, I got to tell you. January, coupled with the weather, the fact that the kids aren't back to school, it's a rough month for recruiting. But in the second half of February and in the month of March, that's when you started to see the team really start to bring people into the stores. And we'll continue that going forward. We're committed to energy in the stores. We're committed also to looking at a few of our stores. When I look -- I talk about that, our large stores, our stores with a high number of customer, we would just say a lot of traffic, we're looking at adding products into some of those stores to also build invoice, build customer satisfaction, all the things that we try to do every day. 
The other thing and lastly, I think a shout-out really to Nick's team on the inventory side coming in at $867,000, with inventory at $869,000 a year ago, really, is, again, a testament to the Fastenal team and what we can do when we put our minds to it. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan."

And for those of you that were wondering, he's referring to Nick Lundquist and the team on the supply chain and the really nice job of managing the inventory in a tough environment.

And for those of you that were wondering, he's referring to Nick Lundquist and the team on the supply chain and the really nice job of managing the inventory in a tough environment. 
I'm going to -- typical to prior quarters, I'm going to reiterate a few of the points made and then touch on a few additional. I have the opportunity to talk to a lot of folks in the Wall Street community over the course of the months. And one confusion there's been and what we talked about in the January call, I just want to reiterate here, and that is -- Lee touched on it, and we really are focused on adding energy into the store to free up the time of our salespeople to get out and sell more. And as Lee mentioned, in the last 12 months, we've added more than 1,000 people, 1,067 to be exact. And we intend to keep adding people to the store level. And internally, the way we've described it to our folks is -- we have just under 300 district managers in the organization. And we'd like to be in a position for each of those district managers to, on a net basis, add an employee into their business each month. And most of that hiring is going to be part-time. We continue to want to beef up our ranks on the part-time. It's really a means for us to recruit long term because we go into 2- and 4-year -- 2-year technical colleges, 4-year state colleges. We recruit people with a year or 2 years left of school, with the hopes that when they graduate, they can come work for us full-time, and we can really hit the ground running. And we have the dollars to put a lot of training into them during their entire cycle with Fastenal. 
So if we added 300 people a month and, say, did it for, hopefully, 9 months, 10 months of the year, maybe 9 months but you'd be adding about 15% to your FTE base in the business. So you add 3,000 people. They work about a little less than 20 hours a week. You start with a group of 10,000 FTE. You add 1,500 onto that. It's 15%. I don't know if, when the dust settles at the end of the year, if we'll hit that 15% number or if we'll be closer to 12% or 13%. The economy's going to dictate a little bit how hard we push on that. But that's our intention, to invest heavily into time in the store and free up our salespeople who are, quite frankly, the best in the industry, free up their time to get out and sell.  And as Lee touched on, quite a few of those came in the last, really, 2 months. In the first quarter here, we added about 614 people into our store locations. 
A little bit in the release, starting on Page 5, talk about the environment. Tough environment out there. Our sales growth softened as we got deeper into the quarter. Weather hit us hard in the January, February time frame, oil and gas and some of our customers that are involved with export markets. The currencies or the U.S. -- strong U.S. dollar is not helping export. So our business did weaken as we went through the quarter. 
You really see it showing up in the industrial, the production side of our business. And as we talked about in the release, the best way to think about that is on the fastener side. Our fasteners grew about 6% for the quarter. They were growing 10% and 11% in the third and fourth quarter last year. So that business really slowed down. We don't -- we didn't lose any customers, but those customers are producing fewer widgets, and therefore, they need fewer fasteners. The non-fastener business still maintained double-digit growth. It did weaken. It will move directionally with the other business. But that is a much -- that's a more resilient piece of business for us. And part of it really stems to the fact that it's heavily influenced by our vending initiative over the last 5 years.
The page -- starting on Page 10, we talk about the earnings. And probably, the things that jump out for me when I look at it personally is I frankly think it's a pretty impressive report. And I'm the first one to let our folks know when we've had a weak quarter. I'm also the first one to let them know we've had a strong quarter. And I think from an execution standpoint, we put out a nice report because we actually hit it well. I mean, we added, in the last 12 months, over 1,000 people into our stores. We managed our labor expenses well. We managed our nonlabor expenses even better. We were helped, obviously, by the fuel and gas prices in our business, but that was a known item for everybody. But even outside of that, we did a wonderful job managing our business. 
Finally, cash flow. Cash flow was very strong. Partly, as Lee touched on, we did a nice job with our inventory, but a strong performance looking at all aspects of the cash flow statement. 
Some things that might be worth pointing out. Late yesterday, we announced our second quarter dividend of $0.28 a share. That is consistent with our dividend in the first quarter. Late March, we announced that our board had increased our repurchase authorization for buying back stock to 4 million shares. Just to give you a brief history on that, in January, they established a 2 million share authorization. From mid-February until the latter part of March, we spent and bought back 2 million shares. We spent roughly $82 million. We bought back stock at just under $41 a share. This depleted that authority. Therefore, we asked our board, and they agreed, to establish a 4 million authorization to use going forward. We have been in the process of increasing our credit facility, so we're in a position to exercise that if the market sees fit, and we'll see how that plays out. 
I think the report is pretty straightforward this quarter. There's not a lot of noise to it. Obviously, the top line weakening is probably the most noteworthy thing again. Everybody had seen January and February numbers, so there's no surprises there. 
And I have one item I'll throw out as a reminder, and then we'll switch over to question-and-answer. And that reminder is, just to remind our folks, our annual meeting is next Tuesday at 10 a.m. 
With that, we'll turn it over to Q&A."

And in that",378,"Yes, I'll take that one. And I don't recall if it was the January call or the October call, but in that previous call, one of the things that I don't know that people always appreciate, we've talked about our pathway to profit table for years. And in that pathway to profit, as our stores mature, they become more profitable because we dramatically leverage the fixed cost structure of our business. The flip side of that coin is if we're visiting a $50,000 store, you don't have very many $20,000- and $30,000-a-month customers in that store. I'd be surprised if you even have one. You visit a $150,000 store, and you could have several. You could have 3 customers doing $20,000, $30,000 a month. And those customers, first off, they have more ability to negotiate pricing. But more importantly than that, we have the ability to go after that business in a different way because that market's a little different. And so you go after that business because you have more predictability of what your need is, and you can be a little sharper with your pencil because you know that those revenue dollars, and more importantly, those gross profit dollars, while there's some added expense to serving them, you're still in the same building. You're still the same semi-delivering product. And so when we move from a $100,000 store -- if you look at all of our stores over $100,000, our average store in that group is about $165,000 a month. Our gross margin in that group, and I'm just reiterating what we talked about earlier, our gross margin in that group is about 90 to 100 basis points lower than the rest of our stores. However, our operating expenses drop off around 450 basis points. So that $165,000 store has profit. Relative to sales dollar, it's 350 basis points higher, but there's some trade-offs. You've given up a little bit of gross margin. You're picking up operating leverage. We like that trade-offs. And so as we move -- once we pop above $100,000 a month in sales, as we move further away from $100,000 a month, I would expect our gross margin to decline. And I'll take that trade-off of $1 here for $4.50 over there."

Well, the operating margin improved, and you see that shine through. If you look at our stores that deliver $100,000 a month, that's about half our revenue, and so our overall profits are up 100 basis points from last year. That group was a big piece of that equation. I removed it for a couple of reasons. I think one thing, when we started the pathway to profit back in 2007, we dramatically expanded some of the information we disclose really because it was a big change for Fastenal. Five years ago, when we introduced the industrial vending, we expanded a bunch of our disclosures because, again, that was a big change for Fastenal. And one thing we like to be in a position to do always with our shareholders is be able to think out loud, openly and honestly, honestly with you about what we're doing. I kind of got -- I started to signal last year that I was going to pull back some of the disclosures not because we wanted to disclose less, but we want to make sure that all the stuff we disclose doesn't create noise and take away from the message. And it's really -- because you want to focus on, here, the major things and, here, the minor things. And so we're trying to pare it back a little bit, so we have a little bit more concise report. And I'm also a firm believer that after 7, 8 years of showing the pathway to profit, for the people that believe it, you don't need to see it every quarter. For the people that don't believe it, after 8 years, I don't know if I can convince anybody."

Where we do have contracts that are tied to a CRU or some other type of index, it usually mirrors the turn of our inventory. So really, when I look at the gross margin, and I tried to touch on that in the release, the improvement in gross margin, there is always a seasonal lift that occurs. And the real impact is -- we have a fixed cost with our trucking network. That truck has gone [indiscernible] Minnesota, and there's a truck that stops there every morning. Whether that truck is carrying 10 packages or 20 packages, the cost of the truck is the same. And so in -- from October to November and December, our volumes will drop off meaningfully because of the seasonality of the business. And so that fixed cost of that truck weighs a little heavily -- more heavily on the sales. When our sales snap up in the first quarter, that truck still costs us the same. I'm ignoring fuel here for a second. That truck still costs us the same, but we're delivering 10% more boxes. And so that lift is always there, and that drag is always there in the fourth quarter. I think what's more important about our gross margin is we did more than that. We got the lift that's there. It was added a little bit, as you've mentioned, because our fuel cost came in less than, say, a year ago, less than even fourth quarter, although that delta is smaller. But more importantly, we did a better job pricing our product and sourcing our product. A lot of our sourcing is done at the store level, which is fairly unique for industrial distributors in general because we're very entrepreneurial in our nature. And it's really looking at everybody square in the eye and challenging everybody. You know what, we need to stop this and stabilize, and we did a little bit better than that."

And we've been in a situation having deflation now for a few years, and so it makes it challenging as we go through the year. At the end of the day, though, I really look at it in a little longer-term perspective than just that because I try to understand what are the long-term drivers of our gross margin because that's really the things that you focus on. And the long-term drivers of our gross margin is -- really gets down to business and product mix, so customer mix, how much of our business is coming through stores of different sizes that we touched on earlier in the call, how much is coming with customers of different sizes. One thing that we've done a nice job in recent years, and by recent years, I'm saying the last 15, but we've done a nice job of leveraging this infrastructure that is Fastenal, the store base that is Fastenal and growing our large account, our national account business quite aggressively. That continues to outgrow the rest of the business, not because we're losing opportunities in the smaller customer base, it's because we're underrepresented in the large customer base. And so we continue to grow a little bit faster there. To me, long term, the growth in that large customer base as well as the residual impact to our product mix, that ultimately drives our gross margin. And as we see, as our revenue base grows and our gross margin does decline a bit, we do a very nice job of our business model leveraging that cost and doing a nice job with the pretax, which really, at the end of the day, is, of all the numbers in the P&L, really, the only one that matters, the one at the bottom of the page. Everything else above that is just discussion points. But it's still healthy to appreciate the points and understand how that differs from business.

It's the steel-based products that are the slowest turning for us. If there is some deflation in non-steel products that we sell, so the non-fasteners, that inventory turns a little faster. There, you can realize some impact. For us, what we are always endeavoring to do is manage the noise of timing, in other words, manage where you're getting price concessions, where you're not. And really, the only time you ever really can get an impact is -- if you go back to -- I think it was the 2008 time frame, there was a lot of inflation going on in steel, and we actually saw some short-term gross margin improvement because of it. That was a little unusual because it was so extreme. But generally speaking, the lift -- the improvement we had in gross margin is -- if there's any impact from steel pricing in there, it's negligible. I'm not sure if it's measurable."

And so the fact that we positioned ourselves with a great store network, staffed with great people, a distribution and support infrastructure behind the scenes to support the day-to-day activities, last 5 years, we've built, basically, a $0.5 billion-a-year business selling products through vending machines.

The quarter was a -- when you look at it, it's really 2 stories, one of things we can control and things we cannot control. Obviously, the things outside of our control: the currency, weather, oil and gas and the port situation in California. But the things we can control, I think when I look at the Fastenal team, I think it was a solid quarter. With that being said, I will always say this, that when we see single-digit revenue growth, we're not satisfied nor are we happy. But with 8.8% growth, we did some things, and I think hats off to the Fastenal team, when you look at some different areas. 
When I look at the fact that we stabilized our gross margins, and I know there's been questions there, but I look at the fact that we were able to do some things there, and a lot of that is truly execution when you really look at what our people are doing at the point of transaction. The second thing is we challenged our Fastenal team to really live within our means. And what I mean by that, that's an old-school BK philosophy that if we don't need it, don't buy it. And you saw that play out in the first quarter when you look at meal, travel and entertainment. We made a conscious decision to spend our money on labor in the stores. We said no to things that may sound nice and may actually help us long term in some regards. But today, we made a decision to invest in our stores, to fuel our growth, to drive profits, and that's what you saw play out on the expense side, even when you take out the head -- or the tailwind on the fuel. 
The other thing, some other highlights. We grew earnings 14%. That's a nice leverage when you consider we're at 8.8% on the daily average growth. More importantly and more impressive, I think, is the team was able to put up 32.2% incremental margin growth. Again, a number that I think most companies would just -- would be thrilled with. 
When you look at the added energy in the store, I want to -- this is where we really got to get down to what's truly happening, boots on the ground. From the end of Q3 2014 up until the end of Q1 2015, we've added 1,000 people into our stores. Now most of those heads came in the last half of Q1. January -- folks, I got to tell you, January, coupled with the weather, the fact that the kids aren't back to school, it's a rough month for recruiting. But in the second half of February and in the month of March, that's when you started to see the team really start to bring people into the stores. And we'll continue that going forward. We're committed to energy in the stores. We're committed also to looking at a few of our stores. When I look -- I talked about that, our large stores, our stores with a high number of customer, or we would just say a lot of traffic, we're looking at adding products into some of those stores to also build invoice, build customer satisfaction, all the things that we try to do every day. 
The other thing, and lastly, I think a shout-out really to Nick's team on the inventory side coming in at $867,000, with inventory at $869,000 a year ago, really is again a testament to the Fastenal team and what we can do when we put our minds to it. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dan."

I'm going to -- typica",1129,"Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everybody. And for those of you that were wondering, he's referring to Nick Lundquist and the team on the supply chain and they did really a nice job of managing the inventory in a tough environment. 
I'm going to -- typical to prior quarters, I'm going to reiterate a few of the points made and then touch on a few additional. I had the opportunity to talk to a lot of folks in the Wall Street community over the course of the month. And one confusion there's been, and what we talked about in the January call, I just want to reiterate here, and that is -- Lee touched on it, and we really are focused on adding energy into the store to free up the time of our salespeople to get out and sell more. And as Lee mentioned, in the last 12 months, we've added more than 1,000 people, 1,067 to be exact. And we intend to keep adding people to the store level. And internally, the way we've described it to our folks is we have just under 300 district managers in the organization, and we'd like to be in a position for each of those district managers to, on a net basis, add an employee into their business each month. And most of that hiring is going to be part-time. We continue to want to beef up our ranks on the part-time. It's really a means for us to recruit long term because we go into 2- and 4-year -- 2-year technical colleges, 4-year state colleges. We recruit people with a year or 2 years left of school, with the hopes that when they graduate, they can come work for us full-time, and we can really hit the ground running. And we have the dollars to put a lot of training into them during their entire cycle with Fastenal. 
So if we added 300 people a month and, say, did it for, hopefully, 9 months, 10 months of the year, maybe 9 months, but you'd be adding about 15% to your FTE base in the business. So you add 3,000 people. They work about a little less than 20 hours a week. You start with a group of 10,000 FTE. You add 1,500 onto that. It's 15%. I don't know if, when the dust settles at the end of the year, if we'll hit that 15% number or if it'll be closer to 12% or 13%. The economy's going to dictate a little bit how hard we push on that. But that's our intention, to invest heavily into time in the store and free up our salespeople who are, quite frankly, the best in the industry, free up their time to get out and sell. And as Lee touched on, quite a few of those came in the last, really, 2 months. In the first quarter here, we added about 614 people into our store locations. 
A little bit in the release, starting on Page 5, talk about the environment. Tough environment out there. Our sales growth softened as we got deeper into the quarter. Weather hit us hard in the January, February time frame, oil and gas and some of our customers that are involved with export markets. The currencies, or the U.S. -- strong U.S. dollar is not helping export. So our business did weaken as we went through the quarter. 
You really see it showing up in the industrial, the production side of our business. And as we talked about in the release, the best way to think about that is on the fastener side. Our fasteners grew about 6% for the quarter. They were growing 10% and 11% in the third and fourth quarter of last year. So that business really slowed down. We don't -- we didn't lose any customers, but those customers are producing fewer widgets, and therefore, they need fewer fasteners. The non-fastener business still maintained double-digit growth. It did weaken. It will move directionally with the other business. But that is a much -- that's a more resilient piece of business for us. And part of it really stems to the fact that it's heavily influenced by our vending initiative of the last 5 years.
The page -- starting on Page 10, we talk about the earnings. And probably, the things that jump out for me when I look at it personally is I frankly think it's a pretty impressive report. And I'm the first one to let our folks know when we've had a weak quarter. I'm also the first one to let them know when we've had a strong quarter. And I think from an execution standpoint, we put out a nice report because we executed well. I mean, we added, in the last 12 months, over 1,000 people into our stores. We managed our labor expenses well. We managed our nonlabor expenses even better. We were helped, obviously, by the fuel and gas prices in our business, but that was a known item for everybody. But even outside of that, we did a wonderful job managing our business. 
Finally, cash flow. Cash flow was very strong. Partly, as Lee touched on, we did a nice job with our inventory, but a strong performance looking at all aspects of the cash flow statement. 
Some things that might be worth pointing out. Late yesterday, we announced our second quarter dividend of $0.28 a share. That is consistent with our dividend in the first quarter. Late March, we announced that our Board had increased our repurchase authorization for buying back stock to 4 million shares. Just to give you a brief history on that, in January, they established a 2 million share authorization. From mid-February until the latter part of March, we spent and bought back 2 million shares. We spent roughly $82 million. We bought back stock at just under $41 a share. This depleted that authority. Therefore, we asked our Board, and they agreed, to establish a 4 million authorization to use going forward. We have been in the process of increasing our credit facility, so we're in a position to exercise that if the market sees fit, and we'll see how that plays out. 
I think the report is pretty straightforward this quarter. There's not a lot of noise to it. Obviously, the top line weakening is probably the most noteworthy thing. Again, everybody had seen January and February numbers, so there's no surprises there. 
And I have one item I'll throw out as a reminder, and then we'll switch over to question-and-answer. And that reminder is, just to remind our folks, our annual meeting is next Tuesday at 10 a.m. 
With that, we'll turn it over to Q&A."

And I don't recall if it was the January call or the October call, but in that previous call -- one of the things that I don't know that people always appreciate, we've talked about our pathway to profit table for years. And in that pathway to profit, as our stores mature, they become more profitable because we dramatically leverage the fixed cost structure of our business. The flip side of that coin is if we're visiting a $50,000 store, you don't have very many $20,000- and $30,000-a-month customers in that store. I'd be surprised if you even have one. You visit a $150,000 store, and you could have several. You could have 3 customers doing $20,000, $30,000 a month. And those customers, first off, they have more ability to negotiate pricing. But more importantly than that, we have the ability to go after that business in a different way because that market's a little different. And so you go after that business because you have more predictability of what your need is, and you can be a little sharper with your pencil because you know that those revenue dollars, and more importantly, those gross profit dollars, while there's some added expense to serving them, you're still in the same building. You're still the same semi delivering product. And so when we move from a $100,000 store -- if you look at all of our stores over $100,000, our average store in that group is about $165,000 a month. Our gross margin in that group, and I'm just reiterating what we talked about earlier, our gross margin in that group is about 90 to 100 basis points lower than the rest of our stores. However, our operating expenses drop off around 450 basis points. So that $165,000 store has profit, relative to the sales dollar, it's 350 basis points higher, but there's some trade-offs. You've given up a little bit of gross margin. You're picking up in operating leverage. We like that trade-off. And so as we move -- once we've popped above $100,000 a month in sales, as we move further away from $100,000 a month, I would expect our gross margin to decline. And I'll take that trade-off of $1 here for $4.50 over there."

If you look at our stores that do over $100,000 a month, that's about half our revenue, and so our overall profits are up 100 basis points from last year. That group was a big piece of that equation. I removed it for a couple of reasons. I think one thing, when we started the pathway to profit back in 2007, we dramatically expanded some of the information we disclose really because it was a big change for Fastenal. Five years ago, when we introduced the industrial vending, we expanded a bunch of our disclosures because, again, that was a big change for Fastenal. And one thing we like to be in a position to do always with our shareholders is be able to think out loud, openly and honestly with you about what we're doing. I kind of got -- I started to signal last year that I was going to pull back some of the disclosures not because we want to disclose less, but we want to make sure that all the stuff we disclose doesn't create noise and take away from the message. And it's really tough, because you want to focus on, here are the major things and here are the minor things. And so we're trying to pare it back a little bit, so we have a little bit more concise of a report. And I also am a firm believer that after 7, 8 years of showing the pathway to profit, for the people that believe it, you don't need to see it every quarter. For the people that don't believe it, after 8 years, I don't know if I'm going to convince anybody."

Where we do have contracts that are tied to a CRU or some other type of index, it usually mirrors the turn of our inventory. So really, when I look at the gross margin, and I tried to touch on that in the release, the improvement in gross margin, there is always a seasonal lift that occurs. And the real impact is -- we have a fixed cost with our trucking network. That truck is going -- our [indiscernible] from Winona is Red Wing, Minnesota, and there's a truck that stops there every morning. Whether that truck is carrying 10 packages or 20 packages, the cost of the truck is the same. And so in -- from October to November and December, our volumes will drop off meaningfully because of the seasonality of the business. And so that fixed cost of that truck weighs a little heavily -- more heavily on the sales. When our sales snap up in the first quarter, that truck still costs us the same. I'm ignoring fuel here for a second. That truck still costs us the same, but we're delivering 10% more boxes. And so that lift is always there, and that drag is always there in the fourth quarter. I think what's more important about our gross margin is we did more than that. We got the lift that's there. It was added a little bit, as you mentioned, because our fuel costs came in less than, say, a year ago, less than even the fourth quarter, although that delta is smaller. But more importantly, we did a better job pricing our product and sourcing our product. A lot of our sourcing is done at the store level, which is fairly unique for industrial distributors in general because we're very entrepreneurial in our nature. And it's really looking at everybody square in the eye and challenging everybody. You know what, we need to stop this and stabilize, and we did a little bit better than that."

That continues to outgrow the rest of the business, not because we're losing opportunities in the smaller customer base, it's because we're underrepresented in the large customer base. And so we continue to grow a little bit faster there. To me, long term, the growth in that large customer base as well as the residual impact to our product mix, that ultimately drives our gross margin. And as we see, as our revenue base grows and our gross margin does decline a bit, we do a very nice job of our business model leveraging that cost and doing a nice job with the pretax, which really, at the end of the day, is, of all the numbers in the P&L, really the only one that matters is the one at the bottom of the page. Everything else above that is just discussion points. But it's still healthy to appreciate the points and understand how that differs from business. But ultimately, it gets down to what's our customer mix and what's our product mix within those customers."

So the core of our business is really in the province of Ontario. That business there has held up reasonably well, if I'm looking at Canadian dollar to Canadian dollar. Obviously, the Canadian currency is very much tied to the fact that their economy is tied to extractive industries, and the weakness in oil and gas, the weakness in energy in general has not helped their currency. So we're -- in a local currency basis, we're growing reasonably well.

Today, I'd like to begin the call to answer the question on what is our opinion of the economy. And when I say that it's a tough economy and a tough environment, I'm really centering at around 5 areas for us, it's nonres, it's oil and gas, ag, manufacturing and, of course, the currency. And so tough environment.  But when I look at it, given this quarter, I think it's a solid quarter of execution given the revenue number. We were able to leverage our growth of 5% into 8.9% pretax growth. We were able to raise our pretax percentage to 22.6% and incremental to 40. 
Now when we talk about execution, the word that comes to mind for me I think many of our folks within Fastenal is discipline. To execute, you must be disciplined. And so we put a call out to our folks to the Blue Team, we call them and we ask them to scrutinize every expense and to reduce where possible. The reason we did this, and we tell our folks over and over, why are we doing what we do, and we make it very clear. In this point, we look to reduce expenses so we could add energy into the stores. And to that point, year-over-year, we're up about 1,129 people. 910 folks we've added in the stores, that's a 9.4% increase. And what's nice and what I want to point out here is a few quarters back, our adds were almost identical whether it was nonselling or selling. Today, that 9.4% year-over-year, it is 4.9% on the nonselling. We're starting again showed disciplined and balance and what we're trying to do in our growth initiative of offering marketing more energy into our stores, again, to offer a high level of service, immediate service, when needed to stay online on these large key customers and to serve our customers on a local level. 
And so the other point that I look at for the quarter that's a highlight is we were able to sign 5,144 machines compared to 3,962 in the previous quarter. And today, it's our pleasure to point out that we have hit a milestone of 50,000 installs, and we've done this all in just over 5 years. So all in all, a solid quarter, but we will continue to pour energy into our growth drivers. Dan?"

We changed up the look of our press release with this quarter. Hopefully, you find it useful. We try to really boil it down and summarize it a little better than I think we've done in the past. Our Q, which will go out on Friday still has a little more meat than you've grown accustomed to in the past, but we felt the best way to communicate is to get to the point fast. And if you want a little more detail, cover some stuff on the call and cover stuff on the general Q. 
The cash flow for the quarter, I'll touch on a few things and then I'll kind of work back through the press release a little bit. Operating cash, year-to-date, 97.5% of our earnings. We feel good about that number. Typically, we think a good number for Fastenal is in that low-90s, 90%, 95% neighborhood. So we feel good about what we're doing. We're doing a nice job. Obviously, the accounts receivable growth is really, really centers on what's going on with our sales growth. 
But I think we're doing a nice job managing the growth of inventory. There's a lot of places we have a found where we could free up some inventory dollars. There's a lot of places where, quite frankly, we want to invest some additional inventory dollars. But I think all in all, in total, we're doing a nice job of managing in the first 6 months of the year, and I'm confident in our ability to managing that in the future. 
If I look at our CapEx, no surprises there. We talked at the -- in our annual report about what we expect of our CapEx for the year to be. That number was moderating from what had been the last few years. A lot of our big distribution projects are behind us. with Automation and a bunch of our DCs over the last 3 years. 
Our vending, we spent a lot of money for about 3 years building up our vending capacity, both from the standpoint of the teams and our equipment. And now we're more of a steady state mode and so that number has come down a little bit to better match what we're actually installing as opposed to building a base of machines. And so feel good about our CapEx in the first 6 months of this year. 
Free cash, which is operating, minus our net CapEx, about $177 million so about 66% of our earnings. Again, I believe a very good number for Fastenal. 
We, in the first 6 months of this year, paid out about $165 million in dividends so about 61% of earnings. So most of our free cash flow went to funding dividends thus far this year. As you all know, we bought back some stock in the latter half of 2014, and we've been busy buying back some stock in the first 4.5 months of 2015. We think it's a good wise decision for our shareholders. So year-to-date, we've bought back about $250 million worth of stock, and we borrowed about $240 million to fund it. And that's a quick snapshot of our cash flow. We think it's good decisions for our shareholders, short term and long term.
In the first page of the press release, continuing on to the second page of the press release. I touched on 4 bullets about the business that I wanted to add, I'm going to touch on it again here. The first one, I think, Lee did a great job talking about the people side of the business. We're people into the stores. We're trying to really allow the efficiency of the organization between the automation we put in, some of the technology we've put in them, everybody working smarter everyday to minimize what we're adding outside the store to minimize the expense growth there. And I think we did a nice job of adding people into the right spots in the first 6 months. 
Item 2 touches on, we've been hit hard this year by a number of factors. In here, I talk about oil and gas. I don't there's any surprise about that. Our customers has been hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Most of our businesses in the U.S. and anything that impairs the manufacturing output of this country impacts us. And the strong dollar has done some of that. We also sell a fair amount into Canada and that business is all denominated in the Canadian currency. So that's created some headwinds for us. I site in bullet 2 that we some signs of stabilization in the oil and gas, and I wanted to share a little bit more insight what I mean by that.
As you know, from our press releases and our filings over the years, we've put a lot of emphasis. We try to really understand the trends of our business. What's going on to improve our business. What's going on to hurt our business. And if I look at the Texas and Louisiana geography within our business and I look at that business and look at their sequential patterns, so not the company numbers, but those 2 states and look at those sequential patterns and what's actually happening in our business, the story is really different in 3 distinct mode -- time periods this year. 
In the January and February time period, if I look at history, and I look at actual results, there's about a 9 or 10 percentage point delta between what history says should happen and what's actually happening. So from January to February, if history says we should be up 2% sequentially, we're 9 or 10 points off that and we're down 7 or 8 points. So I want to explain what I'm talking about. In the March, April and May time frame, that 9 or 10 point delta, the deficiency in our sequential pattern contracted to about 4. In June, it contracted to 2 and change. 
Now doesn't mean, I mean, our year-over-year numbers are pretty weak right now. But sequentially, the trends are starting to move closer to normal and that makes me feel better about what it means for third quarter and fourth quarter and going into next year as far as the health of that underlying business. So I just wanted to touch on that.
Point #3, gross profit is set by large accounts. It's no secret that our growth has been driven by the success we've enjoyed in leveraging this network we've built into growing a large account business. Because for so many years, most of our growth centered on local customers, local business as we were rolling out our store network. As we've been -- as we've developed our store network in the last 15, 20 years, we've very aggressively gone after large-account business. We've had great success there. That business does not operate at company-wide gross margins. But the beauty of going after that business is we can afford to go out to that business even with the lower gross profits because it leverages the network we already have in place. And so those gross profit dollars shine right through quite well to the bottom line. In fact, this quarter, the -- if you look at it, for every dollar in sales, we pick up about $0.41 in gross profit.
$0.40 of that $0.41 actually made its way down to our pretax line because our operating expenses were essentially flat. 
Now that's in -- in spite of the fact that we were adding people at a very fast clip in the last, as we site in the release, in the last 12 months, we've added almost 1,400 people into the organization and increase to 7.7%. We funded that by not spending dollars everywhere else, and that's exciting part about what we were able to accomplish in the last 12 months in my opinion. And again, the fourth point just touches on what I just said, the strong incremental margins. 
I'm sure there's been periods in our history where we've had incremental margins of 40%. I'd have to go back to Bob and see back in the 70s quarter-by-quarter, if he has that information still. I can't recall the time in my 20 year -- 19 years her at Fastenal that we've done it and some really, really impress with that. 
Some thoughts on revenue growth. And in the past, I've touched on this in passing in the calls, sometimes I don't want to go too deep into the numbers, into the weeds because I'll lose everybody on the call. But I think it's helpful to understand our business and in the press release, I touched on we're really 2 distributors in one. We're this fastener distributor that has built the book of business over the last 50 years, and we're an MRO distributor that's really built up that business in the last 20 years. We really started to expand our product lines beyond disasters in the early to mid-1990s and have grown that nonfastener business now it'll be 60% of our sales. And that 40% fastener and 60% nonfasteners are really different businesses, different end markets going through a common channel. 
And so if I look at that fastener business, a lot of production business in there. The beauty of that business is incredibly sticky. It's really invasive and complicated and painful to switch a fastener supplier because that's a very tight relationship because I'm suppling you the stuff you need in what you're producing. And the quality, the sources supply, all those things we bring to the table are critical, and it's very, very disruptive to change your supplier. That's the good news of that business. 
The bad news of that business is linked directly to production. If our customers production is down 10%, that business is down 10%. If our customers production is down 30%, that business is down 30%. The good news is if it's up 20%, our business grows by 20%. And that's really what we've been seeing in the last few months.
If I look at our top 25 customers and I took a good hard look at that group of business, 11 of those 25 customers were negative in June. 7 of those 11 were negative double-digit. And 5 of those 11 were negative in excess of 25%. That's the negative of being directly linked to their business. 
The positive is when I look at those relationships, these are solid relationships. I visited with most of those customers in the last 6 months. We have a great relationship. We're continuing to strengthen because most of those customers, we are growing our business with them. There's only one in that list think that I can think of where we're not growing our business, and it's actually gone backwards a little bit. The other 24, we're going our relationships, but their business is struggling in this economy. That's the function of the end market economy. 
If I take at a step further and go beyond the 25 and I look at our top 100 customers in the company, that group of customers represent a little bit over 20% of our sales. That group of customers has gone from 7% growth 4 months ago to 2% growth in June. It's still growing, but it's struggling because there's so many in that group that are negative. The good news is, if I look at all of our other larger account customers, all of our national accounts outside of our top 100, that business is growing and growing well.
In March, that business grew 11.3%. In April, it grew at 13.5%. In May it grew at 14.5%. And in June, it grew at 14.2%. That's about Fastenal taking market share. That's not about Fastenal being impacted by the economy. We're out taking market share fast -- as fast as we've ever done. I look at our signings in the first 6 months this year, they're ahead of our signings in the first 6 months of last year. So I feel very good about the underlying business as far as our ability to take market share. But we're struggling with some headwinds right now. 
With that, I have used up a little bit more time that I planned on. I will be quite, and we'll take some questions"

At the start of the year, we talked about a goal that we expressed our people in December of adding 3,000 people into our stores. Now that was anticipating a top line growth a world away from what we're actually seeing. And so what you've seen is that number in the first 6 months is just over 900 people into our stores and I would suspect that when the dust settles into the end of this year, we won't double that number because November and December, we typically pull back but you're probably going to '16, '17 kind of 100 [ph] -- increase. But the dynamic that comes into play is if we saw our business picking up for some reason, we'd ramp that number up. In a single-digit environment, we will endeavor to keep our operating expenses growing in a fashion that you saw in the second quarter. It'll be a little challenging. The one thing that helps us is last year, we had a little bit stronger growth and so some of our incentive comp was a little bit higher. And that's provided one of the puts and takes to keep helping us keep our operating expenses low. But if all of a sudden our sales growth was to take off, you'd see us adding people a little faster. You'll see our incentive expense expand quite quickly. And you'd see your operating expense growth move from that low-single digit into the middle single-digit. To me, I always think about it in context of what do I think about our incremental margin, and I feel very good about our ability -- I was a surprise quite frankly, but the fact that we hit 40%. I thought the number in the 30s would be pretty good and I think a number of around that 30% neighborhood is a pretty good target for us to strive for in the next few quarters."

And that number, as we've indicated about 3, 4 years ago, that number moved up dramatically when we were doing 2 big things at once. We were automating our distribution centers, we were rapidly building up inventory of machines to deploy. So we never had it in a situation where a customer wanted a machine and we didn't have one to deploy. And so I think we had a high watermark of CapEx at 44% of earnings.

Free cash, I think, our bias still leads towards the dividend. We have a lot of shareholders that I believe have grown accustomed to that. We have attracted some shareholders because of that aspect of our business, a growth organization over time that pays out a meaningful yield on the stock. Quite frankly, the marketplace has pushed us to buy back some stock by how you price the stock. If our stocks had a price that was materially higher than it is today, we won't be having this discussion, I don't think. And so I think the question on allocation in the future is really going to center on where is our valuation and I don't mean from an absolute perspective. I mean, where is our evaluation from a relative perspective. Where's our valuation relative to our peers. And the tighter that number is, we're probably inclined to buy back a little more stock."

Typically, most of those employees go into an adjoining -- a neighboring store and it increases our selling potential because you don't have any -- u don't have all that labor that's tethered to the store. But in the short term, that expense is pretty nominal on its impact. And looking at the copy of the Q here, and our employee-related expenses were up about 1% in the second quarter. Our expenses were up about 3.5% and most of that centers on vending. And then our selling-transportation expenses, similar to what we saw in the first quarter, it's down around 20%, 21%. And if i look at our fuel component of that, on the first quarter, we spent just under $9 million in fuel, that's total fuel, that's in cost of goods, about half of that is in cost of goods for d diesel going into semis. About half of that is in operating expenses, the gas that goes into our pickups at the start and that number was just over $9 million in the second quarter.

And I saw a lot of blue vending machines, I was walking around those 2 facilities I was in and so they're very tightly related. But the weakness we're seeing in our top 100 customers heavily heavyweights on what you're seeing on the vending. Because vending, quite frankly, if you think about the vending machine, our goal with the FAST 5000 is when we place it, our goal is to get $2,000 in monthly revenue. And so vending by its nature tends to lend itself to a larger customer rather than a smaller customer.

One of the things I shared with our board yesterday is if you look at our business, we have the 80% of our business that's going through either a U.S. or Canadian store. And 20% of our business, that's either going through what we call an on-site situation or a strategic account store where we have a very close tight relationship with a large customer or our non-U.S. and Canadian store business. If I set those aside, and look at the 80% store business. When we set up the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, most of our business was going through that piece, that store piece. And we said as this piece continues to mature, we could take the operating margins from the 18.3% we were at to north of 23%. This quarter, if I look at the strictly the store subset, so that chunk of business that represents about 80% of our sales, we were at north of 23%. So we actually hit our 'pathway to profit' target in that subset of stores. And we've always said, that's a point in time number because that group of stores is about $106,000 a month in business.

The portion of our labor that's tethered to the store becomes a smaller and smaller portion of our labor pool. Those kinds of things are structural. The things that aren't structural that are part of the tug-of-war of life, if you will, one of the challenges Lee put out to the team, and I think the team responded tremendously to is hey, folks, we are investing in adding all these people. We can't spend money doing other things. We've always been and sometimes we joke about some of the things we travel because that we are. We doubled down on that. Now how permanent that component is a function of the tug-of-life. If we were growing faster, Lee's message resonated quite as deeply with our district managers, our national accounts folks, our regionals because they might be traveling a little bit more because they're visiting more customers, they're visiting more people. They're doing more things and sometimes you dial that back. Maybe you don't need to have that meeting, maybe you have that meeting as a conference call rather then a face-to-face. Maybe you do these things in short-term. But those in the scheme of our expense pool are relatively small but they're very symbolic.

Today, I'd like to begin the call to answer the question on what is our opinion of the economy. And when I say that it's a tough economy and a tough environment, I'm really centering at around 5 areas for us: it's non-res; it's oil and gas; ag; manufacturing; and of course, the currency. And so tough environment, but when I look at it, given this quarter, I think it's a solid quarter of execution given the revenue number. We were able to leverage our growth of 5% into 8.9% pretax growth. We were able to raise our pretax percentage to 22.6% and incremental to 40%. 
Now when we talk about execution, the word that comes to mind for me and I think many of our folks within Fastenal is discipline. To execute, you must be disciplined. And so we put a call out to our folks to the Blue Team, we call them, and we asked them to scrutinize every expense and to reduce where possible. The reason we did this -- and we tell our folks over and over why are we doing what we do, and we make it very clear. And in this point, we look to reduce expenses, so we could add energy into the stores. And to that point, year-over-year, we're up about 1,129 people. 910 folks we've added in the stores. That's a 9.4% increase. And what's nice and what I want to point out here is a few quarters back, our adds were almost identical whether it was non-selling or selling. Today, that 9.4% year-over-year, it is 4.9% on the non-selling. We're starting to, again, show discipline and balance in what we're trying to do in our growth initiative of offering or getting more energy into our stores, again, to offer a high level of service, immediate service when needed and to stay aligned on these large key customers and to serve our customers on a local level. 
And so the other point that I look at for the quarter that's a highlight is we were able to sign 5,144 machines compared to 3,962 in the previous quarter. And today, it's our pleasure to point out that we have hit a milestone of 50,000 installs, and we've done this all in just over 5 years. So all in all, a solid quarter, but we will continue to pour energy into our growth drivers. Dan?"

We changed up the look of our press release this quarter. Hopefully, you find it useful. We tried to really boil it down and summarize it a little better than, I think, we've done in the past. Our Q, which will go out on Friday, still has a little bit more of the meat that you've grown accustomed to in the past, but we felt the best way to communicate is to get to the points fast. And if you want a little more detail, I can cover some stuff on the call and cover some stuff in the general Q. 
The cash flow for the quarter, I'll touch on a few things, and then I'll kind of work back through the press release a little bit. Operating cash year-to-date, 97.5% of our earnings. We feel good about that number. Typically, we think a good number for Fastenal is in that low 90s, 90%, 95% neighborhood. So we feel good about what we're doing. We're doing a nice job. Obviously, the accounts receivable growth is really -- it really centers on what's going on with our sales growth.  But I think we're doing a nice job managing the growth of inventory. There's a lot of places we found where we can free up some inventory dollars. There's a lot of places where, quite frankly, we want to invest some additional inventory dollars. But I think all in all, in total, we're doing a nice job of managing the first 6 months of the year, and I'm confident in our ability to continue managing that in the future. 
If I look at our CapEx, no surprises there. We talked at the -- in our annual report about what we expect our CapEx for the year to be. That number was moderating from what it had been the last few years. A lot of our big distribution projects are behind us with automation in a bunch of our DCs over the last 3 years. Our vending, we spent a lot of money for about 3 years building up our vending capacity, both from the standpoint of the teams and our equipment. And now we're in more of a steady-state mode, and so that number has come down a little bit to better match what we're actually installing as opposed to building up a base of machines. And so I feel good about our CapEx in the first 6 months of this year.  
Free cash, which is operating minus our net CapEx, about $177 million, so about 66% of earnings. Again, I believe a very good number for Fastenal. We, in the first 6 months of this year, paid out about $165 million in dividends, so about 61% of earnings. So most of our free cash flow went to funding dividends thus far this year. As you all know, we bought back some stock in the latter half of 2014, and we've been busy buying back some stock in the first 4.5 months of 2015. We think it's a good, wise decision for our shareholders. So year-to-date, we've bought back about $250 million worth of stock, and we borrowed about $240 million to fund it. And that's a quick snapshot of our cash flow. We think it's good decisions for our shareholders, short term and long term.
In the first page of the press release continuing on to the second page of the press release, I touched on 4 bullets about the business that I wanted to add sense, and I'm going to touch on it again here. The first one, I think Lee did a great job talking about the people side of the business. We're putting people into the stores. We're trying to really allow the efficiency of the organization between the automation we put in, some of the technology we put in, everybody working smarter every day to minimize what we're adding outside the store to minimize the expense growth there. And I think we did a nice job of adding people into the right spots in the first 6 months. 
Item 2 touches on -- we've been hit hard this year by a number of factors. In here, I talk about oil and gas. I don't think there's any surprise about that. Our customers have been hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Most of our businesses in the U.S. and anything that impairs the manufacturing output of this country impacts us, and the strong dollar has done some of that. We also sell a fair amount into Canada, and that business is all denominated in the Canadian currency, so that's created some headwinds for us. I cite in bullet 2 that we see some signs of stabilization in the oil and gas, and I wanted to share a little bit more insight what I mean by that.
As you know from our press releases and our filings over the years, we put a lot of emphasis. We try to really understand the trends of our business, what's going on to improve our business, what's going on to hurt our business. And if I look at the Texas and Louisiana geography within our business and I look at that business and look at their sequential patterns, so not the company numbers but those 2 states, and look at those sequential patterns and what's actually happening in our business, the story is really different in 3 distinct time periods this year. 
In the January and February time period, if I look at history and I look at actual results, there's about a 9 or 10 percentage point delta between what history says should happen and what's actually happening. So from January to February, if history says we should be up 2% sequentially, we're 9 or 10 points off that, and we're down 7 or 8 points. So I want to explain what I'm talking about. In the March, April and May time frame, that 9 or 10 point delta, the deficiency in our sequential pattern, contracted to about 4. In June, it contracted to 2 and change. Now it doesn't mean -- I mean, our year-over-year numbers are pretty weak right now. But sequentially, the trends are starting to move closer to normal, and that makes me feel better about what it means for third quarter and fourth quarter and going into next year as far as the health of that underlying business. So I just wanted to touch on that.
Point #3, gross profit is hit by large accounts. It's no secret that our growth has been driven by the success we've enjoyed in leveraging this network we've built into growing a large account business because for so many years, most of our growth centered on local customers, local business as we were rolling out our store network. As we've been -- as we've developed that store network in the last 15, 20 years, we've very aggressively gone after large account business. We've had great success there. That business does not operate at company-wide gross margins, but the beauty of going after that business is we can afford to go after that business even with a lower gross profit because it leverages the network we already have in place. And so those gross profit dollars shine right through quite well to the bottom line. In fact, this quarter, if you look at it, for every $1 in sales, we pick up about $0.41 in gross profit.
$0.40 of that $0.41 actually made its way down to our pretax line because our operating expenses were essentially flat. 
Now that's in -- and in spite of the fact that we were adding people at a very fast clip in the last -- as we cited in the release, in the last 12 months, we've added almost 1,400 people into the organization, an increase of 7.7%. We funded that by not spending dollars everywhere else, and that's the exciting part about what we were able to accomplish in the last 12 months, in my opinion. And again, the fourth point just touches on what I just said, the strong incremental margins.
I'm sure there's been periods in our history where we've had incremental margins of 40%. I'd have to go back to Bob Kierlin and see back in the 70s quarter by quarter, if he has that information still. I can't recall a time in my 20 years -- 19 years here at Fastenal that we've done it, and so I'm really, really impressed with that. 
Some thoughts on revenue growth. And in the past, I've touched on this in passing in the calls. Sometimes, I don't want to get too deep into the numbers, into the weeds because I'll lose everybody on the call. But I think it's helpful to understand our business. And in the press release, I touched on -- we're really 2 distributors in 1. We're this fastener distributor that has built up a book of business over the last 50 years, and we're an MRO distributor that's really built up that business in the last 20 years. We really started to expand our product lines beyond fasteners in the early to mid-1990s and have grown that non-fastener business now to be 60% of our sales. And that 40% fasteners and 60% non-fasteners are really different businesses and different end markets going through a common channel. 
And so if I look at that fastener business, a lot of production business in there. The beauty of that business, it's incredibly sticky. It's really invasive and complicated and painful to switch a fastener supplier because that's a very tight relationship because I'm supplying you the stuff you need in what you're producing. And the quality, the source of supply, all those things we bring to the table are critical, and it's very, very disruptive to change your supplier. That's the good news of that business. 
The bad news of that business is linked directly to production. If our customer's production is down 10%, that business is down 10%. If our customer's production is down 30%, that business is down 30%. The good news is if it's up 20%, our business grows by 20%. And that's really what we've been seeing in the last few months.
If I look at our top 25 customers and I took a good hard look at that group of business, 11 of those 25 customers were negative in June. 7 of those 11 were negative double digit, and 5 of those 11 were negative in excess of 25%. That's the negative of being directly linked to their business. The positive is when I look at those relationships, these are solid relationships. I visited with most of those customers in the last 6 months. We have a great relationship. We're continuing to strengthen because most of those customers, we are growing our business with them. There's only one on that list that I can think of where we're not growing our business and it's actually going backwards a little bit. The other 24, we're growing our relationship, but their business is struggling in this economy. That's a function of the end market economy.
If I take that a step further and go beyond the 25 and I look at our top 100 customers in the company, that group of customers represents a little bit over 20% of our sales. That group of customers has gone from 7% growth 4 months ago to 2% growth in June. It's still growing, but it's struggling because there's so many in that group that are negative. The good news is if I look at all of our other large account customers, all of our national accounts outside of our top 100, that business is growing and growing well. In March, that business grew at 11.3%. In April, it grew at 13.5%. In May it grew at 14.5%. And in June, it grew at 14.2%. That's about Fastenal taking market share. That's not about Fastenal being impacted by the economy. We're out taking market share fast, as fast as we've ever done. I look at our signings in the first 6 months of this year, they're ahead of our signings in the first 6 months of last year. So I feel very good about the underlying business as far as our ability to take market share. But we're struggling with some headwinds right now. 
With that, I have used up a little bit more time than I planned on. I will be quiet, and we'll take some questions."

For example, at the start of the year, we talked about a goal that we expressed to our people in December of adding 3,000 people into our stores. Now that was anticipating a top line growth a world away from what we're actually seeing. And so what you've seen is that number in the first 6 months is just over 900 people into our stores, and I would suspect that when the dust settles end of this year, we won't double that number because November and December, we typically pull back. But you're probably going to see a '16, '17 kind of 100 increase. But the dynamic that comes into play is if we saw our business picking up for some reason, we'd ramp that number up. In a single-digit environment, we will endeavor to keep our operating expenses growing in a fashion that you saw in the second quarter. It'll be a little challenging. The one thing that helps us is last year, we had a little bit stronger growth, and so some of our incentive comp was a little bit higher. And that's providing one of the puts and takes to keep helping us keep our operating expenses low. But if all of a sudden, our sales growth was to take off, you'd see us adding people a little bit faster. You'd see our incentive expense expand quite quickly, and you'd see your operating expense growth move from that low single digit into the middle single digit. To me, I always think about it in context of what do I think about our incremental margin, and I feel very good about our ability to -- I was surprised, quite frankly, by the fact that we hit 40%. I thought a number in the 30s would be pretty good, and I think a number of around that 30% neighborhood is a pretty good target for us to strive for in the next few quarters."

And that number, as we've indicated about 3, 4 years ago",306,"Well, first off, on the CapEx, if you look at that number over an extended period of years, say, 10 years or so, what you'd see is our CapEx kind of hovered in 25% to 30% of earnings zone typically. And that number, as we've indicated about 3, 4 years ago, that number moved up dramatically when we were doing 2 big things at once. We were automating our distribution centers. We were rapidly building up an inventory of machines to deploy. So we never have been in a situation where a customer wanted a machine and we didn't have one to deploy. And so I think we had a high watermark of CapEx at 44% of earnings. And we really saw this year going down closer to that 30% number and probably being in that kind of zone going forward. So that gives us flexibility from the standpoint of free cash. Free cash, I think our bias still leads towards the dividend. We have a lot of shareholders that I believe have grown accustomed to that. We have attracted some shareholders because of that aspect of our business, a growth organization over time that pays out a meaningful yield on the stock. Quite frankly, the marketplace has pushed us to buy back some stock by how you price the stock. If our stock had a price that was materially higher than it is today, we won't be having this discussion, I don't think. And so I think the question on allocation in the future is really going to center on where is our valuation, and I don't mean from an absolute perspective. I mean, where is our evaluation from a relative perspective, where's our valuation relative to our peers. And the tighter that number is, we're probably more inclined to buy back a little stock."

Typically, most of those employees go into an adjoining -- a neighboring store, and it increases our selling potential because you don't have any -- you don't have all that labor that's tethered to the store. But in the short term, that expense is pretty nominal on its impact. I'm looking at the copy of the Q here, and our employee-related expenses were up about 1% in the second quarter. Our occupancy-related expenses were up about 3.5%, and most of that centers on vending. And then our selling transportation expenses, similar to what we saw in the first quarter, it's down around 20%, 21%. And if I look at our fuel component of that, in the first quarter, we spent just under $9 million in fuel. That's total fuel. That's in cost of goods. About half of that's in cost of goods for diesel going into semis. About half of that's in operating expenses, the gas that goes into our pickups at the store, and that number was just over $9 million in the second quarter. So similar savings to what we saw last year, about $3 million of savings."

And so they're very tightly related. But the weakness we're seeing in our top 100 customers heavily, heavily weights on what you're seeing on the vending because vending, quite frankly, if you think about the vending machine, our goal with the FAST 5000 is when we place it, our goal is to get $2,000 in monthly revenue. And so vending, by its nature, tends to lend itself to a larger customer rather than a smaller customer. Because a $500 a month customer, if we're getting the lion's share of the business, they're probably -- well, they're not a target for a vending machine where you're targeting $2,000 because they don't have that spend."

We've touched on that and really talked about the mix and what it does to gross profit.

And 20% of our business, that's either going through in what we call an on-site situation or a strategic account store where we have a very close, tight relationship with a large customer or our non-U.S. and Canadian store business. If I set those aside and look at the 80% store business, when we set up the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, most of our business was going through that piece, that store piece. And we said as this piece continues to mature, we could take the operating margins from the 18.3% we were at to north of 23%. This quarter, if I look at strictly the store subset, so that chunk of business that represents about 80% of our sales, we were at north of 23%. So we actually hit our 'pathway to profit' target in that subset of stores. And we've always said that's a point-in-time number because that group of stores is about $106,000 a month in business, so I think it's very, very bullish for our long-term ability to drive the profit machine that is Fastenal."

The portion of our labor that's tethered to the store becomes a smaller and smaller portion of our labor pool. Those kinds of things are structural. The things that aren't structural that are part of the tug-of-war of life, if you will, one of the challenges Lee put out to the team, and I think the team responded tremendously to is, ""Hey, folks, we're investing and adding all these people. We can't spend money doing other things."" We've always been frugal with travel, and sometimes, we joke about some of the things we do when we travel because that's who we are. We doubled down on that. Now how permanent that component is is a function of the tug-of-war of life. If we were growing faster, Lee's message might not have resonated quite as deeply with our district managers, our national accounts folks, our regionals because they might be traveling a little bit more because they're visiting more customers. They're visiting more people. They're doing more things. And sometimes, you dial that back. Maybe you don't need to have that meeting. Maybe you have that meeting on a conference call rather than a face-to-face. Maybe you do these things in the short term, but those in the scheme of our expense pool are relatively small, but they're very symbolic. And the fact that we managed our travel, our non-store operating expenses as well as we did, I think, was enhanced by the call to action that Lee put out there 3, 6 and 12 months ago.

Today, I'd like to begin the call to answer the question on what is our opinion of the economy. And when I say that it's a tough economy and a tough environment, I'm really centering at around 5 areas for us: it's non-res; it's oil and gas; ag; manufacturing; and of course, the currency. And so tough environment, but when I look at it, given this quarter, I think it's a solid quarter of execution given the revenue number. We were able to leverage our growth of 5% into 8.9% pretax growth. We were able to raise our pretax percentage to 22.6% and incremental to 40%. 
Now when we talk about execution, the word that comes to mind for me and I think many of our folks within Fastenal is discipline. To execute, you must be disciplined. And so we put a call out to our folks to the Blue Team, we call them, and we asked them to scrutinize every expense and to reduce where possible. The reason we did this -- and we tell our folks over and over why are we doing what we do, and we make it very clear. And in this point, we look to reduce expenses, so we could add energy into the stores. And to that point, year-over-year, we're up about 1,129 people. 910 folks we've added in the stores. That's a 9.4% increase. And what's nice and what I want to point out here is a few quarters back, our adds were almost identical whether it was non-selling or selling. Today, that 9.4% year-over-year, it is 4.9% on the non-selling. We're starting to, again, show discipline and balance in what we're trying to do in our growth initiative of offering or getting more energy into our stores, again, to offer a high level of service, immediate service when needed and to stay aligned on these large key customers and to serve our customers on a local level. 
And so the other point that I look at for the quarter that's a highlight is we were able to sign 5,144 machines compared to 3,962 in the previous quarter. And today, it's our pleasure to point out that we have hit a milestone of 50,000 installs, and we've done this all in just over 5 years. So all in all, a solid quarter, but we will continue to pour energy into our growth drivers. Dan?"

We changed up the look of our press release this quarter. Hopefully, you find it useful. We tried to really boil it down and summarize it a little better than, I think, we've done in the past. Our Q, which will go out on Friday, still has a little bit more of the meat that you've grown accustomed to in the past, but we felt the best way to communicate is to get to the points fast. And if you want a little more detail, I can cover some stuff on the call and cover some stuff in the general Q. 
The cash flow for the quarter, I'll touch on a few things, and then I'll kind of work back through the press release a little bit. Operating cash year-to-date, 97.5% of our earnings. We feel good about that number. Typically, we think a good number for Fastenal is in that low 90s, 90% to 95% neighborhood. So we feel good about what we're doing. We're doing a nice job. Obviously, the accounts receivable growth is really -- it really centers on what's going on with our sales growth.  But I think we're doing a nice job managing the growth of inventory. There's a lot of places we have found where we can free up some inventory dollars. There's a lot of places where, quite frankly, we want to invest some additional inventory dollars. But I think all in all, in total, we're doing a nice job of managing the first 6 months of the year, and I'm confident in our ability to continue managing that in the future. 
If I look at our CapEx, no surprises there. We talked at the -- in our annual report about what we expect our CapEx for the year to be. That number was moderating from what it had been the last few years. A lot of our big distribution projects are behind us with automation in a bunch of our DCs over the last 3 years. Our vending, we spent a lot of money for about 3 years building up our vending capacity, both from the standpoint of the teams and our equipment. And now we're in more of a steady-state mode, and so that number has come down a little bit to better match what we're actually installing as opposed to building up a base of machines. And so I feel good about our CapEx in the first 6 months of this year.  
Free cash, which is operating minus our net CapEx, about $177 million, so about 66% of earnings. Again, I believe a very good number for Fastenal. We, in the first 6 months of this year, paid out about $165 million in dividends, so about 61% of earnings. So most of our free cash flow went to funding dividends thus far this year. As you all know, we bought back some stock in the latter half of 2014, and we've been busy buying back some stock in the first 4.5 months of 2015. We think it's a good, wise decision for our shareholders. So year-to-date, we've bought back about $250 million worth of stock, and we borrowed about $240 million to fund it. And that's a quick snapshot of our cash flow. We think it's good decisions for our shareholders, short term and long term.
In the first page of the press release continuing on to the second page of the press release, I touched on 4 bullets about the business that I wanted to add sense, and I'm going to touch on it again here. The first one, I think Lee did a great job talking about the people side of the business. We're putting people into the stores. We're trying to really allow the efficiency of the organization between the automation we put in, some of the technology we put in, everybody working smarter every day to minimize what we're adding outside the store to minimize the expense growth there. And I think we did a nice job of adding people into the right spots in the first 6 months. 
Item 2 touches on -- we've been hit hard this year by a number of factors. In here, I talk about oil and gas. I don't think there's any surprise about that. Our customers have been hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Most of our businesses in the U.S. and anything that impairs the manufacturing output of this country impacts us, and the strong dollar has done some of that. We also sell a fair amount into Canada, and that business is all denominated in the Canadian currency, so that's created some headwinds for us. I cite in bullet 2 that we see some signs of stabilization in the oil and gas, and I wanted to share a little bit more insight what I mean by that.
As you know from our press releases and our filings over the years, we put a lot of emphasis. We try to really understand the trends of our business, what's going on to improve our business, what's going on to hurt our business. And if I look at the Texas and Louisiana geography within our business and I look at that business and look at their sequential patterns, so not the company numbers but those 2 states, and look at those sequential patterns and what's actually happening in our business, the story is really different in 3 distinct time periods this year. 
In the January and February time period, if I look at history and I look at actual results, there's about a 9 or 10 percentage point delta between what history says should happen and what's actually happening. So from January to February, if history says we should be up 2% sequentially, we're 9 or 10 points off that, and we're down 7 or 8 points. So I want to explain what I'm talking about. In the March, April and May time frame, that 9 or 10 point delta, the deficiency in our sequential pattern, contracted to about 4. In June, it contracted to 2 and change. Now it doesn't mean -- I mean, our year-over-year numbers are pretty weak right now. But sequentially, the trends are starting to move closer to normal, and that makes me feel better about what it means for third quarter and fourth quarter and going into next year as far as the health of that underlying business. So I just wanted to touch on that.
Point #3, gross profit is hit by large accounts. It's no secret that our growth has been driven by the success we've enjoyed in leveraging this network we've built into growing a large account business because for so many years, most of our growth centered on local customers, local business as we were rolling out our store network. As we've been -- as we've developed that store network in the last 15, 20 years, we've very aggressively gone after large account business. We've had great success there. That business does not operate at company-wide gross margins, but the beauty of going after that business is we can afford to go after that business even with a lower gross profit because it leverages the network we already have in place. And so those gross profit dollars shine right through quite well to the bottom line. In fact, this quarter, if you look at it, for every $1 in sales, we pick up about $0.41 in gross profit.
$0.40 of that $0.41 actually made its way down to our pretax line because our operating expenses were essentially flat. 
Now that's in -- and in spite of the fact that we were adding people at a very fast clip in the last -- as we cited in the release, in the last 12 months, we've added almost 1,400 people into the organization, an increase of 7.7%. We funded that by not spending dollars everywhere else, and that's the exciting part about what we were able to accomplish in the last 12 months, in my opinion. And again, the fourth point just touches on what I just said, the strong incremental margins.
I'm sure there's been periods in our history where we've had incremental margins of 40%. I'd have to go back to Bob Kierlin and see back in the 70s, quarter by quarter, if he has that information still. I can't recall a time in my 20 years -- 19 years here at Fastenal that we've done it, and so I'm really, really impressed with that. 
Some thoughts on revenue growth. And in the past, I've touched on this in passing in the calls. Sometimes, I don't want to get too deep into the numbers, into the weeds because I'll lose everybody on the call. But I think it's helpful to understand our business. And in the press release, I touched on -- we're really 2 distributors in 1. We're this fastener distributor that has built up a book of business over the last 50 years, and we're an MRO distributor that's really built up that business in the last 20 years. We really started to expand our product lines beyond fasteners in the early to mid-1990s and have grown that non-fastener business now to be 60% of our sales. And that 40% fasteners and 60% non-fasteners are really different businesses and different end markets going through a common channel. 
And so if I look at that fastener business, a lot of production business in there. The beauty of that business, it's incredibly sticky. It's really invasive and complicated and painful to switch a fastener supplier because that's a very tight relationship because I'm supplying you the stuff you need in what you're producing. And the quality, the source of supply, all those things we bring to the table are critical, and it's very, very disruptive to change your supplier. That's the good news of that business. 
The bad news of that business is linked directly to production. If our customer's production is down 10%, that business is down 10%. If our customer's production is down 30%, that business is down 30%. The good news is if it's up 20%, our business grows by 20%. And that's really what we've been seeing in the last few months.
If I look at our top 25 customers and I took a good hard look at that group of business, 11 of those 25 customers were negative in June. 7 of those 11 were negative double digit, and 5 of those 11 were negative in excess of 25%. That's the negative of being directly linked to their business. The positive is when I look at those relationships, these are solid relationships. I visited with most of those customers in the last 6 months. We have a great relationship. We're continuing to strengthen because most of those customers, we are growing our business with them. There's only one on that list that I can think of where we're not growing our business and it's actually going backwards a little bit. The other 24, we're growing our relationship, but their business is struggling in this economy. That's a function of the end market economy.
If I take that a step further and go beyond the 25 and I look at our top 100 customers in the company, that group of customers represents a little bit over 20% of our sales. That group of customers has gone from 7% growth 4 months ago to 2% growth in June. It's still growing, but it's struggling because there's so many in that group that are negative. The good news is if I look at all of our other large account customers, all of our national accounts outside of our top 100, that business is growing and growing well. In March, that business grew at 11.3%. In April, it grew at 13.5%. In May it grew at 14.5%. And in June, it grew at 14.2%. That's about Fastenal taking market share. That's not about Fastenal being impacted by the economy. We're out taking market share fast, as fast as we've ever done. I look at our signings in the first 6 months of this year, they're ahead of our signings in the first 6 months of last year. So I feel very good about the underlying business as far as our ability to take market share. But we're struggling with some headwinds right now. 
With that, I have used up a little bit more time than I planned on. I will be quiet, and we'll take some questions."

But you're probably going to see a '16, '17 kind of 100 increase. But the dynamic that comes into play is if we saw our business picking up for some reason, we'd ramp that number up. In a single-digit environment, we will endeavor to keep our operating expenses growing in a fashion that you saw in the second quarter. It'll be a little challenging. The one thing that helps us is last year, we had a little bit stronger growth, and so some of our incentive comp was a little bit higher. And that's providing one of the puts and takes to keep helping us keep our operating expenses low. But if all of a sudden, our sales growth was to take off, you'd see us adding people a little bit faster. You'd see our incentive expense expand quite quickly, and you'd see your operating expense growth move from that low single digit into the middle single digit. To me, I always think about it in context of what do I think about our incremental margin, and I feel very good about our ability to -- I was surprised, quite frankly, by the fact that we hit 40%. I thought a number in the 30s would be pretty good, and I think a number of around that 30% neighborhood is a pretty good target for us to strive for in the next few quarters."

And that number, as we've indicated about 3, 4 years ago, that number moved up dramatically when we were doing 2 big things at once. We were automating our distribution centers. We were rapidly building up an inventory of machines to deploy. So we never had been in a situation where a customer wanted a machine and we didn't have one to deploy. And so I think we hit a high watermark of CapEx at 44% of earnings. And we really saw this year going down closer to that 30% number and probably being in that kind of zone going forward. So that gives us flexibility from the standpoint of free cash. Free cash, I think our bias still leads towards the dividend. We have a lot of shareholders that I believe have grown accustomed to that. We have attracted some shareholders because of that aspect of our business, a growth organization over time that pays out a meaningful yield on the stock. Quite frankly, the marketplace has pushed us to buy back some stock by how you price the stock. If our stock had a price that was materially higher than it is today, we wouldn't be having this discussion, I don't think. And so I think the question on allocation in the future is really going to center on where is our valuation, and I don't mean from an absolute perspective. I mean, where is our evaluation from a relative perspective, where's our valuation relative to our peers. And the tighter that number is, we're probably more inclined to buy back a little stock."

Typically, most of those employees go into an adjoining -- a neighboring store, and it increases our selling potential because you don't have any -- you don't have all that labor that's tethered to the store. But in the short term, that expense is pretty nominal on its impact. I'm looking at the copy of the Q here, and our employee-related expenses were up about 1% in the second quarter. Our occupancy-related expenses were up about 3.5%, and most of that centers on vending. And then our selling transportation expenses, similar to what we saw in the first quarter, it's down around 20%, 21%. And if I look at our fuel component of that, in the first quarter, we spent just under $9 million in fuel. That's total fuel. That's in cost of goods. About half of that's in cost of goods for diesel going into semis. About half of that's in operating expenses, the gas that goes into our pickups at the store, and that number was just over $9 million in the second quarter.

And so they're very tightly related. But the weakness we're seeing in our top 100 customers heavily, heavily weights on what you're seeing on the vending because vending, quite frankly, if you think about the vending machine, our goal with the FAST 5000 is when we place it, our goal is to get $2,000 in monthly revenue. And so vending, by its nature, tends to lend itself to a larger customer rather than a smaller customer.

We've touched on that and really talked about the mix and what it does to gross profit.

And 20% of our business, that's either going through in what we call an on-site situation or a strategic account store where we have a very close, tight relationship with a large customer or our non-U.S. and Canadian store business. If I set those aside and look at the 80% store business, when we set up the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, most of our business was going through that piece, that store piece. And we said as this piece continues to mature, we could take the operating margins from the 18.3% we were at to north of 23%. This quarter, if I look at strictly the store subset, so that chunk of business that represents about 80% of our sales, we were at north of 23%. So we actually hit our 'pathway to profit' target in that subset of stores. And we've always said that's a point-in-time number because that group of stores is about $106,000 a month in business, so I think it's very, very bullish for our long-term ability to drive the profit machine that is Fastenal."

That's a case of our occupancy as a percentage of sales continues to decline because we're running more dollars through that same building. The portion of our labor that's tethered to the store becomes a smaller and smaller portion of our labor pool. Those kinds of things are structural. The things that aren't structural that are part of the tug-of-war of life, if you will, one of the challenges Lee put out to the team, and I think the team responded tremendously to is, ""Hey, folks, we're investing and adding all these people. We can't spend money doing other things."" We've always been frugal with travel, and sometimes, we joke about some of the things we do when we travel because that's who we are. We doubled down on that. Now how permanent that component is is a function of the tug-of-war of life. If we were growing faster, Lee's message might not have resonated quite as deeply with our district managers, our national accounts folks, our regionals because they might be traveling a little bit more because they're visiting more customers. They're visiting more people. They're doing more things. And sometimes, you dial that back. Maybe you don't need to have that meeting. Maybe you have that meeting on a conference call rather than a face-to-face. Maybe you do these things in the short term, but those in the scheme of our expense pool are relatively small, but they're very symbolic. And the fact that we managed our travel, our non-store operating expenses as well as we did, I think, was enhanced by the call to action that Lee put out there 3, 6 and 12 months ago. But we demonstrated we can do it when we need to do it because when you're growing your top line 5%, you've got to do things like that, that maybe you wouldn't have to do if you were growing at 12% or 14%."

Today, I'd like to begin the call to answer the question on what is our opinion of the economy. And when I say that it's a tough economy and a tough environment, I'm really centering at around 5 areas for us: it's non-res; it's oil and gas; ag; manufacturing; and of course, the currency. And so tough environment, but when I look at it, given this quarter, I think it's a solid quarter of execution given the revenue number. We were able to leverage our growth of 5% into 8.9% pretax growth. We were able to raise our pretax percentage to 22.6% and incremental to 40%. 
Now when we talk about execution, the word that comes to mind for me and I think many of our folks within Fastenal is discipline. To execute, you must be disciplined. And so we put a call out to our folks to the Blue Team, we call them, and we asked them to scrutinize every expense and to reduce where possible. The reason we did this -- and we tell our folks over and over why are we doing what we do, and we make it very clear. And in this point, we look to reduce expenses, so we could add energy into the stores. And to that point, year-over-year, we're up about 1,129 people. 910 folks we've added in the stores. That's a 9.4% increase. And what's nice and what I want to point out here is a few quarters back, our adds were almost identical whether it was non-selling or selling. Today, that 9.4% year-over-year, it is 4.9% on the non-selling. We're starting to, again, show discipline and balance in what we're trying to do in our growth initiative of offering or getting more energy into our stores, again, to offer a high level of service, immediate service when needed and to stay aligned on these large key customers and to serve our customers on a local level. 
And so the other point that I look at for the quarter that's a highlight is we were able to sign 5,144 machines compared to 3,962 in the previous quarter. And today, it's our pleasure to point out that we have hit a milestone of 50,000 installs, and we've done this all in just over 5 years. So all in all, a solid quarter, but we will continue to pour energy into our growth drivers. Dan?"

We changed up the look of our press release this quarter. Hopefully, you find it useful. We tried to really boil it down and summarize it a little better than, I think, we've done in the past. Our Q, which will go out on Friday, still has a little bit more of the meat that you've grown accustomed to in the past, but we felt the best way to communicate is to get to the points fast. And if you want a little more detail, I can cover some stuff on the call and cover some stuff in the general Q. 
The cash flow for the quarter, I'll touch on a few things, and then I'll kind of work back through the press release a little bit. Operating cash year-to-date, 97.5% of our earnings. We feel good about that number. Typically, we think a good number for Fastenal is in that low 90s, 90% to 95% neighborhood. So we feel good about what we're doing. We're doing a nice job. Obviously, the accounts receivable growth is really -- it really centers on what's going on with our sales growth.  But I think we're doing a nice job managing the growth of inventory. There's a lot of places we have found where we can free up some inventory dollars. There's a lot of places where, quite frankly, we want to invest some additional inventory dollars. But I think all in all, in total, we're doing a nice job of managing the first 6 months of the year, and I'm confident in our ability to continue managing that in the future. 
If I look at our CapEx, no surprises there. We talked at the -- in our annual report about what we expect our CapEx for the year to be. That number was moderating from what it had been the last few years. A lot of our big distribution projects are behind us with automation in a bunch of our DCs over the last 3 years. Our vending, we spent a lot of money for about 3 years building up our vending capacity, both from the standpoint of the teams and our equipment. And now we're in more of a steady-state mode, and so that number has come down a little bit to better match what we're actually installing as opposed to building up a base of machines. And so I feel good about our CapEx in the first 6 months of this year.  
Free cash, which is operating minus our net CapEx, about $177 million, so about 66% of earnings. Again, I believe a very good number for Fastenal. We, in the first 6 months of this year, paid out about $165 million in dividends, so about 61% of earnings. So most of our free cash flow went to funding dividends thus far this year. As you all know, we bought back some stock in the latter half of 2014, and we've been busy buying back some stock in the first 4.5 months of 2015. We think it's a good, wise decision for our shareholders. So year-to-date, we've bought back about $250 million worth of stock, and we borrowed about $240 million to fund it. And that's a quick snapshot of our cash flow. We think it's good decisions for our shareholders, short term and long term.
In the first page of the press release continuing on to the second page of the press release, I touched on 4 bullets about the business that I wanted to add sense, and I'm going to touch on it again here. The first one, I think Lee did a great job talking about the people side of the business. We're putting people into the stores. We're trying to really allow the efficiency of the organization between the automation we put in, some of the technology we put in, everybody working smarter every day to minimize what we're adding outside the store to minimize the expense growth there. And I think we did a nice job of adding people into the right spots in the first 6 months. 
Item 2 touches on -- we've been hit hard this year by a number of factors. In here, I talk about oil and gas. I don't think there's any surprise about that. Our customers have been hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Most of our businesses in the U.S. and anything that impairs the manufacturing output of this country impacts us, and the strong dollar has done some of that. We also sell a fair amount into Canada, and that business is all denominated in the Canadian currency, so that's created some headwinds for us. I cite in bullet 2 that we see some signs of stabilization in the oil and gas, and I wanted to share a little bit more insight what I mean by that.
As you know from our press releases and our filings over the years, we put a lot of emphasis. We try to really understand the trends of our business, what's going on to improve our business, what's going on to hurt our business. And if I look at the Texas and Louisiana geography within our business and I look at that business and look at their sequential patterns, so not the company numbers but those 2 states, and look at those sequential patterns and what's actually happening in our business, the story is really different in 3 distinct time periods this year. 
In the January and February time period, if I look at history and I look at actual results, there's about a 9 or 10 percentage point delta between what history says should happen and what's actually happening. So from January to February, if history says we should be up 2% sequentially, we're 9 or 10 points off that, and we're down 7 or 8 points. So I want to explain what I'm talking about. In the March, April and May time frame, that 9 or 10 point delta, the deficiency in our sequential pattern, contracted to about 4. In June, it contracted to 2 and change. Now it doesn't mean -- I mean, our year-over-year numbers are pretty weak right now. But sequentially, the trends are starting to move closer to normal, and that makes me feel better about what it means for third quarter and fourth quarter and going into next year as far as the health of that underlying business. So I just wanted to touch on that.
Point #3, gross profit is hit by large accounts. It's no secret that our growth has been driven by the success we've enjoyed in leveraging this network we've built into growing a large account business because for so many years, most of our growth centered on local customers, local business as we were rolling out our store network. As we've been -- as we've developed that store network in the last 15, 20 years, we've very aggressively gone after large account business. We've had great success there. That business does not operate at company-wide gross margins, but the beauty of going after that business is we can afford to go after that business even with a lower gross profit because it leverages the network we already have in place. And so those gross profit dollars shine right through quite well to the bottom line. In fact, this quarter, if you look at it, for every $1 in sales, we pick up about $0.41 in gross profit.
$0.40 of that $0.41 actually made its way down to our pretax line because our operating expenses were essentially flat. 
Now that's in -- and in spite of the fact that we were adding people at a very fast clip in the last -- as we cited in the release, in the last 12 months, we've added almost 1,400 people into the organization, an increase of 7.7%. We funded that by not spending dollars everywhere else, and that's the exciting part about what we were able to accomplish in the last 12 months, in my opinion. And again, the fourth point just touches on what I just said, the strong incremental margins.
I'm sure there's been periods in our history where we've had incremental margins of 40%. I'd have to go back to Bob Kierlin and see back in the 70s, quarter by quarter, if he has that information still. I can't recall a time in my 20 years -- 19 years here at Fastenal that we've done it, and so I'm really, really impressed with that. 
Some thoughts on revenue growth. And in the past, I've touched on this in passing in the calls. Sometimes, I don't want to get too deep into the numbers, into the weeds because I'll lose everybody on the call. But I think it's helpful to understand our business. And in the press release, I touched on -- we're really 2 distributors in 1. We're this fastener distributor that has built up a book of business over the last 50 years, and we're an MRO distributor that's really built up that business in the last 20 years. We really started to expand our product lines beyond fasteners in the early to mid-1990s and have grown that non-fastener business now to be 60% of our sales. And that 40% fasteners and 60% non-fasteners are really different businesses and different end markets going through a common channel. 
And so if I look at that fastener business, a lot of production business in there. The beauty of that business, it's incredibly sticky. It's really invasive and complicated and painful to switch a fastener supplier because that's a very tight relationship because I'm supplying you the stuff you need in what you're producing. And the quality, the source of supply, all those things we bring to the table are critical, and it's very, very disruptive to change your supplier. That's the good news of that business. 
The bad news of that business is linked directly to production. If our customer's production is down 10%, that business is down 10%. If our customer's production is down 30%, that business is down 30%. The good news is if it's up 20%, our business grows by 20%. And that's really what we've been seeing in the last few months.
If I look at our top 25 customers and I took a good hard look at that group of business, 11 of those 25 customers were negative in June. 7 of those 11 were negative double digit, and 5 of those 11 were negative in excess of 25%. That's the negative of being directly linked to their business. The positive is when I look at those relationships, these are solid relationships. I visited with most of those customers in the last 6 months. We have a great relationship. We're continuing to strengthen because most of those customers, we are growing our business with them. There's only one on that list that I can think of where we're not growing our business and it's actually going backwards a little bit. The other 24, we're growing our relationship, but their business is struggling in this economy. That's a function of the end market economy.
If I take that a step further and go beyond the 25 and I look at our top 100 customers in the company, that group of customers represents a little bit over 20% of our sales. That group of customers has gone from 7% growth 4 months ago to 2% growth in June. It's still growing, but it's struggling because there's so many in that group that are negative. The good news is if I look at all of our other large account customers, all of our national accounts outside of our top 100, that business is growing and growing well. In March, that business grew at 11.3%. In April, it grew at 13.5%. In May it grew at 14.5%. And in June, it grew at 14.2%. That's about Fastenal taking market share. That's not about Fastenal being impacted by the economy. We're out taking market share fast, as fast as we've ever done. I look at our signings in the first 6 months of this year, they're ahead of our signings in the first 6 months of last year. So I feel very good about the underlying business as far as our ability to take market share. But we're struggling with some headwinds right now. 
With that, I have used up a little bit more time than I planned on. I will be quiet, and we'll take some questions."

For example, at the start of the year, we talked about a goal that we expressed to our people in December of adding 3,000 people into our stores. Now that was anticipating a top line growth a world away from what we're actually seeing. And so what you've seen is that number in the first 6 months is just over 900 people into our stores, and I would suspect that when the dust settles end of this year, we won't double that number because November and December, we typically pull back. But you're probably going to see a '16, '17 kind of 100 increase. But the dynamic that comes into play is if we saw our business picking up for some reason, we'd ramp that number up. In a single-digit environment, we will endeavor to keep our operating expenses growing in a fashion that you saw in the second quarter. It'll be a little challenging. The one thing that helps us is last year, we had a little bit stronger growth, and so some of our incentive comp was a little bit higher. And that's providing one of the puts and takes to keep helping us keep our operating expenses low. But if all of a sudden, our sales growth was to take off, you'd see us adding people a little bit faster. You'd see our incentive expense expand quite quickly, and you'd see your operating expense growth move from that low single digit into the middle single digit. To me, I always think about it in context of what do I think about our incremental margin, and I feel very good about our ability to -- I was surprised, quite frankly, by the fact that we hit 40%. I thought a number in the 30s would be pretty good, and I think a number of around that 30% neighborhood is a pretty good target for us to strive for in the next few quarters."

And that number, as we've indicated about 3, 4 years ago, that number moved up dramatically when we were doing 2 big things at once. We were automating our distribution centers. We were rapidly building up an inventory of machines to deploy. So we never had been in a situation where a customer wanted a machine and we didn't have one to deploy. And so I think we hit a high watermark of CapEx at 44% of earnings. And we really saw this year going down closer to that 30% number and probably being in that kind of zone going forward. So that gives us flexibility from the standpoint of free cash. Free cash, I think our bias still leads towards the dividend. We have a lot of shareholders that I believe have grown accustomed to that. We have attracted some shareholders because of that aspect of our business, a growth organization over time that pays out a meaningful yield on the stock. Quite frankly, the marketplace has pushed us to buy back some stock by how you price the stock. If our stock had a price that was materially higher than it is today, we wouldn't be having this discussion, I don't think. And so I think the question on allocation in the future is really going to center on where is our valuation, and I don't mean from an absolute perspective. I mean, where is our evaluation from a relative perspective, where's our valuation relative to our peers. And the tighter that number is, we're probably more inclined to buy back a little stock."

Typically, most of those employees go into an adjoining -- a neighboring store, and it increases our selling potential because you don't have any -- you don't have all that labor that's tethered to the store. But in the short term, that expense is pretty nominal on its impact. I'm looking at the copy of the Q here, and our employee-related expenses were up about 1% in the second quarter. Our occupancy-related expenses were up about 3.5%, and most of that centers on vending. And then our selling transportation expenses, similar to what we saw in the first quarter, it's down around 20%, 21%. And if I look at our fuel component of that, in the first quarter, we spent just under $9 million in fuel. That's total fuel. That's in cost of goods. About half of that's in cost of goods for diesel going into semis. About half of that's in operating expenses, the gas that goes into our pickups at the store, and that number was just over $9 million in the second quarter.

And so they're very tightly related. But the weakness we're seeing in our top 100 customers heavily, heavily weights on what you're seeing on the vending because vending, quite frankly, if you think about the vending machine, our goal with the FAST 5000 is when we place it, our goal is to get $2,000 in monthly revenue. And so vending, by its nature, tends to lend itself to a larger customer rather than a smaller customer.

I thought that the higher EBIT margin year-over-year with lower gross margins was a big positive. But it's hard to tell how much of that is onetime cost-cutting versus 'pathway to profit' really starting to shine through. And 'pathway to profit' really wasn't shining through last year, for example, because gross margins were sort of coming down so much and offsetting it. So my question is, should investors view your results this quarter as a positive long-term signal that you can raise EBIT margins even if gross margin moderates due to mix?"

We've touched on that and really talked about the mix and what it does to gross profit. But the inherent cost structure that we have and the ability to leverage that cost structure -- one of the things I shared with our board yesterday is if you look at our business, we have the 80% of our business that's going through either a U.S. or Canadian store. And 20% of our business, that's either going through in what we call an on-site situation or a strategic account store where we have a very close, tight relationship with a large customer or our non-U.S. and Canadian store business. If I set those aside and look at the 80% store business, when we set up the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, most of our business was going through that piece, that store piece. And we said as this piece continues to mature, we could take the operating margins from the 18.3% we were at to north of 23%. This quarter, if I look at strictly the store subset, so that chunk of business that represents about 80% of our sales, we were at north of 23%. So we actually hit our 'pathway to profit' target in that subset of stores. And we've always said that's a point-in-time number because that group of stores is about $106,000 a month in business, so I think it's very, very bullish for our long-term ability to drive the profit machine that is Fastenal."

That's a case of our occupancy as a percentage of sales continues to decline because we're running more dollars through that same building. The portion of our labor that's tethered to the store becomes a smaller and smaller portion of our labor pool. Those kinds of things are structural. The things that aren't structural that are part of the tug-of-war of life, if you will, one of the challenges Lee put out to the team, and I think the team responded tremendously to is, ""Hey, folks, we're investing and adding all these people. We can't spend money doing other things."" We've always been frugal with travel, and sometimes, we joke about some of the things we do when we travel because that's who we are. We doubled down on that. Now how permanent that component is a function of the tug-of-war of life. If we were growing faster, Lee's message might not have resonated quite as deeply with our district managers, our national accounts folks, our regionals because they might be traveling a little bit more because they're visiting more customers. They're visiting more people. They're doing more things. And sometimes, you dial that back. Maybe you don't need to have that meeting. Maybe you have that meeting on a conference call rather than a face-to-face. Maybe you do these things in the short term, but those in the scheme of our expense pool are relatively small, but they're very symbolic. And the fact that we managed our travel, our non-store operating expenses as well as we did, I think, was enhanced by the call to action that Lee put out there 3, 6 and 12 months ago. But we demonstrated we can do it when we need to do it because when you're growing your top line 5%, you've got to do things like that, that maybe you wouldn't have to do if you were growing at 12% or 14%."

I'd first like to start out, telling you how happy the board, Fastenal board and myself are to announce, as our new CEO. We're very excited and still kind of considered as a new guy because he won't be 20 years until next year with the company. But we think he's going to do -- really believe he's going to do a great job. He has a great team around him that both Dan and I have developed over the last 30 years or so, and we think Fastenal has a great future under Dan's leadership. Thanks, Dan.
Then I'm going to switch to the quarter. As you know, it's a difficult quarter for Fastenal. Talk a little bit about our sales, September slow down slightly and really it's a story of industrial fasteners and the slowness -- we've entered a slowdown within that part of our business. In the first quarter, we grew our industrial fastener business 5.5%, not great, but market taking share. And then by the third quarter, [indiscernible] negative 4.4, driven by not only volume, but also some deflation in the markets, weak steel prices. We do not believe we're losing share. Actually we believe we're still taking some share, not at the rate that we would like, but or expect, but still taking share. On a more positive note, our non-fastener business grew at 5.9%, taking share, growing that business and that's driven by a great effort on our -- by our sales team and continued success with our vending program.
On the margin side of the business, I believe the team did a very nice job considering the balance of things with margin, plus and negative. Product mix goes against us when the fasteners are not growing. Customer mix goes against us when our large customers are outgrowing our small customers due to our success with the National Accounts program and then the deflation and weak steel prices. The positive on the margin, they help support it to where it is, as we -- transportation cost are lower than they would have been a year ago with lower fuel pricing, so there are some puts and takes and overall, I think the team has done a very good job of managing the margin. And as Bob Karl always reminds me, the margin is more about our pay programs and our incentives and our pay programs than it is about mix. Hard-working, smart people have a way to make those -- the margin work for themselves by delivering additional service to our customers, bringing value to the field. I also feel the team did a nice job on expense control. We are able to add, I believe it was almost 1,300 people, I get so many numbers in my head at this point in the month, I lose it, but I know close to 1,300 people in the year. And still manage our expenses to have earnings leverage, which we've never been able to do that in the past, and that's really a testament, not so much to Dan and I and the senior people, but the people in the trenches are working everyday to run their business as profitably and create opportunities for themselves.
The last thing that I'm going -- commenting on very short today, the attitude at Fastenal, the mindset that we're in right now is a mindset of we need to create our own luck. We are not economists. We don't know what the economy will do over the next 2 to 3 quarters. We're not real optimistic that it's going to bounce back quickly, so we need to create our own luck in our organization. And that's what we want to talk to the investing public about on November 5, all the things that we're doing, we're having an Investor Day on November 5, for those of you that don't know that. All of the things that we're doing to help separate ourselves and take more market share in 2016 than we would otherwise be able to do without being very focused. We're going to talk about our increased investment in our stores. We're going to talk about the increased investment in our vending program, how we're refocusing that program and believe that will give us well above average growth through 2016 and beyond. We're going to talk about our on-site program. Dan mentioned that, I believe for the first time in our quarterly release, it came out this morning, about our on-site program. What we're doing with that and why we're so bullish on that as a business, and why that brings value to our customers. And we're going to talk about our web program, our e-business. We know we're not -- we've fallen behind some of our large competitors in that and we're working very hard to make efforts to come back on that and present our customers with a very, very good solution for them to buy products electronically. And there's a common theme to the 4 things that I just mentioned. Our stores, our vending, our on-site and our web. All 4 of those bring value to our customers. They bring product closer, so the customer has to do less work to run their business so they can spend more time running their business than they have to spend buying parts that are necessary to make the place run. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan and he'll cover more information on the quarter. Thank you."

And good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in Fastenal. I'm going to work to keep this focused on the quarter. As Will mentioned, we plan on having an Investor Day, Thursday, November 5, at our Indianapolis facility and we'll be talking a lot about 2016 and beyond and one of the things and I think one of the things that will stand out in that day is always looking at the facts at hand in a business. How are -- in what ways are we great? In what ways do we have the best opportunity to leverage that greatness and the thing that always stands out for me when I think of Fastenal, and that was true -- 20 years ago when I joined the organization, it's true today. And that is we put a lot of energy into recruiting, identifying talent and nurturing talent and unleashing that talent, letting people make decisions in their business to impact their future. And knowing that, the second thing that we're great at is early on, we figured out how to make money in a footprint with a lot of small locations. We figured out, when I look at a lot of investor, distributors, a lot of great companies. regional companies, national companies, one thing that stands out is it's really difficult to make money in a store doing $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000 a month. But if you can figure that out, as you move beyond that, you can put people close to the customer, you can -- you have the ability to provide different type of service than anybody else. And we thrive in a marketplace that wants to be -- that wants to get better, that's wants to be helped by some of the tools, some of the things we bring to the table, and that's really what's driven our ability to excel. If you put great people close to the customer and you have a business model with a structurally low operating cost, you can compensate people fairly for what they're doing, and you build a great machine overtime and you build a good organization over time. And that's really what we've done, and we want to talk about that in early November.
But getting back to the quarter, I've tried to incorporate over the last few quarters into our press release obviously, the usual items that we talk about and disclose, but really some quick bullets on what are some negatives and positives in the quarter? And I always want to get the negatives all the way, so we can talk about the positives because I think the one that is outshines the other. But the reality of it is in 2015, we, our customers have been hit hard by the slowdown in the oil and gas sector and hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the ability of our customers to compete effectively across the globe. And 89% of our sales are in the U.S. so anything that's negative to the U.S. market, is negative to us in the short term as far as managing through it. The other item and you saw it in our September number, we've seen stabilization in a lot of parts of the -- our business in recent months. The Texas market for us, they take a little bit of a step-down in September and the other item I noted is our Canadian business and this is all in local currency, some maybe mindful of that, I've heard a lot about the negatives in the Canadian market and the weakness in the Canadian market. We continue to -- I put in my negatives because we're only growing at 6% and because we were growing at 10% in the second quarter. But I continue to look at that and say, it's a negative and that business has slowed, but it's really a positive in what we're able to accomplish up there in a very tough environment. And it demonstrates the types of things that we can do and Jeff Watson and his team, I think are doing a wonderful job in that business of continuing to manage through and prosper. And if I look at individual regions around the country, there's a lot of similar stories to our business. It's just some geographical areas that are getting really hit really hard, and those areas are big areas for us. But the positive is we're executing well in a lot of places. And I think that shines out and some of the positives I mentioned. We entered the year saying, we weren't sure what the oil and gas was going to mean for us in 2015, but we're going to invest in people at the store level. We're going to invest to keep growing our business long term because the opportunities for us are immense. And year-to-date, we've added 1,234 people into our stores, in the last 12 months, we've added just over 1300, and we've continued to invest in the energy in the business and I think that's meaningful. I did introduce our 2016 estimate for store openings and right now, we're setting a range of 60 to 75 stores, so 2% to 3%. I'm happy to talk about that. The last few years, most of the discussions has been about looking at some of our locations, rationalizing some of our locations and we'll always do that. But also talking about what we're doing to grow the business because again, when you have the inability to break a profit at a reasonable level in the store, and you see opportunities to take market share in a lot of different ways, get close to your customers, this is one of those pieces. The other thing that is positive is when I look at our National Accounts business and I've had the opportunity to work with the folks in our National Accounts team, quite extensively over the last year or so, and some of the things that I've learned over the last year is the opportunity is immense, and we're seeing that shine through in our signings. Now we might have existing customers that the business has been weakened, and we have their business, but their business is down 10%, 20%, 30%. We can't change that in the short term. What we can change is, are we doing everything we can to get all the wallet share we can at that facility with that customer? 
Are we doing things to help their business because when we help our customers, they help us back with more business. Are we doing those things and are we out meeting new customers every day? And when I look at the pace of signings, we are on pace to easily exceed our last 3 years of individual signings with new customers. And I feel very good about where we are even year-to-date and the fact that we're almost at the 2014 number right now as far as signings and we'll easily exceed it through the end of the year. So very excited about what's going on in our National Accounts business. The on-site as Will mentioned, first time I've ever mentioned it in our earnings release. When I look at our on-site business and I think a little bit more expansive view of it when I think of that business, I include in that what we call on-site today as well as what we call strategic account stores. When I combine that business, it's really about dictated locations either physically inside the customer facility or really nearby, dedicated locations that are about this one customer and getting closer and closer to that customer, helping them in their business, becoming more knowledgeable of their business. That business over the last 15 years has grown to be almost 15% of our sales -- just over 15% of our sales today, so it's about 1/3 of our National Accounts business, and it's a great win-win relationship. We can get on-site, lean up some of our operations and really take a much wider view of things we can do for the customer. And I think that bodes well for us into the future. And we'll be talking on that as I mentioned in our meeting in early November. 
As Will mentioned, our gross profit improved in the quarter. We're doing a lot of things to make good, wise decisions every day at the store level, at the district level on how we price our product. Clearly, the faster pieces is tough because there's some deflation going on in that market and now it's creating top line. For us it's creating some gross margin issues for us. Despite that, we continue to manage through it and eat out nominal improvement in our gross profit. 
Finally, and this is about our district managers and about our regional leaders, they're managing the business really well in a tough environment. We've asked them to go out and add people, and to that, they've added 1,300 people into the business. We've asked them to open some locations, to keep building for the future in an environment where our existing book of business is going through a very week period. Despite all those things, we had incremental margin of almost 50% in the quarter. I'm proud of them for what they accomplished because that's about them and because we're asking them to do a lot of things. But with that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. Thank you."

And I don't know if everybody knows all the facts of life, but I've always been a firm believer 80-20 works in a lot of things and I really believe that the large account business and National Account business can be a 70%, 75%, maybe 80% piece of our business if you broaden the definition a little bit of our business long term and the real question is, how do we keep growing that business given that we have a structural advantage in the marketplace. We have people close by, a lot of these locations, a lot of these locations are not in the major metros. They're in various locations through the states, so the promise of Canada and around the planet, and so the fact that we can get close to a lot of them and grow it long term, I think is tremendous because I do believe that's going to be a driver of our growth long term and vending, and on-site are merely another tool to that, growing that business."

We talk about vending, we've added -- greatly increased our sales force. We found other areas to offset those expenses and we found ways to pay for those people. So we had to do is we've had to become very focused and one of the reasons we have to do that is for the investing public, but the bigger reason is for our employees who get paid after performance of the business. And so we're very focused on creating our own look, but at the same time, we're not going to give away the bank and destroy the quarter.

And so it's really all the rest of the things are about things we can do to drive the top line because the deflation -- the negatives that we've had in our business are already embedded in our business. The negatives that have occurred in 2015, the customer that's down 10% or 15% or 20% or 30%, that's in -- that's already inherent in our business, so the things that we can do to drive market share gains faster whether that's National Account signings or driving our vending, driving our on-site as a complement to our National Account signings, all those are wins that are highly profitable wins and allow us the luxury of investing."

There aren't a lot of strong economic indicators that are going to push us up, but we're in a huge market. We're in a market that the U.S. alone is -- who knows $100 billion to $150 billion, so at least $100 billion [ph] we know that. So we have to go out and take share. And our problem today isn't that we aren't taking share. Our problem today is that our base business, as Dan said earlier, they shrunk. Our good existing customers are buying less from us, so to grow at 2%, we have to take share at a much faster rate. If the economy just stabilizes and that base of business just stays flat, we're going to stack business on top, and we're going to separate ourselves from our competitors in the market. And that's what we're planning on. Now if we were to bounce back, and we're to do that at the same time, then you'll see growth like we had -- I believe you'll see growth like we had in 2010 where we're getting a benefit of our existing customers growing at a rapid pace and new business piling on top of that.

So the investment in going on to a new store, we've dialed that in years ago, so we're really, really efficient with that. Our CapEx going into next year is really about what are we doing on the front of vending? What are we doing as far as our distribution centers? And what are we doing as far as our vehicle fleet because those are really where the dollars are driven, not if we open 75 stores or we open 25 stores."

One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""you know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really did like what we've seen and we're going to do that into the future. We're going to do it aggressively."" And so we went from having to distribution centers fully automated. Today, about 84% of are our picks are done through automated DCs. And so what happens is in Ohio, for example, where we have a highly automated distribution center, the dollars that go into there today are more about how much is that business is growing? What do we need in distribution capacity to support that growth? But we're not automating the facility, we're expanding the facility. That's a completely different proposition so our CapEx when I think of distribution will drop meaningfully from where it was in each of the last 3 years. The second one is vending. When we started vending back a number of years ago, we really didn't know how fast this thing will grow. If you recall in 2012, we started the year saying, geez, if we can sign x number -- 10,000 machines for the year, we consider that a homerun, and we hit that number, I believe was around July 6. And the one thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to have a powder dry to support that business, and so not only did we invest capital in the machines we were deploying. We invested capital in the machines to be deployed because we didn't want to outshoot our ability to produce machines. And so we have an inventory of machines that we've been working through. And so that puts us in the luxury of now managing our vending equipment to the needs of the business as opposed to staying well out ahead of it because we have a better idea of our pace."

I'd first like to start out telling you how happy the board, Fastenal board and myself are to announce [indiscernible] as our new CEO. We're very excited. Dan still kind of considered a new guy because he won't be 20 years until next year with the company. But we think he's going to do -- really believe he's going to do a great job. He has a great team around him that both Dan and I have helped developed over the last 30 years or so, and we think Fastenal has a great future under Dan's leadership. Thanks, Dan.
Then I'm going to switch to the quarter. As you know, it's a difficult quarter for Fastenal. Talk a little bit about our sales, September slowed down slightly. And really, it's a story of industrial fasteners and the slowness within the -- slowdown within that part of our business. 
In the first quarter, we grew our industrial -- or our fastener business 5.5%. Not great, but market -- taking share. And then by the third quarter, it had dropped to a negative 4.4%, driven by not only volume, but also some deflation in the markets, weak steel prices. We do not believe we're losing share. Actually, we believe we're still taking some share, not at the rate we would like or expect, but still taking share. 
On a more positive note, our non-fastener business grew at 5.9%, taking share, growing that business. And that's driven by a great effort on our -- by our sales team and continued success with our vending program.
On the margin side of the business, I believe the team did a very nice job considering the balance of things with margin, plus and negative. Product mix goes against us when the fasteners are not growing. Customer mix grows -- goes against us when our large customers are outgrowing our small customers due to our success with the National Accounts program. And then the deflation and weak steel prices. The positive on the margin that helps support it to where it is, as we -- transportation costs are lower than they would have been a year ago with lower fuel pricing. So there are some puts and takes. And overall, I think the team has done a very good job of managing the margin. 
And as Bob Kierlin always reminds me, the margin is more about our pay programs and -- our incentives and our pay programs than it is about mix. Hard-working, smart people have a way to make those -- the margin work for themselves by delivering additional service to our customers, bringing value to the field. 
I also feel the team did a nice job on expense control. We were able to add, I believe it was almost 1,300 people. I get so many numbers in my head at this point of the month, I lose it, but I know close to 1,300 people in the year, and still manage our expenses to have earnings leverage, which we'd never been able to do that in the past. And that's really a testament, not so much to Dan and I and the senior people, but the people in the trenches that are working every day to run their business as profitably and create opportunities for themselves.
The last thing -- my comments are going to be very short today. The attitude at Fastenal, the mindset that we're in right now is a mindset of we need to create our own luck. We're not economists, we don't know what the economy will do over the next 2 to 3 quarters. We're not real optimistic that it's going to bounce back quickly, so we need to create our own luck as an organization. 
And that's what we want to talk to the investing public about on November 5, all the things that we're doing. We're having an Investor Day on November 5, for those of you that don't know that. All of the things that we're doing to help separate ourselves and take more market share in 2016 than we would otherwise be able to do without being very focused. We're going to talk about our increased investment in our stores. We're going to talk about the increased investment in our vending program, how we're refocusing that program and believe it will give us well-above-average growth through 2016 and beyond. 
We're going to talk about our Onsite program. Dan mentioned that, I believe for the first time, in our quarterly release. It was -- came out this morning, about our Onsite program, what we're doing with that and why we're so bullish on that as a -- is why that brings value to our customers. 
And we're going to talk about our web program, our e-business. We know we're not -- we've fallen behind some of our large competitors in that, and we're working very hard to make efforts to come back on that and present our customers with a very, very good solution for them to buy products electronically. 
And there's a common theme to the 4 things that I just mentioned: Our stores, our vending, our Onsite and our web. All 4 of those bring value to our customers. They bring product closer so the customer has to do less work to run their business so they can spend more time running their business than they have to spend buying parts that are necessary to make the place run. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, and he'll cover more information on the quarter. Thank you."

And good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in Fastenal. I'm going to work to keep this focused on the quarter. 
As Will mentioned, we plan on having an Investor Day on Thursday, November 5, at our Indianapolis facility. And we'll be talking a lot about 2016 and beyond. And one of the things -- and I think one of the things that will stand out in that day is always looking at the facts at hand in a business. How are -- in what ways are we great? In what ways do we have the best opportunity to leverage that greatness? 
And the thing that always stands out for me when I think of Fastenal -- and that was true 20 years ago when I joined the organization, and it's true today. And that is we put a lot of energy into recruiting, identifying talent and nurturing talent and unleashing that talent, letting people make decisions in their business to impact their future. 
And knowing that, the second thing that we're great at is early on, we figured out how to make money in a footprint with a lot of small locations. We figured out -- when I look at a lot of industrial distributors, a lot of great companies. regional companies, national companies, one thing that stands out is it's really difficult to make money in a store doing $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a month. But if you can figure that out, as you move beyond that, you can put people close to the customer, you can -- you have the ability to provide a different type of service than anybody else. 
And we thrive in a marketplace that wants to be -- that wants to get better, that wants to be helped by some of the tools, some of the things we bring to the table. And that's really what's driven our ability to excel, is if you put great people close to the customer and you have a business model with a structurally low operating cost, you can compensate people fairly for what they're doing, and you build a great machine over time, and you build a great organization over time. And that's, really, what we've done, and we want to talk about that in early November.
But getting back to the quarter. I've tried to incorporate our last few quarters into our press release. Obviously, the usual items that we talk about and disclose, but really some quick bullets on what are some negatives and positives in the quarter. And I always want to get the negatives out of the way so we can then talk about the positives because I think there's -- the one list outshines the other. 
But the reality of it is, in 2015, we, our customers have been hit hard by the slowdown in the oil and gas sector and hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the ability of our customers to compete effectively across the globe. And 89% of our sales are in the U.S., so anything that's negative to the U.S. market is negative to us in the short term, as far as managing through it. 
The other item, and you saw it in our September number, we have seen stabilization in a lot of parts of the -- our business. In recent months, the Texas market for us did take a little bit of a step-down in September. And the other item I noted is our Canadian business -- and this is all in local currency, so one [indiscernible] mindful of that. I've heard a lot about the negatives in the Canadian market and the weakness in the Canadian market. We continue to -- I put in my negatives because we're only growing at 6%, because we were growing at 10% in the second quarter. 
But I continue to look at that and say it's a negative in that, that business has slowed, but it's really a positive in what we're able to accomplish up there in a very tough environment. And it demonstrates the types of things that we can do. And Jeff Watts and his team, I think, are doing a wonderful job with that business of continuing to manage through and prosper. 
And if I looked at individual regions around the country, there's a lot of similar stories to our business. It's just that you have some geographical areas that are getting really hit really hard, and those areas are big areas for us. But the positive is we're executing well in a lot of places. And I think that shines out in some of the positives I mentioned. 
We entered the year saying we weren't sure what the oil and gas was going to mean for us in 2015, but we're going to invest in people at the store level. We're going to invest to keep growing our business long term because the opportunities for us are immense. And year-to-date, we've added 1,234 people into our stores. In the last 12 months, we've added just over 1300. And we've continued to invest in the energy of the business, and I think that's meaningful. 
I did introduce our 2016 estimate for store openings, and right now, we're setting a range of 60 to 75 stores, so 2% to 3%. I'm happy to talk about that. The last few years, most of discussion's been about looking at some of our locations, rationalizing some of our locations. And we'll always do that, but also talking about what we're doing to grow the business, because again, when you have the inability to break a profit at a reasonable level in the store and you see opportunities to take market share in a lot of different ways, get close to your customer, this is one of those pieces. 
The other thing that is positive is when I look at our National Accounts business. And I've gotten -- I've had the opportunity to work with the folks in our National Accounts team quite extensively over the last year or so. And some things that I've learned over the last year is the opportunity is immense, and we're seeing that shine through in our signings. Now we might have existing customers that their business has been weakened, and we have their business, but their business is down 10%, 20%, 30%. We can't change that in the short term. 
What we can change is, are we doing everything we can to get all the wallet share we can at that facility with that customer? Are we doing things to help their business? Because where we help our customers, they help us back with more business. Are we doing those things and are we out meeting new customers every day? 
And when I look at the pace of signings, we are on pace to easily exceed our last 3 years of individual signings with new customers. And I feel very good about where we are even year-to-date and the fact that we're almost at the 2014 number right now as far as signings and we'll easily exceed it through the end of the year. So very excited about what's going on in our National Accounts business. 
The Onsite. As Will mentioned, it's the first time I've ever mentioned it in our earnings release. When I look at our Onsite business -- and I take a little bit more expansive view of it. When I think of that business, I include in that what we call Onsite today, as well as what we call strategic account stores. When I combine that business, it's really about dedicated locations either physically inside the customers' facility or really nearby, dedicated locations that are about this one customer and getting closer and closer to that customer, helping them in their business, becoming more knowledgeable at their business. 
That business over the last 15 years has grown to be almost 15% of our sales -- just over 15% of our sales today, so it's about 1/3 of our National Account business, and it's a great win-win relationship. We can get on site, lean up some of our operations and really take a much wider view of things we can do for the customer. And I think that bodes well for us into the future. And we'll be talking on that, as I mentioned, in our meeting in early November. 
As Will mentioned, our gross profit improved in the quarter. We're doing a lot of things to make good, wise decisions every day at the store level, at the district level, on how we price our product. Clearly, the fastener piece is tough because there's some deflation going on in that market right now, it's creating top line issues for us, it's creating some gross margin issues for us. Despite that, we continue to manage through it and eke out a nominal improvement in our gross profit. 
Finally -- and this is about our district managers and about our regional leaders. They're managing the business really well in a tough environment. We have asked them to go out and add people, and to that, they've added 1,300 people into the business. We've asked them to open some locations, to keep building for the future in an environment where our existing book of business is going through a very weak period. Despite all those things, we had incremental margin of almost 50% in the quarter. I'm proud of them for what they accomplished, because that's about them and because we're asking them to do a lot of things. But with that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. Thank you."

And when I think of National Accounts and I add to that other large customer pieces that we don't classify as National Account but large regional accounts, a lot of our government business, when you start adding all those pieces together, you're probably talking 56%, 57% of our business. And I don't know if everybody knows all the facts of life, but I have always been a firm believer, 80-20 works in a lot of things. And I really believe that the large account business and National Account business can be a 70%, 75%, maybe 80% piece of our business if you broaden the definition a little bit, of our business long term. And the real question is how do we keep growing that business given that we have a structural advantage in the marketplace. We have people close by a lot of these locations. A lot of these locations are not in the major metros, they're in various locations through the states, through the provinces of Canada, around the planet. And so the fact that we can get close to a lot of them and grow it long term, I think, is tremendous because I do believe that's going to be a driver of our growth long term. And vending in Onsite are merely another tool to that, growing that business."

But we're going to take that inventory out of our -- we're going to redeploy the inventory from distribution to the front line, and we have a very good plan for that. We talk about vending, we've added -- we've greatly increased our sales force. We found other areas to offset those expenses and we found ways to pay for those people. So what we've had to do is we've had to become very focused. And one of the reasons we have to do that is for the investing public, but the bigger reason is for our employees who get paid off the performance of the business. And so we're very focused on creating our own luck, but at the same time, we're not going to give away the bank and destroy the quarter. So looking forward, tight expense control, continue to add people at a certain level and hopefully separate ourselves with additional growth."

And we know what that costs, and that's a pretty modest cost. And so it's really all the rest of the things are about things we can do to drive the top line because the deflation -- the negatives that we've had in our business are already embedded in our business.

There's nothing that points -- doesn't look like oil's going to come back and corn is probably low for a long time. There aren't a lot of strong economic indicators that are going to push us up, but we're in a huge market. We're in a market that in the U.S. alone is -- who knows? $100 billion, $150 billion. it's at least $100 billion, we know that. Or we've -- and so we have to go out and take share. And our problem today isn't that we aren't taking share. Our problem today is that our base business, as Dan said earlier, they shrunk. Our good, existing customers are buying less from us, so to grow at 2%, we have to take share at a much faster rate. If the economy just stabilizes and that base of business just stays flat, we're going to stack business on top and we're going to separate ourselves from the -- from our competitors in the market. And that's what we're planning on. Now if it were to bounce back and we were to do that at the same time, then you'll see growth like we had -- I believe you'll see growth like we had in 2010, where we're getting a benefit of our existing customers growing at a rapid pace and new business piling on top of that.

The real driver of that is, if you think about our business over the last few years, we had 2 big drivers of CapEx. One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""You know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really like what",349,"Yes. The real driver of that is, if you think about our business over the last few years, we had 2 big drivers of CapEx. One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""You know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really like what we've seen and we're going to do that into the future and we're going to do it aggressively."" And so we went from having 2 distribution centers fully automated. Today, about 84% of are our picks are done through automated DCs. And so what happens is, in an Akron, Ohio, for example, where we have a highly automated distribution center, the dollars that go into there today are more about how much is that business is growing? What do we need in distribution capacity to support that growth? But we're not automating the facility, we're expanding the facility. So that's a completely different proposition. So our CapEx, when I think of distribution, will drop meaningfully from where it was in each of the last 3 years. The second one is vending. When we started vending back a number of years ago, we really didn't know how fast this thing would grow. If you recall in 2012, we started the year saying, geez, if we can sign x number -- 10,000 machines for the year, we'd consider that a home run. And we hit that number, I believe it was around July 6. And the one thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to have our powder dry to support that business. And so not only did we invest capital in the machines we were deploying. We invested capital in the machines to be deployed because we didn't want to outshoot our ability to produce machines. And so we have an inventory of machines that we've been working through. And so that puts us in a luxury of now managing our vending equipment to the needs of the business as opposed to staying well out ahead of it because we have a better idea of our pace."

I mean, look at our CapEx next year, there's going to be suppliers to our capital spend that will have a tighter year in 2016 than they have in 2015 because we're not automating 2, 3, 4 distribution centers in the next 12 months. Of that 44 that were negative, 32 of them were negative more than 10%. Of that 44 that's negative, 17 of them were negative more than 25%. That's a sign of a recessionary environment. Because despite all that, we continue to add customers at a faster pace than we've done in recent years. And we -- which is about momentum into the future, which -- we continue to grow our National Account business, which is about momentum. And -- but we have existing customers that are struggling through a pretty weak environment in their own business."

I'd first like to start out telling you how happy the board, Fastenal board and myself are to announce Dan as our new CEO. We're very excited. Dan still kind of considered a new guy because he won't be 20 years until next year with the company. But we think he's going to do -- really believe he's going to do a great job. He has a great team around him that both Dan and I have helped develop over the last 30 years or so, and we think Fastenal has a great future under Dan's leadership. Thanks, Dan.
Then I'm going to switch to the quarter. As you know, it's a difficult quarter for Fastenal. Talk a little bit about our sales, September slowed down slightly. And really, it's a story of industrial fasteners and the slowness within the -- slowdown within that part of our business. 
In the first quarter, we grew our industrial -- or our fastener business 5.5%. Not great, but market -- taking share. And then by the third quarter, it had dropped to a negative 4.4%, driven by not only volume, but also some deflation in the markets, weak steel prices. We do not believe we're losing share. Actually, we believe we're still taking some share, not at the rate we would like or expect, but still taking share. 
On a more positive note, our non-fastener business grew at 5.9%, taking share, growing that business. And that's driven by a great effort on our -- by our sales team and continued success with our vending program.
On the margin side of the business, I believe the team did a very nice job considering the balance of things with margin, plus and negative. Product mix goes against us when the fasteners are not growing. Customer mix grows -- goes against us when our large customers are outgrowing our small customers due to our success with the National Accounts program. And then the deflation and weak steel prices. The positive on the margin that helps support it to where it is, as we -- transportation costs are lower than they would have been a year ago with lower fuel pricing. So there are some puts and takes. And overall, I think the team has done a very good job of managing the margin. 
And as Bob Kierlin always reminds me, the margin is more about our pay programs and -- our incentives and our pay programs than it is about mix. Hard-working, smart people have a way to make those -- the margin work for themselves by delivering additional service to our customers, bringing value to the field. 
I also feel the team did a nice job on expense control. We were able to add, I believe it was almost 1,300 people. I get so many numbers in my head at this point of the month, I lose it, but I know close to 1,300 people in the year, and still manage our expenses to have earnings leverage, which we'd never been able to do that in the past. And that's really a testament, not so much to Dan and I and the senior people, but the people in the trenches that are working every day to run their business as profitably and create opportunities for themselves.
The last thing -- my comments are going to be very short today. The attitude at Fastenal, the mindset that we're in right now is a mindset of we need to create our own luck. We're not economists, we don't know what the economy will do over the next 2 to 3 quarters. We're not real optimistic that it's going to bounce back quickly, so we need to create our own luck as an organization. 
And that's what we want to talk to the investing public about on November 5, all the things that we're doing. We're having an Investor Day on November 5, for those of you that don't know that. All of the things that we're doing to help separate ourselves and take more market share in 2016 than we would otherwise be able to do without being very focused. We're going to talk about our increased investment in our stores. We're going to talk about the increased investment in our vending program, how we're refocusing that program and believe it will give us well-above-average growth through 2016 and beyond. 
We're going to talk about our Onsite program. Dan mentioned that, I believe for the first time, in our quarterly release. It was -- came out this morning, about our Onsite program, what we're doing with that and why we're so bullish on that as  -- is why that brings value to our customers. 
And we're going to talk about our web program, our e-business. We know we're not -- we've fallen behind some of our large competitors in that, and we're working very hard to make efforts to come back on that and present our customers with a very, very good solution for them to buy products electronically. 
And there's a common theme to the 4 things that I just mentioned: Our stores, our vending, our Onsite and our web. All 4 of those bring value to our customers. They bring product closer so the customer has to do less work to run their business so they can spend more time running their business than they have to spend buying parts that are necessary to make the place run. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, and he'll cover more information on the quarter. Thank you."

And good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in Fastenal. I'm going to work to keep this focused on the quarter. 
As Will mentioned, we plan on having an Investor Day on Thursday, November 5, at our Indianapolis facility. And we'll be talking a lot about 2016 and beyond. And one of the things -- and I think one of the things that will stand out in that day is always looking at the facts at hand in a business. How are -- in what ways are we great? In what ways do we have the best opportunity to leverage that greatness? 
And the thing that always stands out for me when I think of Fastenal -- and that was true 20 years ago when I joined the organization, and it's true today. And that is we put a lot of energy into recruiting, identifying talent and nurturing talent and unleashing that talent, letting people make decisions in their business to impact their future. 
And knowing that, the second thing that we're great at is early on, we figured out how to make money in a footprint with a lot of small locations. We figured out -- when I look at a lot of industrial distributors, a lot of great companies. regional companies, national companies, one thing that stands out is it's really difficult to make money in a store doing $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a month. But if you can figure that out, as you move beyond that, you can put people close to the customer, you can -- you have the ability to provide a different type of service than anybody else. 
And we thrive in a marketplace that wants to be -- that wants to get better, that wants to be helped by some of the tools, some of the things we bring to the table. And that's really what's driven our ability to excel, is if you put great people close to the customer and you have a business model with a structurally low operating cost, you can compensate people fairly for what they're doing, and you build a great machine over time, and you build a great organization over time. And that's, really, what we've done, and we want to talk about that in early November.
But getting back to the quarter. I've tried to incorporate our last few quarters into our press release. Obviously, the usual items that we talk about and disclose, but really some quick bullets on what are some negatives and positives in the quarter. And I always want to get the negatives out of the way so we can then talk about the positives because I think there's -- the one list outshines the other. 
But the reality of it is, in 2015, we, our customers have been hit hard by the slowdown in the oil and gas sector and hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the ability of our customers to compete effectively across the globe. And 89% of our sales are in the U.S., so anything that's negative to the U.S. market is negative to us in the short term, as far as managing through it. 
The other item, and you saw it in our September number, we have seen stabilization in a lot of parts of the -- our business. In recent months, the Texas market for us did take a little bit of a step-down in September. And the other item I noted is our Canadian business -- and this is all in local currency, so I want everyone to be mindful of that. I've heard a lot about the negatives in the Canadian market and the weakness in the Canadian market. We continue to -- I put in my negatives because we're only growing at 6%, because we were growing at 10% in the second quarter. 
But I continue to look at that and say it's a negative in that, that business has slowed, but it's really a positive in what we're able to accomplish up there in a very tough environment. And it demonstrates the types of things that we can do. And Jeff Watts and his team, I think, are doing a wonderful job with that business of continuing to manage through and prosper. 
And if I looked at individual regions around the country, there's a lot of similar stories to our business. It's just that you have some geographical areas that are getting really hit really hard, and those areas are big areas for us. But the positive is we're executing well in a lot of places. And I think that shines out in some of the positives I mentioned. 
We entered the year saying we weren't sure what the oil and gas was going to mean for us in 2015, but we're going to invest in people at the store level. We're going to invest to keep growing our business long term because the opportunities for us are immense. And year-to-date, we've added 1,234 people into our stores. In the last 12 months, we've added just over 1300. And we've continued to invest in the energy of the business, and I think that's meaningful. 
I did introduce our 2016 estimate for store openings, and right now, we're setting a range of 60 to 75 stores, so 2% to 3%. I'm happy to talk about that. The last few years, most of discussion's been about looking at some of our locations, rationalizing some of our locations. And we'll always do that, but also talking about what we're doing to grow the business, because again, when you have the ability to break a profit at a reasonable level in the store and you see opportunities to take market share in a lot of different ways, get close to your customer, this is one of those pieces. 
The other thing that is positive is when I look at our National Accounts business. And I've gotten -- I've had the opportunity to work with the folks in our National Accounts team quite extensively over the last year or so. And some things that I've learned over the last year is the opportunity is immense, and we're seeing that shine through in our signings. Now we might have existing customers that their business has been weakened, and we have their business, but their business is down 10%, 20%, 30%. We can't change that in the short term. 
What we can change is, are we doing everything we can to get all the wallet share we can at that facility with that customer? Are we doing things to help their business? Because where we help our customers, they help us back with more business. Are we doing those things and are we out meeting new customers every day? 
And when I look at the pace of signings, we are on pace to easily exceed our last 3 years of individual signings with new customers. And I feel very good about where we are even year-to-date and the fact that we're almost at the 2014 number right now as far as signings and we'll easily exceed it through the end of the year. So very excited about what's going on in our National Accounts business. 
The Onsite. As Will mentioned, it's the first time I've ever mentioned it in our earnings release. When I look at our Onsite business -- and I take a little bit more expansive view of it. When I think of that business, I include in that what we call Onsite today, as well as what we call strategic account stores. When I combine that business, it's really about dedicated locations either physically inside the customers' facility or really nearby, dedicated locations that are about this one customer and getting closer and closer to that customer, helping them in their business, becoming more knowledgeable at their business. 
That business over the last 15 years has grown to be almost 15% of our sales -- just over 15% of our sales today, so it's about 1/3 of our National Account business, and it's a great win-win relationship. We can get on site, lean up some of our operations and really take a much wider view of things we can do for the customer. And I think that bodes well for us into the future. And we'll be talking on that, as I mentioned, in our meeting in early November. 
As Will mentioned, our gross profit improved in the quarter. We're doing a lot of things to make good, wise decisions every day at the store level, at the district level, on how we price our product. Clearly, the fastener piece is tough because there's some deflation going on in that market right now, it's creating top line issues for us, it's creating some gross margin issues for us. Despite that, we continue to manage through it and eke out a nominal improvement in our gross profit. 
Finally -- and this is about our district managers and about our regional leaders. They're managing the business really well in a tough environment. We have asked them to go out and add people, and to that, they've added 1,300 people into the business. We've asked them to open some locations, to keep building for the future in an environment where our existing book of business is going through a very weak period. Despite all those things, we had incremental margin of almost 50% in the quarter.

And I don't know if everybody knows all the facts of life, but I have always been a firm believer, 80-20 works in a lot of things. And I really believe that the large account business and National Account business can be a 70%, 75%, maybe 80% piece of our business if you broaden the definition a little bit, of our business long term. And the real question is how do we keep growing that business given that we have a structural advantage in the marketplace. We have people close by a lot of these locations. A lot of these locations are not in the major metros, they're in various locations through the states, through the provinces of Canada, around the planet. And so the fact that we can get close to a lot of them and grow it long term, I think, is tremendous because I do believe that's going to be a driver of our growth long term.

We talk about vending, we've added -- we've greatly increased our sales force. We found other areas to offset those expenses and we found ways to pay for those people. So what we've had to do is we've had to become very focused. And one of the reasons we have to do that is for the investing public, but the bigger reason is for our employees who get paid off the performance of the business.

And so it's really all the rest of the things are about things we can do to drive the top line because the deflation -- the negatives that we've had in our business are already embedded in our business.

There's nothing that points -- doesn't look like oil's going to come back and corn is probably low for a long time. There aren't a lot of strong economic indicators that are going to push us up, but we're in a huge market. We're in a market that in the U.S. alone is -- who knows? $100 billion, $150 billion. It's at least $100 billion, we know that. Or we've -- and so we have to go out and take share. And our problem today isn't that we aren't taking share. Our problem today is that our base business, as Dan said earlier, they shrunk. Our good, existing customers are buying less from us, so to grow at 2%, we have to take share at a much faster rate. If the economy just stabilizes and that base of business just stays flat, we're going to stack business on top and we're going to separate ourselves from the -- from our competitors in the market.

The real driver of that is, if you think about our business over the last few years, we had 2 big drivers of CapEx. One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""You know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really like what",349,"Yes. The real driver of that is, if you think about our business over the last few years, we had 2 big drivers of CapEx. One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""You know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really like what we've seen and we're going to do that into the future and we're going to do it aggressively."" And so we went from having 2 distribution centers fully automated. Today, about 84% of are our picks are done through automated DCs. And so what happens is, in an Akron, Ohio, for example, where we have a highly automated distribution center, the dollars that go into there today are more about how much is that business is growing? What do we need in distribution capacity to support that growth? But we're not automating the facility, we're expanding the facility. So that's a completely different proposition. So our CapEx, when I think of distribution, will drop meaningfully from where it was in each of the last 3 years. The second one is vending. When we started vending back a number of years ago, we really didn't know how fast this thing would grow. If you recall in 2012, we started the year saying, geez, if we can sign x number -- 10,000 machines for the year, we'd consider that a home run. And we hit that number, I believe it was around July 6. And the one thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to have our powder dry to support that business. And so not only did we invest capital in the machines we were deploying. We invested capital in the machines to be deployed because we didn't want to outshoot our ability to produce machines. And so we have an inventory of machines that we've been working through. And so that puts us in a luxury of now managing our vending equipment to the needs of the business as opposed to staying well out ahead of it because we have a better idea of our pace."

But the piece you have to keep in the back of your mind is we have a natural lift to our business profit as we add dollars to our individual stores.

I'd first like to start out telling you how happy the board, Fastenal board and myself are to announce Dan as our new CEO. We're very excited. Dan still kind of considered a new guy because he won't be 20 years until next year with the company. But we think he's going to do -- really believe he's going to do a great job. He has a great team around him that both Dan and I have helped develop over the last 30 years or so, and we think Fastenal has a great future under Dan's leadership. Thanks, Dan.
Then I'm going to switch to the quarter. As you know, it's a difficult quarter for Fastenal. Talk a little bit about our sales, September slowed down slightly. And really, it's a story of industrial fasteners and the slowness within the -- slowdown within that part of our business. 
In the first quarter, we grew our industrial -- or our fastener business 5.5%. Not great, but market -- taking share. And then by the third quarter, it had dropped to a negative 4.4%, driven by not only volume, but also some deflation in the markets, weak steel prices. We do not believe we're losing share. Actually, we believe we're still taking some share, not at the rate we would like or expect, but still taking share. 
On a more positive note, our non-fastener business grew at 5.9%, taking share, growing that business. And that's driven by a great effort on our -- by our sales team and continued success with our vending program.
On the margin side of the business, I believe the team did a very nice job considering the balance of things with margin, plus and negative. Product mix goes against us when the fasteners are not growing. Customer mix grows -- goes against us when our large customers are outgrowing our small customers due to our success with the National Accounts program. And then the deflation and weak steel prices. The positive on the margin that helps support it to where it is, as we -- transportation costs are lower than they would have been a year ago with lower fuel pricing. So there are some puts and takes. And overall, I think the team has done a very good job of managing the margin. 
And as Bob Kierlin always reminds me, the margin is more about our pay programs and -- our incentives and our pay programs than it is about mix. Hard-working, smart people have a way to make those -- the margin work for themselves by delivering additional service to our customers, bringing value to the field. 
I also feel the team did a nice job on expense control. We were able to add, I believe it was almost 1,300 people. I get so many numbers in my head at this point of the month, I lose it, but I know close to 1,300 people in the year, and still manage our expenses to have earnings leverage, which we'd never been able to do that in the past. And that's really a testament, not so much to Dan and I and the senior people, but the people in the trenches that are working every day to run their business as profitably and create opportunities for themselves.
The last thing -- my comments are going to be very short today. The attitude at Fastenal, the mindset that we're in right now is a mindset of we need to create our own luck. We're not economists, we don't know what the economy will do over the next 2 to 3 quarters. We're not real optimistic that it's going to bounce back quickly, so we need to create our own luck as an organization. 
And that's what we want to talk to the investing public about on November 5, all the things that we're doing. We're having an Investor Day on November 5, for those of you that don't know that. All of the things that we're doing to help separate ourselves and take more market share in 2016 than we would otherwise be able to do without being very focused. We're going to talk about our increased investment in our stores. We're going to talk about the increased investment in our vending program, how we're refocusing that program and believe it will give us well-above-average growth through 2016 and beyond. 
We're going to talk about our Onsite program. Dan mentioned that, I believe for the first time, in our quarterly release. It was -- came out this morning, about our Onsite program, what we're doing with that and why we're so bullish on that as  -- is why that brings value to our customers. 
And we're going to talk about our web program, our e-business. We know we're not -- we've fallen behind some of our large competitors in that, and we're working very hard to make efforts to come back on that and present our customers with a very, very good solution for them to buy products electronically. 
And there's a common theme to the 4 things that I just mentioned: Our stores, our vending, our Onsite and our web. All 4 of those bring value to our customers. They bring product closer so the customer has to do less work to run their business so they can spend more time running their business than they have to spend buying parts that are necessary to make the place run. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, and he'll cover more information on the quarter. Thank you."

As Will mentioned, we plan on having an Investor Day on",1634,"Thanks, Will, and thanks for the message the start of the call as well. And good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in Fastenal. I'm going to work to keep this focused on the quarter. 
As Will mentioned, we plan on having an Investor Day on Thursday, November 5, at our Indianapolis facility. And we'll be talking a lot about 2016 and beyond. And one of the things -- and I think one of the things that will stand out in that day is always looking at the facts at hand in a business. How are -- in what ways are we great? In what ways do we have the best opportunity to leverage that greatness? 
And the thing that always stands out for me when I think of Fastenal -- and that was true 20 years ago when I joined the organization, and it's true today. And that is we put a lot of energy into recruiting, identifying talent and nurturing talent and unleashing that talent, letting people make decisions in their business to impact their future. 
And knowing that, the second thing that we're great at is early on, we figured out how to make money in a footprint with a lot of small locations. We figured out -- when I look at a lot of industrial distributors, a lot of great companies. regional companies, national companies, one thing that stands out is it's really difficult to make money in a store doing $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a month. But if you can figure that out, as you move beyond that, you can put people close to the customer, you can -- you have the ability to provide a different type of service than anybody else. 
And we thrive in a marketplace that wants to be -- that wants to get better, that wants to be helped by some of the tools, some of the things we bring to the table. And that's really what's driven our ability to excel, is if you put great people close to the customer and you have a business model with a structurally low operating cost, you can compensate people fairly for what they're doing, and you build a great machine over time, and you build a great organization over time. And that's, really, what we've done, and we want to talk about that in early November.
But getting back to the quarter. I've tried to incorporate our last few quarters into our press release. Obviously, the usual items that we talk about and disclose, but really some quick bullets on what are some negatives and positives in the quarter. And I always want to get the negatives out of the way so we can then talk about the positives because I think there's -- the one list outshines the other. 
But the reality of it is, in 2015, we, our customers have been hit hard by the slowdown in the oil and gas sector and hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the ability of our customers to compete effectively across the globe. And 89% of our sales are in the U.S., so anything that's negative to the U.S. market is negative to us in the short term, as far as managing through it. 
The other item, and you saw it in our September number, we have seen stabilization in a lot of parts of the -- our business. In recent months, the Texas market for us did take a little bit of a step-down in September. And the other item I noted is our Canadian business -- and this is all in local currency, so I want everyone to be mindful of that. I've heard a lot about the negatives in the Canadian market and the weakness in the Canadian market. We continue to -- I put in my negatives because we're only growing at 6%, because we were growing at 10% in the second quarter. 
But I continue to look at that and say it's a negative in that, that business has slowed, but it's really a positive in what we're able to accomplish up there in a very tough environment. And it demonstrates the types of things that we can do. And Jeff Watts and his team, I think, are doing a wonderful job with that business of continuing to manage through and prosper. 
And if I looked at individual regions around the country, there's a lot of similar stories to our business. It's just that you have some geographical areas that are getting really hit really hard, and those areas are big areas for us. But the positive is we're executing well in a lot of places. And I think that shines out in some of the positives I mentioned. 
We entered the year saying we weren't sure what the oil and gas was going to mean for us in 2015, but we're going to invest in people at the store level. We're going to invest to keep growing our business long term because the opportunities for us are immense. And year-to-date, we've added 1,234 people into our stores. In the last 12 months, we've added just over 1300. And we've continued to invest in the energy of the business, and I think that's meaningful. 
I did introduce our 2016 estimate for store openings, and right now, we're setting a range of 60 to 75 stores, so 2% to 3%. I'm happy to talk about that. The last few years, most of discussion's been about looking at some of our locations, rationalizing some of our locations. And we'll always do that, but also talking about what we're doing to grow the business, because again, when you have the ability to break a profit at a reasonable level in the store and you see opportunities to take market share in a lot of different ways, get close to your customer, this is one of those pieces. 
The other thing that is positive is when I look at our National Accounts business. And I've gotten -- I've had the opportunity to work with the folks in our National Accounts team quite extensively over the last year or so. And some things that I've learned over the last year is the opportunity is immense, and we're seeing that shine through in our signings. Now we might have existing customers that their business has been weakened, and we have their business, but their business is down 10%, 20%, 30%. We can't change that in the short term. 
What we can change is, are we doing everything we can to get all the wallet share we can at that facility with that customer? Are we doing things to help their business? Because where we help our customers, they help us back with more business. Are we doing those things and are we out meeting new customers every day? 
And when I look at the pace of signings, we are on pace to easily exceed our last 3 years of individual signings with new customers. And I feel very good about where we are even year-to-date and the fact that we're almost at the 2014 number right now as far as signings and we'll easily exceed it through the end of the year. So very excited about what's going on in our National Accounts business. 
The Onsite. As Will mentioned, it's the first time I've ever mentioned it in our earnings release. When I look at our Onsite business -- and I take a little bit more expansive view of it. When I think of that business, I include in that what we call Onsite today, as well as what we call strategic account stores. When I combine that business, it's really about dedicated locations either physically inside the customers' facility or really nearby, dedicated locations that are about this one customer and getting closer and closer to that customer, helping them in their business, becoming more knowledgeable at their business. 
That business over the last 15 years has grown to be almost 15% of our sales -- just over 15% of our sales today, so it's about 1/3 of our National Account business, and it's a great win-win relationship. We can get on site, lean up some of our operations and really take a much wider view of things we can do for the customer. And I think that bodes well for us into the future. And we'll be talking on that, as I mentioned, in our meeting in early November. 
As Will mentioned, our gross profit improved in the quarter. We're doing a lot of things to make good, wise decisions every day at the store level, at the district level, on how we price our product. Clearly, the fastener piece is tough because there's some deflation going on in that market right now, it's creating top line issues for us, it's creating some gross margin issues for us. Despite that, we continue to manage through it and eke out a nominal improvement in our gross profit. 
Finally -- and this is about our district managers and about our regional leaders. They're managing the business really well in a tough environment. We have asked them to go out and add people, and to that, they've added 1,300 people into the business. We've asked them to open some locations, to keep building for the future in an environment where our existing book of business is going through a very weak period. Despite all those things, we had incremental margin of almost 50% in the quarter. I'm proud of them for what they accomplished, because that's about them and because we're asking them to do a lot of things. But with that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. Thank you."

And I don't know if everybody knows all the facts of life, but I have always been a firm believer, 80-20 works in a lot of things. And I really believe that the large account business and National Account business can be a 70%, 75%, maybe 80% piece of our business if you broaden the definition a little bit, of our business long term. And the real question is how do we keep growing that business given that we have a structural advantage in the marketplace. We have people close by a lot of these locations. A lot of these locations are not in the major metros, they're in various locations through the states, through the provinces of Canada, around the planet. And so the fact that we can get close to a lot of them and grow it long term, I think, is tremendous because I do believe that's going to be a driver of our growth long term. And vending and Onsite are merely another tool to that, growing that business."

But we're going to take that inventory out of our -- we're going to redeploy the inventory from distribution to the front line, and we have a very good plan for that. We talk about vending, we've added -- we've greatly increased our sales force. We found other areas to offset those expenses and we found ways to pay for those people. So what we've had to do is we've had to become very focused. And one of the reasons we have to do that is for the investing public, but the bigger reason is for our employees who get paid off the performance of the business. And so we're very focused on creating our own luck, but at the same time, we're not going to give away the bank and destroy the quarter.

And so you can invest some dollars to do that. And the only thing that's on our list that doesn't drive that in the ultimate sense is opening 60 or 75 stores. And we know what that costs, and that's a pretty modest cost. And so it's really all the rest of the things are about things we can do to drive the top line because the deflation -- the negatives that we've had in our business are already embedded in our business. The negatives that have occurred in 2015, the customer that's down 10% or 15% or 20% or 30%, that's in -- that's already inherent in our business.

But right now, when you look at election year, you look at the turmoil in the Middle East, China and many other parts of the world, weak economy in Europe. There's nothing that points -- doesn't look like oil's going to come back and corn is probably low for a long time. There aren't a lot of strong economic indicators that are going to push us up, but we're in a huge market. We're in a market that in the U.S. alone is -- who knows? $100 billion, $150 billion. It's at least $100 billion, we know that. Or we've -- and so we have to go out and take share. And our problem today isn't that we aren't taking share. Our problem today is that our base business, as Dan said earlier, they shrunk. Our good, existing customers are buying less from us, so to grow at 2%, we have to take share at a much faster rate. If the economy just stabilizes and that base of business just stays flat, we're going to stack business on top and we're going to separate ourselves from the -- from our competitors in the market. And that's what we're planning on. Now if it were to bounce back and we were to do that at the same time, then you'll see growth like we had -- I believe you'll see growth like we had in 2010, where we're getting a benefit of our existing customers growing at a rapid pace and new business piling on top of that. So those are the 2 scenarios my crystal ball tells me. It's probably the one where we take share and add it on top of a more stable base."

The real driver of that is, if you think about our business over the last few years, we had 2 big drivers of CapEx. One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""You know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really like what",349,"Yes. The real driver of that is, if you think about our business over the last few years, we had 2 big drivers of CapEx. One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""You know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really like what we've seen and we're going to do that into the future and we're going to do it aggressively."" And so we went from having 2 distribution centers fully automated. Today, about 84% of are our picks are done through automated DCs. And so what happens is, in an Akron, Ohio, for example, where we have a highly automated distribution center, the dollars that go into there today are more about how much is that business is growing? What do we need in distribution capacity to support that growth? But we're not automating the facility, we're expanding the facility. So that's a completely different proposition. So our CapEx, when I think of distribution, will drop meaningfully from where it was in each of the last 3 years. The second one is vending. When we started vending back a number of years ago, we really didn't know how fast this thing would grow. If you recall in 2012, we started the year saying, geez, if we can sign x number -- 10,000 machines for the year, we'd consider that a home run. And we hit that number, I believe it was around July 6. And the one thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to have our powder dry to support that business. And so not only did we invest capital in the machines we were deploying. We invested capital in the machines to be deployed because we didn't want to outshoot our ability to produce machines. And so we have an inventory of machines that we've been working through. And so that puts us in a luxury of now managing our vending equipment to the needs of the business as opposed to staying well out ahead of it because we have a better idea of our pace."

I'd first like to start out telling you how happy the board, Fastenal board and myself are to announce Dan as our new CEO. We're very excited. Dan still kind of considered a new guy because he won't be 20 years until next year with the company. But we think he's going to do -- really believe he's going to do a great job. He has a great team around him that both Dan and I have helped develop over the last 30 years or so, and we think Fastenal has a great future under Dan's leadership. Thanks, Dan.
Then I'm going to switch to the quarter. As you know, it's a difficult quarter for Fastenal. Talk a little bit about our sales, September slowed down slightly. And really, it's a story of industrial fasteners and the slowness within the -- slowdown within that part of our business. 
In the first quarter, we grew our industrial -- or our fastener business 5.5%. Not great, but market -- taking share. And then by the third quarter, it had dropped to a negative 4.4%, driven by not only volume, but also some deflation in the markets, weak steel prices. We do not believe we're losing share. Actually, we believe we're still taking some share, not at the rate we would like or expect, but still taking share. 
On a more positive note, our non-fastener business grew at 5.9%, taking share, growing that business. And that's driven by a great effort on our -- by our sales team and continued success with our vending program.
On the margin side of the business, I believe the team did a very nice job considering the balance of things with margin, plus and negative. Product mix goes against us when the fasteners are not growing. Customer mix grows -- goes against us when our large customers are outgrowing our small customers due to our success with the National Accounts program. And then the deflation and weak steel prices. The positive on the margin that helps support it to where it is, as we -- transportation costs are lower than they would have been a year ago with lower fuel pricing. So there are some puts and takes. And overall, I think the team has done a very good job of managing the margin. 
And as Bob Kierlin always reminds me, the margin is more about our pay programs and -- our incentives and our pay programs than it is about mix. Hard-working, smart people have a way to make those -- the margin work for themselves by delivering additional service to our customers, bringing value to the field. 
I also feel the team did a nice job on expense control. We were able to add, I believe it was almost 1,300 people. I get so many numbers in my head at this point of the month, I lose it, but I know close to 1,300 people in the year, and still manage our expenses to have earnings leverage, which we'd never been able to do that in the past. And that's really a testament, not so much to Dan and I and the senior people, but the people in the trenches that are working every day to run their business as profitably and create opportunities for themselves.
The last thing -- my comments are going to be very short today. The attitude at Fastenal, the mindset that we're in right now is a mindset of we need to create our own luck. We're not economists, we don't know what the economy will do over the next 2 to 3 quarters. We're not real optimistic that it's going to bounce back quickly, so we need to create our own luck as an organization. 
And that's what we want to talk to the investing public about on November 5, all the things that we're doing. We're having an Investor Day on November 5, for those of you that don't know that. All of the things that we're doing to help separate ourselves and take more market share in 2016 than we would otherwise be able to do without being very focused. We're going to talk about our increased investment in our stores. We're going to talk about the increased investment in our vending program, how we're refocusing that program and believe it will give us well-above-average growth through 2016 and beyond. 
We're going to talk about our Onsite program. Dan mentioned that, I believe for the first time, in our quarterly release. It was -- came out this morning, about our Onsite program, what we're doing with that and why we're so bullish on that as  -- is why that brings value to our customers. 
And we're going to talk about our web program, our e-business. We know we're not -- we've fallen behind some of our large competitors in that, and we're working very hard to make efforts to come back on that and present our customers with a very, very good solution for them to buy products electronically. 
And there's a common theme to the 4 things that I just mentioned: Our stores, our vending, our Onsite and our web. All 4 of those bring value to our customers. They bring product closer so the customer has to do less work to run their business so they can spend more time running their business than they have to spend buying parts that are necessary to make the place run. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, and he'll cover more information on the quarter. Thank you."

And good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in Fastenal. I'm going to work to keep this focused on the quarter. 
As Will mentioned, we plan on having an Investor Day on Thursday, November 5, at our Indianapolis facility. And we'll be talking a lot about 2016 and beyond. And one of the things -- and I think one of the things that will stand out in that day is always looking at the facts at hand in a business. How are -- in what ways are we great? In what ways do we have the best opportunity to leverage that greatness? 
And the thing that always stands out for me when I think of Fastenal -- and that was true 20 years ago when I joined the organization, and it's true today. And that is we put a lot of energy into recruiting, identifying talent and nurturing talent and unleashing that talent, letting people make decisions in their business to impact their future. 
And knowing that, the second thing that we're great at is early on, we figured out how to make money in a footprint with a lot of small locations. We figured out -- when I look at a lot of industrial distributors, a lot of great companies. regional companies, national companies, one thing that stands out is it's really difficult to make money in a store doing $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a month. But if you can figure that out, as you move beyond that, you can put people close to the customer, you can -- you have the ability to provide a different type of service than anybody else. 
And we thrive in a marketplace that wants to be -- that wants to get better, that wants to be helped by some of the tools, some of the things we bring to the table. And that's really what's driven our ability to excel, is if you put great people close to the customer and you have a business model with a structurally low operating cost, you can compensate people fairly for what they're doing, and you build a great machine over time, and you build a great organization over time. And that's, really, what we've done, and we want to talk about that in early November.
But getting back to the quarter. I've tried to incorporate our last few quarters into our press release. Obviously, the usual items that we talk about and disclose, but really some quick bullets on what are some negatives and positives in the quarter. And I always want to get the negatives out of the way so we can then talk about the positives because I think there's -- the one list outshines the other. 
But the reality of it is, in 2015, we, our customers have been hit hard by the slowdown in the oil and gas sector and hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the ability of our customers to compete effectively across the globe. And 89% of our sales are in the U.S., so anything that's negative to the U.S. market is negative to us in the short term, as far as managing through it. 
The other item, and you saw it in our September number, we have seen stabilization in a lot of parts of the -- our business. In recent months, the Texas market for us did take a little bit of a step-down in September. And the other item I noted is our Canadian business -- and this is all in local currency, so I want everyone to be mindful of that. I've heard a lot about the negatives in the Canadian market and the weakness in the Canadian market. We continue to -- I put in my negatives because we're only growing at 6%, because we were growing at 10% in the second quarter. 
But I continue to look at that and say it's a negative in that, that business has slowed, but it's really a positive in what we're able to accomplish up there in a very tough environment. And it demonstrates the types of things that we can do. And Jeff Watts and his team, I think, are doing a wonderful job with that business of continuing to manage through and prosper. 
And if I looked at individual regions around the country, there's a lot of similar stories to our business. It's just that you have some geographical areas that are getting really hit really hard, and those areas are big areas for us. But the positive is we're executing well in a lot of places. And I think that shines out in some of the positives I mentioned. 
We entered the year saying we weren't sure what the oil and gas was going to mean for us in 2015, but we're going to invest in people at the store level. We're going to invest to keep growing our business long term because the opportunities for us are immense. And year-to-date, we've added 1,234 people into our stores. In the last 12 months, we've added just over 1300. And we've continued to invest in the energy of the business, and I think that's meaningful. 
I did introduce our 2016 estimate for store openings, and right now, we're setting a range of 60 to 75 stores, so 2% to 3%. I'm happy to talk about that. The last few years, most of discussion's been about looking at some of our locations, rationalizing some of our locations. And we'll always do that, but also talking about what we're doing to grow the business, because again, when you have the ability to break a profit at a reasonable level in the store and you see opportunities to take market share in a lot of different ways, get close to your customer, this is one of those pieces. 
The other thing that is positive is when I look at our National Accounts business. And I've gotten -- I've had the opportunity to work with the folks in our National Accounts team quite extensively over the last year or so. And some things that I've learned over the last year is the opportunity is immense, and we're seeing that shine through in our signings. Now we might have existing customers that their business has been weakened, and we have their business, but their business is down 10%, 20%, 30%. We can't change that in the short term. 
What we can change is, are we doing everything we can to get all the wallet share we can at that facility with that customer? Are we doing things to help their business? Because where we help our customers, they help us back with more business. Are we doing those things and are we out meeting new customers every day? 
And when I look at the pace of signings, we are on pace to easily exceed our last 3 years of individual signings with new customers. And I feel very good about where we are even year-to-date and the fact that we're almost at the 2014 number right now as far as signings and we'll easily exceed it through the end of the year. So very excited about what's going on in our National Accounts business. 
The Onsite. As Will mentioned, it's the first time I've ever mentioned it in our earnings release. When I look at our Onsite business -- and I take a little bit more expansive view of it. When I think of that business, I include in that what we call Onsite today, as well as what we call strategic account stores. When I combine that business, it's really about dedicated locations either physically inside the customers' facility or really nearby, dedicated locations that are about this one customer and getting closer and closer to that customer, helping them in their business, becoming more knowledgeable at their business. 
That business over the last 15 years has grown to be almost 15% of our sales -- just over 15% of our sales today, so it's about 1/3 of our National Account business, and it's a great win-win relationship. We can get on site, lean up some of our operations and really take a much wider view of things we can do for the customer. And I think that bodes well for us into the future. And we'll be talking on that, as I mentioned, in our meeting in early November. 
As Will mentioned, our gross profit improved in the quarter. We're doing a lot of things to make good, wise decisions every day at the store level, at the district level, on how we price our product. Clearly, the fastener piece is tough because there's some deflation going on in that market right now, it's creating top line issues for us, it's creating some gross margin issues for us. Despite that, we continue to manage through it and eke out a nominal improvement in our gross profit. 
Finally -- and this is about our district managers and about our regional leaders. They're managing the business really well in a tough environment. We have asked them to go out and add people, and to that, they've added 1,300 people into the business. We've asked them to open some locations, to keep building for the future in an environment where our existing book of business is going through a very weak period. Despite all those things, we had incremental margin of almost 50% in the quarter. I'm proud of them for what they accomplished, because that's about them and because we're asking them to do a lot of things. But with that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. Thank you."

And I don't know if everybody knows all the facts of life, but I have always been a firm believer, 80-20 works in a lot of things. And I really believe that the large account business and National Account business can be a 70%, 75%, maybe 80% piece of our business if you broaden the definition a little bit, of our business long term. And the real question is how do we keep growing that business given that we have a structural advantage in the marketplace. We have people close by a lot of these locations. A lot of these locations are not in the major metros, they're in various locations through the states, through the provinces of Canada, around the planet. And so the fact that we can get close to a lot of them and grow it long term, I think, is tremendous because I do believe that's going to be a driver of our growth long term. And vending and Onsite are merely another tool to that, growing that business."

But we're going to take that inventory out of our -- we're going to redeploy the inventory from distribution to the front line, and we have a very good plan for that. We talk about vending, we've added -- we've greatly increased our sales force. We found other areas to offset those expenses and we found ways to pay for those people. So what we've had to do is we've had to become very focused. And one of the reasons we have to do that is for the investing public, but the bigger reason is for our employees who get paid off the performance of the business.

And so it's really all the rest of the things are about things we can do to drive the top line because the deflation -- the negatives that we've had in our business are already embedded in our business.

There's nothing that points -- doesn't look like oil's going to come back and corn is probably low for a long time. There aren't a lot of strong economic indicators that are going to push us up, but we're in a huge market. We're in a market that in the U.S. alone is -- who knows? $100 billion, $150 billion. It's at least $100 billion, we know that. Or we've -- and so we have to go out and take share. And our problem today isn't that we aren't taking share. Our problem today is that our base business, as Dan said earlier, they shrunk. Our good, existing customers are buying less from us, so to grow at 2%, we have to take share at a much faster rate. If the economy just stabilizes and that base of business just stays flat, we're going to stack business on top and we're going to separate ourselves from the -- from our competitors in the market. And that's what we're planning on. Now if it were to bounce back and we were to do that at the same time, then you'll see growth like we had -- I believe you'll see growth like we had in 2010, where we're getting a benefit of our existing customers growing at a rapid pace and new business piling on top of that.

The real driver of that is, if you think about our business over the last few years, we had 2 big drivers of CapEx. One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""You know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really like what",349,"Yes.

One was we came out a number of years ago and said, ""You know what, we've automated 2 of our distribution centers. We really like what we've seen and we're going to do that into the future and we're going to do it aggressively."" And so we went from having 2 distribution centers fully automated. Today, about 84% of are our picks are done through automated DCs. And so what happens is, in an Akron, Ohio, for example, where we have a highly automated distribution center, the dollars that go into there today are more about how much is that business is growing? What do we need in distribution capacity to support that growth? But we're not automating the facility, we're expanding the facility. So that's a completely different proposition. So our CapEx, when I think of distribution, will drop meaningfully from where it was in each of the last 3 years. The second one is vending. When we started vending back a number of years ago, we really didn't know how fast this thing would grow. If you recall in 2012, we started the year saying, geez, if we can sign x number -- 10,000 machines for the year, we'd consider that a home run. And we hit that number, I believe it was around July 6. And the one thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to have our powder dry to support that business. And so not only did we invest capital in the machines we were deploying. We invested capital in the machines to be deployed because we didn't want to outshoot our ability to produce machines. And so we have an inventory of machines that we've been working through.
