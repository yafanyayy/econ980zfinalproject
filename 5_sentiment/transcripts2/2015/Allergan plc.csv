Let me start with the obvious. We had a terrific quarter on all key measures, and we're on an excellent trajectory for 2015 and beyond. Actavis' first quarter performance was highlighted by double-digit non-GAA",1778,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the obvious. We had a terrific quarter on all key measures, and we're on an excellent trajectory for 2015 and beyond. Actavis' first quarter performance was highlighted by double-digit non-GAAP revenue growth versus the prior year, double-digit growth from key North American Brands, double-digit growth from global generics and double-digit growth from ANDA, our Distribution business, 3 rock-solid pillars to which we are adding the Allergan business. 
While keeping focused on customers and driving robust growth, we also achieved a long list of accomplishments during the quarter, including completion of a largest deal in health care over the last 10 years, expanding the reach of our International portfolio, executing deals that increase our focus on profitable generic markets such as Auden Mackenzie in the U.K. while completing divestitures that sharpened our brand therapy focus such as our respiratory and Doryx and Pharma Tech deal, ramping up productivity of our branded generics R&D teams with 4 new brand product approvals and about 20 new generic launches in the United States and completing the largest financing ever in health care, not to mention kicking off one of the most thoughtful and rapid integrations I have ever seen. I am so proud of each of the people in our combined global team. 
One thing is clear. This combined team rallies quickly around surprising opportunities, focuses on the key objectives and executes flawlessly. When it comes to execution, we are like a finely tuned, high-performance engine. 
Even though we just closed the Allergan acquisition on March 17, we have already made significant progress on the integration, and we're doing exceptionally well on our cost synergies capture. How did we do it? We quickly named a new management team with skilled and experienced leaders from both companies, but we didn't stop there. 
In the vast majority of countries, we designed our entire organization all the way to the frontline preclose so we could rapidly inform our colleagues about their future, give them certainty and move quickly to the new go-forward team. 
For example, our global sales force of approximately 7,500 representatives has already been realigned in all but a handful of countries with the intent to minimize customer disruption. We also stood up our new International model with one Country Manager per country, allowing us to operate as one company while taking full advantage of our global brand and generic capabilities. 
Being bold, nimble and focused during the integration is how we are staying on track with our aggressive synergy targets and more importantly, how we will keep our sales momentum going. After just 6 weeks, we are making great progress on our integration milestones and are on track to deliver about 80% of our synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 
And in a moment, David Nicholson will give an overview of the tremendous progress in the pipeline and will make a few comments about the R&D portfolio prioritization, which is nearly complete. Tessa will also join us to describe our financial performance in detail, but from a high-level perspective, you can see the impact of our transformation over the past 12 to 18 months. 
Non-GAAP net revenue was $4.2 billion, a 65% increase largely driven by the Forest acquisition with only 2 weeks of Allergan in the results; $4.30 of non-GAAP EPS even with the impact of the Allergan financing; $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA; and $525 million in cash flow from operations, more than $800 million if you add back the onetime cash charges for severances, restructuring and integration. 
Turning to the business performance. On a pro forma basis, total U.S. branded sales increased 5% if you exclude Allergan and increased 17% if you exclude Namenda IR. 8 of the top 10 Actavis brands are growing double digits versus prior year not just growing, thriving. 
In fact, many of our key products are hitting new highs in volume and market share, including Linzess, which is now approaching a run rate of $400 million annually. Bystolic had a strong performance, running towards $650 million annually. And Lo Loestrin, Estrace and Minastrin are really soaring with a focus we are putting on Women's Health. will likely be a beneficiary of that focus. 
Meanwhile, Namenda XR sales are up sharply as we continue to drive the conversion rate and have resolved last year supply constraints. Physicians and caregivers continue to convert more patients to Namenda XR with its more convenient and cost-effective profile. Over 70,000 physicians have prescribed Namenda XR, which is a testament to its usefulness and treatment with patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
Our patient awareness campaign, focused on caregivers and their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease, has been well received and is helping with conversion. We are currently at about 50% and climbing towards 60% by the end of the second quarter, and we expect to exceed that figure with the launch of Namzaric, which opens up the market segment worth about $2 billion. 
The primary source of business for Namzaric will be the plus Namenda IR market. The main point here is that the market for Namzaric is bigger than the market for Namenda XR. Namzaric will give patients all the benefits of combination therapy for Alzheimer's disease in one pill, once a day. We intend to support Namzaric with formulary access and direct-to-consumer marketing. Shipping begins this week and full promotional launch later this month. Given the broad use of combination and therapy, we think there is a great opportunity for Namzaric to expand the once a day branded market. 
Turning to the Allergan business. Here again, we come back to our theme of double-digit growth. In the midst of planning for the integration, legacy Allergan delivered double-digit pro forma sales growth of 13% in constant currency to $1.75 billion for its final quarter. Allergan drove this performance while maintaining inventories in the customary, well-managed range. The performance was broad-based, driven by continued strong performance across the company's Eye Care, Botox and Aesthetic businesses. Eye care was up 14% in constant currency, driven by Restasis and. Botox, up 16% in constant currency, driven by growth in therapeutics. Skincare, breast aesthetics and facial aesthetics, up a combined 12% in constant currency. International Allergan sales were also up double digits in constant currency with all 3 units, eye care, medical aesthetics and specialty care achieving double-digit growth. 
We are capitalizing on the exceptional sustaining performance of Actavis and Allergan to create an impressive leader in growth pharma. So the bottom line on our combined company brand performance is strong performance for our key brands, including Namenda XR, Linzess, Botox, Restasis, Bystolic and. Meanwhile, we only have to look at the performance of Lo Loestrin, Saphris, Minastrin and the GI products to see that our team has firmly established a core competency in relaunching products that we acquired. This ability to invigorate acquired products is a differentiator for us. 
We acquire assets to grow them, and we succeed. That opens up more possibilities for us than is appreciated, more growth, more leverage and more credibility for other bolt-on deals. While this early, we're off to a very good start with our new launches,and we are now poised to be a significant player in the increasingly important antibiotics space with Dalvance and AVYCAZ. This is where our model of development prowess, life cycle investment and smart business development is creating enduring competitive advantage. 
Turning to the North American Generics and International business. Sales were up 20% this quarter in constant currency versus prior year. North American sales were $1.2 billion and continue to benefit from the contribution from key products like generic Concerta, Lidoderm and Intuniv. Special capabilities and being First-to-File again and again combined to make our Generics business a best-in-class competitor. 
This year, we have launched 20 generic products in the U.S. including our most recent launch of generic following our court win last week. We also launched generic OxyContin, Temovate and generic ophthalmic products as well. 
This quarter, we also launched our generic injectable business after we regained the rights to about 20 injectables from Saygent at the end of 2014, giving us added strength with hospital purchasers. 
On the R&D side, our generic business continues to fire on all cylinders with the 7 confirmed first-to-files out of the total 18 total filings posted on the FDA website this quarter. 
On the International side, non-GAAP sales were $527 million, growing 20%, excluding foreign exchange. We launched close to 100 products during this quarter. 
International revenue growth was driven by multiple markets, including Russia, up 41% on a constant-currency basis driven by our strong sales organization and OTC performance; and the U.K., up 22% on a constant-currency basis driven by new product launches. 
Our strategy in International generics is to continue allocating resources to markets that deliver high-growth potential and where we can be among the leaders. That is why we divested generic products in Australia and invested in Auden Mackenzie acquisition in the U.K., which is expected to close in the second quarter. 
Let me close with a few comments in our preliminary view of the 2015 financials. We are certainly off to a terrific start. We previously planned to provide guidance at the end of Q2, but given the strong performance this quarter, the progress we're making on integration synergies and the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures, we felt it would be good to give you our preliminary view of 2015 today. 
First, since we acquired Allergan on March 17 as-reported revenue is projected to be in a range of $20.5 billion to $21 billion. On a pro forma basis, full year sales are projected at $22 billion to $22.5 billion, which was consistent with or slightly ahead of our prior comments of $23 billion if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the multiple divestitures such as respiratory and Pharma Tech. 
Our current view on 2014 (sic) (2015) non-GAAP earnings per share on an as-reported basis, including Allergan as of March 17, is in the range of $17 to $18.15 -- I'm sorry, $18.50. We will narrow the range over time. 
With this view, you can see that we have put together a terrific company with a very compelling outlook for 2015, and we are executing like a high-performance engine driving towards our aspirational target of $25 per share in EPS in 2017. We look forward to giving you more refined guidance on our second quarter call. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tessa, who will provide you with an overview of our financial performance during the quarter. Tessa?"

Before I turn to our results, I would like to remind you that the current quarter results, which I will discuss, now include 15 days of financial contribution from the Allergan acquisition, which was completed on",972,"Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results, I would like to remind you that the current quarter results, which I will discuss, now include 15 days of financial contribution from the Allergan acquisition, which was completed on March 17. The Allergan business contributed $258 million in net revenue and $113 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. 
Turning to our results for the first quarter on Slide 15. In Q1, we delivered strong performance with top line growth across key franchises, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite negative foreign currency impact. The year-over-year increase was also driven by the Forest and Allergan acquisition. 
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 65% versus the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP R&D investments for the quarter was $284 million compared to $175 million in the prior year period. 
Non-GAAP R&D spending was $110 million for generics, $125 million for brands, $15 million for biosimilars and $34 million for Allergan. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 20.9%, an increase of 1.7 percentage points over the prior year quarter as a result of the Forest branded products that have higher SG&A spend. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.78 billion, an increase of 107% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across the business. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 23% to $4.30 compared to $3.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of Allergan and its related financing, Actavis' non-GAAP EPS was $4.59 for the first quarter 2015, representing a 17% sequential increase from $3.91 in the fourth quarter. This highlights our continued strong performance on top of integration activities. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 16.4% in the year-ago period to 14.3% in the current year quarter mainly due to geographic mix. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $525 million. Our cash flow from operations would have been more than $800 million if cash charges for severance, restructuring and integration are added back. 
Turning now to our business segments. North American Brands business delivered strong performance year-over-year, powered by the acquired Forest Products and growth in our Women's Health franchise. North American Brands revenue was $1.74 billion for the quarter, up 192% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of the Forest business, including strong double-digit year-over-year growth from 8 out of our top 10 products. 
Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down slightly, driven by normal decline in prescription fill rates from fourth quarter to first quarter but typically recover in the second quarter and wholesaler buying patterns. 
Adjusted gross margin within North America Brands decreased to 86.6% largely due to partner products within the Forest portfolio, including Namenda and Linzess. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin improved due to lower Namenda IR sales, which carry a lower margin. 
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of revenue increased to 27.8% driven by expenses related to the acquired Forest products. 
Our North America Generics and International business continues to perform strongly with non-GAAP revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 12% versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by strong sales of key products and new product launches, including generic versions of Concerta, Lidoderm, Intuniv and OxyContin. 
Internationally, our Generics business was negatively impacted by the strength in U.S. dollar but at constant currency rates, this business grew 20% versus prior year quarter. 
On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross margins increased 3.2 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter due to continued strong performance within our International business. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for the segment declined to 14.8% due to the divestiture of our Western European assets and elimination of the supportive infrastructure of that business. 
Turning to our Anda business. Revenues increased to $462 million, up from $300 million in the prior year, an increase of 18% driven by a higher mix of chain drugstore sales. Gross margin for the Anda business decreased 2.6 percentage points to 12.5% as a result of the higher product mix of chain drugstore sales. 
Slide 19 details our debt capitalization following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the first quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $44 billion and equity of $71 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. 
Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 4.1x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA. Over the next 12 months, we are committed to using our anticipated strong free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment. We expect to achieve a pro forma leverage ratio of 3.5x debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of the first quarter of 2016, in line with our prior guidance. 
Finally, I would like to provide an overview of our key assumptions for the 2015 combined forecast Brent provided earlier in this call. Our non-GAAP EPS of $17 to $18.50 includes key near- and longer-term drivers that we expect over the next few months that will impact our business, including in U.S. brands, we assume the Namenda XR conversion trending to 60% by the end of Q2, Namenda IR generic enters the market in mid-July, Namzaric launch this week. 
In our GX business, we assumed launch of generic Pulmicort, continued current market conditions for Concerta, additional competition on Lidoderm, Auden Mackenzie acquisition close late in Q2, a tax rate of approximately 15%, 2015 fully diluted average shares of approximately 386 million, and year-end 2015 fully diluted shares outstanding of 415 million. Foreign exchange rates are based on average forward consensus for Q2 to Q4. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our brands R&D progress in the quarter. Dave?"

During the first quarter 2015, our R&D teams focused on advancing our near-term development programs whilst also looking towards the future, and the integration of the Actavis and Allergan pipelines. Turning",962,"Thank you, Tessa, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter 2015, our R&D teams focused on advancing our near-term development programs whilst also looking towards the future, and the integration of the Actavis and Allergan pipelines. 
Turning to Slide 22. We have achieved tremendous progress, and I would applaud the combined efforts of our commercial and R&D teams. We have nearly completed the rationalization of our combined pipeline. Our teams have identified and confirmed 70 projects that will move forward as part of the combined development program with more than 50 projects in either late stage or registration stages of development. 
Whilst we have made very significant progress on the rationalization of our pipeline, we are still evaluating certain projects. We continue to drive these projects forward, the key milestones to allow us to make cost-effective but also data-driven decisions. We will present our combined rationalized pipeline as part of an up-and-coming R&D day. 
We have achieved significant progress across key programs from both the legacy Actavis and the legacy Allergan R&D pipelines. 
Turning to Slide 23. You get an insight into the extent of our progress to strengthen our key franchises. In the quarter, we achieved milestones across core franchises, including Women's Health, infectious disease, CNS and Gastroenterology. 
Key FDA and European approvals included Liletta. This was FDA approved in February as a long-acting progestin-only intrauterine system or IUS to prevent pregnancy for up to 3 years and was launched in the U.S. in April. To support the use of Liletta for up to 7 years, we are continuing the ACCESS study. The initial results of this study were published online in April in Contraception. The study found Liletta to be more than 99% effective for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 3 years of use in women aged 16 to 35 regardless of their race, history of previous births or BMI. 
AVYCAZ, our combination of ceftazidime and the inhibitor avibactam was FDA approved in March as a treatment for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. The AVYCAZ launch is in progress. 
As you have heard, Namzaric is being launched, and we are in discussions with the FDA about extending the range of doses that we can make available to maximize convenience for patients. 
Dalbavancin was approved in Europe in February as Xydalba for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, ABSSSI. We are developing a single-dose regimen of Dalvance, and in April, we announced positive top line results for a Phase III study comparing a single 1.5 gram dose of Dalvance with the same total dose event as 2 doses 1 week apart for the treatment of ABSSSI infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, including MERSA. The top line data demonstrated that the single dose of Dalvance achieved its primary endpoint for control of infection at 72 hours after initiation of therapy. The study was also positive at end of treatment, the endpoint required by the European Medicines Agency. 
I will return to Botox later. 
We also announced the initiation of a Phase IIb study for relamorelin, our investigational treatment for gastroparesis in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We are very pleased with this collaboration with our partner, Rhythm Health. 
Turning to Slide 24. We achieved sNDA approvals for a lower dose of 20 milligrams Viibryd, expanding dosing options for clinicians and for Saphris monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar 1 disorder in pediatric patients. FDA have accepted our sNDA to expand the Teflaro label to ABSSSI with concurrent bacteremia. 
We received FDA approval for the expanded label of Botox for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. The FDA also approved an increase to the maximum Botox cumulative dose for adults within 3 months treated for one or more indications. We remain very committed to extending our Botox franchise. 
Looking ahead, and moving on to Slide 25, we have a significant number of regulatory milestones in the next few months. We have upcoming PDUFA dates for Eluxadoline in the second quarter and for cariprazine in June. For eluxadoline, we do not expect an FDA Advisory Committee hearing on our submission, and DEA scheduling begins once approval is achieved. 
We are continuing to build out our Linzess franchise, and we expect to submit an sNDA for a low dosage form of the drug to treat Chronic Idiopathic Constipation in 2016. 
For DARPin, our Phase II programs for AND and DME in the U.S. and Japan are ongoing, and we will begin enrollment in our Phase III program in the U.S. later this quarter or early in the third quarter. This on-time start of Phase III is just one of many examples that our strong combined R&D team is maintaining momentum during the integration of our 2 companies. 
Restasis is on track to submit the dossier for multi-dose, preservative-free formulations by the end of the year. 
I'm excited about Bimatoprost SR. The Phase III trials are continuing in the U.S., and we'll be starting Phase III in Europe later this year. 
SER 120, a low-dose nasal formulation for the treatment of nocturia, is nearing completion in Phase III, and we are looking forward to seeing the data. 
I also wanted to mention our dermal fillers. We are continuing to roll out additional HA formulations. We anticipate extending our Volite line in Europe and our Juvederm line in Asia during the course of the year. 
In conclusion, the first quarter of 2015 has been very productive for the R&D team, and we will continue to see momentum in the second quarter and beyond from our industry-leading pipeline. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Brent, who will provide closing remarks. Brent?"

When you look at our business up almost 20% on top line this year, firing on all cylinders and R&D pipeline that's the envy of the industry, continuing to just be on First-to-Files in the U.S. time and time again, launching 100 brands outside or products outside the United States and our way we manage it, which is so different than anybody else, I think it's something that we've take a lot of pride, and we see a lot of connectivity to generics and our branded business. That being said, I think if you look at trying to sell it, I'm not sure there's a tax-efficient way. We do have reasonably high basis in it, but it'd still be a very difficult thing to do, but I think the bigger calculation would be strategically we value that business."

I think in the studies we're seeing, it lasted about 3 to 4 months, something in that range versus the drops, which compliance and persistence is a huge issue and glaucoma, and if you talk to glaucoma specialist they're dying for an effective treatment that would increase compliance and persistence for disease that typically asymptomatic. It's doing a lot of damage to the back of the eye. In terms of DARPin, Liav, I think you're right on both tracks. I think the way we're thinking about DARPin is that it should achieve the 3 to 4x a year dosing regimen to make it really differentiator. Obviously, people don't like getting an injection in the back of the eye. If you look at even EYLEA, they're dosing it more frequently than the label suggests, and so doctors are really looking for something that -- and patients probably even more so looking for something to minimize injection. So we're really trying to design the experiment or the Phase III to hit the 12-week dosing regimen. The other thing I would put out there is remember, we put nothing in our deal model in DARPin, and so outside the cost of the Phase III study, it's essentially a free call option. And so given where we are, we think after all the modeling and everything we looked at, it was worth going for, but you're right. It's a high hurdle to get there, and to the extent we can, it should provide a very compelling, large opportunity for us in the future, but we've got to get there. I think the second thing it does is sets us up for dual DARPin, and that could be a very exciting place to be, but it's early. And so we've got a lot of work to do there as well.

We have information exchange freely, of course, following all the rules and regulations around jumping, and that allows us to get a jump on things like you saw in this quarter with the integration of Actavis Allergan, but it also shows how you restore momentum by keeping people's morale high, and that is certainly the case for the most part in our combined company. I think there are opportunities to do hostile deals. I think you have to do them when you're buying a single product perhaps or just a research program or a file where people aren't the key driver. But in most of these businesses, people are such a large part of the equation. I think hostile in virtually every instance is a mistake. There could always be an exception to that. I think the second thing is there are other large players that we believe are inefficient that would benefit from our operating model, our management philosophy, the way we approach customers in a more efficient manner, and so over time, there may be some targets that could be surprising to folks, but we have to de-lever, and we have to contain our investment-grade rating.

It keeps us laser focused on our competitors. And just anecdotally, I'll give you one example. I was down at DNA CBS with Paul and Bob Stuart and our branded colleagues, and our other competitors were either there in a very light presence or not at all because they were on the road trying to convince shareholders that their plan or their defense was on track. And so you can already see them despite what they say saying it doesn't impact them, impacting them, and so hopefully we're already in the pole position with respect to R&D, but this will hopefully continue to allow us to continue to be in a pole position with respect to customer service. On the aesthetics aside, maybe Philippe will chime in and Paul perhaps internationally. I think our goal was to really do no harm, right?

Let me start with the obvious. We had a terrific quarter on all key measures, and we are on an excellent trajectory for 2015 and beyond. Actavis' first quarter performance was highlighted by double-digit non-GA",1788,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the obvious. We had a terrific quarter on all key measures, and we are on an excellent trajectory for 2015 and beyond. Actavis' first quarter performance was highlighted by double-digit non-GAAP revenue growth versus the prior year, double-digit growth from key North American Brands, double-digit growth from Global Generics and double-digit growth from Anda, our distribution business, 3 rock-solid pillars to which we are adding the Allergan business.
While keeping focused on customers and driving robust growth, we also achieved a long list of accomplishments during the quarter, including completion of a largest deal in health care over the last 10 years, expanding the reach of our International portfolio, executing deals that increased our focus on profitable generic markets such as Auden Mckenzie in the U.K. while completing divestitures that sharpened our brand therapy focus such as our respiratory and Doryx deals and Pharmatech deal, ramping up productivity of our branded generic R&D teams with 4 new brand product approvals and about 20 new generic launches in the United States, and completing the largest financing ever in health care, not to mention kicking off one of the most thoughtful and rapid integrations I've ever seen. I am so proud of each of the people in our combined global team.
One thing is clear. This combined team rallies quickly around surprising opportunities, focuses on the key objectives and executes flawlessly. When it comes to execution, we are like a finely tuned, high-performance engine.
Even though we just closed the Allergan acquisition on March 17, we have already made significant progress on the integration, and we're doing exceptionally well on our cost synergy capture. How did we do it? We quickly named a new management team with skilled and experienced leaders from both companies, but we didn't stop there. In the vast majority of countries, we designed our entire organization all the way to the frontline preclose so we could rapidly inform our colleagues about their future, give them certainty and move quickly to the new go-forward team.
For example, our global sales force of approximately 7,500 representatives has already been realigned in all but a handful of countries with the intent to minimize customer disruption. We also stood up our new International model with one Country Manager per country, allowing us to operate as one company while taking full advantage of our global brand and generic capabilities.
Being bold, nimble and focused during the integration is how we are staying on track with our aggressive synergy targets and more importantly, how we will keep our sales momentum going. After just 6 weeks, we are making great progress on our integration milestones and are on track to deliver about 80% of our synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2016.
And in a moment, David Nicholson will give an overview of the tremendous progress in the pipeline and will make a few comments about the R&D portfolio prioritization, which is nearly complete. Tessa will also join us to describe our financial performance in detail, but from a high-level perspective, you can see the impact of our transformation over the past 12 to 18 months.
Non-GAAP net revenue was $4.2 billion, a 65% increase largely driven by the Forest acquisition, with only 2 weeks of Allergan in the results; $4.30 of non-GAAP EPS even with the impact of the Allergan financing; $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA; and $525 million in cash flow from operations, more than $800 million if you add back the onetime cash charges for severances, restructuring and integration.
Turning to the business performance. On a pro forma basis, total U.S. branded sales increased 5% if you exclude Allergan and increased 17% if you exclude Namenda IR. 8 of the top 10 Actavis brands are growing double digits versus prior year; not just growing, thriving.
In fact, many of our key products are hitting new highs in volume and market share, including Linzess, which is now approaching a run rate of $400 million annually. Bystolic had a strong performance, running towards $650 million annually. And Lo Loestrin, Estrace and Minastrin are really soaring with the focus we are putting on Women's Health. Lialda will likely be a beneficiary of that focus.
Meanwhile, Namenda XR sales are up sharply as we continue to drive the conversion rate and have resolved last year's supply constraints. Physicians and caregivers continue to convert more patients to Namenda XR with its more convenient and cost-effective profile. Over 70,000 physicians have prescribed Namenda XR, which is a testament to its usefulness and treatment with patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Our patient awareness campaign focused on caregivers and their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease has been well received and is helping with conversion. We are currently at about 50% and climbing towards 60% by the end of the second quarter, and we expect to exceed that figure with the launch of Namzaric, which opens up the donepezil market segment worth about $2 billion.
The primary source of business for Namzaric will be the donepezil or donepezil plus Namenda IR market. The main point here is that the market for Namzaric is bigger than the market for Namenda XR. Namzaric will give patients all the benefits of combination therapy for Alzheimer's disease in one pill, once a day. We intend to support Namzaric with formulary access and direct-to-consumer marketing. Shipping begins this week and full promotional launch later this month. Given the broad use of combination donepezil and memantine therapy, we think there is a great opportunity for Namzaric to expand the once-a-day branded market.
Turning to the Allergan business. Here again, we come back to our theme of double-digit growth. In the midst of planning for the integration, legacy Allergan delivered double-digit pro forma sales growth of 13% in constant currency to $1.75 billion for its final quarter. Allergan drove this performance while maintaining inventories in the customary, well-managed range. The performance was broad-based, driven by continued strong performance across the company's Eye Care, Botox and Aesthetic businesses. Eye care was up 14% in constant currency, driven by Restasis and Ozurdex; Botox, up 16% in constant currency, driven by growth in therapeutics; skin care, breast aesthetics and facial aesthetics, up a combined 12% in constant currency. International Allergan sales were also up double digits in constant currency, with all 3 units, eye care, medical aesthetics and specialty care, achieving double-digit growth.
We are capitalizing on the exceptional sustaining performance of Actavis and Allergan to create an impressive leader in growth pharma. So the bottom line on our combined company brand performance is strong performance for our key brands, including Namenda XR, Linzess, Botox, Restasis, Bystolic and Ozurdex. Meanwhile, you only have to look at the performance of Lo Loestrin, Saphris, Minastrin and the GI products to see that our team has firmly established a core competency in relaunching products that we acquired. This ability to invigorate acquired products is a differentiator for us. We acquire assets to grow them, and we succeed. That opens up more possibilities for us than is appreciated, more growth, more leverage and more credibility for other bolt-on deals.
While this early, we're off to a very good start with our new launches, and we are now poised to be a significant player in the increasingly important antibiotics space with Dalvance and AVYCAZ. This is where our model of development prowess, life cycle investment and smart business development is creating enduring competitive advantage.
Turning to the North American Generics and International business. Sales were up 20% this quarter in constant currency versus prior year. North American sales were $1.2 billion and continue to benefit from the contribution from key products like generic Concerta, Lidoderm and Intuniv. Special capabilities and being first to file again and again combined to make our generics business a best-in-class competitor.
This year, we have launched 20 generic products in the U.S., including our most recent launch of generic Pulmicort following our court win last week. We also launched generic OxyContin, Temovate and generic ophthalmic products as well.
This quarter, we also launched our generic injectable business after we regained the rights to about 20 injectables from Sagent at the end of 2014, giving us added strength with hospital purchasers.
On the R&D side, our generic business continues to fire on all cylinders with 7 confirmed first-to-files out of the total 18 total filings posted on the FDA website this quarter.
On the International side, non-GAAP sales were $527 million, growing 20%, excluding foreign exchange. We launched close to 100 products during this quarter.
International revenue growth was driven by multiple markets, including Russia, up 41% on a constant-currency basis, driven by our strong sales organization and OTC performance; and the U.K., up 22% on a constant-currency basis, driven by new product launches.
Our strategy in international generics is to continue allocating resources to markets that deliver high-growth potential and where we can be among the leaders. That is why we divested generic products in Australia and invested in Auden Mckenzie acquisition in the U.K., which is expected to close in the second quarter.
Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of the 2015 financials. We are certainly off to a terrific start. We previously planned to provide guidance at the end of Q2, but given the strong performance this quarter, the progress we're making on integration synergies and the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures, we felt it would be good to give you our preliminary view of 2015 today.
First, since we acquired Allergan on March 17, as-reported revenue is projected to be in the range of $20.5 billion to $21 billion. On a pro forma basis, full year sales are projected at $22 billion to $22.5 billion, which was consistent with or slightly ahead of our prior comments of $23 billion if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the multiple divestitures such as respiratory and Pharmatech.
Our current view on 2014 (sic) (2015) non-GAAP earnings per share on an as-reported basis, including Allergan as of March 17, is in the range of $17 to $18.15 -- I'm sorry, $18.50. We will narrow the range over time.
With this view, you can see that we have put together a terrific company with a very compelling outlook for 2015, and we are executing like a high-performance engine driving towards our aspirational target of $25 per share in EPS in 2017. We look forward to giving you more refined guidance on our second quarter call.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tessa, who will provide you with an overview of our financial performance during the quarter. Tessa?"
36478,291601714,810773,"Actavis plc, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results, I would like to remind you that the current quarter results, which I will discuss, now include 15 days of financial contribution from the Allergan acquisition, which was completed on",970,"Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results, I would like to remind you that the current quarter results, which I will discuss, now include 15 days of financial contribution from the Allergan acquisition, which was completed on March 17. The Allergan business contributed $258 million in net revenue and $113 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.
Turning to our results for the first quarter on Slide 15. In Q1, we delivered strong performance with top line growth across key franchises, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite negative foreign currency impact. The year-over-year increase was also driven by the Forest and Allergan acquisition.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 65% versus the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $284 million compared to $175 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP R&D spending was $110 million for generics, $125 million for brands, $15 million for biosimilars and $34 million for Allergan.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 20.9%, an increase of 1.7 percentage points over the prior year quarter as a result of the Forest branded products that have higher SG&A spend.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.78 billion, an increase of 107% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across the business.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 23% to $4.30 compared to $3.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of Allergan and its related financing, Actavis non-GAAP EPS was $4.59 for the first quarter 2015, representing a 17% sequential increase from $3.91 in the fourth quarter. This highlights our continued strong performance on top of integration activities.
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 16.4% in the year-ago period to 14.3% in the current-year quarter mainly due to geographic mix.
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $525 million. Our cash flow from operations would have been more than $800 million if cash charges for severance, restructuring and integration are added back.
Turning now to our business segments. North American Brands business delivered strong performance year-over-year, powered by the acquired Forest products and growth in our Women's Health franchise. North American Brands revenue was $1.74 billion for the quarter, up 192% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of the Forest business, including strong double-digit year-over-year growth from 8 out of our top 10 products.
Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down slightly, driven by normal decline in prescription fill rates from fourth quarter to first quarter but typically recover in the second quarter and wholesaler buying patterns.
Adjusted gross margin within North America Brands decreased to 86.6% largely due to partner products within the Forest portfolio, including Namenda and Linzess. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin improved due to lower Namenda IR sales, which carry a lower margin.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of revenue increased to 27.8%, driven by expenses related to the acquired Forest products.
Our North America Generics and International business continues to perform strongly with non-GAAP revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 12% versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by strong sales of key products and new product launches, including generic versions of Concerta, Lidoderm, Intuniv and OxyContin.
Internationally, our generics business was negatively impacted by the strengthened U.S. dollar, but at constant currency rates, this business grew 20% versus prior year quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross margins increased 3.2 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter due to continued strong performance within our International business.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for the segment declined to 14.8% due to the divestiture of our Western European assets and elimination of the supportive infrastructure of that business.
Turning to our Anda business. Revenues increased to $462 million, up from $300 million in the prior year, an increase of 18% driven by a higher mix of chain drugstore sales. Gross margin for the Anda business decreased 2.6 percentage points to 12.5% as a result of the higher product mix of chain drugstore sales.
Slide 19 details our debt capitalization following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the first quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $44 billion and equity of $71 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing.
Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 4.1x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA. Over the next 12 months, we are committed to using our anticipated strong free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment. We expect to achieve a pro forma leverage ratio of 3.5x debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of the first quarter of 2016, in line with our prior guidance.
Finally, I would like to provide an overview of our key assumptions for the 2015 combined forecast Brent provided earlier in this call. Our non-GAAP EPS of $17 to $18.50 includes key near- and longer-term drivers that we expect over the next few months that will impact our business, including: In U.S. brands, we assumed the Namenda XR conversion trending to 60% by the end of Q2, Namenda IR generic enters the market in mid-July, Namzaric launch this week. In our GX business, we assumed launch of generic Pulmicort, continued current market conditions for Concerta, additional competition on Lidoderm, Auden Mckenzie acquisition close late in Q2. A tax rate of approximately 15%, 2015 fully diluted average shares of approximately 386 million, and year-end 2015 fully diluted shares outstanding of 415 million. Foreign exchange rates are based on average forward consensus for Q2 to Q4.
I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our brands R&D progress in the quarter. David?"

During the first quarter 2015, our R&D teams focused on advancing our near-term development programs whilst also looking towards the future, and the integration of the Actavis and Allergan pipelines.
Turning to Slide 22. We have achieved tremendous progress, and I would applaud the combined efforts of our commercial and R&D teams. We have nearly completed the rationalization of our combined pipeline. Our teams have identified and confirmed 70 projects that will move forward as part of the combined development program with more than 50 projects in either late stage or registration stages of development.
Whilst we have made very significant progress on the rationalization of our pipeline, we are still evaluating certain projects. We continue to drive these projects forward, the key milestones, to allow us to make cost-effective but also data-driven decisions. We will present our combined rationalized pipeline as part of an up-and-coming R&D day.
We have achieved significant progress across key programs from both the legacy Actavis and the legacy Allergan R&D pipelines.
Turning to Slide 23. You get an insight into the extent of our progress to strengthen our key franchises. In the quarter, we achieved milestones across core franchises, including women's health, infectious disease, CNS and gastroenterology.
Key FDA and European approvals included Liletta. This was FDA-approved in February as a long-acting progestin-only intrauterine system, or IUS, to prevent pregnancy for up to 3 years and was launched in the U.S. in April. To support the use of Liletta for up to 7 years, we are continuing the ACCESS study. The initial results of this study were published online in April in Contraception. The study found Liletta to be more than 99% effective for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 3 years of use in women aged 16 to 35 regardless of their race, history of previous births or BMI.
AVYCAZ, our combination of ceftazidime and the novel beta lactamase inhibitor, avibactam, was FDA-approved in March as a treatment for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. The AVYCAZ launch is in progress.
As you have heard, Namzaric is being launched, and we are in discussions with the FDA about extending the range of doses that we can make available to maximize convenience for patients.
Dalbavancin was approved in Europe in February as Xydalba for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, ABSSSI. We are developing a single-dose regimen of Dalvance. And in April, we announced positive top line results for a Phase III study comparing a single 1.5 gram dose of Dalvance with the same total dose given as 2 doses 1 week apart for the treatment of ABSSSI infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. The top line data demonstrated that the single dose of Dalvance achieved its primary endpoint for control of infection at 72 hours after initiation of therapy. The study was also positive at end of treatment, the endpoint required by the European Medicines Agency.
I will return to Botox later.
We also announced the initiation of a Phase IIb study for relamorelin, our investigational treatment for gastroparesis in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We are very pleased with this collaboration with our partner, Rhythm Health.
Turning to Slide 24. We achieved sNDA approvals for a lower dose of 20 milligrams Viibryd, expanding dosing options for clinicians; and for Saphris monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in pediatric patients. FDA has accepted our sNDA to expand the Teflaro label to ABSSSI with concurrent bacteremia.
We received FDA approval for the expanded label of Botox for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. The FDA also approved an increase to the maximum Botox cumulative dose for adults within 3 months treated for one or more indications. We remain very committed to extending our Botox franchise.
Looking ahead, and moving on to Slide 25, we have a significant number of regulatory milestones in the next few months. We have upcoming PDUFA dates for Eluxadoline in the second quarter and for Cariprazine in June. For Eluxadoline, we do not expect an FDA Advisory Committee hearing on our submission, and DEA scheduling begins once approval is achieved.
We are continuing to build out our Linzess franchise, and we expect to submit an sNDA for a low dosage form of the drug to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in 2016.
For DARPin, our Phase II programs for AMD and DME in the U.S. and Japan are ongoing, and we will begin enrollment in our Phase III program in the U.S. later this quarter or early in the third quarter. This on-time start of Phase III is just one of many examples that our strong combined R&D team is maintaining momentum during the integration of our 2 companies.
Restasis is on track to submit the dossier for multi-dose, preservative-free formulations by the end of the year.
I'm excited about Bimataprost SR. The Phase III trials are continuing in the U.S., and we will be starting Phase III in Europe later this year.
SER 120, a low-dose nasal formulation for the treatment of Nocturia, is nearing completion of Phase III, and we are looking forward to seeing the data.
I also wanted to mention our dermal fillers. We are continuing to roll out additional HA formulations. We anticipate extending our Volite line in Europe and our Juvederm line in Asia during the course of this year.
In conclusion, the first quarter of 2015 has been very productive for the R&D team, and we will continue to see momentum in the second quarter and beyond from our industry-leading pipeline.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Brent, who will provide closing remarks. Brent?"

And just one backup on LUMIGAN for Marc. I mean, I think in the studies, we're seeing it lasted about 3 to 4 months, something in that range, versus the drops, which compliance and persistence is a huge issue and glaucoma. And if you talk to glaucoma specialists, they're dying for an effective treatment that would increase compliance and persistence for a disease that's typically asymptomatic. It's doing a lot of damage to the back of the eye. In terms of DARPin, Liav, I think you're right on both tracks. I think the way we're thinking about DARPin is that it should achieve the 3 to 4x a year dosing regimen to make it really a differentiator. Obviously, people don't like getting an injection at the back of the eye. If you look at even EYLEA, they're dosing it more frequently than the label suggests, and so doctors are really looking for something that -- and patients probably even more so looking for something to minimize injection. So we're really trying to design the experiment or the Phase III to hit the 12-week dosing regimen. The other thing I would put out there is remember, we put nothing in our deal model in DARPin, and so outside of the cost of the Phase III study, it's essentially a free call option. And so given where we are, we think after all the modeling and everything we looked at, it was worth going for. But you're right, it's a high hurdle to get there, and to the extent we can, it should provide a very compelling, large opportunity for us in the future, but we've got to get there. I think the second thing it does, it sets us up for dual DARPin, and that could be a very exciting place to be, but it's early. And so we've got a lot of work to do there as well.

I think to respect to your second question, Chris, in terms of the stock being perhaps at lower levels than we all would expect, I don't think it's a question of selling the generics business. I think it's a question of digesting this integration, helping shareholders understand the value proposition here, the compelling growth opportunity that we've created in growth pharma, the enduring, sustainable bottom line growth, continuing to prove out our aspiration of $25 of EPS, some $25, and then showing how the businesses support each other and add additional turbo boosting growth to one another. And so it's still early. We only closed Allergan a few weeks ago, I think 5, 6 weeks ago.

I just think that doing a hostile deal against a large, going concern, like we've seen in the industry over the last 12 months, is value destroying. We are quite experienced in integrations. We do them quite well. And one of the largest reasons we do them well is because we treat people with dignity and respect. We have information exchange freely, of course, following all the rules and regulations around jumping, and that allows us to get a jump on things like you saw in this quarter with the integration of Actavis Allergan, but it also shows how you restore momentum by keeping people's morale high, and that is certainly the case for the most part in our combined company. I think there are opportunities to do hostile deals. I think you have to do them when you're buying a single product perhaps or just a research program or a file where people aren't the key driver. But in most of these businesses, people are such a large part of the equation. I think going hostile in virtually every instance is a mistake. There could always be an exception to that. I think the second thing is there are other large players that we believe are inefficient that would benefit from our operating model, our management philosophy, the way we approach customers in a more efficient manner. And so over time, there may be some targets that could be surprising to folks, but we have to delever, and we have to maintain our investment-grade rating. And so those are all the factors that go into everything we look at.

Obviously, you can hold us accountable for it here at the center, but not a lot we can do about it that -- we see that growth. When you look at how we've kind of baselined it, it's really starting in this quarter with generic IR, then everything else is in. And so that's how we think about it as a CAGR on a go-forward basis.

We haven't seen much of a change despite all the fanfare and publicity around drug pricing in generics.

Having 2 out of your 3 major competitors kind of tied up in knots, fighting each other in a hostile way certainly should create some opportunity for us. It certainly doesn't distract us. It keeps us laser focused on our competitors. And just anecdotally, I'll give you one example. I was down at the NACDS with Paul and Bob Stewart and our branded colleagues, and our other competitors were either there in a very light presence or not at all because they were on the road trying to convince shareholders that their plan or their defense was on track. And so you can already see them despite what they say, saying it doesn't impact them -- impacting them, and so hopefully, we're already in the pole position with respect to R&D, but this will hopefully continue to allow us to continue to be in a pole position with respect to customer service. On the aesthetics side, maybe Philippe will chime in, and Paul perhaps internationally. I think our goal was to really do no harm, right?

We had a terrific quarter on all key measures, and we are on an excellent trajectory for 2015 and beyond. Actavis' first quarter performance was highlighted by double-digit non-GAAP revenue growth versus the prior year, double-digit growth from key North American Brands, double-digit growth from Global Generics and double-digit growth from Anda, our distribution business, 3 rock-solid pillars to which we are adding the Allergan business.
While keeping focused on customers and driving robust growth, we also achieved a long list of accomplishments during the quarter, including completion of a largest deal in health care over the last 10 years, expanding the reach of our International portfolio, executing deals that increased our focus on profitable generic markets such as Auden Mckenzie in the U.K. while completing divestitures that sharpened our brand therapy focus such as our respiratory and Doryx deals and Pharmatech deal, ramping up productivity of our branded generic R&D teams with 4 new brand product approvals and about 20 new generic launches in the United States, and completing the largest financing ever in health care, not to mention kicking off one of the most thoughtful and rapid integrations I've ever seen. I am so proud of each of the people in our combined global team.
One thing is clear. This combined team rallies quickly around surprising opportunities, focuses on the key objectives and executes flawlessly. When it comes to execution, we are like a finely tuned, high-performance engine.
Even though we just closed the Allergan acquisition on March 17, we have already made significant progress on the integration, and we're doing exceptionally well on our cost synergy capture. How did we do it? We quickly named a new management team with skilled and experienced leaders from both companies, but we didn't stop there. In the vast majority of countries, we designed our entire organization all the way to the frontline pre-close so we could rapidly inform our colleagues about their future, give them certainty and move quickly to the new go-forward team.
For example, our global sales force of approximately 7,500 representatives has already been realigned in all but a handful of countries with the intent to minimize customer disruption. We also stood up our new International model with one Country Manager per country, allowing us to operate as one company while taking full advantage of our global brand and generic capabilities.
Being bold, nimble and focused during the integration is how we are staying on track with our aggressive synergy targets and more importantly, how we will keep our sales momentum going. After just 6 weeks, we are making great progress on our integration milestones and are on track to deliver about 80% of our synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2016.
And in a moment, David Nicholson will give an overview of the tremendous progress in the pipeline and will make a few comments about the R&D portfolio prioritization, which is nearly complete. Tessa will also join us to describe our financial performance in detail, but from a high-level perspective, you can see the impact of our transformation over the past 12 to 18 months.
Non-GAAP net revenue was $4.2 billion, a 65% increase largely driven by the Forest acquisition, with only 2 weeks of Allergan in the results; $4.30 of non-GAAP EPS even with the impact of the Allergan financing; $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA; and $525 million in cash flow from operations, more than $800 million if you add back the onetime cash charges for severances, restructuring and integration.
Turning to the business performance. On a pro forma basis, total U.S. branded sales increased 5% if you exclude Allergan and increased 17% if you exclude Namenda IR. 8 of the top 10 Actavis brands are growing double digits versus prior year; not just growing, thriving.
In fact, many of our key products are hitting new highs in volume and market share, including Linzess, which is now approaching a run rate of $400 million annually. Bystolic had a strong performance, running towards $650 million annually. And Lo Loestrin, Estrace and Minastrin are really soaring with the focus we are putting on Women's Health. Liletta will likely be a beneficiary of that focus.
Meanwhile, Namenda XR sales are up sharply as we continue to drive the conversion rate and have resolved last year's supply constraints. Physicians and caregivers continue to convert more patients to Namenda XR with its more convenient and cost-effective profile. Over 70,000 physicians have prescribed Namenda XR, which is a testament to its usefulness and treatment with patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Our patient awareness campaign focused on caregivers and their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease has been well received and is helping with conversion. We are currently at about 50% and climbing towards 60% by the end of the second quarter, and we expect to exceed that figure with the launch of Namzaric, which opens up the donepezil market segment worth about $2 billion.
The primary source of business for Namzaric will be the donepezil or donepezil plus Namenda IR market. The main point here is that the market for Namzaric is bigger than the market for Namenda XR. Namzaric will give patients all the benefits of combination therapy for Alzheimer's disease in one pill, once a day. We intend to support Namzaric with formulary access and direct-to-consumer marketing. Shipping begins this week and full promotional launch later this month. Given the broad use of combination donepezil and Memantine therapy, we think there is a great opportunity for Namzaric to expand the once-a-day branded market.
Turning to the Allergan business. Here again, we come back to our theme of double-digit growth. In the midst of planning for the integration, legacy Allergan delivered double-digit pro forma sales growth of 13% in constant currency to $1.75 billion for its final quarter. Allergan drove this performance while maintaining inventories in the customary, well-managed range. The performance was broad-based, driven by continued strong performance across the company's Eye Care, Botox and Aesthetic businesses. Eye care was up 14% in constant currency, driven by Restasis and Ozurdex; Botox, up 16% in constant currency, driven by growth in therapeutics; skin care, breast aesthetics and facial aesthetics, up a combined 12% in constant currency. International Allergan sales were also up double digits in constant currency, with all 3 units, eye care, medical aesthetics and specialty care, achieving double-digit growth.
We are capitalizing on the exceptional sustained performance of Actavis and Allergan to create an impressive leader in growth pharma. So the bottom line on our combined company brand performance is strong performance for our key brands, including Namenda XR, Linzess, Botox, Restasis, Bystolic and Ozurdex. Meanwhile, you only have to look at the performance of Lo Loestrin, Saphris, Minastrin and the GI products to see that our team has firmly established a core competency in relaunching products that we acquired. This ability to invigorate acquired products is a differentiator for us. We acquire assets to grow them, and we succeed. That opens up more possibilities for us than is appreciated, more growth, more leverage and more credibility for other bolt-on deals.
While this early, we're off to a very good start with our new launches, and we are now poised to be a significant player in the increasingly important antibiotics space with Dalvance and AVYCAZ. This is where our model of development prowess, life cycle investment and smart business development is creating enduring competitive advantage.
Turning to the North American Generics and International business. Sales were up 20% this quarter in constant currency versus prior year. North American sales were $1.2 billion and continue to benefit from the contribution from key products like generic Concerta, Lidoderm and Intuniv. Special capabilities and being first to file again and again combined to make our generics business a best-in-class competitor.
This year, we have launched 20 generic products in the U.S., including our most recent launch of generic Pulmicort following our court win last week. We also launched generic OxyContin, Temovate and generic ophthalmic products as well.
This quarter, we also launched our generic injectable business after we regained the rights to about 20 injectables from Sagent at the end of 2014, giving us added strength with hospital purchasers.
On the R&D side, our generic business continues to fire on all cylinders with 7 confirmed first-to-files out of the total 18 total filings posted on the FDA website this quarter.
On the International side, non-GAAP sales were $527 million, growing 20%, excluding foreign exchange. We launched close to 100 products during this quarter.
International revenue growth was driven by multiple markets, including Russia, up 41% on a constant-currency basis, driven by our strong sales organization and OTC performance; and the U.K., up 22% on a constant-currency basis, driven by new product launches.
Our strategy in international generics is to continue allocating resources to markets that deliver high-growth potential and where we can be among the leaders. That is why we divested generic products in Australia and invested in Auden Mckenzie acquisition in the U.K., which is expected to close in the second quarter.
Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of the 2015 financials. We are certainly off to a terrific start. We previously planned to provide guidance at the end of Q2, but given the strong performance this quarter, the progress we're making on integration synergies and the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures, we felt it would be good to give you our preliminary view of 2015 today.
First, since we acquired Allergan on March 17, as-reported revenue is projected to be in the range of $20.5 billion to $21 billion. On a pro forma basis, full year sales are projected at $22 billion to $22.5 billion, which was consistent with or slightly ahead of our prior comments of $23 billion if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the multiple divestitures such as respiratory and Pharmatech.
Our current view on 2014 (sic) [ 2015 ] non-GAAP earnings per share on an as-reported basis, including Allergan as of March 17, is in the range of $17 to $18.15 -- I'm sorry, $18.50. We will narrow the range over time.
With this view, you can see that we have put together a terrific company with a very compelling outlook for 2015, and we are executing like a high-performance engine driving towards our aspirational target of $25 per share in EPS in 2017. We look forward to giving you more refined guidance on our second quarter call.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tessa, who will provide you with an overview of our financial performance during the quarter. Tessa?"

Before I turn to our results, I would like to remind you that the current quarter results, which I will discuss, now include 15 days of financial contribution from the Allergan acquisition, which was completed on",970,"Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results, I would like to remind you that the current quarter results, which I will discuss, now include 15 days of financial contribution from the Allergan acquisition, which was completed on March 17. The Allergan business contributed $258 million in net revenue and $113 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.
Turning to our results for the first quarter on Slide 15. In Q1, we delivered strong performance with top line growth across key franchises, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite negative foreign currency impact. The year-over-year increase was also driven by the Forest and Allergan acquisition.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 65% versus the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $284 million compared to $175 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP R&D spending was $110 million for generics, $125 million for brands, $15 million for biosimilars and $34 million for Allergan.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 20.9%, an increase of 1.7 percentage points over the prior year quarter as a result of the Forest branded products that have higher SG&A spend.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.78 billion, an increase of 107% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across the business.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 23% to $4.30 compared to $3.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of Allergan and its related financing, Actavis non-GAAP EPS was $4.59 for the first quarter 2015, representing a 17% sequential increase from $3.91 in the fourth quarter. This highlights our continued strong performance on top of integration activities.
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 16.4% in the year-ago period to 14.3% in the current-year quarter mainly due to geographic mix.
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $525 million. Our cash flow from operations would have been more than $800 million if cash charges for severance, restructuring and integration are added back.
Turning now to our business segments. North American Brands business delivered strong performance year-over-year, powered by the acquired Forest products and growth in our Women's Health franchise. North American Brands revenue was $1.74 billion for the quarter, up 192% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of the Forest business, including strong double-digit year-over-year growth from 8 out of our top 10 products.
Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down slightly, driven by normal decline in prescription fill rates from fourth quarter to first quarter but typically recover in the second quarter and wholesaler buying patterns.
Adjusted gross margin within North America Brands decreased to 86.6% largely due to partner products within the Forest portfolio, including Namenda and Linzess. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin improved due to lower Namenda IR sales, which carry a lower margin.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of revenue increased to 27.8%, driven by expenses related to the acquired Forest products.
Our North America Generics and International business continues to perform strongly with non-GAAP revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 12% versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by strong sales of key products and new product launches, including generic versions of Concerta, Lidoderm, Intuniv and OxyContin.
Internationally, our generics business was negatively impacted by the strengthened U.S. dollar, but at constant currency rates, this business grew 20% versus prior year quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross margins increased 3.2 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter due to continued strong performance within our International business.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for the segment declined to 14.8% due to the divestiture of our Western European assets and elimination of the supportive infrastructure of that business.
Turning to our Anda business. Revenues increased to $462 million, up from $300 million in the prior year, an increase of 18% driven by a higher mix of chain drugstore sales. Gross margin for the Anda business decreased 2.6 percentage points to 12.5% as a result of the higher product mix of chain drugstore sales.
Slide 19 details our debt capitalization following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the first quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $44 billion and equity of $71 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing.
Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 4.1x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA. Over the next 12 months, we are committed to using our anticipated strong free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment. We expect to achieve a pro forma leverage ratio of 3.5x debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of the first quarter of 2016, in line with our prior guidance.
Finally, I would like to provide an overview of our key assumptions for the 2015 combined forecast Brent provided earlier in this call. Our non-GAAP EPS of $17 to $18.50 includes key near- and longer-term drivers that we expect over the next few months that will impact our business, including: In U.S. brands, we assumed the Namenda XR conversion trending to 60% by the end of Q2, Namenda IR generic enters the market in mid-July, Namzaric launched this week. In our GX business, we assumed launch of generic Pulmicort, continued current market conditions for Concerta, additional competition on Lidoderm, Auden Mckenzie acquisition close late in Q2, a tax rate of approximately 15%, 2015 fully diluted average shares of approximately 386 million, and year-end 2015 fully diluted shares outstanding of 415 million. Foreign exchange rates are based on average forward consensus for Q2 to Q4.
I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our brands R&D progress in the quarter. David?"

During the first quarter 2015, our R&D teams focused on advancing our near-term development programs whilst also looking towards the future, and the integration of the Actavis and Allergan pipelines.
Turning to Slide 22. We have achieved tremendous progress, and I would applaud the combined efforts of our commercial and R&D teams. We have nearly completed the rationalization of our combined pipeline. Our teams have identified and confirmed 70 projects that will move forward as part of the combined development program with more than 50 projects in either late stage or registration stages of development.
Whilst we have made very significant progress on the rationalization of our pipeline, we are still evaluating certain projects. We continue to drive these projects forward, the key milestones, to allow us to make cost-effective but also data-driven decisions. We will present our combined rationalized pipeline as part of an up-and-coming R&D day.
We have achieved significant progress across key programs from both the legacy Actavis and the legacy Allergan R&D pipelines.
Turning to Slide 23. You get an insight into the extent of our progress to strengthen our key franchises. In the quarter, we achieved milestones across core franchises, including women's health, infectious disease, CNS and gastroenterology.
Key FDA and European approvals included Liletta. This was FDA-approved in February as a long-acting progestin-only intrauterine system, or IUS, to prevent pregnancy for up to 3 years and was launched in the U.S. in April. To support the use of Liletta for up to 7 years, we are continuing the ACCESS study. The initial results of this study were published online in April in Contraception. The study found Liletta to be more than 99% effective for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 3 years of use in women aged 16 to 35 regardless of their race, history of previous births or BMI.
AVYCAZ, our combination of ceftazidime and the novel beta lactamase inhibitor, avibactam, was FDA-approved in March as a treatment for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. The AVYCAZ launch is in progress.
As you have heard, Namzaric is being launched, and we are in discussions with the FDA about extending the range of doses that we can make available to maximize convenience for patients.
Dalbavancin was approved in Europe in February as Xydalba for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, ABSSSI. We are developing a single-dose regimen of Dalvance. And in April, we announced positive top line results for a Phase III study comparing a single 1.5 gram dose of Dalvance with the same total dose given as 2 doses 1 week apart for the treatment of ABSSSI infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. The top line data demonstrated that the single dose of Dalvance achieved its primary endpoint for control of infection at 72 hours after initiation of therapy. The study was also positive at end of treatment, the endpoint required by the European Medicines Agency.
I will return to Botox later.
We also announced the initiation of a Phase IIb study for relamorelin, our investigational treatment for gastroparesis in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We are very pleased with this collaboration with our partner, Rhythm Health.
Turning to Slide 24. We achieved sNDA approvals for a lower dose of 20 milligrams Viibryd, expanding dosing options for clinicians; and for Saphris monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in pediatric patients. FDA has accepted our sNDA to expand the Teflaro label to ABSSSI with concurrent bacteremia.
We received FDA approval for the expanded label of Botox for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. The FDA also approved an increase to the maximum Botox cumulative dose for adults within 3 months treated for one or more indications. We remain very committed to extending our Botox franchise.
Looking ahead, and moving on to Slide 25, we have a significant number of regulatory milestones in the next few months. We have upcoming PDUFA dates for Eluxadoline in the second quarter and for Cariprazine in June. For Eluxadoline, we do not expect an FDA Advisory Committee hearing on our submission, and DEA scheduling begins once approval is achieved.
We are continuing to build out our Linzess franchise, and we expect to submit an sNDA for a low dosage form of the drug to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in 2016.
For DARPin, our Phase II programs for AMD and DME in the U.S. and Japan are ongoing, and we will begin enrollment in our Phase III program in the U.S. later this quarter or early in the third quarter. This on-time start of Phase III is just one of many examples that our strong combined R&D team is maintaining momentum during the integration of our 2 companies.
Restasis is on track to submit the dossier for multi-dose, preservative-free formulations by the end of the year.
I'm excited about Bimataprost SR. The Phase III trials are continuing in the U.S., and we will be starting Phase III in Europe later this year.
SER 120, a low-dose nasal formulation for the treatment of Nocturia, is nearing completion of Phase III, and we are looking forward to seeing the data.
I also wanted to mention our dermal fillers. We are continuing to roll out additional HA formulations. We anticipate extending our Volite line in Europe and our Juvederm line in Asia during the course of this year.
In conclusion, the first quarter of 2015 has been very productive for the R&D team, and we will continue to see momentum in the second quarter and beyond from our industry-leading pipeline.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Brent, who will provide closing remarks. Brent?"

And just one backup on LUMIGAN for Marc. I mean, I think in the studies, we're seeing it lasted about 3 to 4 months, something in that range, versus the drops, which compliance and persistence is a huge issue and glaucoma. And if you talk to glaucoma specialists, they're dying for an effective treatment that would increase compliance and persistence for a disease that's typically asymptomatic. It's doing a lot of damage to the back of the eye. 
In terms of DARPin, Liav, I think you're right on both tracks. I think the way we're thinking about DARPin is that it should achieve the 3x to 4x a year dosing regimen to make it really a differentiator. Obviously, people don't like getting an injection at the back of the eye. If you look at even EYLEA, they're dosing it more frequently than the label suggests, and so doctors are really looking for something that, and patients probably even more so looking, for something to minimize injection. So we're really trying to design the experiment or the Phase III to hit the 12-week dosing regimen. The other thing I would put out there is remember, we put nothing in our deal model in DARPin, and so outside of the cost of the Phase III study, it's essentially a free call option. And so given where we are, we think after all the modeling and everything we looked at, it was worth going for. But you're right, it's a high hurdle to get there, and to the extent we can, it should provide a very compelling, large opportunity for us in the future, but we've got to get there. I think the second thing it does, it sets us up for dual DARPin, and that could be a very exciting place to be, but it's early. And so we've got a lot of work to do there as well.

I think to respect to your second question, Chris, in terms of the stock being perhaps at lower levels than we all would expect, I don't think it's a question of selling the generics business. I think it's a question of digesting this integration, helping shareholders understand the value proposition here, the compelling growth opportunity that we've created in growth pharma, the enduring, sustainable bottom line growth, continuing to prove out our aspiration of $25 of EPS in '25 (sic) [ 2017 ], and then showing how the businesses support each other and add additional turbo boosting growth to one another. And so it's still early. We only closed Allergan a few weeks ago, I think 5, 6 weeks ago. And so I think no one wants to have a trigger finger and overreact to 5 weeks of weakness, if you will, in the midst of closing, rebasing your shareholders, having a lot of people sorting through different moving parts.

We have information exchange freely, of course, following all the rules and regulations gun jumping, and that allows us to get a jump on things like you saw in this quarter with the integration of Actavis Allergan, but it also shows how you restore momentum by keeping people's morale high, and that is certainly the case for the most part in our combined company. 
I think there are opportunities to do hostile deals. I think you have to do them when you're buying a single product perhaps or just a research program or a file where people aren't the key driver. But in most of these businesses, people are such a large part of the equation. I think going hostile in virtually every instance is a mistake. There could always be an exception to that. I think the second thing is there are other large players that we believe are inefficient that would benefit from our operating model, our management philosophy, the way we approach customers in a more efficient manner. And so over time, there may be some targets that could be surprising to folks, but we have to delever, and we have to maintain our investment-grade rating.

We haven't seen much of a change despite all the fanfare and publicity around drug pricing in generics. There are obviously a few products that go up, but the model for generics is price decreases as more competitors come into the market. That's just the way the business works. And overall, we still model a mid-single-digit price decrease in our business. That being said, the environment has remained pretty stable and favorable. So we don't expect that to change short term either. I don't know, Paul, if you have other thoughts."

Having 2 out of your 3 major competitors kind of tied up in knots, fighting each other in a hostile way certainly should create some opportunity for us. It certainly doesn't distract us. It keeps us laser focused on our competitors. And just anecdotally, I'll give you one example. I was down at the NACDS with Paul and Bob Stewart and our branded colleagues, and our other competitors were either there in a very light presence or not at all because they were on the road trying to convince shareholders that their plan or their defense was on track. And so you can already see them despite what they say, saying it doesn't impact them -- impacting them, and so hopefully, we're already in the pole position with respect to R&D, but this will hopefully continue to allow us to continue to be in a pole position with respect to customer service. On the aesthetics side, maybe Philippe will chime in, and Paul perhaps internationally. I think our goal was to really do no harm, right?

It's great to be with you to review our results for the second quarter of 2015, which builds on the terrific results we have last quarter. This was also our first full quarter of a combined operations following the close of the Allergan acquisition on March 17. And I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished, especially the momentum they have created to propel our future growth.
Turning to Slide 5. Allergan's second quarter performance highlights our ability to execute on our 4 pillars of our long-term growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and result in all key business segments, key products and key geographies. Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises. Third, our productive innovative R&D engine has produced more than 100 branded product approvals globally and 56 branded regulatory submissions year-to-date. And fourth, and forth, we're executing on strategic business deals to support our growth in the therapy areas and charge-off our pipeline for the future.
We also changed our name to Allergan in the quarter to symbolize our transformation into a leader in growth pharma or brands now contribute more than 2/3 of our company's revenues. Whereas our focus in growth pharma, we are encouraging our employees around the world to be bold and smart in the way we think and act. 
Turning to Slide 6. The announcement of our plans to combine our Global Generics business with Teva in a $40.5 billion deal is the latest bold move by our company to continue our transformation towards being a leader in branded Growth Pharma. For years, we've been lessening up the innovation curve towards especially pharma products. This agreement clearly our transformation. This deal allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our focus on 7 core therapy areas and reload our capital structure to continue our transformation. There are certainly more to come on this story.
We are confident that we're creating the most dynamic company in growth pharma, while adding our impressive generic commercial, generic R&D and operating capabilities to Teva. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and talk about the business performance in the second quarter.
Our second quarter revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $5.7 billion as a result of the acquisitions of Allergan and Forest. On a pro forma basis, sales were up 12%, excluding the impact of foreign currency, Namenda IR and divestitures, with double the growth in Brand and Global Generics segments. The strong sales increase introduced from the integration of Allergan and Forest were the primary drivers of the 29% increase in earnings per share to $4.41. 
Meanwhile, non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2.6 billion and cash flow from operations was about $1.7 billion, excluding one-time cash payments for severance, acquisitions and integration. Tessa will talk more about the financials shortly.
On Slide 8. Our Global Generics business is doing very well and the units that comprise it are firing at all cylinders as we prepare for the combination with Teva. Generics sales are up 17%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Generic profitability is up and our exceptional generic R&D capabilities are evident, with 12 new first-to-file drugs this year. This brings the total number of ANDAs under review to approximately 220 with 76 confirmed first-to-files.
U.S. Generics revenues were $1.1 billion in the quarter and continue to benefit from new product introductions and contribution from high barrier and semiexclusive products like generic Concerta. Meanwhile, our International Generics team continues to drive excellent performance in key markets, excluding the impact of foreign currency such as the U.K., which was up 85%, including the effect of the Auden Mckenzie transaction that closed in May, and Russia, which was up 32%.
Turning to Slide 9. Our brand business continues to thrive impressive performance with 12 of the top 15 Global Brands growing, many with double-digit pro forma year-over-year growth. Sales increased 11%, excluding Namenda IR, the divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange. And the success is broad-based, excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit growth in eye care, GI and key woman health products and cardiovascular. Double-digit growth from our latest largest leading brands like Botox, Restasis, Namenda XR and our Fillers, including Juvederm. Double-digit growth from well-established brands like Bystolic, LoLoestrin and Estrace and double-digit growth from Linzess, Aciphex and other large brands, which puts us in excellent position to our growth will into the future.
It is a terrific lineup of brands with long exclusivity and is backed by a great team on the ground and our leading pipeline with multiple shops in each of our 7 priority therapeutic areas.
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to drive conversion of patients to Namenda XR right up to the end of the Namenda IR exclusivity, reaching about 53% before generic entry. With continued promotion and the launch of Namzaric, we believe the penetration rate goes even higher, towards our target of 60%, 65% as the year progresses. And with once a day dosing, formulary access at every 1 of the top 8 plans and focused sales team, we maintain relatively stable volumes on Namenda XR even as the Namenda IR prescriptions dropped.
We are now doing the blocking and tackling to build the demand and access for Namzaric. With full promotion just getting underway, our DTC campaign beginning in September and an anticipated 7 out of the top 10 plans having coverage by the beginning of 2016, we think we are well-prepared to drive market expansion in 2016. 
Given the broad use of combination to therapy, the efficacy of Namzaric and the patient caregiver and system benefits of 1 pill, once a day, we think there's a great opportunity for the innovation of Namzaric to become the cornerstone of once a day branded market in Alzheimer's treatment.
Turning to Slide 11. In a few moments, David will give an update on the pipeline, but I want to point out that our pipeline remains one of the best kept secrets of our company. With 70 projects in mid to late development, we are in an enviable position of having multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help a sustain leadership in the areas we chose to compete. And we built this pipeline step-by-step, not by investing big dollars on discovery, but by investing in smart development projects.
Even with ESN breadth and depth of our current pipeline, we're always on the look out for R&D assets that can extend our leadership by bringing novel approaches to existing therapy areas. And then last 2 months alone, we've announced agreements for 4 planned acquisitions in Aesthetics, eye care and CNS, each will bring novelty to existing areas and will add to our ability to lead in these therapeutic areas. And each of these deals to bring games and their potential ideas to our pipeline.
ABL is off to to a strong start in aesthetics, with sales already surpassing $1 million and a recent approval in Canada. We are making great progress towards closing the transaction mode that we've cleared antitrust review in the U.S. And as announced yesterday, we no longer intend to issue our shares to complete this acquisition. The Oculeve acquisition has also cleared HSR in the U.S. and we'll work toward extending our try opportunities with our novel nasal neurostimulation device. 
In CNS, we're working to close deals to extend our migraine offering with Merck's first in oral -- first-in-class oral CGRP antagonist and the Naurex novel approach to treating new disorders including severe depression, which remains aleading cause of suicidal.
In closing, our team continues to focus on execution and the results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at delivering strong operating results, while also doing surprising things that make our company the most dynamic in all of health care.
I'm so proud of our team for their performance and I'm looking forward to what we can do with the strength and focus on branded pharmaceuticals and a significantly reduced operating structure and reloaded capital structure. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tessa."

In Q2, we delivered strong performance, both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.7 billion, an increase of 36% versus Q1 2015. 
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $406 million compared to $185 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 21.7%, an increase of 3 percentage points over the prior year quarter, as a result of the Forest branded products and business, which we have higher SG&A spend.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 203% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across our segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 29% to $4.41 compared to $3.42 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014.
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 17.1% in the year-ago period to 14.5% in the current-year quarter, mainly due to the geographic mix of our businesses. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 198% versus the year-ago quarter. Excluding acquisition-related restructuring and integration payments, our second quarter free cash flow would be $1.7 billion.
Before turning to our business segment results, I would like to take a moment to review our new segment reporting for the second quarter. In this quarter, we are reporting results in 5 segments. The U.S. brand segment represents sales and expenses related to branded products within the United States, including Botox therapeutics. 
The U.S. Medical Aesthetics segment represents sales and expenses related to aesthetics and dermatology products within the United States, including Botox cosmetics. The International Brands segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that have the majority of their businesses represented by branded sales and revenues and expenses related to product sales in Canada, Switzerland and Austria. 
The Global Generics segment represents revenues in operating expenses in countries that have the majority of their business represented by generic product sales, a third-party Medis business and revenues and expenses related to product sales in the U.S., Canada, Switzerland and Austria. 
The Anda distribution segment results represents sales and expenses related to distribution of generic and brand pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties. Also, as a result of Teva's acquisition of Allergan's generic business, Allergan will report its generics business as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2015. Since the divested business spans both Global Generics and international brand segments, it will be difficult today to model the remaining Allergan business. We will provide some guidance in September.
Turning now to our U.S. brand results on Slide 15. The business has strong performance year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. U.S. brands revenue was $2.44 billion for the quarter, up 331% versus the prior year period and 35% in the prior quarter, driven by the addition of the Forest and Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products, including Linzess and Namenda XR.
Adjusted gross margin within the U.S. brands remains steady at 87.4%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.8% versus 17.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven by expenses related to the Forest and Allergan acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 16 in our U.S. Medical Aesthetics business. The second quarter revenues were $487 million, an increase of 510% versus first quarter 2015 results. Second quarter gross margin of 93% and segment margin of 70.6% were largely in line with expectations. SG&A in the quarter remains steady. 
Turning to Slide 17 in our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $717 million versus $169 million in the prior year period, an increase of 324%. Gross margins increased 21.7 percentage points to 77.8% in the second quarter, due largely to the inclusion of higher margin legacy Allergan products. 
Segment SG&A improved 7.2 percentage points to 32% versus Q1 2015 due largely to synergy capture related to the Allergan acquisition.
On Slide 18, Global Generics revenues in the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10% versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by strong sales in the base business, including generic Concerta, offset in part additional competition on certain products, including generic Lidoderm. Adjusted gross margins increased 1 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter due to continued strong performance within our international business.
Lower gross margin versus the prior year quarter was mainly due to lower contribution of ER and oxycodone in the second quarter the first quarter of 2015. SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue decreased slightly to 15% from 15.8% in the year-ago quarter.
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 19. Revenues increased $462 million, up from $427 million in the prior year, an increase of 8%, driven by trends in our base business and a higher mix of chain drugstore sales. 
Slide 20 details our debt capitalization following the completion of our first full quarter following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the second quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.9 billion and equity of $72.1 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. In the second quarter, we paid down approximately $1.4 billion of our debt. Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 3.9x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 4.1x in the prior quarter. We remain committed to using strong free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment, and we continue to remain committed to investment-grade ratings.
I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our brand's R&D progress in the quarter. David?"

Our brand's R&D team continues to be tremendously productive. Year-to-date, worldwide, our strong late-stage pipeline has delivered more than 100 pharmaceutical and medical device approvals and 56 regulatory submissions. 
I will highlight some of the most significant of this in my overview. Following the first round of integration prioritization, we now have more than 7 the mid- to late-stage development projects, with approximately 45 projects in either late-stage development or registration. The productivity of the legacy Allergan R&D organizations is demonstrated by the industry-leading figure of 14 MME approval in the United States over the last 6.5 years. Going forward, we'll continue to make data-driven prioritization positions in all of our programs.
In addition to rationalizing and driving productivity from our existing pipeline, we are committed to identifying and executing acquisitions and licensing agreements that further strengthen our long-term leadership position in key therapeutic areas. This is exemplified by ap ending acquisitions of Kythera, Oculeve and Naurex and licensing of Merck's oral CGRP programs during the quarter. 
The next 2 slides summarize some highlights and describe the progress in our late-stage pipeline. Slide 23 shows late-stage game-changing opportunities across our therapeutic areas. 
In aesthetics, we are adding ABLF from to our pipeline. Our aesthetics pipeline already includes by for hair growth, and so for acne, as well as many line extensions to our dealers. 
In eye care, we are adding the intranasal dry eye device from Oculeve to our dry eye franchise, further enhancing our leading position in our therapeutic area. My colleagues and I have reviewed our restated data and again, find our efficacy and tolerability data very compelling in comparison to the recently published data from other compounds in development and registration. 
In Phase III, we are developing dark and have a sustained-release formulation of bimatoprost. 
In CNS, we are adding generics, an modulator to our pipeline. These compounds of the first novel mechanism for mood disorders for more than 2 decades. We're also adding oral CGRP antagonist. These compounds in-license from Merck are designed both for the acute treatment as well as for the prophylaxis of migraine. We also have Cariprazine in development and Namzaric, which combines 2 complementary therapeutic agents, Namenda and Aricept. 
Recently, much attention has turned to prevention of Alzheimer's and like all of us, I had hoped that effective preventive therapy will be discovered. Namzaric was recently presented in the 2015 Alzheimer's Association International Conference. The efficacy of Namzaric in patients with Alzheimer's is least similar magnitude to that reported with the present preventative agents in development. 
In GI disorders, together with our partner [ph], we continue to develop dosage and formulations of our IBS and the to offer a very complete package to physician and patients. Also, we complete the deal initial development of Alex and by YSP. 
In Urology, together with our partner Serenity, we have intranasal completing Phase III from Nocturia. 
In our anti-infectives franchise, we continue to develop and AVYCAZ. In biologics, Phase III will be completed this year for bevacizumab, a biosimilar of of Avastin, which is part of our partnership with Amgen.
Last, but certainly not least, is Botox. We continue to further develop and launch these agents across our Aesthetics, C&S and Urology franchises. 
Turning to Slide 24, I'm going to update you on progress with regulatory authorities to key late-stage products.
In Aesthetics, naturally inspirer, tested breast implants received FDA approval for women undergoing breast reconstruction, augmentation or revision surgery, and we are on track for FDA submission of our Filler in the third quarter 2015. Yesterday, we received FDA approval to market 28 additional styles of NATRELLE 410 breast implants. 
In Asia, we received licensing rights for commercial sales of Juvederm in China and submitted an NDA to Botox [indiscernible] in Japan. In eye care, Botox received approval in Japan for the treatment of strabismus. We're on track for FDA submission as a multi-dose preservative-free formulations of Restasis in September. We've currently enrolling patients in Phase III trials for bimatoprost in the U.S., and we've initiated pivotal Phase III trials of our lead Darphin in age-related macular degeneration on target in June this year. 
In CNS, we have a PDUFA date in September for Cariprazine as a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar mania. In this quarter, we launched Namzaric and we'll be filing additional dose combinations of this agent later this year.
In GI, our strong pipeline does continue to develop new opportunities. We expect to complete the Phase III study for a low-dosage form of Linzess to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in the second half of the year, and we expect to submit an sNDA for this indication next year. 
Meanwhile, has been approved by the FDA as a twice-daily oral treatment for IBSD. We're awaiting DEA scheduling of prior to  launch of this product in the United States, and we submitted the dosage eluxadoline in Europe in May.
In women's health, enrollment in our Phase III trial of Esmya for the treatment of bleeding disorders caused by uterine fibroids is on track. We're committed to completing trial enrollment this year.
In Urology, we completed our Phase III trials of SER 120 in Nocturia. The date is on our review prior submission to the agency. In anti-infectives, our development of a single-dose formulation of Dalvance remains on track. We've made regulatory submissions for approval in both the United States in Europe. We're also anticipating approval for Teflaro in bacteremia during the course of this year.
On Slide 25, we outlined some of our most recent business development opportunities. Obviously, these this helps us to further solidify our leadership position in our core therapeutic areas. 
With Kythera, we add a first-in-class agent, Kybella, for the treatment of submental fat or double chin to our product line. The product is launched in the States and was recently approved in Canada. 
In addition, Kythera has an interesting and genetically validated here growth problem in early development. Oculeve will strengthen our leading position in dry eye, with the ODO 1 development program, an intranasal neurostimulation device that increases tear production in patients with dry eye. 
Our licensing agreement with Merck built in our commitment to the development of treatment to migraine. We're adding oral formulations of CGRP antagonist of our product line. The use of both small molecules as well as antibodies has clearly shown that CGRP antagonism is effective in treating migraine. 
There are 4 injectable antibodies in development whilst, we will have the only oral CGRP antagonist. 
Finally, Naurex. The acquisition of NRx add innovative development programs in depression to our pipeline. Depression is an area of medicine that has seen minimal progress for the last 20 years. The Naurex compounds are MMDA modulators, a unique approach to the treatment of depression. These agents have the potential to be fast onset antidepressant and hence, may be beneficial in the alleviation of suicidality, which is so often a terrible feature of this disorder. 
In early-stage development, the Naurex team showed their compound in [indiscernible] and also to be effective in treating depression, which fail to respond to traditional antidepressants.
In closing, the second quarter of 2015 was another period of continuous strong productivity for the Allergan R&D team. We look forward to continue to deliver on the promise of many of our development programs in our pipeline for the remainder of 2015 and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn it over to brand for closing remarks.

So how do we think about that when we think about the base business going forward? And then secondly, just to follow up on that $25 number, that $25 obviously includes about $5 or $2.4 billion in EBIT from the generic business.

What we have been indicated in our coin related whatever that we would use a portion of the proceeds to pay down debt. But again, it's largely dependent on how much we use for capital deployment.

What has change obviously, is by selling the generics business and the $2.4 billion of EBITDA to Teva, the timing of that aspiration. And so we need to continue to look at how we will deploy the capital and how the timing of the deployment of that capital will pull-through to give a more precise view of it.

We have an effort where to increase the diagnosis rate through in office screenings for dry eye, which have been linked to blurred vision, adverse post outcomes. And so it is an educational effort. And finally, we have launched a primary care effort for Restasis. And the formulary coverage on the drug is rocksolid. And then I probably just add Linzess in there. We have our foot on the gas. The response to our second wave of direct-to-consumer advertising is exceeding industry norms. We just launched a effort into long-term care for the first time since Linzess was approved and that's about 25% of the market.

Look, I think that in fairness, it would be very difficult for us to do a transformational deal with a company with a higher growth rate because I think based on at least of today's measure with high-growth rate so that would really limit the universe. That being said, I think that the issue for us is we want to be in growth pharma. We'd be willing to go from, let's say, roughly 10% to a 9% top line growth rate of the highly accretive bottom line deal? The answer is absolutely. We'd be willing to go from 10% to 3% or 4% top line growth to do a highly accretive deal, I would say highly unlikely. And so we want to go out and make sure that we can acquire something that we believe has a growth orientation to it that has longer duration assets. And I think it should also keep in mind, we're pretty, as I use the word, bold in our thinking. So yes, I think think a lot of people look at the universe of transformational deals and say you can't touch this because it's got this particular product track over this particular issue. We've been known to be very creative consulting for those things in the past and I'll be at a very deal, I would pointed clearly excess just an illustration. They had 2 assets, they had the NDA for [ph] and they had royalty stream from Tekada. We divested the royalties stream Tekada to Royalty Pharma at the time we announced the deal. We had that repeat wired. And so we kept what we wanted and we sold something that was available to somebody else to help pay for the deal.

It's great to be with you to review our results for the second quarter of 2015, which builds on the terrific results we had last quarter. This was also our first full quarter of a combined operations following the close of the Allergan acquisition on March 17. And I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished, especially the momentum they have created to propel our future growth.
Turning to Slide 5. Allergan's second quarter performance highlights our ability to execute on our 4 pillars of our long-term growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and results in all key business segments, key products and key geographies. Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine has produced more than 100 branded product approvals globally and 56 branded regulatory submissions year-to-date. And fourth, we're executing on strategic business deals to support our growth in key therapy areas and charge up our pipeline for the future.
We also changed our name to Allergan in the quarter to symbolize our transformation into a leader in Growth Pharma, where brands now contribute more than 2/3 of our company's revenues. With our focus in Growth Pharma, we are encouraging our employees around the world to be bold and smart in the way we think and act. 
Turning to Slide 6. The announcement of our plans to combine our Global Generics business with Teva in a $40.5 billion deal is the latest bold move by our company to continue our transformation towards being a leader in branded Growth Pharma. For years, we've been moving up the innovation curve towards specialty pharma products. This agreement clearly accelerates our transformation. This deal allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our focus on 7 core therapy areas and reload our capital structure to continue our transformation. There's certainly more to come on this story.
We are confident that we are creating the most dynamic company in Growth Pharma, while adding our impressive global generic commercial, generic R&D and operating capabilities to Teva. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and talk about the business performance in the second quarter. Our second quarter revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $5.7 billion as a result of the acquisitions of Allergan and Forest. On a pro forma basis, sales were up 12%, excluding the impact of foreign currency, Namenda IR and divestitures, with double-digit growth in brand and Global Generics segments. The strong sales increase introduced from the integration of Allergan and Forest were the primary drivers of the 29% increase in earnings per share to $4.41. Meanwhile, non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2.6 billion and cash flow from operations was about $1.7 billion, excluding onetime cash payments for severance, acquisitions and integration. Tessa will talk more about the financials shortly.
On Slide 8. Our Global Generics business is doing very well and the units that comprise it are firing on all cylinders as we prepare for the combination with Teva. Generics sales are up 17%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Generic profitability is up and our exceptional generic R&D capabilities are evident, with 12 new first-to-file drugs this year. This brings the total number of ANDAs under review to approximately 220 with 76 confirmed first-to-files.
U.S. Generic revenues were $1.1 billion in the quarter and continued to benefit from new product introductions and contribution from high-barrier and semi-exclusive products, like generic Concerta. Meanwhile, our International Generics team continues to drive excellent performance in key markets, excluding the impact of foreign currency such as the U.K., which was up 85%, including the effect of the Auden Mckenzie transaction that closed in May; and Russia, which was up 32%.
Turning to Slide 9. Our brands business continues to thrive impressive performance with 12 of the top 15 global brands growing, many with double-digit pro forma year-over-year growth. Sales increased 11%, excluding Namenda IR, the divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange. And the success is broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit growth in eye care, GI and key woman health products and cardiovascular; double-digit growth from our latest largest leading brands like Botox, Restasis, Namenda XR and our fillers, including Juvederm; double-digit growth from well-established brands like Bystolic, LoLoestrin and Estrace; and double-digit growth from Linzess, Ozurdex and other launch brands, which puts us in excellent position to power growth well into the future. It is a terrific lineup of brands with long exclusivity and is backed by a great team on the ground and our leading pipeline, with multiple shots on each of our 7 priority therapeutic areas.
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to drive conversion of patients to Namenda XR right up to the end of the Namenda IR exclusivity, reaching about 53% before generic entry. With continued promotion and the launch of Namzaric, we believe the penetration rate goes even higher, towards our target of 60% to 65% as the year progresses. And with once a day dosing, formulary access at every 1 of the top 8 plans and a focused sales team, we maintain relatively stable volumes on Namenda XR even as the Namenda IR prescriptions dropped. We are now doing the blocking and tackling to build the demand and access for Namzaric. With full promotion just getting underway, our DTC campaign beginning in September and an anticipated 7 out of the top 10 plans having coverage by the beginning of 2016, we think we are well prepared to drive market expansion in 2016. Given the broad use of combination donepezil and memantine therapy, the efficacy of Namzaric and the patient caregiver and system benefits of one pill, once a day, we think there's a great opportunity for the innovation of Namzaric to become the cornerstone of once-a-day branded market in Alzheimer's treatment.
Turning to Slide 11. In a few moments, David Nicholson will give an update on the pipeline, but I want to point out that our pipeline remains one of the best-kept secrets of our company. With 70 projects in mid to late development, we are in an enviable position of having multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help us sustain leadership in the areas we choose to compete. And we built this pipeline step-by-step, not by investing big dollars on discovery, but by investing in smart development projects.
Even with the excellent breadth and depth of our current pipeline, we are always on the lookout for R&D assets that can extend our leadership by bringing novel approaches to existing therapy areas. And in last 2 months alone, we've announced agreements for 4 planned acquisitions in aesthetics, eye care and CNS. Each will bring novelty to existing areas and will add to our ability to lead in these therapeutic areas. And each of these deals bible game-changer potential ideas to our pipeline.
Kybella is off to a strong start in aesthetics, with sales already surpassing $1 million and a recent approval in Canada. We are making great progress towards closing the transaction now that we have cleared antitrust review in the U.S. And as we announced yesterday, we no longer intend to issue our shares to complete this acquisition. The Oculeve acquisition has also cleared HSR in the U.S. and we'll look forward to extending our dry ey opportunities with our novel nasal neurostimulation device. In CNS, we're working to close deals to extend our migraine offering with Merck's first in oral -- first-in-class oral CGRP antagonist and the Naurex novel approach to treating mood disorders, including severe depression, which remains a leading cause of suicide.
In closing, our team continues to focus on execution and the results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at delivering strong operating results, while also doing surprising things that make our company the most dynamic in all of health care. I'm so proud of our team for their performance and I'm looking forward to what we can do with a strength and focus on branded pharmaceuticals and a significantly reduced operating structure and reloaded capital structure. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tessa."

In Q2, we delivered strong performance, both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.7 billion, an increase of 36% versus Q1 2015. 
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $406 million compared to $185 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 21.7%, an increase of 3 percentage points over the prior year quarter, as a result of the Forest branded products and Allergan business, which we have higher SG&A spend.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 203% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across our segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 29% to $4.41 compared to $3.42 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014.
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 17.1% in the year-ago period to 14.5% in the current-year quarter, mainly due to the geographic mix of our businesses. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 198% versus the year-ago quarter. Excluding acquisition-related restructuring and integration payments, our second quarter free cash flow would be $1.7 billion.
Before turning to our business segment results, I would like to take a moment to review our new segment reporting for the second quarter. In this quarter, we are reporting results in 5 segments: The U.S. Brands segment represents sales and expenses related to branded products within the United States, including Botox therapeutics. The U.S. Medical Aesthetics segment represents sales and expenses related to aesthetics and dermatology products within the United States, including Botox cosmetics. The International Brands segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that have the majority of their businesses represented by branded sales and revenues and expenses related to product sales in Canada, Switzerland and Austria. The Global Generics segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that have the majority of their business represented by generic product sales, our third-party Medis business and revenues and expenses related to product sales in the U.S., Canada, Switzerland and Austria. The Anda Distribution segment results represents sales and expenses related to distribution of generic and brand pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties. Also, as a result of Teva's acquisition of Allergan's generic business, Allergan will report its generics business as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2015. Since the divested business spans both Global Generics and International Brand segments, it will be difficult today to model the remaining Allergan business. We will provide some guidance in September.
Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on Slide 15. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.44 billion for the quarter, up 331% versus the prior year period and 35% in the prior quarter, driven by the addition of the Forest and Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products, including Linzess and Namenda XR. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands remained steady at 87.4%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.8% versus 17.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven by expenses related to the Forest and Allergan acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 16 and our U.S. Medical Aesthetics business. The second quarter revenues were $487 million, an increase of 510% versus first quarter 2015 results. Second quarter gross margin of 93% and segment margin of 70.6% were largely in line with expectations. SG&A in the quarter remained steady. 
Turning to Slide 17 and our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $717 million versus $169 million in the prior year period, an increase of 324%. Gross margins increased 21.7 percentage points to 77.8% in the second quarter, due largely to the inclusion of higher margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A improved 7.2 percentage points to 32% versus Q1 2015 due largely to synergy capture related to the Allergan acquisition.
On Slide 18, Global Generics revenues in the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10% versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by strong sales in the base business, including generic Concerta, offset in part by additional competition on certain products, including generic Lidoderm. Adjusted gross margins increased 1 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter due to continued strong performance within our international business. Lower gross margin versus the prior year quarter was mainly due to lower contribution of Guanfacine ER and oxycodone in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue decreased slightly to 15% from 15.8% in the year-ago quarter.
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 19. Revenues increased to $462 million, up from $427 million in the prior year, an increase of 8%, driven by trends in our base business and a higher mix of chain drugstore sales. 
Slide 20 details our debt capitalization following the completion of our first full quarter following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the second quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.9 billion and equity of $72.1 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. In the second quarter, we paid down approximately $1.4 billion of our debt. Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 3.9x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 4.1x in the prior quarter. We remain committed to using strong free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment, and we continue to remain committed to investment-grade ratings.
I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our Brands R&D progress in the quarter. David?"

Our Brands R&D team continues to be tremendously productive. Year-to-date and worldwide, our strong late-stage pipeline has delivered more than 100 pharmaceutical and medical device approval",1270,"Thanks, Tessa, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 22. Our Brands R&D team continues to be tremendously productive. Year-to-date and worldwide, our strong late-stage pipeline has delivered more than 100 pharmaceutical and medical device approvals and 56 regulatory submissions. I will highlight some of the most significant of these in my overview. 
Following the first round of integration prioritization, we now have more than 70 mid- to late-stage development projects, with approximately 45 projects in either late-stage development or registration. The productivity of the legacy Allergan R&D organizations is demonstrated by the industry-leading figure of 14 NME approvals in the United States over the last 6.5 years. Going forward, we'll continue to make data-driven prioritization decision on all of our programs.
In addition to rationalizing and driving productivity from our existing pipeline, we are committed to identifying and executing acquisitions and licensing agreements that further strengthen our long-term leadership position in key therapeutic areas. This is exemplified by our pending acquisitions of Kythera, Oculeve and Naurex and licensing of Merck's oral CGRP programs during the quarter. 
The next 2 slides summarize some highlights and describe the progress in our late-stage pipeline. Slide 23 shows late-stage game-changing opportunities across our therapeutic areas. 
In aesthetics, we are adding Kybella from Kythera to our pipeline. Our aesthetics pipeline already includes bimatoprost for hair growth, Aczone and sarecycline for acne as well as many line extensions to our fillers. In eye care, we are adding the intranasal dry eye device from Oculeve to our dry eye franchise, further enhancing our leading position in this therapeutic area. 
My colleagues and I have reviewed our restated data and again, find our efficacy and tolerability data very compelling in comparison to the recently published data from other compounds in development and registration. In Phase III, we are developing DARPin and have a sustained-release formulation of bimatoprost. In CNS, we are adding the Naurex NMDA modulator to our pipeline. These compounds have the first novel mechanism for mood disorders for more than 2 decades. We're also adding oral CGRP antagonists. These compounds, in license from Merck, are designed both for the acute treatment as well as for the prophylaxis of migraine. We also have cariprazine in development and Namzaric, which combines 2 complementary therapeutic agents, Namenda and Aricept. 
Recently, much attention has turned to prevention of Alzheimer's and like all of us, I hope that effective preventive therapy will be discovered. Data on Namzaric was recently presented at the 2015 Alzheimer's Association International Conference. The efficacy of Namzaric in patients with Alzheimer's is at least a similar magnitude to that reported with the present preventative agents in development. 
In GI disorders, together with our partner, Ironwood, we continue to develop dosage and formulations of our IBS-C agent, Linzess, to offer a very complete package to physician and patients. Also, we're completing the initial development of eluxadoline, Viberzi, for IBS-D. 
In urology, together with our partner Serenity, we have intranasal desmopressin completing Phase III for nocturia. In our anti-infective franchise, we continue to develop Dalvance and Avycaz. In biologics, Phase III will be completed this year for bevacizumab, a biosimilar of Avastin, which is part of our partnership with Amgen. Last, but certainly not least, is Botox. We continue to further develop and launch these agent across our aesthetics, CNS and urology franchises. 
Turning to Slide 24. I'm going to update you on progress with regulatory authorities to key late-stage products.
In aesthetics, Natrelle Inspira textured breast implants received FDA approval for women undergoing breast reconstruction, augmentation or revision surgery, and we are on track for FDA submission of our Volbella filler in the third quarter 2015. Yesterday, we received FDA approval to market 28 additional styles of Natrelle 410 breast implants. 
In Asia, we received licensing rights for commercial sales of Juvederm in China and submitted an NDA for Botox for crow's feet lines in Japan. In eye care, Botox received approval in Japan for the treatment of strabismus. We're on track for FDA submission of a multidose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis in September. We've currently enrolling patients in Phase III trials for bimatoprost in the U.S., and we've initiated pivotal Phase III trials of our lead DARPin in age-related macular degeneration, on target in June this year. 
In CNS, we have a PDUFA date in September for cariprazine as a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar mania. And this quarter, we launched Namzaric and we'll be filing additional dose combinations of this agent later this year.
In GI, our strong pipeline does continue to develop new opportunities. We expect to complete the Phase III study for a low-dosage form of Linzess to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in the second half of the year, and we expect to submit an sNDA for this indication next year. 
Meanwhile, Viberzi, eluxadoline, has been approved by the FDA as a twice-daily oral treatment for IBS-D. We're awaiting DEA scheduling of Viberzi prior to launch of this product in the United States. And we submitted the dossier of eluxadoline in Europe in May.
In women's health, enrollment in our Phase III trial of Esmya for the treatment of bleeding disorders caused by uterine fibroids is on track. We're committed to completing trial enrollment this year.
In urology, we completed our Phase III trials of SER 120 in nocturia. The data is under our review prior to submission to the agency. In anti-infectives, our development of a single-dose formulation of Dalvance remains on track. We've made regulatory submissions for approval in both the United States and Europe. We're also anticipating approval for Teflaro in bacteremia during the course of this year.
On Slide 25, we outline some of our most recent business development opportunities. Obviously, these help us to further solidify our leadership position in our core therapeutic areas. 
With Kythera, we add a first-in-class agent, Kybella, for the treatment of submental fat, or double chin, to our product line. The product is launched in the States and was recently approved in Canada. In addition, Kythera has an interesting and genetically validated hair growth product in early development. 
Oculeve will strengthen our leading position in dry eye with the OD-01 development program, an intranasal neurostimulatory device that increases tear production in patients with dry eye. 
Our licensing agreement with Merck builds on our commitment to the development of treatments for migraine. We're adding oral formulations of CGRP antagonists to our product line. The use of both small molecules as well as antibodies has clearly shown that CGRP antagonism is effective in treating migraine. There are 4 injectable antibodies in development, whilst we will have the only oral CGRP antagonist. 
Finally, Naurex. The acquisition of Naurex adds innovative development programs in depression to our pipeline. Depression is an area of medicine that has seen minimal progress for the last 20 years. The Naurex compounds are NMDA modulators, a unique approach to the treatment of depression. These agents have the potential to be fast-onset antidepressants and, hence, may be beneficial in the alleviation of suicidality, which is so often a terrible feature of this disorder. In early-stage development, the Naurex team showed their compound indeed to be fast in onset and also to be effective in treating depression, which fail to respond to traditional antidepressants.
In closing, the second quarter of 2015 was another period of continuous strong productivity for the Allergan R&D team. We look forward to continue to deliver on the promise of many of our development programs in our pipeline for the remainder of 2015 and beyond. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brent for closing remarks.

Is it possible for Allergan to pursue a large transaction before the Teva deal closes if the right transaction were available, I guess, both from an operational and financial standpoint? And just a very quick second one on that guidance in September, is that just 2015? Or can we think about a preliminary view on either '16 or an update on the $25 2017 outlook at that time as well?"

So with respect to potential for transformational M&A, I think that the way to think about it is the most likely scenario would be after the close of Teva, if in fact, we were to do transformational M&A. Certainly, anything is possible prior to that and we have always been bold in thinking about how to execute things if the timing was right. But I think in fairness, given the commitment to our investment-grade rating and our ability to deploy cash after the deal has closed versus prior -- or perhaps, our flexibility to deploy cash after the deal closes is better than prior. I think that's probably how you should think about it. Now that doesn't mean we couldn't engage in analysis or discussions or other things like that with someone who is interested in doing a deal with us or we were interested in doing a deal with them. But I would say that it's most likely after the close of the Teva transaction. 
With respect to the guidance, maybe I'll ask Tessa to talk about that for a second."

And also just to manage expectations, so we provide that given the account rules, it will be very difficult at this point in time for you to model what the remaining 2015 will look like. As an example, for instance, debt will continue to remain with the Allergan-branded business and not go to discontinued operations. There's no such thing as non-GAAP discontinued operations. So we'll provide a little bit more clarity come September, but it's really largely focused on the remainder of 2015."

So when you give discontinued -- or rather, when you give pro forma earnings going forward, which presumably only includes the branded business, will that branded business also include all the interest expense that you're carrying on your books? In other words, I would assume that some of that $40.5 billion is going to reduce debt. So how do we think about that when we think about the base business going forward? And then secondly, just to follow up on that $25 number, that $25 obviously includes about $5 or $2.4 billion in EBIT from the generic business. Brent, at what point can we expect you to update us on that guidance? And I think on the last call, you didn't withdraw that $25. So any, again, any color on how we should think about the company's ability to replace that $2.4 billion in EBIT?"

So on a go-forward basis, in the September earnings, what you will see is that, debt will reside in the remaining company and not allocated to discontinued ops. Obviously, as you think about that on a go-forward basis, it would really largely depend on what we do with the capital on a go-forward basis. What we had indicated in our call related to Teva that we would use a portion of the proceeds to pay down debt. But again, it's largely dependent on how much we used for capital deployment. Having said that, though, we are committed to our investment-grade rating so we will ensure that the appropriate amount of debt is paid down."

But it will make for some tough modeling work on your guys' part over the next 2 or 3 quarters. And we apologize in advance for that and we'll do everything we can to help facilitate that. 
With respect to the $25 aspiration, what I said -- I think you asked this question on the deal call, if I recall correctly, Jami, was that we absolutely remain steadfast in our aspiration to increase our earnings per share to as high as possible, including the $25 target. What has changed, obviously, is by selling the generics business and the $2.4 billion of EBITDA to Teva, the timing of that aspiration. And so we need to continue to look at how we will deploy that capital and how the timing of the deployment of that capital will pull through to give a more precise view of it. So again, we're not withdrawing the $25 but we will come back and have to add some variables to it, like capital deployment and timing of capital deployment to get there."

Having worked in this space before, one of the biggest issues with chronic eyedrops, particularly Restasis because of its single-dose applicator, is dosage and compliance because it's very hard to get that little single dose in the eye. And so for patient convenience, and patient compliance and dosing, the multidose applicator is a huge something and something that we're very excited about bringing to market next year. And then keep in mind, we also have 4 other development programs of both Restasis and novel mechanisms earlier in our pipeline. On Bystolic in cardio, I mean, I think the way I think about it -- and Bill, certainly chime in, is Bystolic, while certainly a cardio drug, is managed a bit more like a primary care drug and about 80% of its volume comes from our primary care field force.

We think the trends in the second quarter look terrific, and I think the outlook for the rest of the year is the same. I don't see anything that would disrupt the reliability of that sales frame. As it relates to Restasis, we're focused on a large OTC artificial tear market. There are millions of patients overusing artificial tears. We have an effort where -- to increase the diagnosis rate through in-office screenings for dry eye, which have been linked to blurred vision, adverse post-op outcomes, and so there's an educational effort there. And then finally, we launched a primary care effort for Restasis, and the formulary coverage on the drug is rock solid. And then I'd just probably add Linzess in there. We have our foot on the gas. The response to our second wave of direct-to-consumer advertising is exceeding industry norms. We just launched a effort into long-term care for the first time since Linzess was approved and that's about 25% of the market. Our relationship with Ironwood is excellent, and we're waiting to launch a low-dose version of Linzess. And so I feel very good about our top products, and as Brent mentioned in his opening remarks, 12 of our 15 products are increasing. If you look at the U.S. business, 12 of the 15 products are increasing at a double-digit rate.

Look, I think that in fairness, it would be very difficult for us to do a transformational deal with a company with a higher growth rate because I think based on at least today's measure, the only one with a higher growth rate is Celgene. So that would really limit the universe. That being said, I think that the issue for us is, look, we want to be in Growth Pharma. Would we be willing to go from, let's say, roughly 10% to a 9% top line growth rate to do a highly accretive bottom line deal? The answer is absolutely. Would we be willing to go from 10% to 3% or 4% top line growth to do a highly accretive deal? I would say highly unlikely. And so we want to go out and make sure that we can acquire something that we believe has a growth orientation to it, that has longer-duration assets. And I think you should also keep in mind, we're pretty, as I use the word, bold in our thinking. So I think a lot of people look at the universe of transformational deals and say, ""Well, you can't touch this because it's got this particular product drag"" or this particular issue. We've been known to be very creative in solving for those things in the past and albeit a very deal, I would point to Furiex as just an illustration, where they had 2 assets. They had the NDA for eluxadoline and they had a royalty stream from Takeda. We divested the royalties stream of Takeda to Royalty Pharma at the time we announced the deal. We had that prewired. And so we kept what we wanted and we sold something that was valuable to somebody else to help pay for the deal. And so to the extent we look at companies or opportunities that have things we like, and some things, perhaps, we don't like, there are always potential solutions for solving for those issues."

You can debate the numbers but very few patients, in fact, the minority of patients are adequately served by SSRI or SNRI. And then, they have to live with, in some cases, very difficult side effects from those medicines as well. It's a long onset of action for those with acute issues that need to be dealt with more quickly. And I think, David, you mentioned this in your earlier remarks. There's been no real novel breakthrough in depression in about 20 years. And so for us to be able to be at the forefront of potentially revolutionizing this very large and horrific disease is something that I think that's very exciting for us, given our commitment to leading in CNS and in particular, psychiatry.

So when an opportunity like Naurex comes along with a novel mechanism of action over the last 2 decades, yes...
So when an new opportunity comes along with a new mechanism of action I think the team here can recognize it and seize it pretty quickly. These things are exciting: completely novel mechanism of action, showing a fast onset of action in depression, in -- and not only in depression but in depression where the patients failed to respond to SSRIs. So that's an exciting opportunity. And the next steps for us are to get into Phase III as quickly as possible with GLYX-13, the lead molecule, and to get into Phase IIb with the second compound in NRX-1074. And we aim to do that as early as possible next year."

It's great to be with you to review our results for the second quarter of 2015, which builds on the terrific results we had last quarter. This was also our first full quarter of a combined operations following the close of the Allergan acquisition on March 17. And I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished, especially the momentum they have created to propel our future growth.
Turning to Slide 5. Allergan's second quarter performance highlights our ability to execute on our 4 pillars of our long-term growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and results in all key business segments, key products and key geographies. Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine has produced more than 100 branded product approvals globally and 56 branded regulatory submissions year-to-date. And fourth, we're executing on strategic business deals to support our growth in key therapy areas and charge up our pipeline for the future.
We also changed our name to Allergan in the quarter to symbolize our transformation into a leader in Growth Pharma, where brands now contribute more than 2/3 of our company's revenues. With our focus in Growth Pharma, we are encouraging our employees around the world to be bold and smart in the way we think and act. 
Turning to Slide 6. The announcement of our plans to combine our Global Generics business with Teva in a $40.5 billion deal is the latest bold move by our company to continue our transformation towards being a leader in branded Growth Pharma. For years, we've been moving up the innovation curve towards specialty pharma products. This agreement clearly accelerates our transformation. This deal allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our focus on 7 core therapy areas and reload our capital structure to continue our transformation. There's certainly more to come on this story.
We are confident that we are creating the most dynamic company in Growth Pharma, while adding our impressive global generic commercial, generic R&D and operating capabilities to Teva. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and talk about the business performance in the second quarter. Our second quarter revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $5.7 billion as a result of the acquisitions of Allergan and Forest. On a pro forma basis, sales were up 12%, excluding the impact of foreign currency, Namenda IR and divestitures, with double-digit growth in our brand and Global Generics segments. The strong sales increase introduced from the integration of Allergan and Forest were the primary drivers of the 29% increase in earnings per share to $4.41. Meanwhile, non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2.6 billion and cash flow from operations was about $1.7 billion, excluding onetime cash payments for severance, acquisitions and integration. Tessa will talk more about the financials shortly.
On Slide 8. Our Global Generics business is doing very well and the units that comprise it are firing on all cylinders as we prepare for the combination with Teva. Generics sales are up 17%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Generic profitability is up and our exceptional generic R&D capabilities are evident, with 12 new first-to-file drugs this year. This brings the total number of ANDAs under review to approximately 220 with 76 confirmed first-to-files.
U.S. Generic revenues were $1.1 billion in the quarter and continued to benefit from new product introductions and contribution from high-barrier and semi-exclusive products, like generic Concerta. Meanwhile, our International Generics team continues to drive excellent performance in key markets, excluding the impact of foreign currency such as the U.K., which was up 85%, including the effect of the Auden Mckenzie transaction that closed in May; and Russia, which was up 32%.
Turning to Slide 9. Our brands business continues to thrive impressive performance with 12 of the top 15 global brands growing, many with double-digit pro forma year-over-year growth. Sales increased 11%, excluding Namenda IR, the divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange. And the success is broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit growth in eye care, GI and key woman health products and cardiovascular; double-digit growth from our latest largest leading brands like Botox, Restasis, Namenda XR and our fillers, including Juvederm; double-digit growth from well-established brands like Bystolic, LoLoestrin and Estrace; and double-digit growth from Linzess, Ozurdex and other launch brands, which puts us in excellent position to power growth well into the future. It is a terrific lineup of brands with long exclusivity and is backed by a great team on the ground and our leading pipeline, with multiple shots on each of our 7 priority therapeutic areas.
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to drive conversion of patients to Namenda XR right up to the end of the Namenda IR exclusivity, reaching about 53% before generic entry. With continued promotion and the launch of Namzaric, we believe the penetration rate goes even higher, towards our target of 60% to 65% as the year progresses. And with once a day dosing, formulary access at every 1 of the top 8 plans and a focused sales team, we maintain relatively stable volumes on Namenda XR even as the Namenda IR prescriptions drop. We are now doing the blocking and tackling to build the demand and access for Namzaric. With full promotion just getting underway, our DTC campaign beginning in September and an anticipated 7 out of the top 10 plans having coverage by the beginning of 2016, we think we are well prepared to drive market expansion in 2016. Given the broad use of combination donepezil and memantine therapy, the efficacy of Namzaric and the patient, caregiver and system benefits of one pill, once a day, we think there's a great opportunity for the innovation of Namzaric to become the cornerstone of once-a-day branded market in Alzheimer's treatment.
Turning to Slide 11. In a few moments, David Nicholson will give an update on the pipeline, but I want to point out that our pipeline remains one of the best-kept secrets of our company. With 70 projects in mid to late development, we are in an enviable position of having multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help us sustain leadership in the areas we choose to compete. And we have built this pipeline step-by-step, not by investing big dollars on discovery, but by investing in smart development projects.
Even with the excellent breadth and depth of our current pipeline, we are always on the lookout for R&D assets that can extend our leadership by bringing novel approaches to existing therapy areas. And in the last 2 months alone, we've announced agreements for 4 planned acquisitions in aesthetic eye care and CNS. Each will bring novelty to existing areas and will add to our ability to lead in these therapeutic areas. And each of these deals brings game-changer potential ideas to our pipeline.
Kybella is off to a strong start in aesthetics, with sales already surpassing $1 million and a recent approval in Canada. We are making great progress towards closing the transaction now that we have cleared antitrust review in the U.S. And as we announced yesterday, we no longer intend to issue our shares to complete this acquisition. The Oculeve acquisition has also cleared HSR in the U.S. and we'll look forward to extending our dry eye opportunities with our novel nasal neurostimulation device. In CNS, we're working to close deals to extend our migraine offering with Merck's first in oral -- first-in-class oral CGRP antagonist and the Naurex novel approach to treating mood disorders, including severe depression, which remains a leading cause of suicide.
In closing, our team continues to focus on execution and the results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at delivering strong operating results, while also doing surprising things that make our company the most dynamic in all of health care. I'm so proud of our team for their performance and I'm looking forward to what we can do with a strength and focus on branded pharmaceuticals and a significantly reduced operating structure and reloaded capital structure. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tessa."

In Q2, we delivered strong performance, both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.7 billion, an increase of 36% versus Q1 2015. 
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $406 million compared to $185 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 21.7%, an increase of 3 percentage points over the prior year quarter, as a result of the Forest branded products and Allergan business, which we have higher SG&A spend.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 203% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across our segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 29% to $4.41 compared to $3.42 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014.
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 17.1% in the year-ago period to 14.5% in the current-year quarter, mainly due to the geographic mix of our businesses. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 198% versus the year-ago quarter. Excluding acquisition-related restructuring and integration payments, our second quarter free cash flow would be $1.7 billion.
Before turning to our business segment results, I would like to take a moment to review our new segment reporting for the second quarter. In this quarter, we are reporting results in 5 segments: The U.S. Brands segment represents sales and expenses related to branded products within the United States, including Botox therapeutics. The U.S. Medical Aesthetics segment represents sales and expenses related to aesthetics and dermatology products within the United States, including Botox cosmetics. The International Brands segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that have the majority of their businesses represented by branded sales and revenues and expenses related to product sales in Canada, Switzerland and Austria. The Global Generics segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that have the majority of their business represented by generic product sales, our third-party Medis business and revenues and expenses related to product sales in the U.S., Canada, Switzerland and Austria. The Anda Distribution segment results represents sales and expenses related to distribution of generic and brand pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties. Also, as a result of Teva's acquisition of Allergan's generic business, Allergan will report its generics business as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2015. Since the divested business spans both Global Generics and International Brand segments, it will be difficult today to model the remaining Allergan business. We will provide some guidance in September.
Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on Slide 15. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.44 billion for the quarter, up 331% versus the prior year period and 35% in the prior quarter, driven by the addition of the Forest and Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products, including Linzess and Namenda XR. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands remained steady at 87.4%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.8% versus 17.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven by expenses related to the Forest and Allergan acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 16 and our U.S. Medical Aesthetics business. The second quarter revenues were $487 million, an increase of 510% versus first quarter 2015 results. Second quarter gross margin of 93% and segment margin of 70.6% were largely in line with expectations. SG&A in the quarter remained steady. 
Turning to Slide 17 and our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $717 million versus $169 million in the prior year period, an increase of 324%. Gross margins increased 21.7 percentage points to 77.8% in the second quarter, due largely to the inclusion of higher margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A improved 7.2 percentage points to 32% versus Q1 2015 due largely to synergy capture related to the Allergan acquisition.
On Slide 18, Global Generics revenues in the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10% versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by strong sales in the base business, including generic Concerta, offset in part by additional competition on certain products, including generic Lidoderm. Adjusted gross margins increased 1 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter due to continued strong performance within our international business. Lower gross margin versus the prior year quarter was mainly due to lower contribution of Guanfacine ER and oxycodone in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue decreased slightly to 15% from 15.8% in the year-ago quarter.
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 19. Revenues increased to $462 million, up from $427 million in the prior year, an increase of 8%, driven by trends in our base business and a higher mix of chain drugstore sales. 
Slide 20 details our debt capitalization following the completion of our first full quarter, following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the second quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.9 billion and equity of $72.1 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. In the second quarter, we paid down approximately $1.4 billion of our debt. Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 3.9x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 4.1x in the prior quarter. We remain committed to using strong free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment, and we continue to remain committed to investment-grade ratings.
I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our Brands R&D progress in the quarter. David?"

Our Brands R&D team continues to be tremendously productive. Year-to-date and worldwide, our strong late-stage pipeline has delivered more than 100 pharmaceutical and medical device approval",1268,"Thanks, Tessa, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 22. Our Brands R&D team continues to be tremendously productive. Year-to-date and worldwide, our strong late-stage pipeline has delivered more than 100 pharmaceutical and medical device approvals and 56 regulatory submissions. I will highlight some of the most significant of these in my overview. 
Following the first round of integration prioritization, we now have more than 70 mid- to late-stage development projects, with approximately 45 projects in either late-stage development or registration. The productivity of the legacy Allergan R&D organizations is demonstrated by the industry-leading figure of 14 NME approvals in the United States over the last 6.5 years. Going forward, we'll continue to make data-driven prioritization decisions on all of our programs.
In addition to rationalizing and driving productivity from our existing pipeline, we are committed to identifying and executing acquisitions and licensing agreements that further strengthen our long-term leadership position in key therapeutic areas. This is exemplified by our pending acquisitions of Kythera, Oculeve and Naurex and licensing of Merck's oral CGRP programs during the quarter. 
The next 2 slides summarize some highlights and describe the progress in our late-stage pipeline. Slide 23 shows late-stage game-changing opportunities across our therapeutic areas. 
In aesthetics, we are adding Kybella from Kythera to our pipeline. Our aesthetics pipeline already includes bimatoprost for hair growth, Aczone and sarecycline for acne as well as many line extensions to our fillers. In eye care, we are adding the intranasal dry eye device from Oculeve to our dry eye franchise, further enhancing our leading position in this therapeutic area. 
My colleagues and I have reviewed our restated data and again, find our efficacy and tolerability data very compelling in comparison to recently published data from other compounds in development and registration. In Phase III, we are developing DARPin and have a sustained-release formulation of bimatoprost. In CNS, we are adding the Naurex NMDA modulators to our pipeline. These compounds have the first novel mechanism for mood disorders for more than 2 decades. We're also adding oral CGRP antagonists. These compounds, in license from Merck, are designed both for the acute treatment as well as for the prophylaxis of migraine. We also have cariprazine in development and Namzaric, which combines 2 complementary therapeutic agents, Namenda and Aricept. 
Recently, much attention has turned to prevention of Alzheimer's and like all of us, I hope that effective preventive therapy will be discovered. Data on Namzaric was recently presented at the 2015 Alzheimer's Association International Conference. The efficacy of Namzaric in patients with Alzheimer's is at least a similar magnitude to that reported with the present preventative agents in development. 
In GI disorders, together with our partner, Ironwood, we continue to develop dosage and formulations of our IBS-C agent, Linzess, to offer a very complete package to physician and patients. Also, we're completing the initial development of eluxadoline, Viberzi, for IBS-D. 
In urology, together with our partner Serenity, we have intranasal desmopressin completing Phase III for nocturia. In our anti-infective franchise, we continue to develop Dalvance and Avycaz. In biologics, Phase III will be completed this year for bevacizumab, a biosimilar of Avastin, which is part of our partnership with Amgen. Last, but certainly not least, is Botox. We continue to further develop and launch these agent across our aesthetics, CNS and urology franchises. 
Turning to Slide 24. I'm going to update you on progress with regulatory authorities to key late-stage products.
In aesthetics, Natrelle Inspira textured breast implants received FDA approval for women undergoing breast reconstruction, augmentation or revision surgery, and we are on track for FDA submission of our Volbella filler in third quarter 2015. Yesterday, we received FDA approval to market 28 additional styles of Natrelle 410 breast implants. 
In Asia, we received licensing rights for commercial sales of Juvederm in China and submitted an NDA for Botox for crow's feet lines in Japan. In eye care, Botox received approval in Japan for the treatment of strabismus. We're on track for FDA submission of a multidose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis in September. We've currently enrolling patients in Phase III trials for bimatoprost in the U.S., and we've initiated pivotal Phase III trials of our lead DARPin in age-related macular degeneration, on target in June this year. 
In CNS, we have a PDUFA date in September for cariprazine as a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar mania. And this quarter, we launched Namzaric and we'll be filing additional dose combinations of this agent later this year.
In GI, our strong pipeline does continue to develop new opportunities. We expect to complete the Phase III study for a low-dosage form of Linzess to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in the second half of the year, and we expect to submit an sNDA for this indication next year. 
Meanwhile, Viberzi, eluxadoline, has been approved by the FDA as a twice-daily oral treatment for IBS-D. We're awaiting DEA scheduling of Viberzi prior to launch of this product in the United States. And we submitted the dossier of eluxadoline in Europe in May.
In women's health, enrollment in our Phase III trial of Esmya for the treatment of bleeding disorders caused by uterine fibroids is on track. We're committed to completing trial enrollment this year.
In urology, we completed our Phase III trials of SER 120 in nocturia. The data is under our review prior to submission to the agency. In anti-infectives, our development of a single-dose formulation of Dalvance remains on track. We've made regulatory submissions for approval in both the United States and Europe. We're also anticipating approval for Teflaro in bacteremia during the course of this year.
On Slide 25, we outline some of our most recent business development opportunities. Obviously, these help us to further solidify our leadership position in our core therapeutic areas. 
With Kythera, we add a first-in-class agent, Kybella, for the treatment of submental fat, or double chin, to our product line. The product is launched in the States and was recently approved in Canada. In addition, Kythera has an interesting and genetically validated hair growth product in early development. 
Oculeve will strengthen our leading position in dry eye with the OD-01 development program, an intranasal neurostimulatory device that increases tear production in patients with dry eye. 
Our licensing agreement with Merck builds on our commitment to the development of treatments for migraine. We're adding oral formulations of CGRP antagonists to our product line. The use of both small molecules as well as antibodies has clearly shown that CGRP antagonism is effective in treating migraine. There are 4 injectable antibodies in development, whilst we will have the only oral CGRP antagonist. 
Finally, Naurex. The acquisition of Naurex adds innovative development programs in depression to our pipeline. Depression is an area of medicine that has seen minimal progress for the last 20 years. The Naurex compounds are NMDA modulators, a unique approach to the treatment of depression. These agents have the potential to be fast-onset antidepressants and, hence, may be beneficial in the alleviation of suicidality, which is so often a terrible feature of this disorder. In early-stage development, the Naurex team showed their compound indeed to be fast in onset and also to be effective in treating depression, which fail to respond to traditional antidepressants.
In closing, the second quarter of 2015 was another period of continuous strong productivity for the Allergan R&D team. We look forward to continue to deliver on the promise of many of our development programs in our pipeline for the remainder of 2015 and beyond. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brent for closing remarks.

Is it possible for Allergan to pursue a large transaction before the Teva deal closes if the right transaction were available, I guess, both from an operational and financial standpoint? And just a very quick second one on that guidance in September, is that just 2015? Or can we think about a preliminary view on either '16 or an update on the $25 2017 outlook at that time as well?"

So with respect to potential for transformational M&A, I think that the way to think about it is the most likely scenario would be after the close of Teva, if in fact, we were to do transformational M&A. Certainly, anything is possible prior to that and we have always been bold in thinking about how to execute things if the timing was right. But I think in fairness, given the commitment to our investment-grade rating and our ability to deploy cash after the deal has closed versus prior -- or perhaps, our flexibility to deploy cash after the deal closes is better than prior. I think that's probably how you should think about it. Now that doesn't mean we couldn't engage in analysis or discussions or other things like that with someone who is interested in doing a deal with us, or we were interested in doing a deal with them. But I would say that it's most likely after the close of the Teva transaction. 
With respect to the guidance, maybe I'll ask Tessa to talk about that for a second."

That's not exactly a very easy separation to do. And also just to manage expectations, so we provide that given the account rules, it will be very difficult at this point in time for you to model what the remaining 2015 will look like. As an example, for instance, debt will continue to remain with the Allergan-branded business and not go to discontinued operations. There's no such thing as non-GAAP discontinued operations. So we'll provide a little bit more clarity come September, but it's really largely focused on the remainder of 2015."

So when you give discontinued -- or rather, when you give pro forma earnings going forward, which presumably only includes the branded business, will that branded business also include all the interest expense that you're carrying on your books? In other words, I would assume that some of that $40.5 billion is going to reduce debt. So how do we think about that when we think about the base business going forward? And then secondly, just to follow up on that $25 number, that $25 obviously includes about $5 or $2.4 billion in EBIT from the generic business. Brent, at what point can we expect you to update us on that guidance? And I think on the last call, you didn't withdraw that $25. So any, again, any color on how we should think about the company's ability to replace that $2.4 billion in EBIT?"

So on a go-forward basis, in the September earnings, what you will see is that, debt will reside in the remaining company and not allocated to discontinued ops. Obviously, as you think about that on a go-forward basis, it would really largely depend on what we do with the capital on a go-forward basis. What we had indicated in our call related to Teva that we would use a portion of the proceeds to pay down debt. But again, it's largely dependent on how much we used for capital deployment. Having said that, though, we are committed to our investment-grade rating. So we will ensure that the appropriate amount of debt is paid down."

But it will make for some tough modeling work on your guys' part over the next 2 or 3 quarters. And we apologize in advance for that and we'll do everything we can to help facilitate that. 
With respect to the $25 aspiration, what I said -- I think you asked this question on the deal call, if I recall correctly, Jami, was that we absolutely remain steadfast in our aspiration to increase our earnings per share to as high as possible, including the $25 target. What has changed, obviously, is by selling the generics business and the $2.4 billion of EBITDA to Teva, the timing of that aspiration. And so we need to continue to look at how we will deploy that capital and how the timing of the deployment of that capital will pull through to give a more precise view of it. So again, we're not withdrawing the $25 but we will come back and have to add some variables to it, like capital deployment and timing of capital deployment to get there."

We do have a partnership with Trevena for an earlier-stage products, so we're not completely walking away from cardio. But it's not one of our core focus therapeutic areas.

We think the trends in the second quarter look terrific, and I think the outlook for the rest of the year is the same. I don't see anything that would disrupt the reliability of that sales frame. As it relates to Restasis, we're focused on a large OTC artificial tear market. There are millions of patients overusing artificial tears. We have an effort where -- to increase the diagnosis rate through in-office screenings for dry eye, which have been linked to blurred vision, adverse post-op outcomes, and so there's an educational effort there. And then finally, we launched a primary care effort for Restasis, and the formulary coverage on the drug is rock solid. And then I'd just probably add Linzess in there. We have our foot on the gas. The response to our second wave of direct-to-consumer advertising is exceeding industry norms. We just launched a effort into long-term care for the first time since Linzess was approved and that's about 25% of the market. Our relationship with Ironwood is excellent, and we're waiting to launch a low-dose version of Linzess. And so I feel very good about our top products, and as Brent mentioned in his opening remarks, 12 of our 15 products are increasing. If you look at the U.S. business, 12 of the 15 products are increasing at a double-digit rate. And we've had virtually, in my opinion, no disruption due to the integration.

Look, I think that in fairness, it would be very difficult for us to do a transformational deal with a company with a higher growth rate, because I think based on at least today's measure, the only one with a higher growth rate is Celgene. So that would really limit the universe. That being said, I think that the issue for us is, look, we want to be in Growth Pharma. Would we be willing to go from, let's say, roughly 10% to a 9% top line growth rate to do a highly accretive bottom line deal? The answer is absolutely. Would we be willing to go from 10% to 3% or 4% top line growth to do a highly accretive deal? I would say highly unlikely. And so we want to go out and make sure that we can acquire something that we believe has a growth orientation to it, that has longer-duration assets. And I think you should also keep in mind, we're pretty, as I use the word, bold in our thinking. So I think a lot of people look at the universe of transformational deals and say, ""Well, you can't touch this because it's got this particular product drag"" or this particular issue. We've been known to be very creative in solving for those things in the past and albeit a very deal, I would point to Furiex as just an illustration. Where they had 2 assets. They had the NDA for eluxadoline and they had a royalty stream from Takeda. We divested the royalties stream of Takeda to Royalty Pharma at the time we announced the deal. We had that prewired. And so we kept what we wanted and we sold something that was valuable to somebody else to help pay for the deal. And so to the extent we look at companies or opportunities that have things we like, and some things, perhaps, we don't like, there are always potential solutions for solving for those issues."

These things are exciting: completely novel mechanism of action, showing a fast onset of action in depression, in -- and not only in depression but in depression where the patients failed to respond to SSRIs. So that's an exciting opportunity. And the next steps for us are to get into Phase III as quickly as possible with GLYX-13, the lead molecule, and to get into Phase IIb with the second compound NRX-1074. And we aim to do that as early as possible next year."

It's great to be here with you to review our results for the third quarter of 2015.

It's great to be here with you to review our results for the third quarter of 2015. We're obviously bee very busy on many fronts and our teams continue to be build on the momentum we have had all year. This momentum will propel our future growth.
Turning to Slide 5. Allergan's third quarter performance illustrates the we continued to execute on the 4 pillars of our growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and strong results to continuing operations, key products and key geographies.
Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce. Our team is looking forward to showcasing our R&D pipeline, the success we've had this year and the depth of our pipeline across all 7 therapeutic areas later today at R&D Day.
And we are executing on strategic business deals, including our Teva transaction earlier in the quarter to allow us to focus on growing our business. With the announcements of our plans to combine our Global Generics business with Teva and a deal worth approximately $40.5 billion, we are now reporting our generics business as discontinued operations. Although the business results are consolidated into a single line in the income statement, our Global Generics team continues to perform well.
I am impressed with the continued momentum in the business and proud of the performance of the steam. For example, the generics R&D team has submitted 25 new command in the U.S. this year with 16 of them potential First-to-Files. This team is a gem of the generics industry, and they are on track to submit approximately 35 outpatients by year-end.
Outside of the U.S, we filed over 1,000 marketing authorizations in critical markets. This year, we have received approval and launched over 25 products in the U.S. of these new launches are adding to our results. Internationally, the teams in the U.K, Russia and other eastern European markets continue to deliver strong performance.
The pre-integration work with Teva is going well, and we remain committed to closing this transaction during the first quarter of 2016. This plan to divest the global generics business allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our focus on 7 core therapeutic areas and reward our capital structure to continue our transformation. We are confident that we are creating the most dynamic company and growth environment.
Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter net revenue grew 90% on a year-over-year basis to $4.1 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition. On a pro forma basis, sales grew 10% despite the loss of exclusivity on one of our largest products, Namenda IR, which experienced generic competition in the quarter. Strong sales in key products across our business drove 65% increase and non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.48.
Meanwhile, non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2 billion and cash flow from operations, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments was $1.7 billion in the quarter. Our business continues to drive strong performance. More than half of our products have delivered double-digit volume driven growth. On a pro forma basis, year-over-year brand revenue increased nearly 13% excluding Namenda IR divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange.
On Slide 8. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit growth from leading brands across key franchises, such as Botox, Restasis, Linzess, [indiscernible] and SAPHRIS. We continue to solidify our leadership in key categories with new launches and approvals. Our recent launches include -- including advertise, relevance, Namzaric, and Kybella are all performing well supported by strong promotional activities. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approval and upcoming launches, including Davis in a few weeks and Rigler in the first quarter of 2016.
In addition to products made in our R&D pipeline, we are also strengthening therapeutic area leadership through new acquisitions of important programs. In eye care, we continue to add shop and goal and development opportunities for dry eye disease and eye care with the acquisition of AqueSys, Lumenigene and Oculeve. Lumenigene, which we just announced this morning, brings a novel topical formulation dry eye treatment that could potentially be used alone and in combination with other dry eye therapies. This asset Phase 3 program further strengthening our dry eye pipeline, giving us the potential to launch 6 new products over the next 5 years.
In Aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera for its leading product, Kybella, adding a nonsurgical treatment for Simental Comus or double chin. We also announced this morning the acquisition of Northwood Medical Innovation, developer of innovated implant technology earfold. Earfold is a medical device for the correction of prominent years.
In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which has potential breakthrough treatments in depression and will be discussed in detail later this morning at R&D day. And in GI, we recently completed the acquisition of commercial rights to Castella in more than 40 international markets. This acts as an important part of our commercial team internationally and helps position us for the potential to add new G.I. therapies, like eluxadoline, to our product offering for international customers.
Before I turn a call over to Tessa to review our financial performance in the third quarter, I wanted to touch in our R&D day and recent commentary on product pricing. Later this morning, David Nelson, Bill Meury, and Smith will give an update on the pipeline and the commercial it potentially contains. We believe that people we begin to take more active notice of our pipeline after today's meeting. 
With more than 70 projects in mid- to late-stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help us sustain leadership in the areas where we choose to compete. We are building a sustainable innovation engine that power our top line performance and therapeutic area leadership well into the future. Please join us for an exciting day beginning in about an hour.
Turning to pricing. Pricing has been in the headline and featured in the presidential debates. But let's not pretend that this is a topic that has just appeared in the news. It's been a focus for many years. We know that cost is a constant concern, so as patient access to medical innovation. Allergan seeks to strike the right balance between care and cost. We operate in an open science model, developing promising products that frequently originate with smaller companies. These companies often lack the infrastructure to bring their products through expensive late stage trials or the commercial persons to recoup their R&D investments. The innovation ecosystem is full of these smaller companies who have extraordinary ideas and brilliant scientists. We want to be the magnet for their great ideas in this new innovation ecosystem.
Our models designed bring these extraordinary ideas to market. Our R&D staff is my than 2,000 people strong. They mobilize resources to help regulatory authorities around the world assess safety and efficacy of our products or providing data to payers to reflect their value.
Let's face, this effort is costly and often reflecting the cost and medicine, and it is easy to miss the significant value they represent. They reduce the need for hospitalization, surgery, followed business and more dial medical consequences. Allergan has a heritage in knowing health system economics very well, and we want to make sure patients have access to important medicines. Like many of our peers, we have patient assistance programs to ensure that patients have access to our medicines regardless of their ability to pay.
We are boiling and firing and investing in promising treatments for serious diseases, Alzheimer's, severe depression, glaucoma, debilitating gastrointestinal conditions. Our business model does not involve purchasing old products already in the marketplace and taking excessive price increases. We prefer to acquire mid- to late-stage drugs and invest extensively in their development. 
To make these decisions, to help people with unmet medical needs requires us to build bridges with physicians, academic medical centers, governments, regulators and inventors of these molecules so that they see us a partner who shares in their dedication to improve people's well-being. 
If you look at our recent development acquisitions, it's all about investing in ideas that can help change the way medicine is practiced. What makes the biopharmaceutical industry great? Inventions that change lives. We will continue to use our resources to advance treatment for unmet medical need and to tap into the world's best ideas to advance care for patients. We will do this while we will continue to strike the appropriate balance between care and cost. 
In closing, our team continues to focus on execution, and our results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at delivering strong operating results while also doing surprising things to make our company the most dynamic and bold in health care. I'm so proud of this team for their performance, and I'm looking forward to what we can do with a strength and focus on just branded pharmaceuticals. 
With that, now I'd turn the call over to Tessa."

In the third quarter, we delivered very strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 90% versus third quarter 2014.
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $305 million compared to $192 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A, as a percentage of revenue was 22.4%, a decrease of 3.1 percentage points over the prior year quarter as a result of the synergies realized from recent acquisition. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2 billion, an increase of 168% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 65% to $3.48 compared to $2.11 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the quarter. This rate was below expectation, driven primarily by the allocation of the entire interest expense to continuing operations earnings. This rate could change by potentially payment of debt upon the close of the Teva transaction. 
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $1 billion, impacted by recent asset acquisition, excluding acquisition-related with structuring and integration payments or third quarter cash flow from operations would be $1.7 billion.
Slide 13. Turning now to our U.S. brand results on Slide 13. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year. U.S. brand's revenue was $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 60% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products including Restasis, Linzess, Women's Health products and new product launches, including letter, Namzaric and Africa. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. brands continued to be strong with margins approaching 88%. SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 18.3% versus 22.1% in the year-ago quarter, driven by a continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 14 and our U.S. Medical Aesthetics business. Third quarter revenues were $457 million, an increase of 9% versus third quarter 2014 results on a pro forma basis. Sequentially, U.S. Medical Aesthetics performance was affected by seasonality related to aesthetics procedures. Third quarter gross margins were strong at 93.9%. SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 1.2 percentage points versus third quarter 2014.
Turning to Slide 15 and our International Brands results. Third quarter revenues were $661 million versus $58 million in the prior year, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Year-over-year growth was also driven by fillers and Ozurdex in international markets. Sequential revenue performance was mostly due to seasonality. Gross margins increased 25.7 percentage points to 83% in the third quarter, due largely to the inclusion of higher margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A increased 3.2 percentage points to 29.8% versus third quarter 2014 due largely to the Allergan acquisition.
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 16. Revenues increased $500 million to $576 million, up from $500 million in the prior year, an increase of 15%, driven by trends in our base business and new retail chain businesses. Results include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic product manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.
Slide 17 details our debt capitalization. We ended the third quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion and equity of $77.5 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. In the third quarter, we paid down approximately $231 million of our debt. In October, we borrowed $800 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the Kythera acquisition.
Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 3.98x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 3.9x in the prior quarter due to continued investments in R&D assets. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings.
And now I will turn the call to Lisa for Q&A."

The first is just more convenient than 60 single unit vials or droppers. And it's also easier to administer. And a big problem with all of these eyedrops is they're difficult to instill and it's often a major problem with compliance.

Hence, the low tax rate. On-the-go forward basis, that should trend upward assuming we pay down debt, but we can't really be precise at this point, given our restriction based on Irish law. But it should trend higher based on that -- if we assume debt paydown."

And I'm pretty sure it's going to be the largest launch in gas. It's going to be very nicely. We know how to do this. We did with iron with June the launch of Linzess. The DTC advertising will start not 1 year after approval, but only 3 months. And the promotional efforts, unlike any companies in the area will capture not only gastroenterologist, but primary care physicians. There's an interplay in almost every category between primary care and specialty that we can navigate that other companies can.

But our pricing, as I've mentioned during my opening remarks, is always a balance.

But I would just remind you that there are competitive toxins already the market. And more, if you talk to customers, more -- very few care about having an extra few weeks or month of duration of effect for Botox or toxins. And in fact what they mostly complain about is price. And our competitors price their toxins much -- at a much lower rate than we price Botox, and yet Botox continues to be a strong market leader. And so I would just issued to the perspective of as Bill said earlier, love to really decisions of a full range of patient aesthetics. Have a largest field force.

It's great to be with you to review our results for the third quarter of 2015. We obviously have been very busy on many fronts, and our teams continue to be build on the momentum we have had all year. This momentum will propel our future growth.
Turning to Slide 5. Allergan's third quarter performance illustrates the we continue to execute on the 4 pillars of our growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and strong results in continuing operations, key products and key geographies. Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce. Our team is looking forward to showcasing our R&D pipeline, the success we've had this year and the depth of our pipeline across all 7 therapeutic areas later today at R&D Day.
And we are executing on strategic business deals, including our Teva transaction earlier in the quarter, to allow us to focus on growing our business. With the announcements of our plans to combine our Global Generics business with Teva in a deal worth approximately $40.5 billion, we are now reporting our generics business as discontinued operations. Although the business results are consolidated into a single line in the income statement, our Global Generics team continues to perform well.
I'm impressed with the continued momentum in the business and proud of the performance of this team. For example, the generics R&D team has submitted 25 new ANDAs in the U.S. this year, with 16 of them potential First-to-Files. This team is a gem of the generics industry, and they are on track to submit approximately 35 applications by year-end.
Outside of the U.S., we filed over 1,000 marketing authorizations in critical markets. This year, we have received approval and launched over 25 products in the U.S., and these new launches are adding to our results. Internationally, the teams in the U.K., Russia and other Eastern European markets continue to deliver strong performance.
The pre-integration work with Teva is going well, and we remain committed to closing the transaction during the first quarter of 2016. This plan to divest the Global Generics business allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our focus on 7 core therapeutic areas and reload our capital structure to continue our transformation. We are confident that we are creating the most dynamic company in growth pharma.
Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter net revenue grew 90% on a year-over-year basis to $4.1 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition. On a pro forma basis, sales grew 10% despite the loss of exclusivity on one of our largest products, Namenda IR, which experienced generic competition in the quarter. Strong sales in key products across our business drove 65% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.48. Meanwhile, non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2 billion, and cash flow from operations, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments, was $1.7 billion in the quarter. 
Our business continues to drive strong performance. More than half of our products are delivering double-digit volume-driven growth. On a pro forma basis, year-over-year brand revenue increased nearly 13% excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange.
On Slide 8. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit growth from leading brands across key franchises such as Botox, Restasis, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Saphris. We continue to solidify our leadership in key categories with new launches and approvals. Our recent launches include -- including Avycaz, Dalvance, Namzaric, Liletta and Kybella, are all performing well, supported by strong promotional activities. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches, including Viberzi in a few weeks and Vraylar in the first quarter of 2016.
In addition to progress made in our R&D pipeline, we are also strengthening therapeutic area leadership through new acquisitions of important programs. In eye care, we continue to add [indiscernible] and development opportunities for dry eye disease and eye care with the acquisition of AqueSys, Mimetogen and Oculeve. Mimetogen, which we just announced this morning, brings a novel topical formulation dry eye treatment that could potentially be used alone and in combination with other dry eye therapies. This adds a Phase III program, further strengthening our dry eye pipeline, giving us the potential to launch 6 new products over the next 5 years.
In aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera for its leading product, Kybella, adding a nonsurgical treatment for submental fullness or double-chin. We also announced this morning the acquisition of Northwood Medical Innovation, developer of innovative implant technology, earFold. earFold is a medical device for the correction of prominent ears.
In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which has potential breakthrough treatments in depression and will be discussed in detail later this morning at R&D Day. 
And in GI, we recently completed the acquisition of commercial rights to Constella in more than 40 international markets. This adds an important product to our commercial team internationally and helps position us for the potential to add new GI therapies, like eluxadoline, to our product offering for international customers.
Before I turn the call over to Tessa to review our financial performance in the third quarter, I wanted to touch on our R&D Day and recent commentary on product pricing. Later this morning, David Nicholson, Bill Meury and Philippe Schaison will give an update on the pipeline and the commercial potential it contains. We believe that people will begin to take more active notice of our pipeline after today's meeting. 
With more than 70 projects in mid- to late-stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help us sustain leadership in the areas where we choose to compete. We are building a sustainable innovation engine to power our top line performance and therapeutic area leadership well into the future. Please join us for an exciting day beginning in about an hour.
Turning to pricing. Pricing has been in the headlines and featured in the presidential debates. But let's not pretend that this is a topic that has just appeared in the news. It's been a focus for many years. We know that cost is a constant concern, so is patient access to medical innovation. Allergan seeks to strike the right balance between care and cost. We operate in an Open Science model, developing promising products that frequently originate with smaller companies. These companies often lack the infrastructure to bring their products through expensive late-stage trials or the commercial presence to recoup their R&D investments. The innovation ecosystem is full of these smaller companies who have extraordinary ideas and brilliant scientists. We want to be the magnet for their great ideas in this new innovation ecosystem. Our model is designed to bring these extraordinary ideas to market. Our R&D staff is more than 2,000 people strong. They mobilize resources to help regulatory authorities around the world assess safety and efficacy of our products while providing data to payers to reflect their value.
Let's face it. This effort is costly and often reflected in the cost of medicine, and it is easy to miss the significant value they represent. They reduce the need for hospitalization, surgery, follow-up visits and more dire medical consequences. Allergan has a heritage in knowing health system economics very well, and we want to make sure patients have access to important medicines. Like many of our peers, we have patient assistance programs to make sure that patients have access to our medicines regardless of their ability to pay.
We are [indiscernible], acquiring and investing in promising treatments for serious diseases, Alzheimer's, severe depression, glaucoma, debilitating gastrointestinal conditions. Our business model does not involve purchasing old products already in the marketplace and taking excessive price increases. We prefer to acquire mid- to late-stage drugs and invest extensively in their development. 
To make these decisions to help people with unmet medical needs requires us to build bridges with physicians, academic medical centers, government, regulators and inventors of these molecules so that they see us as a partner who shares in their dedication to improve people's well-being. 
If you look at our recent development acquisitions, it's all about investing in ideas that can help change the way medicine is practiced. What makes the biopharmaceutical industry great? Inventions that change lives. We will continue to use our resources to advance treatments for unmet medical needs and to tap into the world's best ideas to advance care for patients. We will do this while we will continue to strike the appropriate balance between care and cost. 
In closing, our team continues to focus on execution, and our results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at delivering strong operating results while also doing surprising things to make our company the most dynamic and bold in health care. I'm so proud of this team for their performance, and I'm looking forward to what we can do with the strength and focus on just branded pharmaceuticals. 
With that, now I'd turn the call over to Tessa."

In the third quarter, we delivered very strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 90% versus third quarter 2014.
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $305 million compared to $192 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 22.4%, a decrease of 3.1 percentage points over the prior year quarter as a result of the synergies realized from recent acquisitions. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2 billion, an increase of 168% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 65% to $3.48 compared to $2.11 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the quarter. This rate was below expectations, driven primarily by the allocation of the entire interest expense to continuing operations earnings. This rate could change by potential repayment of debt upon the close of the Teva transaction. 
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $1 billion, impacted by recent asset acquisitions. Excluding acquisition-related restructuring and integration payments, our third quarter cash flow from operations would be $1.7 billion.
Slide 13. Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on Slide 13. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 50% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products, including Restasis, Linzess, Women's Health products, and new product launches, including Liletta, Namzaric and Avycaz. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continued to be strong with margins approaching 88%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.3% versus 22.1% in the year-ago quarter, driven by continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 14 and our U.S. Medical Aesthetics business. Third quarter revenues were $457 million, an increase of 9% versus third quarter 2014 results on a pro forma basis. Sequentially, U.S. Medical Aesthetics performance was affected by seasonality related to aesthetics procedures. Third quarter gross margins were strong at 93.9%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.2 percentage points versus third quarter 2014.
Turning to Slide 15 and our International Brands results. Third quarter revenues were $661 million versus $58 million in the prior year largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Year-over-year growth was also driven by fillers and Ozurdex in international markets. Sequential revenue performance was mostly due to seasonality. Gross margins increased 25.7 percentage points to 83% in the third quarter due largely to the inclusion of higher-margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A increased 3.2 percentage points to 29.8% versus third quarter 2014 due largely to the Allergan acquisition.
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 16. Revenues increased to $576 million, up from $500 million in the prior year, an increase of 15%, driven by trends in our base business and new retail chain businesses. Results include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.
Slide 17 details our debt capitalization. We ended the third quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion and equity of $77.5 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. In the third quarter, we paid down approximately $231 million of our debt. In October, we borrowed $800 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the Kythera acquisition.  Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 3.98x debt-to-pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 3.9x in the prior quarter due to continued investments in R&D assets. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings.
And now I will turn the call to Lisa for Q&A."

As Brent said, when formulary coverage converge in 2016 and after several months of direct-to-consumer advertising, I would expect over time that the overall business is going to grow and that Namzaric is going to account for a greater and greater percentage of it for one simple reason. It's a better product. If you look at the data, 2 drugs is better than 1, and I think it will take just a little bit of time to move this category."

To be able to have more opportunities to leverage GI is a good move for us. Obviously, Aesthetic Medicine is very important. We have lots of opportunity to continue to expand the aesthetic portfolio in Asia, China, I would call out, Latin America. Brazil is another market I would call out where we're seeing strong growth. And then, of course, eye care is very important to us around the world. And we continue to look for ways to build our portfolio and leadership in eye care. And in many markets, we are #1 in eye care outside the U.S. So we have a big heritage there, and it is important for us to continue to leverage. With respect to business development, it remains a priority. We will continue to look for ways to add scale and product flow in key international markets around the world. And if we do that ourselves by eluxadoline approval or Juvederm approval recently in China or buying Constella or other things, it's an important growth driver for us in the future."

I don't believe that this is going to be a fight to the death between Shire and Allergan. I've said before that the gap between the prevalent population and prescription-treated population is enormous. It's larger than it is in most categories. The importance of dry eye disease is clear, and it's getting more and more attention because of the impact it has on quality of life, the impact that it can have on vision and positive post-op outcomes. When you look at the data sets between the drugs, I would simply say that we'll have to see how Lifitegrast stands up in the real world. I would also point out that in the second half of 2016, we'll be launching a multi-dose preservative-free form of Restasis, which, I believe, is going to be very popular with physicians and with patients for 2 reasons. The first, it's just more convenient than 60 single-unit vials or droppers, and it's also easier to administer. And a big problem with all of these eyedrops is they're difficult to instill, and it's often a major problem with compliance. Our promotional program in this category will continue to be at the very top. We have a large sales force that covers primary care, optometry and ophthalmology. We'll continue to run the largest direct-to-consumer advertising program in the industry. And then lastly, obviously, as you asked about formulary coverage, we have preferred status on 85% to 90% of health plan formularies, and 90% of that is Tier 2. And so this is a highly economical option. There's no doubt eye care professionals are going to try something new. But I believe, long term, this category has the potential to double, so there's more than enough to go around."

But we do operate with the principal when we launch new products, and we have multiple new product launches over the next several years. We will always aim to achieve share of voice leadership.

IBS should be thought about as a continuum, with constipation on one end and diarrhea on the other. And because we're able to market 2 products for the same condition essentially, we're able to talk about it in a more complete way. I think it's a competitive advantage. As it relates to the products -- compared to Xifaxan, it's a completely different approach to treatment. This drug works on motility and visceral pain or hypersensitivity. And Xifaxan essentially is an antibiotic. There's certainly room in this category for more than one product. Promotionally speaking, this will be one of the largest launches in the industry from an investment standpoint, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be the largest launch in gastroenterology. It's going to be very noisy. We know how to do this. We did it with Ironwood during the launch of Linzess. The DTC advertising will start not 1 year after approval but only 3 months. And the promotional efforts, unlike other companies in the area, will capture not only gastroenterologists but primary care physicians. And there's an interplay in almost every category between primary care and specialty that we can navigate that other companies can't. And I would expect that this drug should do as well as Linzess does on the other side of the market and could ultimately almost double the size of our GI business over the next 5 years."

So I think as, obviously, we're under some restriction under Irish law with respect to guidance, but our pricing, as I've mentioned during my opening remarks, is always a balance. And most of our key growth drivers are, as Bill indicated, predominantly in a volume situation, not a price situation. As we think about price, we tend to think about mid- to high single-digit price increases across the portfolio. And so we don't really think of any change or expect any change in our very, I think, conservative pricing policy and the way we think about price. And so we're not going to -- I don't think you're going to see us change our view or, perhaps, better said, our commitment to the 10% growth objectives and aspirations that we have. So I think that's going to stay fairly normalized for the foreseeable future. I think with respect to Revance and competitive toxins, I'll ask David to comment as well. But I would just remind you that there are competitive toxins already in the market. And more -- if you talk to customers, more -- very few care about having an extra few weeks or a month of duration of effect for Botox or toxins. And in fact, what they mostly complain about is price. And our competitors price their toxins much -- at a much lower rate than we price Botox, and yet Botox continues to be a strong market leader. And so I would just urge you to keep perspective. As Philippe said earlier, we have 2 million members and brilliant distinctions. We have a full range of facial aesthetics. We have the largest field force. Botox is the #1 branded pharmaceutical brand in the world. And so this is a very strong franchise with very good staying power. And so sometimes, there's a hammer looking for a nail. Duration maybe just that. But scientifically, maybe David can comment, too."

We will be launching new indications of Botox around the world, so extending our aesthetic reach geographically. And we will be developing Botox for new therapeutic application. I would point out, if we're talking about duration, Botox, in some indications, has a duration for up to 9 months. So if we're talking about hyperhidrosis, for instance, Botox then works for up to 9 months. So the duration of Botox depends on the use and the dose that we administer.

Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law.
At this time, as a result of the press release Allergan issued on October 29, 2015 confirming the company has been approached by Pfizer and is in preliminary friendly discussions regarding a potential business combination transaction, the company will not be issuing any financial forecast that could require additional reporting under Rule 28 of the Irish Takeover Rules.
With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our CEO and President, who will provide an overview of our third quarter continuing operations business highlights; and Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss the Allergan third quarter continuing operations results in more detail. Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Paul Bisaro, our Executive Chairman; Bob Stewart, President of Global Generics and Commercial Operations; Bill Meury, President of Branded Pharma; David Nicholson, Executive Vice President and President of Global Brands R&D; Paul Navarre, President of International Brands; Philippe Schaison, President of Allergan Medical; and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brent."

This momentum w",1542,"Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you to review our results for the third quarter of 2015. We obviously have been very busy on many fronts, and our teams continue to build on the momentum we have had all year. This momentum will propel our future growth.
Turning to Slide 5. Allergan's third quarter performance illustrates that we continue to execute on the 4 pillars of our growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and strong results in continuing operations, key products and key geographies. Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce. Our team is looking forward to showcasing our R&D pipeline, the success we've had this year and the depth of our pipeline across all 7 therapeutic areas later today at R&D Day.
And we are executing on strategic business deals, including our Teva transaction earlier in the quarter, to allow us to focus on growing our business. With the announcements of our plans to combine our Global Generics business with Teva in a deal worth approximately $40.5 billion, we are now reporting our generics business as discontinued operations. Although the business results are consolidated into a single line in the income statement, our Global Generics team continues to perform well.
I'm impressed with the continued momentum in the business and proud of the performance of this team. For example, the generics R&D team has submitted 25 new ANDAs in the U.S. this year, with 16 of them potential First-to-Files. This team is the gem of the generics industry, and they are on track to submit approximately 35 applications by year-end.
Outside the U.S., we filed over 1,000 marketing authorizations in critical markets. This year, we have received approval and launched over 25 products in the U.S., and these new launches are adding to our results. Internationally, the teams in the U.K., Russia and other Eastern European markets continue to deliver strong performance.
The pre-integration work with Teva is going well, and we remain committed to closing the transaction during the first quarter of 2016. This plan to divest the Global Generics business allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our focus on 7 core therapeutic areas and reload our capital structures to continue our transformation. We are confident that we are creating the most dynamic company in growth pharma.
Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter net revenue grew 90% on a year-over-year basis to $4.1 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition. On a pro forma basis, sales grew 10% despite the loss of exclusivity on one of our largest products, Namenda IR, which experienced generic competition in the quarter. Strong sales in key products across our business drove 65% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.48. Meanwhile, non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2 billion, and cash flow from operations, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments, was $1.7 billion in the quarter. 
Our business continues to drive strong performance. More than half of our products are delivering double-digit volume-driven growth. On a pro forma basis, year-over-year brand revenue increased nearly 13% excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange.
On Slide 8. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit growth from leading brands across key franchises such as Botox, Restasis, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Saphris. We continue to solidify our leadership in key categories with new launches and approvals. Our recent launches include -- including Avycaz, Dalvance, Namzaric, Liletta and Kybella, are all performing well, supported by strong promotional activities. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches, including Viberzi in a few weeks and Vraylar in the first quarter of 2016.
In addition to progress made in our R&D pipeline, we are also strengthening therapeutic area leadership through new acquisitions of important programs. In eye care, we continue to add shots on goal and development opportunities for dry eye disease and eye care with the acquisition of AqueSys, Mimetogen and Oculeve. Mimetogen, which we just announced this morning, brings a novel topical formulation dry eye treatment that could potentially be used alone and in combination with other dry eye therapies. This adds a Phase III program, further strengthening our dry eye pipeline, giving us the potential to launch 6 new products over the next 5 years.
In aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera for its leading product, Kybella, adding a nonsurgical treatment for submental fullness or double-chin. We also announced this morning the acquisition of Northwood Medical Innovation, developer of an innovative implant technology, earFold. earFold is a medical device for the correction of prominent ears.
In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which adds potential breakthrough treatments in depression and will be discussed in detail later this morning at R&D Day. 
And in GI, we recently completed the acquisition of commercial rights to Constella in more than 40 international markets. This adds an important product to our commercial team internationally and helps position us for the potential to add new GI therapies, like eluxadoline, to our product offering for international customers.
Before I turn the call over to Tessa to review our financial performance in the third quarter, I wanted to touch on our R&D Day and recent commentary on product pricing. Later this morning, David Nicholson, Bill Meury and Philippe Schaison will give an update on the pipeline and the commercial potential it contains. We believe that people will begin to take more active notice of our pipeline after today's meeting. 
With more than 70 projects in mid- to late-stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help us sustain leadership in the areas where we choose to compete. We are building a sustainable innovation engine to power our top line performance and therapeutic area leadership well into the future. Please join us for an exciting day beginning in about an hour.
Turning to pricing. Pricing has been in the headlines and featured in the presidential debates. But let's not pretend that this is a topic that has just appeared in the news. It's been a focus for many years. We know that cost is a constant concern, so is patient access to medical innovation. Allergan seeks to strike the right balance between care and cost. We operate in an Open Science model, developing promising products that frequently originate with smaller companies. These companies often lack the infrastructure to bring their products through expensive late-stage trials or the commercial presence to recoup their R&D investments. The innovation ecosystem is full of these smaller companies who have extraordinary ideas and brilliant scientists. We want to be the magnet for their great ideas in this new innovation ecosystem. Our model is designed to bring these extraordinary ideas to market. Our R&D staff is more than 2,000 people strong. They mobilize resources to help regulatory authorities around the world assess safety and efficacy of our products while providing data to payers to reflect their value.
Let's face it. This effort is costly and often reflected in the cost of medicine, and it is easy to miss the significant value they represent. They reduce the need for hospitalization, surgery, follow-up visits and more dire medical consequences. Allergan has a heritage in knowing health system economics very well, and we want to make sure patients have access to important medicines. Like many of our peers, we have patient assistance programs to make sure that patients have access to our medicines regardless of their ability to pay.
We are bold in acquiring and investing in promising treatments for serious diseases, Alzheimer's, severe depression, glaucoma, debilitating gastrointestinal conditions. Our business model does not involve purchasing old products already in the marketplace and taking excessive price increases. We prefer to acquire mid- to late-stage drugs and invest extensively in their development. 
To make these decisions to help people with unmet medical needs requires us to build bridges with physicians, academic medical centers, government, regulators and inventors of these molecules so that they see us as a partner who shares in their dedication to improve people's well-being. 
If you look at our recent development acquisitions, it's all about investing in ideas that can help change the way medicine is practiced. What makes the biopharmaceutical industry great? Inventions that change lives. We will continue to use our resources to advance treatments for unmet medical needs and to tap into the world's best ideas to advance care for patients. We will do this while we will continue to strike the appropriate balance between care and cost. 
In closing, our team continues to focus on execution, and our results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at delivering strong operating results while also doing surprising things to make our company the most dynamic and bold in health care. I'm so proud of this team for their performance, and I'm looking forward to what we can do with the strength and focus on just branded pharmaceuticals. 
With that, now I'd turn the call over to Tessa."

In the third quarter, we delivered very strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 90% versus third quarter 2014.
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $305 million compared to $192 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 22.4%, a decrease of 3.1 percentage points over the prior year quarter as a result of the synergies realized from recent acquisitions. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2 billion, an increase of 168% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 65% to $3.48 compared to $2.11 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the quarter. This rate was below expectations, driven primarily by the allocation of the entire interest expense to continuing operations earnings. This rate could change by potential repayment of debt upon the close of the Teva transaction. 
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $1 billion, impacted by recent asset acquisitions. Excluding acquisition-related restructuring and integration payments, our third quarter cash flow from operations would be $1.7 billion.
Slide 13. Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on Slide 13. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 50% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products, including Restasis, Linzess, Women's Health products, and new product launches, including Liletta, Namzaric and Avycaz. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continued to be strong with margins approaching 88%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.3% versus 22.1% in the year-ago quarter, driven by continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 14 and our U.S. Medical Aesthetics business. Third quarter revenues were $457 million, an increase of 9% versus third quarter 2014 results on a pro forma basis. Sequentially, U.S. Medical Aesthetics performance was affected by seasonality related to aesthetics procedures. Third quarter gross margins were strong at 93.9%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.2 percentage points versus third quarter 2014.
Turning to Slide 15 and our International Brands results. Third quarter revenues were $661 million versus $58 million in the prior year largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Year-over-year growth was also driven by fillers and Ozurdex in international markets. Sequential revenue performance was mostly due to seasonality. Gross margins increased 25.7 percentage points to 83% in the third quarter due largely to the inclusion of higher-margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A increased 3.2 percentage points to 29.8% versus third quarter 2014 due largely to the Allergan acquisition.
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 16. Revenues increased to $576 million, up from $500 million in the prior year, an increase of 15%, driven by trends in our base business and new retail chain businesses. Results include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.
Slide 17 details our debt capitalization. We ended the third quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion and equity of $77.5 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. In the third quarter, we paid down approximately $231 million of our debt. In October, we borrowed $800 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the Kythera acquisition.  Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 3.98x debt-to-pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 3.9x in the prior quarter due to continued investments in R&D assets. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings.
And now I will turn the call to Lisa for Q&A."

As Brent said, when formulary coverage converts in 2016 and after several months of direct-to-consumer advertising, I would expect over time that the overall business is going to grow and that Namzaric is going to account for a greater and greater percentage of it for one simple reason. It's a better product. If you look at the data, 2 drugs is better than 1, and I think it will take just a little bit of time to move this category."

To be able to have more opportunities to leverage GI is a good move for us. Obviously, Aesthetic Medicine is very important. We have lots of opportunity to continue to expand the aesthetic portfolio in Asia, China, I would call out, Latin America. Brazil is another market I would call out where we're seeing strong growth. And then, of course, eye care is very important to us around the world. And we continue to look for ways to build our portfolio and leadership in eye care.

I don't believe that this is going to be a fight to the death between Shire and Allergan. I've said before that the gap between the prevalent population and prescription-treated population is enormous. It's larger than it is in most categories. The importance of dry eye disease is clear, and it's getting more and more attention because of the impact it has on quality of life, the impact that it can have on vision and positive post-op outcomes. When you look at the data sets between the drugs, I would simply say that we'll have to see how Lifitegrast stands up in the real world. I would also point out that in the second half of 2016, we'll be launching a multi-dose preservative-free form of Restasis, which, I believe, is going to be very popular with physicians and with patients for 2 reasons. The first, it's just more convenient than 60 single-unit vials or droppers, and it's also easier to administer. And a big problem with all of these eyedrops is they're difficult to instill, and it's often a major problem with compliance. Our promotional program in this category will continue to be at the very top. We have a large sales force that covers primary care, optometry and ophthalmology. We'll continue to run the largest direct-to-consumer advertising program in the industry. And then lastly, obviously, as you asked about formulary coverage, we have preferred status on 85% to 90% of health plan formularies, and 90% of that is Tier 2. And so this is a highly economical option. There's no doubt eye care professionals are going to try something new. But I believe, long term, this category has the potential to double, so there's more than enough to go around."

So to the extent that we don't deploy the capital, we will pay down the amount necessary to maintain the rating on a go-forward basis. With regards to the tax question, based on our release, what actually occurred because of continuing operations is that the bulk of -- or the entire interest expense was actually allocated to continuing operations, hence, the low tax rate.

And Xifaxan essentially is an antibiotic. There's certainly room in this category for more than one product. Promotionally speaking, this will be one of the largest launches in the industry from an investment standpoint, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be the largest launch in gastroenterology. It's going to be very noisy. We know how to do this. We did it with Ironwood during the launch of Linzess. The DTC advertising will start not 1 year after approval but only 3 months. And the promotional efforts, unlike other companies in the area, will capture not only gastroenterologists but primary care physicians. And there's an interplay in almost every category between primary care and specialty that we can navigate that other companies can't.

So I think as, obviously, we're under some restriction under Irish law with respect to guidance, but our pricing, as I've mentioned during my opening remarks, is always a balance. And most of our key growth drivers are, as Bill indicated, predominantly in a volume situation, not a price situation. As we think about price, we tend to think about mid- to high single-digit price increases across the portfolio. And so we don't really think of any change or expect any change in our very, I think, conservative pricing policy and the way we think about price. And so we're not going to -- I don't think you're going to see us change our view or, perhaps, better said, our commitment to the 10% growth objectives and aspirations that we have. So I think that's going to stay fairly normalized for the foreseeable future. I think with respect to Revance and competitive toxins, I'll ask David to comment as well. But I would just remind you that there are competitive toxins already in the market. And more -- if you talk to customers, more -- very few care about having an extra few weeks or a month of duration of effect for Botox or toxins. And in fact, what they mostly complain about is price. And our competitors price their toxins much -- at a much lower rate than we price Botox, and yet Botox continues to be a strong market leader. And so I would just urge you to keep perspective. As Philippe said earlier, we have 2 million members and brilliant distinctions. We have a full range of facial aesthetics. We have the largest field force. Botox is the #1 branded pharmaceutical brand in the world. And so this is a very strong franchise with very good staying power. And so sometimes, there's a hammer looking for a nail. Duration may be just that. But scientifically, maybe David can comment, too."

And Botox, of course, is a pipeline in a product, and we remain committed to continuing to build the pipeline. We will be launching new indications of Botox around the world, so extending our aesthetic reach geographically. And we will be developing Botox for new therapeutic application. I would point out, if we're talking about duration, Botox, in some indications, has a duration for up to 9 months. So if we're talking about hyperhidrosis, for instance, Botox then works for up to 9 months. So the duration of Botox depends on the use and the dose that we administer. And more of this during the course of the day as we walk through our R&D pipeline."

CNS, a strong presence in Alzheimer's and neurology and psychiatry. But we know we don't participate, let's say, in, just as an example, MS or Parkinson's or a variety of other conditions that could leverage CNS.

I mean, most of the sales for Linzess today are being captured by patients who are using over-the-counter medications. And that will be the primary source of growth in the future. A low dose is going to give physicians some optionality. And for patients, it may be better tolerated. So Linzess, at that 145 and 290, based on our estimation, is extremely well tolerated. The average patient is taking close to 120 days of therapy as compared to Amitiza or Zelnorm, which were trading at roughly 90 days of therapy. Broadly speaking, though, it's a great space. And with Viberzi, we can pull resources for the 2 products so that each one is going to get a greater level of effort than they would have if marketed independently.
