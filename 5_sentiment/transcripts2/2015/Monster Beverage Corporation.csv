We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 13 billion Monster energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 13 years. In August 2014, monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into a definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerated growth for Monster in the global energy category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership with worldwide energy business to monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to The Coca-Cola Company. Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution coordination agreements to expanded distribution with Coca-Cola Bottlers into additional territories. The Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long-term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We believe that this distribution arrangement will accelerate Monster's opportunity to grow internationally. We are actively engaged in preparations for the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. The waiting period under the hotspot Regina Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with respect to the transactions expired on October 15 2014, and in addition, all necessary approvals and consents from foreign antitrust authorities have been obtained. In accordance with this existing agreements, with applicable third-party distributors, on February 9, 2015, the company set notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors in the U.S. providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights are expected to be transitioned to Coca-Cola's distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third parties rights in such territory. We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights from Monster to such bottlers. The closing of the transactions is still subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies, as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we received the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. 
Turning to the fourth quarter results. Throughout the fourth quarter and continuing into the 2015, the beverage industry, in general, has continued to show weakness. However, sales in the energy drink category appear to have accelerated, particularly in the U.S. towards the end of 2014 and into 2015. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record growth sales of $696.3 million, up 12.1% from $621.1 million. Net sales were $605.6 million, up 12% from $540.8 million. Our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew well in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole during the fourth quarter. Sales of Zero Ultra also continued to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter. Zero Ultra has become our second best selling item. At the end of the third quarter, we launched Ultra Sunrise, which was well-received by retailers, as well as consumers, and quickly became one of our top-performing SKUs. Sales of Java Monster also grew in the quarter. During 2014, we redesigned the graphics for our Juice-based MAT and Chaos energy drinks. Those products have been repositioned as our Juice Monster lines. MAT was renamed RIPPER, and the juice content was lowered, which has improved their capability. Sales of these products have showed healthy increases since this exercise was completed. Sales of our repositioned Punch Monster line have also increased. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 3.6 percentage points to 54.8 from 51.2 in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line, changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweetness and other raw material, as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Operating income was up 43.2% to $192.9 million from $134.8 million in the 2013 comparable quarter. During the fourth quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan, as compared to an operating loss from these operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fact, our operations outside North America delivered operating income of $13.8 million in the 2014 fourth quarter as compared to an operating loss of $4.4 million in the same quarter in 2013. Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower in the quarter than last year. While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year in dollars, in the quarter, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Results for the 2014 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $2.9 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared with $4.7 million in the -- for the 2013 fourth quarter. Foreign currency losses during the fourth quarter decreased primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Japan and South Africa. Our effective tax rate decreased from 42.2% to 34.7%, in the fourth quarter, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that had no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets. Net income was $125.3 million, up 64.7% over net income of $76.1 million earned during the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 63.2% to $0.72 from $0.44 in the 2013 comparable quarter. 
Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record growth sales of $2.8 billion for the 2014 full year, up 9.3% from $2.6 billion in 2013. Net sales were $2.5 billion, up 9.7% from $2.2 billion. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended 2013. Operating income was up 30.5% to $747.5 million from $572.9 million in 2013. Our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year as compared to an operating loss of $13.4 million in the same period the previous year. In the full year, expenses related to regulatory and litigation concerning our Monster Energy drinks were $20.6 million as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.9% in 2013 to 35.2% for the full 2014 year. Net income was $483.2 million, up 42.7% of a net income of $338.7 million in 2013, and diluted earnings per share increased 41.9% to $2.77 from $1.95 in 2013.

Costco market share presented by Burn and Gladiator together decreased 3.4% to 6.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially improved by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on a monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.

Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased its market share in Europe. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and Greece, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. Overall, our Western European, Africa divisions and operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in store execution. We are continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and into 2014. Our EMEA division traded profitably during both the third and fourth quarters of 2014 which contributed to the reduction in effective tax rate of the company. Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 11.1% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America decreased 17.1% over the comparable 2013 fourth quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange differences and comparative price adjustment in Chile to offset indirect tax and issues with our Columbia distributor. Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets, although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the third quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We are planning to produce Monster in India shortly. Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter were 4.1% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013.

General and administrative expenses decreased 3.3%, although payroll costs were slightly higher. Including general and administrative costs and the quarter was $1.2 million related to the Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. During the 2014 fourth quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board authorized share repurchase program. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $373.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $781.1 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased from $9.8 million to $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, and 40.1 days at December 31, 2013 as compared to 40.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $174.6 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013.

As discussed on the last call, we are currently in the process of launching Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster D+ energy. Due to strong response we received to our 2014 summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South America, we have converted that item into a permanent SKU in existing countries, in which it is being sold and are planning to launch it in additional European countries in 2015. Gross sales in January 2015, were 11.2% higher than in January 2014. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent part of the points North America international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 fourth quarter gross margins in North America, as well as internationally, generate higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. deals in the market statistics show the energy category continues to grow and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 are gaining market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers during 2014 and both distribution and sales of those lines are improving. We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines will continue to increase their contribution to sales throughout 2015. 
Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, The Netherlands and Chile. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year. Thank you."

And then my second question is specific to Asia. I think your sales were up 11.4%. You talked about positive performance in Japan.

Also, you would appreciate that their are severance fee is dependent on their sales in the 12 months immediately preceding the termination. So it is in their interest, obviously, to continue increasing their sales out in order to maximize their own severance payments, and we felt that by giving them the assurance that the went pick up all or buyback all inventory that there is no reason for them to start trying to rationalize their inventory or try and cut down in only focus on the main SKUs and not carry the supporting brands. And we've had -- we think we had a good effect. This correspondence had a good effect. And we've really not experienced any noticeable disruption from the A.B. distributors as compared to our other distributors. I think that continued to perform. Nicely you can see that from the results any we are not seeing any despair their bridge differences between the A.B. distributors on the one side and Coke distributors or some of the independence on the other side. The trends that we have from these distributors before the notice has continued into the fourth quarter and continued even in the first couple of 2 months of this year. So where we aren't seeing that, we are being able to manage that reasonably comfortably. Going forward, obviously, we will see how that goes. We're hoping that by giving the AB distributors quite a lot of notice, being able to manage these inventory issues and pick up issues, will enable us also to make sure inventory is in place at the Coke gone to the Coke branches so that when the change over occurs, they will be ready to go with inventory as well. So we obviously are trying to minimize the disruption that will occur at that point in time. And it will occur slightly at a slightly different dates it's not a lot of principal dates probably closer to the early April, there are dates that take place at different times."

We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 13 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 13 years. In August 2014, Monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into a definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership with worldwide energy business to Monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to The Coca-Cola Company. 
Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution coordination agreements to expand distribution with Coca-Cola Bottlers into additional territories. The Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strengths of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We believe that this distribution arrangement will accelerate Monster's opportunity to grow internationally. We are actively engaged in preparations for the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with respect to the transactions expired on October 15 2014, and in addition, all necessary approvals and consents from foreign antitrust authorities have been obtained. 
In accordance with this existing agreements with applicable third-party distributors, on February 9, 2015, the company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors in the U.S. providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights are expected to be transitioned to Coca-Cola's distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third-party's rights in such territory. 
We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights from Monster to such bottlers. The closing of the transactions is still subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. 
Turning to the fourth quarter results. Throughout the fourth quarter and continuing into the 2015, the beverage industry, in general, has continued to show weakness. However, sales in the Energy Drink category appear to have accelerated, particularly in the U.S. towards the end of 2014 and into 2015. 
In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $696.3 million, up 12.1% from $621.1 million. Net sales were  $605.6 million, up 12% from $540.8 million. Our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew well in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole during the fourth quarter. Sales of Zero Ultra also continued to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter. Zero Ultra has become our second best selling item. At the end of the third quarter, we launched Ultra Sunrise, which was well received by retailers as well as consumers, and quickly became one of our top-performing SKUs. 
Sales of Java Monster also grew in the quarter. During 2014, we redesigned the graphics for our juice-based M-80 and Chaos energy drinks. Those products have been repositioned as our Juice Monster line. M-80 was renamed RIPPER, and the juice content was lowered, which has improved their drinkability. Sales of these products have showed healthy increases since this exercise was completed. Sales of our repositioned Punch Monster line have also increased. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 3.6 percentage points to 54.8% from 51.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line, changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweetness and other raw material as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Operating income was up 43.2% to $192.9 million from $134.8 million in the 2013 comparable quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan, as compared to an operating loss from these operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fact, our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $13.8 million in the 2014 fourth quarter as compared to an operating loss of $4.4 million in the same quarter in 2013. 
Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower in the quarter than last year. While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year in dollars, in the quarter, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Results for the 2014 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $2.9 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared with $4.7 million in the -- for the 2013 fourth quarter. Foreign currency losses during the fourth quarter decreased, primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Japan and South Africa. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 42.2% to 34.7%, in the fourth quarter, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets. 
Net income was $125.3 million, up 64.7% over net income of $76.1 million earned during the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 63.2% to $0.72 from $0.44 in the 2013 comparable quarter. 
Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record growth sales of $2.8 billion for the 2014 full year, up 9.3% from $2.6 billion in 2013. Net sales were $2.5 billion, up 9.7% from $2.2 billion. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended 2013. Operating income was up 30.5% to $747.5 million from $572.9 million in 2013. Our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year as compared to an operating loss of $13.4 million in the same period the previous year. 
In the full year, expenses related to regulatory and litigation concerning our Monster Energy drinks were $20.6 million as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.9% in 2013 to 35.2% for the full 2014 year. Net income was $483.2 million, up 42.7% of a net income of $338.7 million in 2013, and diluted earnings per share increased 41.9% to $2.77 from $1.95 in 2013. 
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through January 24, 2015, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago.

Java Monster was 10.6% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot energy was 22.2% higher. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 7, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were flat versus a year ago. Our market share decreased 1.4 points to 28.2% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased by 0.3 of 1 point to 36.2%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 9.7% in the month of December 2014. Monster sales increased 1.7% and market share decreased 2.6 points to 32.6% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 8.7% and its market share decreased by 4.8% to 23 -- 9 points to 23.7%.

Coke market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together decreased 3.4 points to 6.1%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended January 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.5% to 12.8% in Great Britain, and from 17.4% to 18.3% in France. In the 13-week period ended December 2014, Monster's market share in value as compared to the same period last year increased from 8% to 10.9% in Germany; from 7.4% to 7.9% in Belgium; from 5.2% to 5.9% in The Netherlands; and from 8.1% to 8.7% in Sweden. 
Monster's market sharing value for the 13 weeks ended January 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.4% to 18% in South Africa, and from 21.7% to 21.2% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks through December 28, 2014 from 24.5% to 29.2% increase. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen for the month of January 2015, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 14.4% as compared to 9.4% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of January grew from 4.6% to 5.2% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of January 2015, in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 29% to 32.6%. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 12.6% to $584.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 from $519.4 million in the same period in 2013. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 10.3% to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.1 billion in the same period in 2013. Contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 31.2% from $177.9 million to $232.5 million in the quarter and from $726.8 million to $908 million for the year. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.2% to $20.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 from $21.4 million for the same period in 2013 and decreased from $99.1 million for the 2013 year to $95.7 million for the full 2014 year. 
For the full year, contribution margin increased from a loss of $1 million in the prior year's fourth quarter to a profit of $0.8 million and from a loss of $1.7 million in 2013 to a profit of $3 million in 2014. For the 3-month ended December 31, gross sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represent a 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 8% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. 
Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in '13. Gross sales internationally represented 23% of sales, up from 22% in the same period a year ago. Other sales are 2% for the period was the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2014 amounted to $160.1 million compared to $137.9 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in sub-sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2014 in dollars were 17.5% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and Greece, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. 
Overall, our Western European and Africa divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and into 2014. Our EMEA division traded profitably during both the third and fourth quarters of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in effective tax rate of the company. Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 11.1% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America decreased 17.1% over the comparable 2013 fourth quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange differences and comparative price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Columbian distributor. Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase. 
We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets, although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the third quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We are planning to produce Monster in India shortly. Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter were 4.1% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Other selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.3% in the quarter versus 10.8% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs were marginally higher in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. TDM MAT program costs were lower during the quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales. 
General and administrative expenses decreased 3.3%, although payroll costs were slightly higher, including general and administrative costs in the quarter was $1.2 million related to The Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. During the 2014 fourth quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $370.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $781.1 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased from $9.8 million to $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million. Days outstanding for account receivables were 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, and 40.1 days at December 31, 2013 as compared to 40.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $174.6 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 57.4 days at December 31, 2014, which was lower than the 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014. 
As discussed on the last call, we are currently in the process of launching Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy. Due to the strong response we received to our 2014 summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South Africa, we have converted that item into a permanent SKU in existing countries, in which it is being sold and are planning to launch it in additional European countries in 2015. 
Gross sales in January 2015, were 11.2% higher than in January 2014. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent part of the points North American international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 fourth quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the Energy category continues to grow and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 are gaining market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. 
Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers during 2014 and both distribution and sales of those lines are improving. We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines will continue to increase their contribution to sales throughout 2015. 
Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, The Netherlands and Chile. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year. Thank you."

Also, you will appreciate that their are severance fee is dependent on their sales in the 12 months, immediately preceding the termination. So it is in their interest, obviously, to continue increasing their sales out in order to maximizing their own severance payments, and we felt that by giving them the assurance that we would pick up all or buyback all several inventories that there was no reason for them to start trying to rationalize their inventory or try and cut down and only focus on the main SKUs and not carry the supporting brands.

And we've really not experienced any noticeable disruption from the AB Distributors as compared to our other distributors.

The trend that we had from these distributors before the notice has continued into the fourth quarter and continued even in the first couple of 2 months of this year. So we aren't seeing that, we are being able to manage that reasonably comfortably. Going forward, obviously, we will see how that goes. We're hoping that by giving the AB Distributors quite a lot of notice, being able to manage these inventory issues and pick up issues, will enable us to also make sure inventory is in place at the Coke plants and the Coke branches so that when the change over occurs, they will be ready to go with the inventory as well.

And I'm just wondering if there was any sort of overshipment to the anticipation of any other change over that happened at that point? Or, in fact, you had the acceleration in growth rate in the fourth quarter and if you look at 11% in January, that's actually a slight deceleration. So was there anything going on in the fourth quarter that inflated U.S. profits?"

We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 13 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 13 years. In August 2014, Monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership with worldwide energy business to Monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to The Coca-Cola Company. 
Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution coordination agreements to expand distribution with Coca-Cola Bottlers into additional territories. The Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strengths of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We believe that this distribution arrangement will accelerate Monster's opportunity to grow internationally. We are actively engaged in preparations for the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with respect to the transactions expired on October 15 2014, and in addition, all necessary approvals and consents from foreign antitrust authorities have been obtained. 
In accordance with this existing agreements with applicable third-party distributors, on February 9, 2015, the company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors in the U.S. providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights are expected to be transitioned to Coca-Cola's distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third-party's rights in such territory. 
We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights from Monster to such bottlers. The closing of the transactions is still subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. 
Turning to the fourth quarter results. Throughout the fourth quarter and continuing into the 2015, the beverage industry, in general, has continued to show weakness. However, sales in the Energy Drink category appear to have accelerated, particularly in the U.S. towards the end of 2014 and into 2015. 
In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $696.3 million, up 12.1% from $621.1 million. Net sales were  $605.6 million, up 12% from $540.8 million. Our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew well in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole during the fourth quarter. Sales of Zero Ultra also continued to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter. Zero Ultra has become our second best selling item. At the end of the third quarter, we launched Ultra Sunrise, which was well received by retailers as well as consumers, and quickly became one of our top-performing SKUs. 
Sales of Java Monster also grew in the quarter. During 2014, we redesigned the graphics for our juice-based M-80 and Chaos energy drinks. Those products have been repositioned as our Juice Monster line. M-80 was renamed RIPPER, and the juice content was lowered, which has improved their drinkability. Sales of these products have showed healthy increases since this exercise was completed. Sales of our repositioned Punch Monster line have also increased. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 3.6 percentage points to 54.8% from 51.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line, changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweetness and other raw material as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Operating income was up 43.2% to $192.9 million from $134.8 million in the 2013 comparable quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan, as compared to an operating loss from these operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fact, our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $13.8 million in the 2014 fourth quarter as compared to an operating loss of $4.4 million in the same quarter in 2013. 
Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower in the quarter than last year. While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year in dollars, in the quarter, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Results for the 2014 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $2.9 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared with $4.7 million in the -- for the 2013 fourth quarter. Foreign currency losses during the fourth quarter decreased, primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Japan and South Africa. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 42.2% to 34.7%, in the fourth quarter, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets. 
Net income was $125.3 million, up 64.7% over net income of $76.1 million earned during the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 63.2% to $0.72 from $0.44 in the 2013 comparable quarter. 
Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record growth sales of $2.8 billion for the 2014 full year, up 9.3% from $2.6 billion in 2013. Net sales were $2.5 billion, up 9.7% from $2.2 billion. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended 2013. Operating income was up 30.5% to $747.5 million from $572.9 million in 2013. Our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year as compared to an operating loss of $13.4 million in the same period the previous year. 
In the full year, expenses related to regulatory and litigation concerning our Monster Energy drinks were $20.6 million as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.9% in 2013 to 35.2% for the full 2014 year. Net income was $483.2 million, up 42.7% of a net income of $338.7 million in 2013, and diluted earnings per share increased 41.9% to $2.77 from $1.95 in 2013. 
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through January 24, 2015, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 7.6%; sales of Rockstar decreased by 4.2%; 5-Hour decreased by 3.8%; and AMP decreased by 10%. Sales of NOS increased by 38.8% and Full Throttle increased by 7.1%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, sales in the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 8.5% over the comparable period in 2014. Sales of Monster increased by 11.3% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 8.7% and NOS was up 42.4%. Rockstar was down 3.8%, 5-Hour was down 1.4%, and AMP was down 7.4%. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, Monster's market share of the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 0.9 of 1 point over the comparable period last -- a year ago to 34.8% against Red Bull's share, which was level with Monster's at 34.8%. Rockstar's share was lower at 7.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower than 8.8%, while NOS' share was higher at 4.3%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 14.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.6% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot energy was 22.2% higher.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 9.7% in the month of December 2014. Monster sales increased 1.7% and market share decreased 2.6 points to 32.6% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 8.7% and its market share decreased by 4.8% to 23 -- 9 points to 23.7%. Drivet100 market share increased 10 points to 17.8%, while Boost's market share decreased by 0.1 of 1 point to 16.4%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together decreased 3.4 points to 6.1%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended January 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.5% to 12.8% in Great Britain, and from 17.4% to 18.3% in France. In the 13-week period ended December 2014, Monster's market share in value as compared to the same period last year increased from 8% to 10.9% in Germany; from 7.4% to 7.9% in Belgium; from 5.2% to 5.9% in The Netherlands; and from 8.1% to 8.7% in Sweden. 
Monster's market sharing value for the 13 weeks ended January 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.4% to 18% in South Africa, and from 21.7% to 21.2% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks through December 28, 2014 from 24.5% to 29.2% increase. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen for the month of January 2015, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 14.4% as compared to 9.4% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of January grew from 4.6% to 5.2% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of January 2015, in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 29% to 32.6%. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 12.6% to $584.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 from $519.4 million in the same period in 2013. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 10.3% to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.1 billion in the same period in 2013. Contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 31.2% from $177.9 million to $232.5 million in the quarter and from $726.8 million to $908 million for the year. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.2% to $20.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 from $21.4 million for the same period in 2013 and decreased from $99.1 million for the 2013 year to $95.7 million for the full 2014 year. 
For the full year, contribution margin increased from a loss of $1 million in the prior year's fourth quarter to a profit of $0.8 million and from a loss of $1.7 million in 2013 to a profit of $3 million in 2014. For the 3-month ended December 31, gross sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represent a 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 8% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. 
Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in '13. Gross sales internationally represented 23% of sales, up from 22% in the same period a year ago. Other sales are 2% for the period was the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2014 amounted to $160.1 million compared to $137.9 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in sub-sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2014 in dollars were 17.5% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and Greece, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. 
Overall, our Western European and Africa divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and into 2014. Our EMEA division traded profitably during both the third and fourth quarters of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in effective tax rate of the company. Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 11.1% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America decreased 17.1% over the comparable 2013 fourth quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange differences and competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Columbian distributor. Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase. 
We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets, although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the third quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We are planning to produce Monster in India shortly. Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter were 4.1% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Other selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.3% in the quarter versus 10.8% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs were marginally higher in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. TDM MAT program costs were lower during the quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales. 
General and administrative expenses decreased 3.3%, although payroll costs were slightly higher, including general and administrative costs in the quarter was $1.2 million related to The Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. During the 2014 fourth quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $370.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $781.1 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased from $9.8 million to $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million. Days outstanding for account receivables were 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, and 40.1 days at December 31, 2013 as compared to 40.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $174.6 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 57.4 days at December 31, 2014, which was lower than the 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014. 
As discussed on the last call, we are currently in the process of launching Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy. Due to the strong response we received to our 2014 summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South Africa, we have converted that item into a permanent SKU in existing countries, in which it is being sold and are planning to launch it in additional European countries in 2015. 
Gross sales in January 2015, were 11.2% higher than in January 2014. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points North American international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 fourth quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the Energy category continues to grow and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 are gaining market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. 
Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers during 2014 and both distribution and sales of those lines are improving. We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines will continue to increase their contribution to sales throughout 2015.

Also, you will appreciate that their are severance fee is dependent on their sales in the 12 months, immediately preceding the termination. So it is in their interest, obviously, to continue increasing their sales out in order to maximizing their own severance payments, and we felt that by giving them the assurance that we would pick up all or buyback all several inventories that there was no reason for them to start trying to rationalize their inventory or try and cut down and only focus on the main SKUs and not carry the supporting brands. And we've had -- we think we had a good effect. This correspondence had a good effect. And we've really not experienced any noticeable disruption from the AB Distributors as compared to our other distributors. I think that continued to perform nicely, you can see that from the results and we are not seeing any despair or differences between the AB Distributors on the one side and Coke distributors or some of the independence on the other side. The trend that we had from these distributors before the notice has continued into the fourth quarter and continued even in the first couple of 2 months of this year. So we aren't seeing that, we are being able to manage that reasonably comfortably. Going forward, obviously, we will see how that goes. We're hoping that by giving the AB Distributors quite a lot of notice, being able to manage these inventory issues and pick up issues, will enable us to also make sure inventory is in place at the Coke plants and at the Coke branches so that when the change over occurs, they will be ready to go with the inventory as well.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.
As previously disclosed, in August 2014, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definite agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global energy drink category.
Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, the following issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company, and will transfer ownership of this worldwide Energy business to Monster, which in turn will translate its non-Energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company and its partners will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy late. We believe this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long-term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicate focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally.
We are actively engaged both in preparations for and the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. As previously reported, all necessary approvals and consents from the relevant antitrust authorities around the world have been obtained.
In anticipation of the closing of the transactions, to date Monster has transitioned approximately 84% of its targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners and an additional 5% will be transitioned during May 2015.
Thus far, such were accomplished with only minor interruptions, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many persons involved in the transition both on Monster's and Coke's perspective teams.
We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights for Monster Energy to such Bottlers after the closing. While the closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, we anticipate closing the transactions early in June 2015.
We are excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster Energy portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies, as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transactions close and will receive the funds to the company in terms of the agreement to return cash to our shareholders.
Turning to the first quarter results. We believe that the first quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted the domestically by the entity relating to the closing of the transactions and the transitioning of our brands in the U.S. from existing distributors to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, as well as internationally, due to the uncertainty inherent in the anticipated closing of the transactions.
At this time, we cannot quantify what impact the transactions, including the transitions, will have on our second quarter.
In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe shall be considered in assessing our performance in the quarter.
We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, gross sales for the 2015 first quarter were $670.4 million, an increase of 9.2% over gross sales in the comparable first quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 first quarter as reported was $626.8 million.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue, net sales for the 2015 first quarter were $587 million, 9.5% higher than net sales of $536.1 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $15 million on gross sales and approximately $12 million on net sales.
After adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 56.1% as compared to 53.5% for the comparable 2014 first quarter. The increasing gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweetness and other raw materials, as well as an increase in production efficiencies.
Excluding distributed costs of $206 million, operating expenses for the 2015 first quarter were $155.3 million as compared to $138.0 million in same quarter last year. Excluding both the acceleration of the deferred revenue and distributed termination costs, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter were 26.5% as compared to 25.7% in the same quarter last year. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales, excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, were 4.4% for the 2015 first quarter compared to 4.7% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, selling expenses, although higher in dollars as a percentage of net sales, were 10.6% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in cost of premiums and a $3.7 million increase in sponsorships. TDM and met program cost were lower in the quarter.
General and administered of cost as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter, excluding the acceleration of deferred revenues and termination costs of $206 million, were 11.4% as compared to 10.3% for the corresponding quarter last year.
Operating income after adjustment for acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs would have been 16.8% higher at $173.8 million as compared to $148.9 million in the same period last year.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs and tax effective basis, net income would have increased by 13.9% to $108.5 million from $95.3 million in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, as well as distributed to the termination cost, the effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter would have been approximately 38.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter adjusted for the previously discussed items was higher than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to a decrease in the company's domestic production deduction due to the exercise of certain stock options.
Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, as well as distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, earnings would have increased to $0.62 per diluted share, 13.8% higher than $0.55 per diluted share earned in the comparable quarter in 2014.
Results for the 2015 first quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning advertising, marketing, promotion in regions, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2015.
Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year.
Professional services and other transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction was $3.6 million. Also additional payroll taxes of $7.2 million were incurred following the exercise of certain stock options.
If in addition to making the adjustments discussed earlier, professional service costs relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the additional payroll taxes are excluded from operating costs, operating income would have been $184.6 million, 24% higher than operating income earned in the first quarter of 2014.
On that same basis, net income on a tax effective basis would have been $115.2 million or 21% higher than net income for the first quarter of 2014, while earnings per diluted share would have been $0.66 per diluted share, 20.9% higher than earnings per diluted share of $0.55 for the same quarter in 2014.
The effective regulatory related expenses on earnings per share is approximately $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter. Note also, there was a foreign exchange impact of net sales of approximately $12 million.
Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $141 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $144.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $113 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $115.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014.
As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15 million and $12 million, respectively.
Included in geographic sales reported in our sales for the company's military customers which were delivered in the United States in transit to the military in customers and overseas.
According to Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2015, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandises, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including Shots increased by 9.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased 13.7%. Sales for Rockstar increased by 8.8%. Sales of far increased by 0.4% and [indiscernible] decreased 12.2%. Sales of NOS increased 28.3%; and sales of [indiscernible] increased 4.3%.

We do want to point out that increased processing, as well as the trading up of SKUs of their flavor extensions by Red Bull to 12-ounce had the effect of increase in revenues per unit sold for Red Bull. We have assessed the increase in Red Bull processing that has took effect earlier this year, and we will be taking out processing of our product later this year.
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended April 25, 2015, Monster's market share of energy drink category including the community and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.0 points over the same period last year to 34.4% against Red Bull's share, which increased 1.9 points to 36.6%. Rockstar share was up 0.2 points at 7.2%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.5%; while NOS was higher at 3.9%.

The other month was 8.5% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot energy was 17.5% higher.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for 12 weeks ended April 4, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%; Monster sales were down 5% versus a year ago. I just wanted to point out that we are cycling on a  lot of innovations that have been introduced the first quarter last year.
Our market share decreased 2.2 points to 26.1% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4% and its market share increased 0.4 points to 37.5%. Rockstar's sales increased 26% and its market share increased to 2.5 points to 13.7%.
Another note is that it's just timing of promotions, we will be embarking on quite an extensive promotional campaign during the second trimester. Some of our competitors promotions this year were slotted in the first trimester.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 17.2% in the month of March 2015. Monster sales decreased 2.5%. Our market share decreased 6.5 points to 32.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 9.5% and its market share decreased by 5.9 points to 20%.
The [indiscernible] 100 market share increased 11.6 points to 20.9%, while booze market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.3%. [indiscernible] market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 0.6 points to 7.7%.
Nielsen's statistics for Mexico covers single month, which is a short period that may often be influenced positively or negatively by sales in the convenience change [indiscernible] which dominates the market. Sales in the convenience chain in turn to be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 more energy drink brand during a particular month.
Approximately such activities could have such a significant impact for the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value is compared to the same period last year grew from 10.1% to 12.1% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 18.5% in France; from 8% to 10.7% in Germany; from 7.5% to 8.2% in Belgium.

Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended February 2015, as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.3% to 17.3% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of March 2015 from 25.2% to 29.3% increase.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by the IRI and the EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.3% as compared to 9.4% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2015, grew from 4.3% to 4.7% as compared to the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of March 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 28% to 33.8%.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and the distributed termination costs, net sales for the DSD segment increased to 10% to $566 million and contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 20.1% to $223.9 million from $186.5 million in the 2014 first quarter.
Net sales for our DSD segment were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million due to foreign currency movement. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.6% to $21 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, from $21.8 million for the same period in 2014.
Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was negative by $0.04 -- sorry by about $4 million -- $0.04 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter positive of 2014.
Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2015 in dollars were 2% lower than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 14.7% higher than in the same period last year.
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Greece, Monster achieved sales guidance and continue to increase its market share.
Overall, our European and African divisions are now offering well and we have made good strides in achieving increases regional levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefit of strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and in 2014.
Our EMEA division traded positively during the first quarter. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in majority of markets in Europe and South Africa, continues to perform well as a permanent SKU and was launched in 5 additional markets in the first quarter of the 2015.
During the quarter, we also launched Mega Monster, a resealable 553 ml SKU of our original Monster Green Energy drink in a number of EMEA markets. Early indications show positive sales contribution from mega Monster.
Net sales in Asia-Pacific decreased 9.5% in dollars, but increased 1% in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in South America decreased 15%, 6.2% in local currency over the comparable period in 2014, mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitor price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Colombian distributor. Sales also decreased in Brazil ahead of the anticipated closing of the Coca-Cola transactions although our market share in March for Nielsen.
In Japan, net sales increased 11% in local currency. Japan contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. In Mexico, net sales increased 35% in dollars. Similarly, Mexico contributed meaningful operating profit in the first quarter of 2015.
We are continuing with our expansion strategy in the international markets but have deferred proposed launched in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that we are entering into with The Coca-Cola Company. We will address the implementation of such deferred launches following the closing of the transaction. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that our partnership with The Coca-Cola Company may result in additional local production opportunities for us and may accelerate our local production strategy.
Our original Monster Green Energy Drink continue to perform well and has experienced good growth as did our entire Ultra product line. Unfortunately, we experienced a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster product line. This issue has been addressed and the line has been reformulated. We are refreshing the packaging of that line as well. As a result, our sales at Muscle Monster during the quarter was substantially lower than the first quarter last year and obviously, negatively impacted our sales.
During the 2015 first quarter, no share repurchases were made and the board authorized share repurchase program. However, 2.2 million shares were purchased from employees during the quarter in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding tax as due.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $362.8 million compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $647.3 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $41.2 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million.
Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.4 days at March 31, 2015 and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 48.1 days at March 31, 2014. Inventories increased to $197.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014.
Average days of inventory was 69.1 days at March 31, 2015, which was higher than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 73.7 days at March 31, 2014.
We have now launched Ultra Citron, our [indiscernible] SKU in the Ultra product line and Rehab Peach Tea + Energy, which have been well received by consumers. Our repositioned juice and punch products continue to show healthy gains. We are planning to launch additional products later in 2015, but it is premature for us to discuss those products at this time.
We believe that the transitioning of a substantial majority of our targeted distribution rights in the U.S., effective April 6, 2015, orders by The Coca-Cola system to implement the transitions, the accounting for returns from terminated distributors, the timing of the transitions, as well as uncertainty with our independent international distributors, given the imminent implementation of the transaction, are among the factors that impacted our sales levels in March and April 2015. It is premature for us to finalize our April sales and to commit thereon at this time.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize the recent positive points, North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2015 first quarter gross margins in North America, as well as internationally, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2014. U.S. deals and market statistics show that the energy category continues to grow. The new additions in the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 continue to gain market share and contribute positively to the overall increase in the company's sales.
Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines have been positively received the distributors and consumers in both distribution and sales of those lines continue to improve.
We believe that our Monster Unleaded, Ultra Sunrise and Ultra Citron lines, as well as was Rehab Peach Tea + Energy will continue to increase their contribution to sales through 2015.
Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international brand expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Chile. We believe that the Coca-Cola transition, in particular a successful transition, will afford us ongoing opportunities in 2015 and beyond.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

I think international market has just been a little more affected. I think there are just a little bit more skepticism amongst the distributors and their anticipation of what the future will be and whether they will continue to distribute the brand. And I think that has affected their investment in the brand, investment in securing distribution and sales, and in general approach, I think [indiscernible]. With regard to the transition in the U.S., we think that the transition has gone relatively smoothly from a retailer point of view. There were a few disruptions, minor where the retailers weren't able in time to make changes or distributor make changes, so that in some cases product being taken into stores were still being shown as being supplied by the previous vendors. So there were some issues. But generally, we thought that the transition went well. But again, a lot of that will only come through to us with time. We've heard of small few instances, but obviously we don't hear of everything, except they're not in the first few weeks of taking place. I think that even to really understand the issues and the opportunities, is going to take some months to pan out and for us to be able to really make more sense of it. Just to comment on any doubtful things, I think will not be sensible and not accurate enough."

And there are obviously economic issues and factors as to whether we're happy making the change, if based on margin requirements and cost requirements. So there are a number of factors and we are working through those. But the U.S. was an easier transition to do in mass clearly, and it was the main focus for us to get done. The other focuses we've been -- to visit them, we traveled around them, we're starting negotiations with them. But many of them are -- don't know Monster, don't know the system. And each negotiation takes on its own course because of different factors that apply in each of these different countries. And this quite varies, there isn't a 1 formula fits all for the different countries. So that is taking a bit more time and we are going to have to work our way through it. Obviously, we are looking at that as positive point of view, we would like to transition substantial amount of that distribution, but that will pan out later in the year over the next 3 to 6 months."

We've got to see that for a little while until we resolve some of the pending regulator matters. With regard to the payroll taxes, again we think there maybe 1 or 2 quarters but that will also and become much more normalized. One of the other costs that we are or a couple of the other cost that was just mentioned that I did mention, the premiums was higher this quarter was we took premiums into our books in the first quarter. A lot of it designed or earmarked for second quarter premiums. So there was a slight switch of when you're going to see the benefit of it, but we needed in accordance with our policies. Also in sponsorships, there was an increase, which we think will level out over the year. What in certain types of sponsorships, we had allocated these in sponsorships over the period of the actual events due to certain changes in the way we are contracts with particular events. Now we are advertising those more spread over the 12-month period. So that had a bit of an effect of increasing costs in the first quarter because a lot of the events start towards the annual events start in the second quarter or early -- end of the first quarter. We also had an increase and we signed an agreement and should have made a sponsorship with UFC this year which had the effect of also increasing and coming into the first quarter. So those again, we think those will normalized somewhat and probably get us more in line with what we've been going in the future. What we don't know is how those effects -- those are all be effective once we obviously bring the KL brands because the whole model of the KL brands, different cost criteria and that may change things up a little bit."

We obviously, Germany isn't at the moment and that will be a decision if and when we change in Germany, which is likely and imminent. The opportunities also in the other big markets, which are sort of -- as a market where we've done the size of the energy category for probably premium. The market is very big for -- in energy, for example, in China, which we've mentioned before, is a really -- we think is a big future opportunity. But it's in a lower-priced product at the moment. And so whether the premium section and how, where we want to position our brand is still uncertain. We've not come to a final decision. But clearly, that is a market we're going to focus on. We do believe there's good opportunity to grow, much more than we have in a market like Brazil, which is also a big market. Obviously Japan, we are doing nicely. And so we're going to try and focus on the larger markets where we are already there. And then obviously, in newer markets, we will be -- we will go into, but we will be much authority, probably other than China, which we do regard as a priority for us. And we are looking at that and taking steps to actively look at the market and ascertain whether we get into that market. So I think that we will see some benefits, but we just got to get more information and have more time to meet all the bottlers. That's a pretty gigantic task when you look at -- there are a number of independent bottlers around the world in the Coke system, it's not a matter of getting together with half a dozen of them. And we are working our way through them at the moment and making good progress. But each country has its own issues. And one of the things that complicate international, which we believe is important for the long term, is we are looking, as in many cases when we're talking to distribution, to the bottlers there, we are also talking to them about production, local production, because we believe that will be important to reduce our costs and just as important to also get them more aligned with to be real partners and produced locally as well as sell locally. So those  -- production has its own issues and we need to deal with those, that just adds complexity. But ultimately, we'll get there and it will be in the long-term benefit to do it this way."

And in some case in some current countries, there may well be a need for backup or 2 production plants.

As previously disclosed, in August 2014, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definite agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category.
Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company, and will transfer ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster, which, in turn, will translate its non-Energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company and its partners will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally.
We are actively engaged both in preparations for and the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. As previously reported, all necessary approvals and consents from the relevant antitrust authorities around the world have been obtained. In anticipation of the closing of the transactions, to date, Monster has transitioned approximately 84% of its targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, and an additional 5% will be transitioned during May 2015.
Thus far, such transitions were accomplished with only minor interruptions, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many persons involved in the transition, both on Monster's and Coke's respective teams.
We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights for Monster Energy to such Bottlers after the closing. While the closing of the transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, we anticipate closing the transactions early in June 2015.
We are excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company Energy brands to our Monster Energy portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transactions close and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return cash to our shareholders.
Turning to the first quarter results. We believe that the first quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted domestically by the entity [ph] relating to the closing of the transactions and the transitioning of our brands in the U.S. from existing distributors to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, as well as internationally, due to the uncertainty inherent in the anticipated closing of the transactions.
At this time, we cannot quantify what impact the transactions, including the transitions, will have on our second quarter.
In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in the quarter. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, gross sales for the 2015 first quarter were $670.4 million, an increase of 9.2% over gross sales in the comparable first quarter of 2014.
Net sales in the 2015 first quarter, as reported, was $626.8 million. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue, net sales for the 2015 first quarter were $587 million, 9.5% higher than net sales of $536.1 million in the same period last year.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $15 million on gross sales and approximately $12 million on net sales.
After adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 56.1% as compared to 53.5% for the comparable 2014 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweetness and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies.
Excluding distributed termination costs of $206 million, operating expenses for the 2015 first quarter were $155.3 million as compared to $138.0 million in same quarter last year. Excluding both the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter were 26.5% as compared to 25.7% in the same quarter last year. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales, excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, were 4.4% for the 2015 first quarter compared to 4.7% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, selling expenses, although higher in dollars, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.6% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in cost of premiums and a $3.7 million increase in sponsorships. TDM and MAT program costs were lower during the quarter.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter, excluding the acceleration of deferred revenues and distributed termination costs of $206 million, were 11.4% as compared to 10.3% for the corresponding quarter last year.
Operating income after adjustment for acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs would have been 16.8% higher at $173.8 million as compared to $148.9 million in the same period last year.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, net income would have increased by 13.9% to $108.5 million from $95.3 million in the same quarter last year.
Excluding acceleration deferred revenue as well as distributed termination cost, the effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter would have been approximately 38.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter adjusted for the previously discussed items was higher than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to a decrease in the company's domestic production deduction due to the exercise of certain stock options.
Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue as well as distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, earnings would have increased to $0.62 per diluted share, 13.8% higher than $0.55 per diluted share earned in the comparable quarter in 2014.
Results for the 2015 first quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2015.
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year.
Professional services and other transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction was $3.6 million. Also, additional payroll taxes of $7.2 million were incurred following the exercise of certain stock options.
If in addition to making the adjustments discussed earlier, professional service costs relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the additional payroll taxes are excluded from operating costs, operating income would have been $184.6 million, 24% higher than operating income earned in the first quarter of 2014. On that same basis, net income on a tax effective basis would have been $115.2 million or 21% higher than net income for the first quarter of 2014, while earnings per diluted share would have been $0.66 per diluted share, 20.9% higher than earnings per diluted share of $0.55 for the same quarter in 2014.
The effective regulatory-related expenses on earnings per share is approximately $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter. Note also, there was a foreign exchange impact of net sales of approximately $12 million.
Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $141 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $144.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $113 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $115.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014.
As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15 million and $12 million, respectively. Included in geographic sales reported are our sales for the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
According to Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2015, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 9.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased 13.7%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 8.8%; sales of 5-Hour increased by 0.4%; and AMP decreased 12.2%. Sales of NOS increased 28.3%; and sales of Full Throttle increased 4.3%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 10.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.3% over the same period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.5%. NOS was up 21.8%; Rockstar was up 13.2%; 5-Hour was up 1.3%; and AMP was down 17%.
We do want to point out that increased processing as well as the trading-up of SKUs of their flavor extensions by Red Bull to 12-ounce had the effect of increase in revenues per unit sold for Red Bull. We have assessed the increase in Red Bull processing that has took effect earlier this year, and we will be taking out processing of our products later this year.
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended April 25, 2015, Monster's market share of Energy Drink category in the community and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.0 points over the same period last year to 34.4% against Red Bull's share, which increased 1.9 points to 36.6%. Rockstar's share was up point -- 0.2 points at 7.2%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.5%, while NOS's was higher at 3.9%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 8.5% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 17.1% higher.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended April 4, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were down 5% versus a year ago. I just want to point out that we are cycling on a lot of innovation that we introduced the first quarter last year.
Our market share decreased 2.2 points to 26.1% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 37.5%. Rockstar's sales increased 26%, and its market share increased to 2.5 points to 13.7%.
Another note is that it's just timing of promotions. We will be embarking on quite an extensive promotional campaign during the second trimester. Some of our competitors' promotions this year were slotted in the first trimester.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 17.2% in the month of March 2015. Monster sales decreased 2.5%. Our market share decreased 6.5 points to 32.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 9.5%, and its market share decreased by 5.9 points to 20%. Vive 100's market share increased 11.6 points to 20.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.3%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 0.6 points to 7.7%.
Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy Drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact for the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.1% to 12.1% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 18.5% in France; from 8% to 10.7% in Germany; from 7.5% to 8.2% in Belgium. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.8% to 9.2% in Sweden; from 5% to 5.6% in the Netherlands; and from 21.2% to 21.3% in Spain.
Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended February 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.3% to 17.3% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of March 2015 from 25.2% to 29.3% in Greece.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.3% as compared to 9.4% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2015, grew from 4.3% to 4.7% as compared to the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of March 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 28% to 33.8%.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and the distributed termination costs, net sales for the DSD segment increased 10% to $566 million, and contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 20.1% to $223.9 million from $186.5 million in the 2014 first quarter.
Net sales for our DSD segment were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million due to foreign currency movement. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.6% to $21 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, from $21.8 million for the same period in 2014. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was negative by $0.04 -- I'm sorry, by $4 million -- $0.04 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter positive of 2014.
Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2015 in dollars were 2% lower than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 14.7% higher than in the same period last year.
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, in particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Greece. Monster achieved sales guidance and continue to increase its market share.
Overall, our Western European and African divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and in 2014.
Our EMEA division traded positively during the first quarter. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of markets in Europe and South Africa, continues to perform well as a permanent SKU and was launched in 5 additional markets in the first quarter of 2015.
During the quarter, we also launched Mega Monster, a resealable 553 ml SKU of our original Monster Green Energy drink in a number of EMEA markets. Early indications show positive sales contribution from Mega Monster.
Net sales in Asia-Pacific decreased 9.5% in dollars but increased 1% in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in South America decreased 15%, 6.2% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014. Mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitor price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Colombian distributor, sales also decreased in Brazil ahead of the anticipated closing of the Coca-Cola transactions although our market share in March increased for Nielsen.
In Japan, net sales increased 11% in local currency. Japan contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. In Mexico, net sales increased 35% in dollars. Similarly, Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015.
We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets but have deferred proposed launches in certain countries in the -- for the future following the strategic partnership that we are entering into with The Coca-Cola Company. We will address the implementation of such deferred launches following the closing of the transactions. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that our partnership with The Coca-Cola Company may result in additional local production opportunities for us and may accelerate our local production strategy.
Our original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to perform well and experienced good growth as did our entire Ultra product line. Unfortunately, we experienced a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster product line. This issue has been addressed, and the line has been reformulated. We are refreshing the packaging of that line as well. As a result, of our ever [ph] sales at Muscle Monster during the quarter was substantially lower than the first quarter of last year and, obviously, negatively impacted our sales.
During the 2015 first quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. However, 20 -- I'm sorry, 2.2 million shares were purchased from employees during the quarter in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding tax as due.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $362.8 million compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $647.3 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $41.2 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million.
Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.4 days at March 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 48.1 days at March 31, 2014. Inventories increased to $197.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014.
Average days of inventory was 69.1 days at March 31, 2015, which was higher than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 73.7 days at March 31, 2014.
We have now launched Ultra Citron, our fruity SKU in the Ultra product line and Rehab Peach Tea + Energy, which have been well received by consumers. Our repositioned juice and punch products continue to show healthy gains. We are planning to launch additional products later in 2015, but it is premature for us to discuss those products at this time.
We believe that the transitioning of a substantial majority of our targeted distribution rights in the U.S., effective April 6, 2015, orders by the Coca-Cola system to implement the transitions, the accounting for returns from terminated distributors, the timing of the transitions as well as uncertainty with our independent international distributors given the imminent implementation of the transaction, are among the factors that impacted our sales levels in March and April 2015. It is premature for us to finalize our April sales and to commit thereon at this time.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize the recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2015 first quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2014. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 continue to gain market share and contribute positively to the overall increase in the company's sales.
Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines have been positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to improve. We believe that our Monster Unleaded, Ultra Sunrise and Ultra Citron lines as well as was Rehab Peach Tea + Energy will continue to increase their contribution to sales through 2015.
Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international brand expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Chile. We believe that the Coca-Cola transition, particularly a successful transition, will afford us ongoing opportunities in 2015 and beyond.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

I think international markets have just been a little more affected. I think there's just a little more skepticism amongst the distributors and anticipation of what the future will be and whether they will continue to be -- distribute the brand. And I think that has affected their investment in the brand, investment in securing distribution and sales and, in general approach, I think in attitude. With regard to the transition to the U.S., we think that the transition has gone relatively smoothly from a retailer point of view. There were a few disruptions, minor where retailers hadn't -- weren't able in time to make changes or the distributor to make changes, so that, in some cases, products being taken into stores were still being shown as being supplied by the previous vendors, so there were some issues. But generally, we thought that the transition went well. But again, a lot of that will only come through to us with time. We've heard of small -- a few instances, but obviously, we don't hear of everything, except they're not in the first few weeks of a taking place. So I think that even to really understand the issues and the opportunities, it's going to take some months to pan out and be -- for us to be able to really make more sense of it. Just to comment on any doubtful things, I think would not be sensible and not accurate enough."

And there are also, obviously, economic issues and factors as to whether we are happy making the change, if -- based on margin requirements and cost requirements. So there are a number of factors, and we are working through those. But the U.S. was an easier transition in -- to do in mass clearly and was the main focus for us to get done. The other focuses, we've been -- to visit them, we've traveled around them, we're starting negotiations with them. But many of them are -- don't know Monster, don't know the system. And it's -- and each negotiation takes on its own course because of different factors that apply in each of these different countries. And this quite varies. There isn't a 1 formula fits all for the different countries. So that is taking a bit more time, and we're going to have to work our way through it. Obviously, we are looking at that as -- on a positive point of view, we like to transition substantial amount of that distribution, but that will pan out later in the year over the next 3 to 6 months."

One of the other costs that we -- or a couple of the other costs that I just mentioned, that I did mention, the premiums was high this quarter. What happened was we took premiums into our books in the first quarter. A lot of it designed or earmarked for second quarter premiums. So there was a slight switch in when you're going to see the benefit of it, but is this the right -- we needed to account with an accordance with our policies. Also, in the -- in sponsorships, there was a -- there was an increase, which we think will level out over the year. What -- in certain types of sponsorships, we had allocated these sponsorships over the period of the actual events due to certain changes in the way we are contracts with the -- particular events. Now we are advertising those more spread over the 12-month period. So that had a bit of an effect of increasing costs in the first quarter because a lot of the events start towards -- the annual events start towards the second quarter or early than that -- end of the first quarter. We also had an increase, and we signed an agreement, a sort of major sponsorship with UFC this year, which had the effect of also increasing and coming into the first quarter. So those -- again, we think those will normalize somewhat and probably get us more in line with what we've been going in the future. What we don't know is how those effects will -- those will all be effective once we obviously bring in the KO brands with -- because the whole model for the KO brands will be a concentrate model.

The opportunities also in the other big markets, which are sort of -- as a market where we've done with the size of the Energy category for probably premium. The market is very big for -- in Energy, for example, in China, which we've mentioned before, is a really big -- we think is a big future opportunity. But it's in a lower-priced product at the moment. And so whether the premium section and how, where we want to position our brand is still uncertain, we've not come to a final decision. But clearly, that is a market we're going to focus on. We do believe there's good opportunity to grow much more than we have in a market like Brazil, which is also a big market. Obviously Japan, we're doing nicely. And so we're going to try and focus on the larger markets where we're already there. And then obviously, in newer markets, we will be -- we will go into, but it wouldn't be as much authority, probably other than China, which we do regard as a priority for us. And we are looking at that and taking steps to actively look at the market and ascertain when we can get into that market. So I think that we will see some benefits, but we just got to get more information and have more time to meet with all the bottlers. That's a pretty gigantic task when you look at -- there are a number of independent bottlers around the world in the Coke system. It's not a matter of getting together with a half a dozen of them. And we are working our way through them at the moment and making good progress. But each country has its own issues. And one of the things that complicate international, which we believe is important for the long term, is we are looking, as in many cases when we're talking to distribution, to the bottlers there, we are also talking to them about production, local production because we believe that will be important to reduce our costs. And then just important to also get them more aligned with us to be real partners and produce locally and -- as well as sell locally. So -- production has its own issues, and we need to deal with those things. That just adds complexity. But ultimately, we'll get there, and we believe it will be in the long-term benefit to do it this way."

Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.

As previously disclosed, in August 2014, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category.
Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company, and will transfer ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster, which, in turn, will transfer its non-Energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company and its partners will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally.
We are actively engaged both in preparations for and the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. As previously reported, all necessary approvals and consents from the relevant antitrust authorities around the world have been obtained. In anticipation of the closing of the transactions, to date, Monster has transitioned approximately 84% of its targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, and an additional 5% will be transitioned during May 2015.
Thus far, such transitions were accomplished with only minor interruptions, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many persons involved in the transition, both on Monster's and Coke's respective teams.
We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights for Monster Energy to such Bottlers after the closing. While the closing of the transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, we anticipate closing the transactions early in June 2015.
We are excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company Energy brands to our Monster Energy portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transactions close and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return cash to our shareholders.
Turning to the first quarter results. We believe that the first quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted domestically by the events relating to the closing of the transactions and the transitioning of our brands in the U.S. from existing distributors to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, as well as internationally, due to the uncertainty inherent in the anticipated closing of the transactions.
At this time, we cannot quantify what impact the transactions, including the transitions, will have on our second quarter.
In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in the quarter. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, gross sales for the 2015 first quarter were $670.4 million, an increase of 9.2% over gross sales in the comparable first quarter of 2014.
Net sales in the 2015 first quarter, as reported, was $626.8 million. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue, net sales for the 2015 first quarter were $587 million, 9.5% higher than net sales of $536.1 million in the same period last year.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $15 million on gross sales and approximately $12 million on net sales.
After adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 56.1% as compared to 53.5% for the comparable 2014 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweeteners and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies.
Excluding distributed termination costs of $206 million, operating expenses for the 2015 first quarter were $155.3 million as compared to $138.0 million in same quarter last year. Excluding both the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter were 26.5% as compared to 25.7% in the same quarter last year. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales, excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, were 4.4% for the 2015 first quarter compared to 4.7% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, selling expenses, although higher in dollars, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.6% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in cost of premiums and a $3.7 million increase in sponsorships. TDM and MAT program costs were lower during the quarter.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter, excluding the acceleration of deferred revenues and distributed termination costs of $206 million, were 11.4% as compared to 10.3% for the corresponding quarter last year.
Operating income after adjustment for acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs would have been 16.8% higher at $173.8 million as compared to $148.9 million in the same period last year.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, net income would have increased by 13.9% to $108.5 million from $95.3 million in the same quarter last year.
Excluding acceleration deferred revenue as well as distributed termination cost, the effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter would have been approximately 38.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter adjusted for the previously discussed items was higher than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to a decrease in the company's domestic production deduction due to the exercise of certain stock options.
Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue as well as distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, earnings would have increased to $0.62 per diluted share, 13.8% higher than $0.55 per diluted share earned in the comparable quarter in 2014.
Results for the 2015 first quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2015.
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year.
Professional services and other transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction was $3.6 million. Also, additional payroll taxes of $7.2 million were incurred following the exercise of certain stock options.
If in addition to making the adjustments discussed earlier, professional service costs relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the additional payroll taxes are excluded from operating costs, operating income would have been $184.6 million, 24% higher than operating income earned in the first quarter of 2014. On that same basis, net income on a tax effective basis would have been $115.2 million or 21% higher than net income for the first quarter of 2014, while earnings per diluted share would have been $0.66 per diluted share, 20.9% higher than earnings per diluted share of $0.55 for the same quarter in 2014.
The effective regulatory-related expenses on earnings per share is approximately $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter. Note also, there was a foreign exchange impact of net sales of approximately $12 million.
Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $141 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $144.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $113 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $115.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014.
As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15 million and $12 million, respectively. Included in geographic sales reported are our sales for the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
According to Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2015, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 9.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased 13.7%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 8.8%; sales of 5-Hour increased by 0.4%; and AMP decreased 12.2%. Sales of NOS increased 28.3%; and sales of Full Throttle increased 4.3%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 10.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.3% over the same period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.5%. NOS was up 21.8%; Rockstar was up 13.2%; 5-Hour was up 1.3%; and AMP was down 17%.
We do want to point out that increased processing as well as the trading-up of SKUs of their flavor extensions by Red Bull to 12-ounce had the effect of increasing revenues per unit sold for Red Bull. We have assessed the increase in Red Bull processing that has took effect earlier this year, and we will be taking up processing of our products later this year.
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended April 25, 2015, Monster's market share of Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.0 points over the same period last year to 34.4% against Red Bull's share, which increased 1.9 points to 36.6%. Rockstar's share was up point -- 0.2 points at 7.2%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.5%, while NOS's was higher at 3.9%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 8.5% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 17.1% higher.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended April 4, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were down 5% versus a year ago. I just want to point out that we are cycling on a lot of innovation that we introduced the first quarter last year.
Our market share decreased 2.2 points to 26.1% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 37.5%. Rockstar's sales increased 26%, and its market share increased to 2.5 points to 13.7%.
Another note is that it's just timing of promotions. We will be embarking on quite an extensive promotional campaign during the second trimester. Some of our competitors' promotions this year were slotted in the first trimester.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 17.2% in the month of March 2015. Monster sales decreased 2.5%. Our market share decreased 6.5 points to 32.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 9.5%, and its market share decreased by 5.9 points to 20%. Vive 100's market share increased 11.6 points to 20.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.3%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 0.6 points to 7.7%.
Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy Drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.1% to 12.1% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 18.5% in France; from 8% to 10.7% in Germany; from 7.5% to 8.2% in Belgium. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.8% to 9.2% in Sweden; from 5% to 5.6% in the Netherlands; and from 21.2% to 21.3% in Spain.
Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended February 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.3% to 17.3% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of March 2015 from 25.2% to 29.3% in Greece.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.3% as compared to 9.4% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2015, grew from 4.3% to 4.7% as compared to the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of March 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 28% to 33.8%.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and the distributed termination costs, net sales for the DSD segment increased 10% to $566 million, and contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 20.1% to $223.9 million from $186.5 million in the 2014 first quarter.
Net sales for our DSD segment were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million due to foreign currency movement. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.6% to $21 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, from $21.8 million for the same period in 2014. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was negative by $0.04 -- I'm sorry, by $4 million -- $0.04 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter positive of 2014.
Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2015 in dollars were 2% lower than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 14.7% higher than in the same period last year.
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, in particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Greece. Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share.
Overall, our Western European and African divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and in 2014.
Our EMEA division traded positively during the first quarter. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of markets in Europe and South Africa, continues to perform well as a permanent SKU and was launched in 5 additional markets in the first quarter of 2015.
During the quarter, we also launched Mega Monster, a resealable 553 ml SKU of our original Monster Green Energy drink in a number of EMEA markets. Early indications show positive sales contribution from Mega Monster.
Net sales in Asia-Pacific decreased 9.5% in dollars but increased 1% in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in South America decreased 15%, 6.2% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014. Mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitor price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Colombian distributor, sales also decreased in Brazil ahead of the anticipated closing of the Coca-Cola transactions although our market share in March increased for Nielsen.
In Japan, net sales increased 11% in local currency. Japan contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. In Mexico, net sales increased 35% in dollars. Similarly, Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015.
We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets but have deferred proposed launches in certain countries in the -- for the future following the strategic partnership that we are entering into with The Coca-Cola Company. We will address the implementation of such deferred launches following the closing of the transactions. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that our partnership with The Coca-Cola Company may result in additional local production opportunities for us and may accelerate our local production strategy.
Our original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to perform well and experienced good growth as did our entire Ultra product line. Unfortunately, we experienced a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster product line. This issue has been addressed, and the line has been reformulated. We are refreshing the packaging of that line as well. As a result, however, sales at Muscle Monster during the quarter was substantially lower than the first quarter of last year and, obviously, negatively impacted our sales.
During the 2015 first quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. However, 20 -- I'm sorry, 2.2 million shares were purchased from employees during the quarter in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding tax as due.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $362.8 million compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $647.3 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $41.2 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million.
Days outstanding for accounts receivables were at 46.4 days at March 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 48.1 days at March 31, 2014. Inventories increased to $197.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014.
Average days of inventory was 69.1 days at March 31, 2015, which was higher than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 73.7 days at March 31, 2014.
We have now launched Ultra Citron, our fifth SKU in the Ultra product line and Rehab Peach Tea + Energy, which have been well received by consumers. Our repositioned juice and punch products continue to show healthy gains. We are planning to launch additional products later in 2015, but it is premature for us to discuss those products at this time.
We believe that the transitioning of a substantial majority of our targeted distribution rights in the U.S., effective April 6, 2015, orders by the Coca-Cola system to implement the transitions, the accounting for returns from terminated distributors, the timing of the transitions as well as uncertainty with our independent international distributors given the imminent implementation of the transaction, are among the factors that impacted our sales levels in March and April 2015. It is premature for us to finalize our April sales and to commit thereon at this time.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize the recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2015 first quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2014. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 continue to gain market share and contribute positively to the overall increase in the company's sales.
Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines have been positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to improve. We believe that our Monster Unleaded, Ultra Sunrise and Ultra Citron lines as well as was Rehab Peach Tea + Energy will continue to increase their contribution to sales through 2015.
Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international brand expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Chile. We believe that the Coca-Cola transition, particularly a successful transition, will afford us ongoing opportunities in 2015 and beyond.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And you've obviously highlighted the opportunity in the vending and specialty channels. Can we see those channels getting more traction more quickly? And then in international market, it sounds like the disruptions related to just the pending transition is perhaps a little bit more pronounced maybe than the U.S. markets. So can you verify if that is the appropriate reads that we should think about at this point? And are there any sort of any big markets?

I think international markets have just been a little more affected. I think there's just a little more skepticism amongst the distributors and anticipation of what the future will be and whether they will continue to be -- distribute the brand. And I think that has affected their investment in the brand, investment in securing distribution and sales and, in general approach, I think in attitude. With regard to the transition to the U.S., we think that the transition has gone relatively smoothly from a retailer point of view. There were a few disruptions, minor where retailers hadn't -- weren't able in time to make changes or the distributor to make changes, so that, in some cases, products being taken into stores were still being shown as being supplied by the previous vendors, so there were some issues. But generally, we thought that the transition went well. But again, a lot of that will only come through to us with time. We've heard of small -- a few instances, but obviously, we don't hear of everything, certainly not in the first few weeks of it taking place. So I think that even to really understand the issues and the opportunities, is going to take some months to pan out and be -- for us to be able to really make more sense of it. Just to comment on any doubtful things, I think would not be sensible and not accurate enough."

And there are also, obviously, economic issues and factors as to whether we are happy making the change, if -- based on margin requirements and cost requirements. So there are a number of factors, and we are working through those. But the U.S. was an easier transition in -- to do in mass clearly and was the main focus for us to get done. The other focuses, we've been -- to visit them, we've traveled around them, we're starting negotiations with them. But many of them are -- don't know Monster, don't know the system. And it's -- and each negotiation takes on its own course because of different factors that apply in each of these different countries. And this quite varies. There isn't a 1 formula fits all for the different countries. So that is taking a bit more time, and we're going to have to work our way through it. Obviously, we are looking at that as -- on a positive point of view, we would like to transition substantial amount of that distribution, but that will pan out later in the year over the next 3 to 6 months."

With regard to the payroll taxes, again, we think that there may be 1 or 2 quarters, but that generally will also I think regulate -- might disappear and become much more normalized. One of the other costs that we -- or a couple of the other costs that I just mentioned, that I did mention, the premiums was high this quarter. What happened was we took premiums into our books in the first quarter. A lot of it designed or earmarked for second quarter premiums. So there was a slight switch in when you're going to see the benefit of it, but is this the right -- we needed to account with an accordance with our policies. Also, in the -- in sponsorships, there was a -- there was an increase, which we think will level out over the year. What -- in certain types of sponsorships, we had allocated these sponsorships over the period of the actual events due to certain changes in the way we -- our contracts with the -- particular events. Now we are amortizing those more spread over the 12-month period. So that had a bit of an effect of increasing costs in the first quarter because a lot of the events start towards -- the annual events start towards the second quarter or earlier than that -- end of the first quarter. We also had an increase in -- we signed an agreement, a sort of major sponsorship with UFC this year, which had the effect of also increasing and coming into the first quarter. So those -- again, we think those will normalize somewhat and probably get us more in line with what we've been going in the future. What we don't know is how those effects will -- those will all be effective once we obviously bring in the KO brands with -- because the whole model for the KO brands will be a concentrate model. There'd be different cost criteria, and that may change things up a little bit."

Those markets won't -- obviously GB and Spain are with the same Coca-Cola Bottlers. We -- obviously, Germany isn't at the moment, and that will be a decision on -- if and when we change in Germany, which is likely and imminent. The opportunities also in the other big markets, which are sort of -- as a market but we don't know the size of the Energy category for probably premium. The market is very big for -- in Energy, for example, in China, which we've mentioned before, is a really big -- we think is a big future opportunity. But it's in a lower-priced product at the moment. And so whether the premium section and how, where we want to position our brand is still uncertain and we've not come to a final decision. But clearly, that is a market we're going to focus on. We do believe there's good opportunity to grow much more than we have in a market like Brazil, which is also a big market. Obviously Japan, we're doing nicely. And so we're going to try and focus on the larger markets where we're already there. And then obviously, in newer markets, we will be -- we will go into, but it wouldn't be as much authority, probably other than China, which we do regard as a priority for us. And we are looking at that and taking steps to actively look at the market and ascertain when we can get into that market. So I think that we will see some benefits, but we just got to get more information and have more time to meet with all the bottlers. That's a pretty gigantic task when you look at -- there are a number of independent bottlers around the world in the Coke system. It's not a matter of getting together with a half a dozen of them. And we are working our way through them at the moment and making good progress. But each country has its own issues. And one of the things that complicate international, which we believe is important for the long term, is we are looking, as in many cases when we're talking to distribution, to the bottlers there, we are also talking to them about production, local production because we believe that will be important to reduce our costs. And then just important to also get them more aligned with us to be real partners and produce locally and -- as well as sell locally. So -- production has its own issues, and we need to deal with those things. That just adds complexity. But ultimately, we'll get there, and we believe it will be in the long-term benefit to do it this way."

And in some case in countries, there may well be a need for backup or 2 production plants. So again, it depends on the country. It depends on the circumstances, but there is a really good appetite from the Coke bottlers who are enthusiastic about wanting to do production and -- which is very beneficial for us.

As previously disclosed, in August 2014, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category.
Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company, and will transfer ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster, which, in turn, will transfer its non-Energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally.
We are actively engaged both in preparations for and the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. As previously reported, all necessary approvals and consents from the relevant antitrust authorities around the world have been obtained. In anticipation of the closing of the transactions, to date, Monster has transitioned approximately 84% of its targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, and an additional 5% will be transitioned during May 2015.
Thus far, such transitions were accomplished with only minor interruptions, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many persons involved in the transition, both on Monster's and Coke's respective teams.
We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights for Monster Energy to such Bottlers after the closing. While the closing of the transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, we anticipate closing the transactions early in June 2015.
We are excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company Energy brands to our Monster Energy portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transactions close and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return cash to our shareholders.
Turning to the first quarter results. We believe that the first quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted domestically by events relating to the closing of the transactions and the transitioning of our brands in the U.S. from existing distributors to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, as well as internationally, due to the uncertainty inherent in the anticipated closing of the transactions.
At this time, we cannot quantify what impact the transactions, including the transitions, will have on our second quarter.
In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in the quarter. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, gross sales for the 2015 first quarter were $670.4 million, an increase of 9.2% over gross sales in the comparable first quarter of 2014.
Net sales in the 2015 first quarter, as reported, was $626.8 million. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue, net sales for the 2015 first quarter were $587 million, 9.5% higher than net sales of $536.1 million in the same period last year.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $15 million on gross sales and approximately $12 million on net sales.
After adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 56.1% as compared to 53.5% for the comparable 2014 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweeteners and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies.
Excluding distributed termination costs of $206 million, operating expenses for the 2015 first quarter were $155.3 million as compared to $138.0 million in same quarter last year. Excluding both the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter were 26.5% as compared to 25.7% in the same quarter last year. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales, excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, were 4.4% for the 2015 first quarter compared to 4.7% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, selling expenses, although higher in dollars, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.6% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in cost of premiums and a $3.7 million increase in sponsorships. TDM and MAT program costs were lower during the quarter.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter, excluding the acceleration of deferred revenues and distributed termination costs of $206 million, were 11.4% as compared to 10.3% for the corresponding quarter last year.
Operating income after adjustment for acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs would have been 16.8% higher at $173.8 million as compared to $148.9 million in the same period last year.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, net income would have increased by 13.9% to $108.5 million from $95.3 million in the same quarter last year.
Excluding acceleration deferred revenue as well as distributed termination cost, the effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter would have been approximately 38.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter adjusted for the previously discussed items was higher than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to a decrease in the company's domestic production deduction due to the exercise of certain stock options.
Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue as well as distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, earnings would have increased to $0.62 per diluted share, 13.8% higher than $0.55 per diluted share earned in the comparable quarter in 2014.
Results for the 2015 first quarter continue to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2015.
Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year.
Professional services and other transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction was $3.6 million. Also, additional payroll taxes of $7.2 million were incurred following the exercise of certain stock options.
If in addition to making the adjustments discussed earlier, professional service costs relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the additional payroll taxes are excluded from operating costs, operating income would have been $184.6 million, 24% higher than operating income earned in the first quarter of 2014. On that same basis, net income on a tax effective basis would have been $115.2 million or 21% higher than net income for the first quarter of 2014, while earnings per diluted share would have been $0.66 per diluted share, 20.9% higher than earnings per diluted share of $0.55 for the same quarter in 2014.
The effective regulatory-related expenses on earnings per share is approximately $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter. Note also, there was a foreign exchange impact of net sales of approximately $12 million.
Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $141 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $144.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $113 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $115.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014.
As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15 million and $12 million, respectively. Included in geographic sales reported are our sales for the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.
According to Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2015, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 9.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased 13.7%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 8.8%; sales of 5-Hour increased by 0.4%; and AMP decreased 12.2%. Sales of NOS increased 28.3%; and sales of Full Throttle increased 4.3%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 10.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.3% over the same period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.5%. NOS was up 21.8%; Rockstar was up 13.2%; 5-Hour was up 1.3%; and AMP was down 17%.
We do want to point out that increased processing as well as the trading-up of SKUs of their flavor extensions by Red Bull to 12-ounce had the effect of increasing revenues per unit sold for Red Bull. We have assessed the increase in Red Bull processing that has took effect earlier this year, and we will be taking up processing of our products later this year.
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended April 25, 2015, Monster's market share of Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.0 points over the same period last year to 34.4% against Red Bull's share, which increased 1.9 points to 36.6%. Rockstar's share was up point -- 0.2 points at 7.2%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.5%, while NOS' was higher at 3.9%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 8.5% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 17.1% higher.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended April 4, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were down 5% versus a year ago. I just want to point out that we are cycling on a lot of innovation that we introduced the first quarter last year.
Our market share decreased 2.2 points to 26.1% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 37.5%. Rockstar's sales increased 26%, and its market share increased to 2.5 points to 13.7%.
Another note is that it's just timing of promotions. We will be embarking on quite an extensive promotional campaign during the second trimester. Some of our competitors' promotions this year were slotted in the first trimester.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 17.2% in the month of March 2015. Monster sales decreased 2.5%. Our market share decreased 6.5 points to 32.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 9.5%, and its market share decreased by 5.9 points to 20%. Vive 100's market share increased 11.6 points to 20.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.3%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 0.6 points to 7.7%.
Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy Drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.1% to 12.1% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 18.5% in France; from 8% to 10.7% in Germany; from 7.5% to 8.2% in Belgium. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.8% to 9.2% in Sweden; from 5% to 5.6% in the Netherlands; and from 21.2% to 21.3% in Spain.
Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended February 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.3% to 17.3% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of March 2015 from 25.2% to 29.3% in Greece.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.3% as compared to 9.4% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2015, grew from 4.3% to 4.7% as compared to the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of March 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 28% to 33.8%.
Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and the distributed termination costs, net sales for the DSD segment increased 10% to $566 million, and contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 20.1% to $223.9 million from $186.5 million in the 2014 first quarter.
Net sales for our DSD segment were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million due to foreign currency movement. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.6% to $21 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, from $21.8 million for the same period in 2014. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was negative by $0.04 -- I'm sorry, by $4 million -- $0.04 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter positive of 2014.
Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2015 in dollars were 2% lower than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 14.7% higher than in the same period last year.
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, in particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Greece. Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share.
Overall, our Western European and African divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and in 2014.
Our EMEA division traded profitably during the first quarter. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of markets in Europe and South Africa, continues to perform well as a permanent SKU and was launched in 5 additional markets in the first quarter of 2015.
During the quarter, we also launched Mega Monster, a resealable 553 ml SKU of our original Monster Green Energy drink in a number of EMEA markets. Early indications show positive sales contribution from Mega Monster.
Net sales in Asia-Pacific decreased 9.5% in dollars but increased 1% in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in South America decreased 15%, 6.2% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014. Mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitor price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Colombian distributor, sales also decreased in Brazil ahead of the anticipated closing of the Coca-Cola transactions although our market share in March increased for Nielsen.
In Japan, net sales increased 11% in local currency. Japan contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. In Mexico, net sales increased 35% in dollars. Similarly, Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015.
We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets but have deferred proposed launches in certain countries in the -- for the future following the strategic partnership that we are entering into with The Coca-Cola Company. We will address the implementation of such deferred launches following the closing of the transactions. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that our partnership with The Coca-Cola Company may result in additional local production opportunities for us and may accelerate our local production strategy.
Our original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to perform well and experienced good growth as did our entire Ultra product line. Unfortunately, we experienced a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster product line. This issue has been addressed, and the line has been reformulated. We are refreshing the packaging of that line as well. As a result, however, sales at Muscle Monster during the quarter was substantially lower than the first quarter of last year and, obviously, negatively impacted our sales.
During the 2015 first quarter, no share purchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. However, 20 -- I'm sorry, 2.2 million shares were purchased from employees during the quarter in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding tax as due.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $362.8 million compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $647.3 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $41.2 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million.
Days outstanding for accounts receivables were at 46.4 days at March 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 48.1 days at March 31, 2014. Inventories increased to $197.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014.
Average days of inventory was 69.1 days at March 31, 2015, which was higher than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 73.7 days at March 31, 2014.
We have now launched Ultra Citron, our fruity SKU in the Ultra product line and Rehab Peach Tea + Energy, which have been well received by consumers. Our repositioned juice and punch products continue to show healthy gains. We are planning to launch additional products later in 2015, but it is premature for us to discuss those products at this time.
We believe that the transitioning of a substantial majority of our targeted distribution rights in the U.S., effective April 6, 2015, orders by the Coca-Cola system to implement the transitions, the accounting for returns from terminated distributors, the timing of the transitions as well as uncertainty with our independent international distributors given the imminent implementation of the transaction, are among the factors that impacted our sales levels in March and April 2015. It is premature for us to finalize our April sales and to comment thereon at this time.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize the recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2015 first quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2014. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 continue to gain market share and contribute positively to the overall increase in the company's sales.
Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines have been positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to improve. We believe that our Monster Unleaded, Ultra Sunrise and Ultra Citron lines as well as was Rehab Peach Tea + Energy will continue to increase their contribution to sales through 2015.
Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international brand expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Chile. We believe that the Coca-Cola transition, particularly a successful transition, will afford us ongoing opportunities in 2015 and beyond.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

I think international markets have just been a little more affected. I think there's just a little more skepticism amongst the distributors and anticipation of what the future will be and whether they will continue to be -- distribute the brand. And I think that has affected their investment in the brand, investment in securing distribution and sales and, in general approach, I think in attitude. With regard to the transition to the U.S., we think that the transition has gone relatively smoothly from a retailer point of view. There were a few disruptions, minor where retailers hadn't -- weren't able in time to make changes or the distributor to make changes, so that, in some cases, products being taken into stores were still being shown as being supplied by the previous vendors, so there were some issues. But generally, we thought that the transition went well. But again, a lot of that will only come through to us with time. We've heard of small -- a few instances, but obviously, we don't hear of everything, certainly not in the first few weeks of it taking place. So I think that even to really understand the issues and the opportunities, is going to take some months to pan out and be -- for us to be able to really make more sense of it. Just to comment on any doubtful things, I think would not be sensible and not accurate enough."

And there are also, obviously, economic issues and factors as to whether we are happy making the change, if -- based on margin requirements and cost requirements. So there are a number of factors, and we are working through those. But the U.S. was an easier transition in -- to do in mass clearly and was the main focus for us to get done. The other focuses, we've been -- to visit them, we've traveled around them, we're starting negotiations with them. But many of them are -- don't know Monster, don't know the system. And it's -- and each negotiation takes on its own course because of different factors that apply in each of these different countries. And this quite varies. There isn't a one formula fits all for the different countries. So that is taking a bit more time, and we're going to have to work our way through it. Obviously, we are looking at that as -- on a positive point of view, we would like to transition substantial amount of that distribution, but that will pan out later in the year over the next 3 to 6 months."

One of the other costs that we -- or a couple of the other costs that I would just mention, that I did mention, the premiums was high this quarter. What happened was we took premiums into our books in the first quarter. A lot of it designed or earmarked for second quarter premiums. So there was a slight switch in when you're going to see the benefit of it, but is this the right -- we needed to account with an accordance with our policies. Also, in the -- in sponsorships, there was a -- there was an increase, which we think will level out over the year. What -- in certain types of sponsorships, we had allocated these sponsorships over the period of the actual events due to certain changes in the way we -- our contracts with the -- particular events. Now we are amortizing those more spread over the 12-month period. So that had a bit of an effect of increasing costs in the first quarter because a lot of the events start towards -- the annual events start towards the second quarter or earlier than that -- end of the first quarter. We also had an increase in -- we signed an agreement, a sort of major sponsorship with UFC this year, which had the effect of also increasing and coming into the first quarter. So those -- again, we think those will normalize somewhat and probably get us more in line with what we've been going in the future. What we don't know is how those effects will -- those will all be effective once we obviously bring in the KO brands with -- because the whole model for the KO brands will be a concentrate model.

The market is very big for -- in Energy, for example, in China, which we've mentioned before, is a really big -- we think is a big future opportunity. But it's in a lower-priced product at the moment. And so whether the premium section and how, where we want to position our brand is still uncertain and we've not come to a final decision. But clearly, that is a market we're going to focus on. We do believe there's good opportunity to grow much more than we have in a market like Brazil, which is also a big market. Obviously Japan, we're doing nicely. And so we're going to try and focus on the larger markets where we're already there. And then obviously, newer markets, we will be -- we will go into, but it wouldn't be as much authority, probably other than China, which we do regard as a priority for us. And we are looking at that and taking steps to actively look at the market and ascertain when we can get into that market. So I think that we will see some benefits, but we just got to get more information and have more time to meet with all the bottlers. That's a pretty gigantic task when you look at -- there are a number of independent bottlers around the world in the Coke system. It's not a matter of getting together with a half a dozen of them. And we are working our way through them at the moment and making good progress. But each country has its own issues. And one of the things that complicate international, which we believe is important for the long term, is we are looking, as in many cases when we're talking to distribution, to the bottlers there, we are also talking to them about production, local production because we believe that will be important to reduce our costs. And then just important to also get them more aligned with us to be real partners and produce locally and -- as well as sell locally. So -- production has its own issues, and we need to deal with those things. That just adds complexity. But ultimately, we'll get there, and we believe it will be in the long-term benefit to do it this way."

And in some cases, we need to and we will continue with those arrangements and implement them because a, it'll help secure local production on a -- at a quicker date because it does take some time to get a Coke-packing plant up to speed and to make certain equipment changes that might be necessary or was usually necessary in order to run our products. And in some case in countries, there may well be a need for backup or 2 production plants. So again, it depends on the country. It depends on the circumstances, but there is a really good appetite from the Coke bottlers who are enthusiastic about wanting to do production and -- which is very beneficial for us. So we are reviewing and running down dual policies in some countries where 2 -- the independent packers that we already started on, plus Coke packers, and then in other countries, just looking -- starting from a fresh with Coke -- with the Coke packers or Coke bottlers."

As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company finally closed on June 12, 2015. Under the agreement, The Coca-Cola Company acquired an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company also transferred ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster and Monster, in turn, transfer its non-Energy business to the Coca-Cola company. We are excited about our partnership and believe that it will strategically align both companies for the long-term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We are now actively engaged in implementing our strategic alignment and have commenced discussions with Coca-Cola Bottlers in many countries around the world. Our first international transition to a Coca-Cola bottle was accomplished in Germany in early July. There are a number of hurdles to be overcome, both legal and financial, in finalizing the award of distribution rights to new international bottlers. We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola Energy business, which we referred to as our strategic brands as a concentrate business as The Coca-Cola Company did prior to the closing of the transactions. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model where our Monster Energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. 
Under our historical finished products model, we sell finished products to our distributors. Under the concentrate model concentrate and beverage base is sold to Butler's who had added other common ingredients and containers to produce the finished product. As a result, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect management's view of the business. In this quarter, we report our 3 operating in reportable segments. First is the finished products segment, the principal products of which include the company's Monster Energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment. Second is concentrate, the principal products of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola and the third is other principal products, which include the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transactions. Including those, which were previously comprise the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the brand. We are endeavoring to accelerate the pace of our negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers with a view to be able to transition a number of additional international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the future. Sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements. The impact of the transitions of a substantial majority of our Monster distribution rights in the United States earlier this year, the lower inventory levels maintained by Coca-Cola Bottlers versus the position with us and uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network. Given the anticipated implementation of the transactions, all negatively affected our sales growth during the second quarter. Both the Nielsen numbers which reflects retail sales to consumers, as well as distributed depletions, which reflect sales out by distributors and bottlers to the customers were substantially less affected by the transition. 
Results during the second quarter were also negatively affected by out of stocks, which occurred in certain geographic -- geographies due to the learning curve associated with the transitions to the Coca-Cola network. Although the transition has progressed relatively smoothly in the United States, there is always some disruption when transitioning distribution. These -- this learning curve was not dissimilar to what we experienced when we transitioned a large part of the distribution in the United States to the Coca-Cola Bottlers some 6 years ago. But it was temporary, they got up to speed relatively quickly, and we believe that the same will occur here. 
In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information, and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in this quarter. We believe that it will be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis off to giving you shots to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. 
Gross sales for the 2015 second quarter was $789.9 million compared to gross sales of $779 million in the comparable second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 second quarter was $693.7 million as compared to $687.2 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $29.9 million on gross sales and approximately $23.9 million on net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 56.9% as compared to 55.2% for the comparable 2014 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins in finished product segment, as well as changes in product sales mix and lower cost of raw materials. 
Excluding distributed termination costs of $12.2 million, and transaction expenses of $11.5 million, operating expenses for the 2015 second quarter were $166.1 million as compared to $161.9 million in the same quarter last year. Excluding termination cost of $500,000 and transaction cost of $1.1 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding these items were 23.9% for the 2015 second quarter as compared to 23.6% in the same quarter last year. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were for 4.1% for the 2015 second quarter compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.4% compared to 10.5% in the same quarter a year ago. Commissions in royalties in the quarter were lower, partly offset by a $1.6 million provision for marketing funds for the new Coca-Cola Energy business and an increase of $3.6 million in sponsorships and endorsements. General and administrative costs excluding distributor termination costs and the transaction costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 second quarter were 9.5% as compared to 8.6% for the corresponding quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses of $8.4 million due to additional payroll taxes paid by the company following the exercise of certain stock options by senior management, as well as the addition of certain employees to manage and service the new strategic brands. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the same quarter last year. Payroll taxes were $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.6 million last year in the same quarter, an increase of $4.8 million. 
Total transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transactions during the second quarter were $11.5 million as compared to $1.1 million in the comparable quarter in 2014. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $187.2 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $180.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $151.3 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $148 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $29.9 million and on net sales for approximately $23.9 million. Including gross sales to customers outside the United States, our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 25, 2015 for all outlets combined and the convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy drink category, including shots increased by 10.3% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull increased 14.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 13%; sales of 5-hour increased 2.1%; and sales of decreased 5.8%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 10.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.1% of the same period last year, while Noss was up 11.5% and Full Throttle sales decreased 0.9%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 13.5%; Rockstar was up 21.7%; 5-hour was up 4.8%; and amp was up 0.4%.

Rockstar's share was up 0.7 points at 7.6%; $5 share was lower than 8.6% and after decreased 0.2 points to 2.2%. 
According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.9% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 9.1% higher. According to Nielsen and the community gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 27, 2015, the Energy drink category increased 5%. Monster sales were up 6% versus a year ago. And market share increased 1.4 points to 27.8% over the same period last year. For sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.8 points to 38.2%. Rockstar sales increased 37% and its market share increased 4.1 points to 19.2%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy drink category grew 20.4% in the month of June, 2015. Monster sales increased 1.1%. Our market share decreased 6.2 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Our strategic brands market share represented by increased 0.3 points to 6.2%. Radiated has been discontinued in Mexico. Red Bull sales increased 4.3% and its market share decreased by 3.2 points to 20.9%. Be very 100's market share increased 7.8 points to 21.7%, while boost's market share decreased 0.2 points to 14.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the offshore convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the offshore convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. In the month prior which is May 2015, for example, all outlets combined in Mexico the Energy drink category grew 28.7% in the month and Monster's sales increased 25.6%. Our market share decreased 0.9 points to 35.3% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 0.8% and its market share decreased by 6.1 points to 20.4%. We very 100 market share increased 6.5 points to 19.6% while our Boost's market share decreased 1.8 points to 13.9%. Coke market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 1.1 points to 6.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June, 2015, the actual 13 week period is varied by few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.5% to 12.4% in Great Britain; from 15.8% to 18.7% in France; and from 7.6% to 11.5% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.9% to 8.7% in Sweden; from 8.2% to 8.8% in Belgium and from 5.9% to 6% in The Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended June, 2015, as compared to the same period last year decreased from 18.7% to 16.8% in South Africa. And from 22.4% to 21.9% in Spain and from 11.7% to 11.2% in Italy. All 3 of these markets had independent distributors. 
According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of June 2015 from 25.4% to 27.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of May 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.6% as compared to 11.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of June, 2015, declined from 5.3% to 3.9% as compared to the same period last year. We believe that our distributor in Brazil has loss focus on our brand as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of June 2015, in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 24.1% to 32.7%. Additionally, within the last few weeks, Monster launched its Monster Energy Ultra Energy drink in Japan. Early indications are very positive. As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into finished products, concentrate and other. Net sales for the finished product segment DSD segment, but excluding PSP increased 1.2% to $651.2 million and operating income for the finished product segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts, decreased 1.1% to $251.6 million in the 2015 second quarter. Net sales for the finished product segment were negatively impacted by approximately $22.8 million of foreign currency movements and operating income for the finished product segment was negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of distributed terminations. Net sales for the company's new concentrate segment was $13 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2015, and operating income before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts for the concentrate segment was $9.1 million. 
You would appreciate that, that covers the period only between the closing of the transaction and the end of the quarter, which is not a full quarter. Net sales for the company's third segment decreased 32.6% to $29.5 million for the 3 months ended June, 2015, from $43.8 million for the same period ending June 30, 2014. The 2015 second quarter's results for the other segment our through June 12, the date of the Coca-Cola transaction closed. 
Operating income for the Other segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts, and excluding the gain of the sale of our non-energy business was $2.2 million the second quarter 2015 compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2015 in dollars were 4.8% higher than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 32% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 10% higher in dollars and 38% higher in local currencies. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. However, growth in Spain, South Africa, Italy were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of the Coca-Cola transaction. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we made good strives in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution and traded profitably in the second quarter. We are continuing to see the benefit of strategic changes implemented over the past 2 years. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink which is now available in the majority of the markets in Europe and South Africa continues to perform well. During the quarter, we launched Mega Monster in additional EMEA markets. Results continued to be positive. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Ireland, Hungary and Poland, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. In our international markets where our distribution partners anticipates a transition occurring, there's a notable difference in our sales levels versus our markets that already operating in the Coca-Cola system. 
Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased 28.7%, 49.9% increase in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean decreased 3.5% in dollars but increased 5.8% in local currencies over the comparable period 2014. Mainly due to foreign exchange differences and competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and continuing issues with our Colombian distributor. Sales in Brazil for the second quarter were disappointing as referred to earlier. In Japan, net sales increased by 41.8% in dollars and 66.5% in local currency. In Mexico net sales were slightly up both in local currency and dollars. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the division in the second quarter of 2015. India has been impacted by losses in the second quarter forming regulatory issues, which are currently, being addressed. That we are actively involved in discussions with aspect of Coca-Cola Bottlers in numerous companies around the world through regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drink. We're also evaluating many additional local production opportunities with Coca-Cola Bottlers, which we believe will yield cost reductions. We have experienced a decrease in sales of Muscle Monster as we believe -- that we believe is principally attributable to a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster products. I did mention this on our previous call. We have addressed the issue by reformulating those products and all currently shipping new Muscle Monster products with new graphics to our distributors. 
Following the confirmation of the transactions for The Coca-Cola Company. The company receives substantial cash funds. The Board of Directors is considering options with regard to the return of capital, including share repurchases. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.7 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.2 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments increased to $52.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.2 million. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 42.6 days at June 30, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 43.5 days at June 30, 2014. Inventories increased to $180.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 54.4 days at June 30, 2015,, which was lower than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 60.8 days at June 30, 2014. In the full, we are planning to launch a new Juice Monster called Pipeline Punch and a new banana flavored Muscle Monster, as well as Monster Ultra Black as a permanent SKU. We've also reformulated our Rehab Peach Tea + Energy Rehab product as of raspberry tree + Energy product, which is currently in the process of being introduced. We have additional new product launches planned for the beginning of 2016. Our repositioned Juice Monster and Punch Monster line continued to show healthy gains. Growth sales in July 2015 in dollars were approximately 14.1% higher than in July, 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in July were 19.2% higher than in July 2014. July, 2014 included the old warehouse provision and Peace Tea. Specifically, the finished product segment, which comprises our Monster Energy brand products grew 10.2% in July in dollars and 14.5% without foreign exchange impact. We caution against that sales in the single month and over short period are often does report that the impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week, and with holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be in future to regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We are pleased that the Coca-Cola transaction closed on June 12 and are excited with the opportunity this presents to the company. North American and international gross margins are healthy and in fact, it continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. We believe that the majority of the increases in dollar values achieves by Red Bull are attributable to the price increase with implemented in January. In units, sales of Red Bull in the United States increased by 5.5%, which is lower than 9.1% increase in units achieved by Monster. We think that the resilience shown by consumers to Red Bull's increased pricing all bodes well for planned for price increase in September. Importantly, on a unit basis, Monster continues to outperform Red Bull this year, which we believe is significant. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced last year continue to gain market share and add to the company sales. We believe that our Monster Ultra lines and additions in changes to our Rehab and Juice monster lines will continue to add sales -- to add to sales. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland, Greece and Chile. We are pleased with the improvement in July in our sales book. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

So number one, can you just talk about what sort of driving some of that underlying improvement? Maybe it's the Coke system doing better or some of the new markets you're entering and then even the improvement that you saw in July, kind of what's driving that? And then the markets that you're having some challenges like Brazil and Italy, and maybe even other markets that we're having discussions about the transition, can you just elaborate on how much progress you're making? What are some of the early learnings that you're talking to this bottlers and just kind of thinking about the phase, in which you can transition some of the bottlers to the Coke system?"

In many of these markets, it's not a question of what we can do that. The question is you got existing distribution obviously you have heard about the Coke transaction and believe that big was would be transition to Coke. So what they have generally have really pulled back on their investments in their markets and investing in putting extra effort and although we try to, obviously, work with them and assure them that it affects the buyout to some extent, they really have mentally are not in the same place as they will when they were fully engaged as our full-time distributors. So the challenge we've got is in basically being able to conclude arrangements with the Coke bottlers as soon as possible to transition those markets. And we've referred to that, there is a learning curve with international Coke bottle there's not only from a point of learning about our product, but the way we go to the market, the way we operate, the terms of our agreements using a finished product model, all of these things are not usual to generally to the Coca-Cola Bottlers. They have very different business models and contractual existing contract relations with The Coca-Cola Company. So there are some complex issues both with regard to the legal terms of the agreements and the economics and working out the value chains and these are being done and attended to, and we are having a discussion, but it is taking some time. And we just unfortunately, we just got to be patient but what we do clearly see is there is a very big difference in the sales in both our sales in end sales out from distributors to please their depletions in markets where they are or non-what I call non-transition markets. We are district the shippers know that they're going to stay with the brand, for example, the Coke, the CCR markets in Europe, those markets are generally performing well and performing at a much higher level than the markets where there is a likelihood of a transition. There are some markets, on the other hand, with we've not made a decision to transition, and we've communicated that, we've been able to assure our distributor. Those markets are performing well. Particularly, you call out a market like Japan where our partner has, as you know, we talked with them, and we're focused on continuing to operate with them and their the market has done very well and they're continuing to perform fully. There is an international. That is not at dissimilar situation in a in the U.S. If you take our markets in the U.S. whether it some cases most cases their existing Coke but there's there's some cases we have some independent bottlers here distributors or bottlers. And again, you're seeing a clear difference between the results both our sales in and the sales were also affected by the lower stockholding levels held by Coke Bottlers versus the AV, that new ones we've gone too, that was an additional factor. But even if you take that factor, take that into account or put us in the side of the moment, when you look at the depletions in by the Coke Bottlers in the transition therapies, the depletions are lower than in the same companies non-transition territories. And it's clear that what's going on is that there is a learning curve. It was amount of stocks, but from our side and in retail, and it's also a learning curve because the new sales teams have basically got to learn that Monster business, the velocity that thought that those accounts that are higher in velocity that don't necessarily replicate that accounts that are higher in velocity for traditional beverages. And so we think that, that's a transitory thing and this is the quarter where they've gone through the first 90 days of the transitions to the Coke system in the U.S. And so we think these are things that are just going to have to work their way out of it, and we are -- we believe we're starting to see improvements and some of that is now being reflected in the numbers that we're showing in our sales numbers for July. Obviously, what you also can see is if you look at the Nielsen over this whole period, the Nielsen numbers in the U.S. have been pretty consistent on our sales out in units, et cetera, which shows that from the consumer point of view, there is still the similar retail pull in all these markets."

So we're just having to work through those issues, but it will -- we all have pulled and we'll get through it to the extent that we don't in any particular territory, we have options that we can go to with existing distributors, and lot a lot of the issues we are having with existing distributors if we were to not transition the territory and go back to those distributors and basically assure them that will give them a longer-term contract and give them the assurance that they will have a longer term, and they have a number of years secure. We've got no doubt they will start to reinvest, and reengage in the brand. It's just that we've not been able to do that because we haven't wanted to mislead them or give them any false hopes.

As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company finally closed on June 12, 2015. Under the agreement, The Coca-Cola Company acquired an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company also transferred ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster and Monster, in turn, transferred its non-Energy business to the Coca-Cola Company. We are excited about our partnership and believe that it will strategically align both companies for the long-term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player, globally. We are now actively engaged in implementing our strategic alignment and have commenced discussions with Coca-Cola Bottlers in many countries around the world. Our first international transition to a Coca-Cola bottler was accomplished in Germany in early July. There are a number of hurdles to be overcome, both legal and financial, in finalizing the award of distribution rights to new international bottlers. We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola Energy business, which we referred to as our strategic brands as a concentrate business as The Coca-Cola Company did prior to the closing of the transactions. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model for our Monster Energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. 
Under our historical finished products model, we sell finished products to our distributors. Under the concentrate model concentrate and concentrate and of beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients and containers to produce the finished product. As a result, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect management's view of the business. In this quarter, we report our 3 operating in reportable segments. First is the finished products segment, the principal products of which include the company's Monster Energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment. Second is concentrate, the principal products of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. And the third is other, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transactions. Including those, which were previously comprised the majority of the former Warehouse segment the Peace Tea brand. We are endeavoring to accelerate the pace of our negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers with a view to be able to transition a number of additional international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the future. Sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements. The impact of the transitions of a substantial majority of our Monster distribution rights in the United States earlier this year, the lower inventory levels maintained by Coca-Cola bottlers versus the Anheuser-Busch distributors and the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network. Given the anticipated implementation of the transactions, all negatively affected our sales growth during the second quarter. Both the Nielsen numbers which reflect retail sales to consumers, as well as distributed depletions, which reflect sales out by distributors and bottlers to their customers, were substantially less affected by the transition. 
Results during the second quarter were also negatively affected by out of stocks, which occurred in certain geographic -- geographies due to the learning curve associated with the transitions to the Coca-Cola network. Although the transition has progressed relatively smoothly in the United States, there is always some disruption when transitioning distribution. These -- this learning curve was not dissimilar to what we experienced when we transitioned a large part of our distribution in the United States to the Coca-Cola Bottlers some 6 years ago. But it was temporary, they got up to speed relatively quickly, and we believe that the same will occur here. 
In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information, and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in this quarter. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. 
Gross sales for the 2015 second quarter was $789.9 million compared to gross sales of $779 million in the comparable second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 second quarter was $693.7 million as compared to $687.2 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $29.9 million on gross sales and approximately $23.9 million on net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 56.9% as compared to 55.2% for the comparable 2014 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins in the finished product segment, as well as changes in product sales mix and lower cost of raw materials. 
Excluding distributor termination costs of $12.2 million, and transaction expenses of $11.5 million, operating expenses for the 2015 second quarter were $166.1 million as compared to $161.9 million in the same quarter last year. Excluding termination cost of $0.5 million and transaction cost of $1.1 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding these items were 23.9% for the 2015 second quarter as compared to 23.6% in the same quarter last year. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were for 4.1% for the 2015 second quarter compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.4% compared to 10.5% in the same quarter a year ago. Commissions and royalties in the quarter were lower, partly offset by a $1.6 million provision for marketing funds for the new Coca-Cola Energy business and an increase of $3.6 million in sponsorships and endorsements. General and administrative costs excluding distributor termination costs and the transaction costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 second quarter were 9.5% as compared to 8.6% for the corresponding quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses of $8.4 million due to additional payroll taxes paid by the company following the exercise of certain stock options by senior management, as well as the addition of certain employees to manage and service the new strategic brands. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the same quarter last year. Payroll taxes were $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.6 million last year in the same quarter, an increase of $4.8 million. 
Total transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transactions during the second quarter were $11.5 million as compared to $1.1 million in the comparable quarter in 2014. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $187.2 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $180.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $151.3 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $148 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $29.9 million and on net sales of approximately $23.9 million. Included in gross sales to customers outside the United States, our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 25, 2015 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 10.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 14.9% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 14.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 13%; sales of 5-Hour increased 2.1%; and sales of AMP decreased 5.8%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 10.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.1% of the same period last year, while NOS was up 11.5% and Full Throttle sales decreased 0.9%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 13.5%; Rockstar was up 21.7%; 5-Hour was up 4.8%; and AMP was up 0.4%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended the July 25, 2015, Monster's market share of the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shot in dollars increased by 0.5 points over the same period last year to 34.2%. NOS' shared remain the same at 3.8% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.9 points to 36.3%. Rockstar's share was up 0.7 points at 7.6%; 5-Hour share was lower at 8.6% and AMP share decreased 0.2 points to 2.2%. 
According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.9% higher than in the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 9.1% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 27, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 5%. Monster sales were up 6% versus a year ago. And market share increased 1.4 points to 27.8% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.8 points to 38.2%. Rockstar sales increased 37% and its market share increased 4.1 points to 19.2%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 20.4% in the month of June, 2015. Monster sales increased 1.1%. Our market share decreased 6.2 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Our strategic brands market share represented by Burn, increased 0.3 points to 6.2%. Gladiator has been discontinued in Mexico. Red Bull sales increased 4.3% and its market share decreased by 3.2 points to 20.9%. Vive 100's market share increased 7.8 points to 21.7%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.2 points to 14.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more Energy Drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. In the month prior which is May 2015, for example, all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 28.7% in the month and Monster's sales increased 25.6%. Our market share decreased 0.9 points to 35.3% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 0.8% and its market share decreased by 6.1 points to 20.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 6.5 points to 19.6% while our Boost's market share decreased 1.8 points to 13.9%. Coke market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 1.1 points to 6.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June, 2015, the actual 13-week period is varied by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.5% to 12.4% in Great Britain; from 15.8% to 18.7% in France; and from 7.6% to 11.5% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.9% to 8.7% in Sweden; from 8.2% to 8.8% in Belgium and from 5.9% to 6% in The Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended June, 2015, as compared to the same period last year decreased from 18.7% to 16.8% in South Africa. And from 22.4% to 21.9% in Spain and from 11.7% to 11.2% in Italy. All 3 of these markets had independent distributors. 
According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks to the end of June 2015 from 25.4% to 27.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of May 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.6% as compared to 11.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of June, 2015, declined from 5.3% to 3.9% as compared to the same period last year. We believe that our distributor in Brazil has lost focus on our brand as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of June 2015, in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 24.1% to 32.7%. Additionally, within the last few weeks, Monster launched its Monster Energy Ultra Energy drink in Japan. Early indications are very positive. As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into finished products, concentrate and other. Net sales for the finished product segment, formerly the DSD segment but excluding Peace Tea, increased 1.2% to $651.2 million and operating income for the finished product segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts, decreased 1.1% to $251.6 million in the 2015 second quarter. Net sales for the finished product segment were negatively impacted by approximately $22.8 million of foreign currency movements and operating income for the finished product segment was negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of distributor terminations. Net sales for the company's new concentrate segment was $13 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2015, and operating income before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts for the concentrate segment was $9.1 million. 
You will appreciate that, that covers the period only between the closing of the transaction and the end of the quarter, which is not a full quarter. Net sales for the company's third segment, Other, decreased 32.6% to $29.5 million for the 3 months ended June, 2015, from $43.8 million for the same period ending June 30, 2014. The 2015 second quarter's results for the other segment are through June 12, the date of the Coca-Cola transaction closed. 
Operating income for the Other segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts, and excluding the gain on the sale of our non-energy business was $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2015 in dollars were 4.8% higher than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 32% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 10% higher in dollars and 38% higher in local currencies. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. However, growth in Spain, South Africa and Italy were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of the Coca-Cola transaction. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution and traded profitably in the second quarter. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented over the past 2 years. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink which is now available in the majority of the markets in Europe and South Africa continues to perform well. During the quarter, we launched Mega Monster in additional EMEA markets, results continued to be positive. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Ireland, Hungary and Poland, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. In our international markets where our distribution partners anticipates a transition occurring, there is a notable difference in our sales levels versus our markets that already operating in the Coca-Cola system. 
Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased 28.7%, 49.9% increase in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean decreased 3.5% in dollars but increased 5.8% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014. Mainly due to foreign exchange differences and competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and continuing issues with our Colombian distributor. Sales in Brazil for the second quarter were disappointing as referred to earlier. In Japan, net sales increased by 41.8% in dollars and 66.5% in local currency. In Mexico net sales were slightly up both in local currency and dollars. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the division in the second quarter of 2015. India has been impacted by losses in the second quarter following regulatory issues, which we are -- which are currently being addressed. We are actively involved in discussions with respective Coca-Cola Bottlers in numerous companies around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We're also evaluating many additional local production opportunities with Coca-Cola Bottlers, which we believe will yield cost reductions. We have experienced a decrease in sales of Muscle Monster as we believe -- that we believe is principally attributable to a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster products. I did mention this on our previous call. We have addressed the issue by reformulating those products and are currently shipping new Muscle Monster products with new graphics to our distributors. 
Following the consummation of the transactions with The Coca-Cola Company. The company receives substantial cash funds. The Board of Directors is considering options with regard to the return of capital, including share repurchases. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.7 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.2 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments increased to $52.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.2 million. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 42.6 days at June 30, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 43.5 days at June 30, 2014. Inventories increased to $180.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 54.4 days at June 30, 2015, which was lower than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 60.8 days at June 30, 2014. In the fall, we are planning to launch a new Juice Monster called Pipeline Punch and a new banana flavored Muscle Monster, as well as Monster Ultra Black as a permanent SKU. We've also reformulated our Rojo Tea + Energy Rehab product as a Raspberry Tree + Energy product, which is currently in the process of being introduced. We have additional new product launches planned for the beginning of 2016. Our repositioned Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continued to show healthy gains. Growth sales in July 2015 in dollars were approximately 14.1% higher than in July, 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in July were 19.2% higher than in July 2014. July, 2014 included the old Warehouse provision and Peace Tea. Specifically, the finished product segment, which comprises our Monster Energy brand products grew 10.2% in July in dollars and 14.5% without a foreign exchange impact. We caution again, that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week, in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We are pleased that the Coca-Cola transaction closed on June 12 and are excited with the opportunity this presents to the company. North American and International gross margins are healthy and in fact, it continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. We believe that the majority of the increases in dollar values achieved by Red Bull are attributable to their price increase which they implemented in January. In units, sales of Red Bull in the United States increased by 5.5%, which is lower than 9.1% increase in units achieved by Monster. We think that the resilience shown by consumers to Red Bull's increased pricing augurs well for our price increase in September. Importantly, on a unit basis, Monster continues to outperform Red Bull this year, which we believe is significant. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced last year continue to gain market share and add to the company sales. We believe that our Monster Ultra lines and additions in changes to our Rehab and Juice monster lines will continue to add sales -- to add to sales. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland, Greece and Chile. We are pleased with the improvement in July in our sales growth. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

So number one, can you just talk about what sort of driving some of that underlying improvement? Maybe it's the Coke system doing better or some of the new markets you're entering and then even the improvement that you saw in July, kind of what's driving that? And then the markets that you're having some challenges like Brazil and Italy, and maybe even other markets that we're having discussions about the transition, can you just elaborate on how much progress you're making? What are some of the early learnings as you're talking to these bottlers and just kind of thinking about the pace in which you can transition some of the bottlers to the Coke system?"

In many of these markets, it's not a question of what we can do. The question is you've got existing distributors and bottlers who obviously, have heard about the Coke transaction and believe that the",800,"I think, that -- let me take the last question, first. In many of these markets, it's not a question of what we can do. The question is you've got existing distributors and bottlers who obviously, have heard about the Coke transaction and believe that they -- their territories will ultimately be would be transition to Coke. So what -- they have generally have really pulled back on their investments in their markets, in investing, in putting extra effort and although we've tried to, obviously, work with them and assure them and it affects the buyout to some extent, they really have mentally are not in the same place as they were when they were fully engaged as our full-time distributors. So the challenge we've got is in basically being able to conclude arrangements with the Coke bottlers as soon as possible to transition those markets. And that -- we've referred to that, there is a learning curve with the International Coke bottlers not only from a point of view of learning about our products, but the way we go to the market, the way we operate, the terms of our agreements using a finished product model, all of these things are not usual to -- generally, to the Coca-Cola bottlers. They have very different business models and contractual -- existing contractual relationships with The Coca-Cola Company. So there are some complex issues both with regard to the legal terms of the agreements and the economics and working out the value chains and these are being done and attended to, and we are having a discussion, but it is taking some time. And we just -- unfortunately, we've just got to be patient but what we do clearly see is there is a very big difference in the sales in both our sales-in and sales-out from distributors to please their depletions in markets where they are or non -- where they are called non-transition markets. Where the distributors know that they're going to stay with the brand, for example, the Coke, the CCR markets in Europe, those markets are generally performing well and performing at a much higher level than the markets where there is a likelihood of a transition. There are some markets, on the other hand, where we've not made a decision to transition, and we've communicated that and able to assure our distributor. Those markets are performing well. Particularly, you call out a market like Japan where our partner has, as you know, we've talked with them, and we're focused on continuing to operate with them and there, the market has done very well and they're continuing to perform fully. That is in international, I mean that is not a dissimilar situation in the U.S. If you take our markets in the U.S. where with it in some cases -- most cases they're existing Coke bottlers but in some cases we have some independent bottlers here, distributors or bottlers. And again, you're seeing a clear difference between the results both our sales in and the sales in here obviously, were also affected by the lower stockholding levels held by Coke Bottlers versus the AB, the new ones we've gone too, yes, that was an additional factor. But even if you take that factor -- take that into account or put it to the side for the moment, when you look at the depletions in -- by the Coke bottlers in the transition territories, the depletions are lower than in the same companies non-transition territories. And it's clear that what's going on is that there is a learning curve. there were some out-of-stocks, but from our side and in retail, but it's also a learning curve because the new sales teams have basically got to learn that Monster business, the velocity, the accounts that are -- those accounts that are higher in velocity which don't necessarily replicate the accounts that are higher in velocity for traditional beverages. And so we think that, that's a transitory thing and this is the quarter where they've gone through it, it's the first 90 days of the transitions to the Coke system in the U.S. And so we think these are things that are just going to have to work their way out of it, and we are -- we believe we're starting to see improvements and some of that is now being reflected in the numbers that we're showing in our sales numbers for July. Obviously, what you also can see is if you look at the Nielsen over this whole period, the Nielsen numbers in the U.S. have been pretty consistent on our sales-out in units, et cetera, which shows that the -- from the consumer point of view, there is still the similar retail pull in all these markets."

And I think, it's right through the Coke -- I think, there's a very good attitude throughout the Coke system. I think, the issue is as I indicated earlier, it's getting to be able to get them comfortable with the basis on which we do business, which is different to the traditional concentrate sort of model business that Coke has followed for centuries. And to get them to understand as we work through the legal issues such, we're getting through value chain issues and generally they are, to the extent, that we worked with him, they are all comfortable with the value chain issues that there are satisfactory ways, in which we can work to share the issue and they're excited by that, it's a positive for them. But we obviously, have to negotiate and get them, everybody's trying to muscle each other at the moment to take a position, which will, obviously, be entrenched going forward. So we're just having to work through those issues, but it will -- we are hopeful that we'll get through in [indiscernible] if to the extent that we don't in any particular territory, we have options that we can go to grab existing distributors, and a lot of the issues we are having with existing distributors if we were to not transition the territory and go back to those distributors and basically, assure them that we'll give them a longer-term contract and give them the assurance that they will have a longer term that they have a number of years secured. We've got no doubt they will start to reinvest, and reengage in the brand. It's just that we've not been able to do that because we haven't wanted to mislead them or give them any false hopes. And so that's being the delicate sort of tightrope we've been walking at the moment. So again it doesn't mean that in every territory, we will go to a Coke bottler, but I don't think that, that is an issue. The issue at the moment is just getting everybody and it's time to deal in all these different countries and get everybody on the same page and get them comfortable with us. We are making progress and we obviously are going to try and step up the pace of those negotiations."

As previously announced, the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company finally closed on June 12, 2015. Under the agreement, the Coca-Cola Company acquired an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster following the issuance of shares to the Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company also transferred ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster and Monster, in turn, transferred its non-Energy business to the Coca-Cola Company. We are excited about our partnership and believe that it will strategically align both companies for the long-term by combining the strength of the Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player, globally. We are now actively engaged in implementing our strategic alignment and have commenced discussions with Coca-Cola Bottlers in many countries around the world. Our first international transition to a Coca-Cola bottler was accomplished in Germany in early July. There are a number of hurdles to be overcome, both legal and financial, in finalizing the award of distribution rights to new international bottlers. We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola Energy business, which we refer to as our strategic brands, as a concentrate business as the Coca-Cola Company did prior to the closing of the transactions. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model for our Monster Energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. 
Under our historical finished products model, we sell finished products to our distributors. Under the concentrate model, concentrate and/or beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients and containers to produce the finished product. As a result, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect management's view of the business. In this quarter, we report our 3 operating and reportable segments. First is the finished products segment, the principal products of which include the company's Monster Energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment. Second is concentrate, the principal products of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. And the third is other, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transactions, including those which were previously comprised of the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea brand. We are endeavoring to accelerate the pace of our negotiations with Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to be able to transition a number of additional international markets to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the future. Sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements. The impact of the transitions of a substantial majority of our Monster distribution rights in the United States earlier this year, the lower inventory levels maintained by Coca-Cola Bottlers versus the Anheuser-Busch distributors and the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network, given the anticipated implementation of the transactions, all negatively affected our sales growth during the second quarter. Both the Nielsen numbers, which reflect retail sales to consumers, as well as distributed depletions, which reflect sales out by distributors and bottlers to their customers, were substantially less affected by the transition. 
Results during the second quarter were also negatively affected by out of stocks, which occurred in certain geographic -- geographies due to the learning curve associated with the transitions to the Coca-Cola network. Although the transition has progressed relatively smoothly in the United States, there is always some disruption when transitioning distribution. These -- this learning curve was not dissimilar to what we experienced when we transitioned a large part of our distribution in the United States to the Coca-Cola Bottlers some 6 years ago. But it was temporary, they got up to speed relatively quickly and we believe that the same will occur here. 
In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information, and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in this quarter. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. 
Gross sales for the 2015 second quarter were $789.9 million compared to gross sales of $779 million in the comparable second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 second quarter were $693.7 million as compared to $687.2 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $29.9 million on gross sales and approximately $23.9 million on net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 56.9% as compared to 55.2% for the comparable 2014 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the finished product segment, as well as changes in product sales mix and lower cost of raw materials. 
Excluding distributor termination costs of $12.2 million, and transaction expenses of $11.5 million, operating expenses for the 2015 second quarter were $166.1 million as compared to $161.9 million in the same quarter last year. Excluding termination costs of $0.5 million and transaction costs of $1.1 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding these items, were 23.9% for the 2015 second quarter as compared to 23.6% in the same quarter last year. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2015 second quarter compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.4% compared to 10.5% in the same quarter a year ago. Commissions and royalties in the quarter were lower, partly offset by a $1.6 million provision for marketing funds for the new Coca-Cola Energy business and an increase of $3.6 million in sponsorships and endorsements. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination costs and the transaction costs, as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 second quarter were 9.5% as compared to 8.6% for the corresponding quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses of $8.4 million due to additional payroll taxes paid by the company following the exercise of certain stock options by senior management, as well as the addition of certain employees to manage and service the new strategic brands. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the same quarter last year. Payroll taxes were $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.6 million last year in the same quarter, an increase of $4.8 million. 
Total transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transactions during the second quarter were $11.5 million as compared to $1.1 million in the comparable quarter in 2014. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $187.2 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $180.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $151.3 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $148 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $29.9 million and on net sales of approximately $23.9 million. Included in gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 25, 2015 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 10.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 14.9% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 14.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 13%; sales of 5-Hour increased 2.1%; and sales of AMP decreased 5.8%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 10.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.1% of the same period last year, while NOS was up 11.5% and Full Throttle sales decreased 0.9%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 13.5%; Rockstar was up 21.7%; 5-Hour was up 4.8%; and AMP was up 0.4%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 25, 2015, Monster's market share of the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy Shots in dollars increased by 0.5 points over the same period last year to 34.2%. NOS' shared remain the same at 3.8% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.9 points to 36.3%. Rockstar's share was up 0.7 points at 7.6%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.6% and AMP's share decreased 0.2 points to 2.2%. 
According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.9% higher than in the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 9.1% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 27, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 5%. Monster sales were up 6% versus a year ago. And market share increased 1.4 points to 27.8% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.8 points to 38.2%. Rockstar sales increased 37% and its market share increased 4.1 points to 19.2%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 20.4% in the month of June 2015. Monster sales increased 1.1%. Our market share decreased 6.2 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Our strategic brands market share represented by Burn, increased 0.3 points to 6.2%. Gladiator has been discontinued in Mexico. Red Bull sales increased 4.3% and its market share decreased by 3.2 points to 20.9%. Vive 100's market share increased 7.8 points to 21.7%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.2 points to 14.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more Energy Drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. In the month prior, which is May 2015, for example, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 28.7% in the month and Monster's sales increased 25.6%. Our market share decreased 0.9 points to 35.3% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 0.8% and its market share decreased by 6.1 points to 20.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 6.5 points to 19.6%, while our Boost's market share decreased 1.8 points to 13.9%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 1.1 points to 6.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2015 -- the actual 13-week periods varied by a few weeks between different markets, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.5% to 12.4% in Great Britain; from 15.8% to 18.7% in France; and from 7.6% to 11.5% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.9% to 8.7% in Sweden; from 8.2% to 8.8% in Belgium and from 5.9% to 6% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended June 2015, as compared to the same period last year, decreased from 18.7% to 16.8% in South Africa. And from 22.4% to 21.9% in Spain and from 11.7% to 11.2% in Italy. All 3 of these markets have independent distributors. 
According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks to the end of June 2015 from 25.4% to 27.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of May 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.6% as compared to 11.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of June 2015, declined from 5.3% to 3.9% as compared to the same period last year. We believe that our distributor in Brazil has lost focus on our brand as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of June 2015, in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 24.1% to 32.7%. Additionally, within the last few weeks, Monster launched its Monster Energy Ultra Energy drink in Japan. Early indications are very positive. As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into finished products, concentrate and other. Net sales for the finished product segment, formerly the DSD segment but excluding Peace Tea, increased 1.2% to $651.2 million and operating income for the finished product segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts, decreased 1.1% to $251.6 million in the 2015 second quarter. Net sales for the finished product segment were negatively impacted by approximately $22.8 million of foreign currency movements and operating income for the finished product segment was negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of distributor terminations. Net sales for the company's new concentrate segment was $13 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2015, and operating income before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts for the concentrate segment was $9.1 million. 
You will appreciate that, that covers the period only between the closing of the transaction and the end of the quarter, which is not a full quarter. Net sales for the company's third segment, Other, decreased 32.6% to $29.5 million for the 3 months ended June 2015, from $43.8 million for the same period ending June 30, 2014. The 2015 second quarter's results for the Other segment are through June 12, the date of the Coca-Cola transaction closed. 
Operating income for the Other segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts, and excluding the gain on the sale of our non-energy business was $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2015 in dollars were 4.8% higher than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 32% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 10% higher in dollars and 38% higher in local currencies. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. However, growth in Spain, South Africa and Italy were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of the Coca-Cola transaction. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution and traded profitably in the second quarter. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented over the past 2 years. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of the markets in Europe and South Africa, continues to perform well. During the quarter, we launched Mega Monster in additional EMEA markets. Results continued to be positive. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Ireland, Hungary and Poland, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. In our international markets, where our distribution partners anticipates a transition occurring, there is a notable difference in our sales levels versus our markets that are already operating in the Coca-Cola system. 
Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased 28.7%, 49.9% increase in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean decreased 3.5% in dollars but increased 5.8% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014, mainly due to foreign exchange differences and competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and continuing issues with our Colombian distributor. Sales in Brazil for the second quarter were disappointing, as referred to earlier. In Japan, net sales increased by 41.8% in dollars and 66.5% in local currency. In Mexico net sales were slightly up both in local currency and dollars. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the division in the second quarter of 2015. India has been impacted by losses in the second quarter following regulatory issues, which we are -- which are currently being addressed. We are actively involved in discussions with prospective Coca-Cola Bottlers in numerous companies around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We're also evaluating many additional local production opportunities with Coca-Cola Bottlers, which we believe will yield cost reductions. We have experienced a decrease in sales of Muscle Monster, as we believe -- that we believe is principally attributable to a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster products. I did mention this on our previous call. We have addressed the issue by reformulating those products and are currently shipping new Muscle Monster products with new graphics to our distributors. 
Following the consummation of the transactions with the Coca-Cola Company. The company receives substantial cash funds. The Board of Directors is considering options with regard to the return of capital, including share repurchases. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.7 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.2 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments increased to $52.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.2 million. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 42.6 days at June 30, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 43.5 days at June 30, 2014. Inventories increased to $180.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 54.4 days at June 30, 2015, which was lower than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 60.8 days at June 30, 2014. In the fall, we are planning to launch a new Juice Monster called Pipeline Punch and a new banana-flavored Muscle Monster, as well as Monster Ultra Black as a permanent SKU. We've also reformulated our Rojo Tea + Energy Rehab product as a Raspberry Tea + Energy product, which is currently in the process of being introduced. We have additional new product launches planned for the beginning of 2016. Our repositioned Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continued to show healthy gains. Growth sales in July 2015 in dollars were approximately 14.1% higher than in July 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in July were 19.2% higher than in July 2014. July 2014 included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. Specifically, the finished product segment, which comprises our Monster Energy brand products, grew 10.2% in July in dollars and 14.5% without a foreign exchange impact. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week, in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We are pleased that the Coca-Cola transaction closed on June 12 and are excited with the opportunity this presents to the company. North American and International gross margins are healthy and, in fact, have continued to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. We believe that the majority of the increases in dollar values achieved by Red Bull are attributable to their price increase, which they implemented in January. In units, sales of Red Bull in the United States increased by 5.5%, which is lower than the 9.1% increase in units achieved by Monster. We think that the resilience shown by consumers to Red Bull's increased pricing augurs well for our planned price increase in September. Importantly, on a unit basis, Monster continues to outperform Red Bull this year, which we believe is significant. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced last year continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. We believe that our Monster Ultra lines and additions and changes to our Rehab and Juice monster lines will continue to add sales -- to add to sales. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland, Greece and Chile. We are pleased with the improvement in July in our sales growth. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

So number one, can you just talk about what sort of driving some of that underlying improvement? Maybe it's the Coke system doing better or it's some of the new markets you're entering. And then even the improvement that you saw in July, kind of what's driving that? And then the markets that you're having some challenges, like Brazil and Italy, and maybe even other markets that we're having discussions about the transition, can you just elaborate on how much progress you're making? What are some of the early learnings that you're talking to these bottlers and just kind of thinking about the pace in which you can transition some of the bottlers to the Coke system?"
343729,308120763,851866,"Monster Beverage Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Monster Beverage Corporation","Executives","I think, that -- let me take the last question, first. In many of these markets, it's not a question of what we can do. The question is you've got existing distributors and bottlers who obviously, have heard about the Coke transaction and believe that the",794,"I think, that -- let me take the last question, first. In many of these markets, it's not a question of what we can do. The question is you've got existing distributors and bottlers who obviously, have heard about the Coke transaction and believe that they -- their territories will ultimately be transitioned to Coke. So what they've generally have really pulled back on, their investments in their markets, in investing, in putting extra effort, and although we've tried to, obviously, work with them and assure them and it affects their buyout to some extent, they really have mentally -- are not in the same place as they were when they were fully engaged as our full-time distributors. So the challenge we've got is in basically being able to conclude arrangements with the Coke bottlers as soon as possible to transition those markets. And that -- we've referred to that, there is a learning curve with the International Coke bottlers not only from a point of view of learning about our products, but the way we go to the market, the way we operate, the terms of our agreements using a finished product model, all of these things are not usual to -- generally, to the Coke bottlers. They have very different business models and contractual -- existing contractual relationships with the Coca-Cola Company. So there are some complex issues both with regard to the legal terms of the agreements and the economics and working out the value chains and these are being done and attended to, and we are having a discussion, but it is taking some time. And we just -- unfortunately, we've just got to be patient but what we do clearly see is there is a very big difference in the sales in both our sales-in and sales-out from distributors to please their depletions in markets where they are or non -- what I call non-transition markets, where the distributors know that they're going to stay with the brand, for example, the Coke, the CCR markets in Europe. Those markets are generally performing well and performing at a much higher level than the markets where there is a likelihood of a transition. There are some markets, on the other hand, where we've not made a decision to transition, and we've communicated that and been able to assure our distributor. Those markets are performing well. Particularly, you call out a market like Japan, where our partner has-- we've talked with them, and we're focused on continuing to operate with them and there, the market has done very well and they're continuing to perform fully. That is in international. And that is not a dissimilar situation in the U.S. If you take our markets in the U.S., where with it in some cases -- most cases they're existing Coke bottlers but in some cases we have some independent bottlers here, distributors or bottlers. And again, you're seeing a clear difference between the results of both our sales in and the sales in here, obviously, were also affected by the lower stockholding levels held by Coke Bottlers versus the AB, the new ones we've gone too. Yes, that was an additional factor. But even if you take that factor -- take that into account or put it to the side for the moment, when you look at the depletions in -- by the Coke bottlers in the transition territories, the depletions are lower than in the same company's non-transition territories. And it's clear that what's going on is that there is a learning curve. There were some out-of-stocks, but from our side and in retail, but it's also a learning curve because new sales teams have basically got to learn that Monster business, the velocity, the accounts that are -- those accounts that are higher in velocity, which don't necessarily replicate the accounts that are higher in velocity for traditional beverages. And so we think that, that's a transitory thing and this is the quarter where they've gone through it. It's the first 90 days of the transitions to the Coke system in the U.S. And so we think these are things that are just going to have to work their way out of it, and we are -- we believe we're starting to see improvements and some of that is now being reflected in the numbers that we're showing in our sales numbers for July. But, obviously, what you also can see is if you look at the Nielsen over this whole period, the Nielsen numbers in the U.S. have been pretty consistent on our sales-out in units, et cetera, which shows that the -- from the consumer point of view, there is still the similar retail pull in all these markets."

I think the issue is, as I indicated earlier, it's getting to be able to get them comfortable with the basis on which we do business, which is different to the traditional concentrate sort of model business that Coke has followed for centuries. And to get them to understand as we work through the legal issues such -- we're getting through value chain issues and generally they are, to the extent that we worked with them, they are all comfortable with the value chain issues that there are satisfactory ways, in which we can work to share the issue and they're excited by that. It's a positive for them. But we obviously, have to negotiate and get through. Everybody's trying to muscle each other at the moment to take a position, which will, obviously, be entrenched more going forward. So we're just having to work through those issues, but it will -- we are hopeful that we'll get through in most of them. If to the extent that we don't in any particular territory, we have options that we can go to. We have existing distributors. And a lot of the issues we are having with existing distributors, if we were to not transition the territory and go back to those distributors and basically assure them that we'll give them a longer-term contract and give them the assurance that they will have a longer term, that they have a number of years secured, we've got no doubt they will start to reinvest and reengage in the brand. It's just that we've not been able to do that because we haven't wanted to mislead them or give them any false hopes. And so that's been the delicate sort of tightrope we've been walking at the moment. So again, it doesn't mean that in every territory, we will go to a Coke bottler, but I don't think that, that is an issue. The issue at the moment is just getting everybody its time to deal in all these different countries and get everybody on the same page and get them comfortable with us.

They're just really not engaged, and some of the wholesalers they work with seem to be have disengaged as well. And then in some of the other markets, which are non-Coke bottlers, we're up -- almost -- when I say we're up, it's marginal, it's almost flat versus really not healthy gains in across the Coke bottler markets. So there is a very big distinction between those markets. But as to the percentage, I'm just guessing, I just don't have a number in my head or available at this point in time."

As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company closed on June 12, 2015. We are continuing to implement our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers worldwide. Our transition in Germany in July was successfully implemented, and we are starting to see an improvement in the quality of our distribution with and execution by that bottler. We are also pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the Coca-Cola and group that will be applied across 28 countries serviced by them for Coca-Cola. Monsters currently, being distributed through the Hellenic group in approximately 14 countries. We are currently in the process of signing agreements and planning for the transitions and/or launches of Monster in the remaining 14 countries within the Hellenic group's distribution network. Of particular note are our plans to transition our brand from our existing distributors in Italy, Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia to Hellenic, as well as to launch Monster in Russia through Hellenic before the end of this year. Another substantial opportunity for us with Hellenic is the planned launch of Monster in Nigeria in 2016. We have commenced discussions regarding the production of Monster locally with Hellenic in Nigeria, which is one of the 2 largest energy drink markets in Africa, the other being South Africa. 
Besides the agreement with Hellenic, we have also reach definitive agreements with the Coca-Cola Butler's in Spain and Portugal, which are a lot more markets for Monster. We are planning to transition the Monster in Spain and Portugal from our existing distributors to Coca-Cola Iberian partners early  in the first quarter of 2016. We hav had positive discussions with the Coca-Cola Bottlers in Southern Africa and are in the process of commencing the distribution of Monster in a number of countries in Southern and Central Africa through Coca-Cola Bottlers. We are planning to commence local production of Monster in South Africa in the next few months. We're also planning to launch Monster in China. We have filed applications for approval of our product and have commenced negotiations with the Coca-Cola Bottlers for production and distribution of Monster in China. Although the approval process could take longer, we're also planning to launch Monster in China in the first half of 2016. 
We're also pleased to report that we entered into a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola Beverage Company owned by LG Household and Healthcare Limited in Korea to distribute Monster in South Korea and are in the process of making transition arrangements with them. We are continuing negotiations regarding the perspective transitioning of Monster to Coca-Cola Bottlers in South and Central America, as well as in Australia. While we have made good progress, many legal and financial issues still need to be resolved. We are hopeful that we will be able to make further progress over the next few months. 
We have also engaged in ongoing negotiations to transition Monster to Coca-Cola Bottlers in a number of smaller countries worldwide. 
We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola energy brands, which we acquired and strategic brands as a concentrate business similar to the manner in which the Coca-Cola Company operate in such business prior to the closing of the transaction. Under the concentrate model, concentrate and their beverage basis is sold to Bottlers who add other common ingredients and continues to produce the finished product. We will able to continue to upgrade a finished product's model for our own Monster energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. Such arrangements will form part of our finished products segment. As previously indicated, our affordable segments will reflect our view of the business going forward. In this quarter, we reported 3 operating and reportable segments. One finished product, the principal product of which includes of the Company's Monster energy drink products, which previously comprised of the majority of the former DSD segment. Two, concentrate, the principal product, of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Three, other, the principal products of which includes the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transactions, including those, which previously comprised the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peach Tea brand. Sales in the quarter continued to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements, as well as the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network given the anticipated implementation of the transitions in their territories. Additionally, our bottling Great Britain experienced production issues causing production to be suspended for a number of weeks towards the end of the quarter and most of October resulting in lost sales to us both for the quarter and in October. While no substantial progress has made during the third quarter, results still affected by out of stock at retail were lower the level than in the previous quarter. 
Gross sales for the 2015 third quarter were $862.4 million compared to gross sales of $738.1 million in the comparable third quarter of 2014, an increase of 16.8%. Net sales in the 2015 third quarter was $756.6 million as compared to $636 million in the same period last year, an increase of 19%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $34.1 million on gross sales, and approximately $28.6 million on net sales. Gross and net sales were impacted by bonds purchases made by our customers in the quarter due to a price increase effective August 31, 2015 on certain of our Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that approximately $12 million of gross sales and $11 million of net sales in the quarter were attributable to such advanced purchases. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 61.5% as compared to 53.8% for the comparable 2014 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the finished product segment, as well as the sale of the non-energy brands, the price increase referred to earlier, lower costs of certain raw materials and changes in product sales mix. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 3.5% for the 2015 third quarter compared to 4.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% compared to 10.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Advertising costs, sponsorships and endorsements, as well as commissions in royalties were all higher in the third quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 third quarter were 8.8% as compared to 9.2% for the corresponding quarter last year. Overall expenses were up $7 million due partially to increase staffing in connection with the Coca-Cola transaction. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $7.4 million in the same quarter last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $207.8 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $173.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 20%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $170.6 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $136.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 25.2%. 
Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $34.1 million and a net sales of approximately $28.6 million. Including gross sales to customers outside the United States our sales to the Company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.

materially Influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the outside convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particle month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ended September 2015, the XO 30-week period vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value is compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12% in Great Britain, from 16.6% to 19.4% in the France; and from 8.9% to 12% in Germany.

I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and the IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 38% in the same period last year to 51.5% during the quarter. While Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe throughout the third quarter, growth in Spain and Italy, in particular, were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty following the Coca-Cola transaction. We believe that this situation will be reversed once Monster is transitioned in these countries to the Coca-Cola bottlers. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. EMEA traded profitably during the third quarter. We are continuing with the launch of Mega Monster in 553-ml cans in limited additional markets in Europe. Response from consumers has been positive, and we believe sales from Mega Monster aer largely incremental to sales of our original Monster 500-ml size products. In particular, in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales guidance, as well as increased market share. 
It is noteworthy that in many of our international markets where our distribution partners anticipate the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network. Sales levels as compared to the same period last year were markedly lower than the sales levels in those markets which are being managed by the Coca-Cola Bottlers system, also as compared to last year. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 64% in local currencies, and 42.6% in dollars over the comparable quarter last year. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean in the third quarter increased 65.8% in local currencies and 45.7% in dollars over the comparable period in 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions in Brazil, along with the uncertainty for the distributor they associated with the Coca-Cola transaction. 
In Japan, net sales increased by 11% in dollars and 34.1% in local currency during the quarter, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, net sales increased by 48.8% in dollars and 72.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the region in the third quarter of 2015. India continues to be impacted by regulatory issues and the continued to incur losses in the third quarter. We are addressing these issues and hope to achieve a resolution in the near future. 
We continue to be actively involved in discussions with prospective Coca-Cola Bottlers in numerous companies around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating a large number of local production opportunities with Coca-Cola Bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. As previously reported, we have reformulated and repositioned our Muscle Monster line. In September, a new Juice Monster drink top line Punch was launched exclusively with 7Eleven. During the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of the common stock in every purchase price of $134.43 per share. Purchases are made under our prior repurchase program authorized by the board, which has been exhausted, as well as under the new $500 million share repurchase program announced in September 2015. Subsequent to the close of the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.6 million shares."

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.5 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $34.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $1.5 million, which is now being redeemed in full. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43 days at September 30, 2015 and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 38.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $159.7 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014.

In November, we will be launching Pipeline Punch, as well as Ultra Black nationally. Our reposition Monster Energy Rehab, Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines all continued to make good progress. We are planning to launch additionally new products early in 2016. Gross sales in October 2015 in dollars adjusted for the advanced purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 6.8% higher than in October 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in October adjusted for the advanced purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 10.6% higher than in October 2014. October 2014 included the division and Peach Tea. October 2014 comes to a high, October also had 1 less selling day in October 2014 and is also negatively impacted by the production issues experienced in Great Britain. We caution again that sales in a single month and over shirt period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week, in which holidays fall and timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we continue to be pleased with the Coca-Cola transaction and the opportunity that this presents to the company. Two, North American and international gross margins are healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category continuing during to grow. Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. Ultra continues to perform well. We believe that the changes made to in the repositioning of our Rehab Juice and Punch Monster line have been be positive. With regard to its national markets, we are particularly pleased with the performance of the number of our international markets particularly Japan, Great Britain and Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, Chile, Ireland and Greece. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

If in the cases where we're going to transition Monster, we're transitioned M&As deltas and managed separately. You got months going into that Bottler, and we obviously have bought and paid for the strategic brands, and we are going to manage those brands. It is our job, obviously to cry, which is different to how Coke obviously look at competitors but now that we have both brands in the country, we're going to look to try and segment them and position them differently. But they both are important brandsd. They both are in each country or good contributors to our bottom line a to our growth as a company and to giving us a stronger position in the overall in the energy category in that country if you aggregate the 2 brands, in many countries it gives us a very strong and leading position, which, I think, also helps us. And obviously from a management point of view, where we can use the same staff, we will try and rationalize it. But in some cases, we feel you do need additional staffs that you take and focus on their own brand in a country. So attrition the attrition will come from if the brand is not strong enough in the particular country to sustain its distribution or shelf space then, there will attrition. But obviously, we're going to try and put focus on it and try and avoid that. At the moment, obviously, we gained through learning curve with some of the new brands. We are repositioning the new brands. We are looking to redesign them and reevaluate their size containers and whether we have a different size or a single size in some markets, there are too many size containers and different flavors in different countries for the same brand. We're trying to rationalize some of the and improve some of the flavors. We have plans to introduce a new -- some innovation and some new flavors for these brands, the strategic brands in 2016.

We don't think that they will take that long, but we think we're hoping in the next few months to start getting some positive response and maybe get some approvals. But we really don't know how long it is. We've not done it before, so we don't know. And we do have sort of different ingredients and therefore, different timeline then we can just simply look back and compare a solid and say how long does it take for a soda to get approved? I mean, it's a different product with different ingredients,but we are still believe that we have a good prospects of launching in the first half perhaps a little later than in thought maybe a few months ago, but you still think that we have a good chance of going in the first half of launching in China. Perhaps Hilton will then take your other question."

As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company closed on June 12, 2015. We are continuing to implement our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. Our transition in Germany in July was successfully implemented, and we are starting to see an improvement in the quality of our distribution with and execution by their bottler. We are also pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the Coca-Cola Hellenic group that will be applied across 28 countries serviced by them for Coca-Cola. Monster is currently being distributed through the Hellenic group in approximately 14 countries. We are currently in the process of signing agreements and planning for the transitions and/or launches of Monster in the remaining 14 countries within the Hellenic group's distribution network. Of particular note are our plans to transition our brand from our existing distributors in Italy, Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia to Hellenic, as well as to launch Monster in Russia through Hellenic before the end of this year. Another substantial opportunity for us with Hellenic is the planned launch of Monster in Nigeria in 2016. We have commenced discussions regarding the production of Monster locally with Hellenic in Nigeria, which is one of the 2 largest energy drink markets in Africa, the other being South Africa. 
Besides the agreement with Hellenic, we have also reach definitive agreements with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Spain and Portugal, which are large markets for Monster. We are planning to transition Monster in Spain and Portugal from our existing distributors to Coca-Cola Iberian Partners early in the first quarter of 2016. We have had positive discussions with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Southern Africa and are in the process of commencing the distribution of Monster in a number of countries in Southern and Central Africa through Coca-Cola bottlers. We are planning to commence local production of Monster in South Africa in the next few months. We are also planning to launch Monster in China. We have filed applications for approval of our product and have commenced negotiations with the Coca-Cola bottlers for production and distribution of Monster in China. Although the approval process could take longer, we are still planning to launch Monster in China in the first half of 2016. 
We are also pleased to report that we entered into a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola Beverage Company owned by LG Household & Health Care Limited in Korea to distribute Monster in South Korea and are in the process of making transition arrangements with them. We are continuing negotiations regarding the prospective transitioning of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South and Central America, as well as in Australia. While we have made good progress, many legal and financial issues still need to be resolved. We are hopeful that we will be able to make further progress over the next few months. 
We have also engaged in ongoing negotiations to transition Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of smaller countries worldwide. 
We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola energy brands, which we acquired and refer to as our strategic brands as a concentrate business similar to the manner in which the Coca-Cola Company operated such business prior to the closing of the transaction. Under the concentrate model, concentrate and/or beverage basis is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients and containers to produce the finished product. We will able to continue to operate a finished product's model for our own Monster energy drinks, consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. Such arrangements will form part of our Finished Products segment. As previously indicated, our reportable segments will reflect our view of the business going forward. In this quarter, we report on 3 operating and reportable segments. One, Finished Product, the principal product of which include the company's Monster energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment. Two, Concentrate, the principal product of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Three, other, the principal products of which includes the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transactions, including those, which previously comprised the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea brand. Sales in the quarter continued to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements, as well as the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network given the anticipated implementation of the transitions in their territories. Additionally, our bottler in Great Britain experienced production issues causing production to be suspended for a number of weeks towards the end of the quarter and most of October resulting in lost sales to us both for the quarter and in October. Although substantial progress was made during the third quarter, results was still affected by out of stocks at retail were lower the level than in the previous quarter. 
Gross sales for the 2015 third quarter were $862.4 million compared to gross sales of $738.1 million in the comparable third quarter of 2014, an increase of 16.8%. Net sales in the 2015 third quarter was $756.6 million as compared to $636 million in the same period last year, an increase of 19%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $34.1 million on gross sales, and approximately $28.6 million on net sales. Gross and net sales were impacted by bonds purchases made by our customers in the quarter due to a price increase effective August 31, 2015 on certain of our Monster 16-ounce energy drinks. We estimate that approximately $12 million of gross sales and $11 million of net sales in the quarter were attributable to such advanced purchases. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 61.5% as compared to 53.8% for the comparable 2014 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, as well as the sale of the non-energy brands, the price increase referred to earlier, lower costs of certain raw materials and changes in product sales mix. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 3.5% for the 2015 third quarter compared to 4.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% compared to 10.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Advertising costs, sponsorships and endorsements, as well as commissions in royalties were all higher in the third quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 third quarter were 8.8% as compared to 9.2% for the corresponding quarter last year. Overall expenses were up $7 million due partially to increase staffing in connection with the Coca-Cola transaction. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $7.4 million in the same quarter last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $207.8 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $173.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 20%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $170.6 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $136.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 25.2%. 
Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $34.1 million and a net sales of approximately $28.6 million. Including gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 24, 2015, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandises, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots increased by 10.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9.3% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 6.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased 11.2%, sales of Rockstar increased by 28.5%; sales of 5-Hour increased 2.8%; and sales of AMP decrease 3.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 24, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 4.3% over the same period last year, while NOS is up 3.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5.5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 11.2%; Rockstar was up 32.1%; 5-Hour was up 3.5%; and AMP was down 6.6%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended October 24; 2015, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 34.9%. NOS's share decreased by 0.2 of a point to 3.9%, Full Throttle share decreased 0.2 of a point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share increased to 0.8 points to 34.8%, slightly below Monster share. Rockstar share was up 1.5 points at 8.2%, which is similar to the market share Rockstar had 2 years ago. 5-Hours share was lower at 8.2% and AMP's share decrease 0.3 points to 2%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 24, 2015, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 5.9% higher than in the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 16.6% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 19, 2015 the energy drink category increased 8%. Monster sales were up 32% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 5.7 points to 30.4% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 2.5 points to 39.1%. Rockstar sales increased 6% and its market share decreased 0.4 points to 16%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 31% in the month of August 2015. Monster sales increased 24%. Our market share decreased 1.8 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired brands, increased 8% while our Burn's market share decreased 1.1 points to 5.2%. Red Bull sales increased 8% and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 17.8%. Vive 100's market share increased 5.1 points to 26.9, while Boost market share decreased 0.1 of a point to 13.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ended September 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value is compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12% in Great Britain, from 16.6% to 19.4% in the France; and from 8.9% to 12% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 8% to 9% in Sweden; from 7.9% to 8.7% in Belgium; and from 5.6% to 6.1% in The Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending August 2015 is compared to the same period last year decreased from 17.6% to 15.7% in South Africa, although in local currencies, sales were higher. Monster's retail market chain value for the 13 weeks ending September 2015 in Spain decreased from 22.7% to 22.1% and in Italy decreased from 12.6% to 10.3%. These lesser 3 markets all have independent distributors. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of September 2015 from 28.2% to 29.4%. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and the IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 18.3% as compared to 11.8% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of September declined from 5.7 to 3.7 as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, for the month of September 2015, the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 30% to 39.2%. The launch of Monster Energy Ultra in Japan has been positive and sales continue to be solid. As stated earlier, the company has provided support of both segments into Finished Products, Concentrate and other. Net sales for the Finished Products segment, formerly DSD segment, but excluding Peace Tea, increased 15.5% to $686.7 million and operating income for the Finished Products segment increased 25.3% to $289.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. 
Net sales for the Finished Products segment were negatively impacted by approximately $23.1 million of foreign currency movements and operating income for the Finished Products segment was negatively impacted by approximately $2.5 million of distributed termination process. 
Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment was $69.9 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2015 and operating income for the Concentrate segment was $45.3 million. Net sales for the Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $5.5 million of foreign currency movements. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the other segment during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $41.6 million of net sales in the third quarter of 2014. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the third quarter in local currencies increased 45.4% and 19.9% in dollars over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 38% in the same period last year to 51.5% during the quarter. While Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe throughout the third quarter, growth in Spain and Italy, in particular, were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty following the Coca-Cola transaction. We believe that this situation will be reversed once Monster is transitioned in these countries to the Coca-Cola bottlers. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. EMEA traded profitably during the third quarter. We are continuing with the launch of Mega Monster in 553-ml cans in limited additional markets in Europe. Response from consumers has been positive, and we believe sales from Mega Monster are largely incremental to sales of our original Monster 500-ml size products. In particular, in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales guidance, as well as increased market share. 
It is noteworthy that in many of our international markets where our distribution partners anticipate the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network. Sales levels as compared to the same period last year were markedly lower than the sales levels in those markets which are being managed by the Coca-Cola bottler system, also as compared to last year. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 64% in local currencies, and 42.6% in dollars over the comparable quarter last year. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean in the third quarter increased 65.8% in local currencies and 45.7% in dollars over the comparable period in 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions in Brazil, along with the uncertainty for the distributor they associated with the Coca-Cola transaction. 
In Japan, net sales increased by 11% in dollars and 34.1% in local currency during the quarter, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, net sales increased by 48.8% in dollars and 72.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the region in the third quarter of 2015. India continues to be impacted by regulatory issues and we continue to incur losses there in the third quarter. We are addressing these issues and hope to achieve a resolution in the near future. 
We continue to be actively involved in discussions with prospective Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous companies around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating a large number of local production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. As previously reported, we have reformulated and repositioned our Muscle Monster line. In September, a new Juice Monster drink named Pipeline Punch was launched exclusively with 7-Eleven. During the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of the common stock an average purchase price of $134.43 per share. Purchases are made under a prior repurchase program authorized by the board, which has been exhausted, as well as under the new $500 million share repurchase program announced in September 2015. Subsequent to the close of the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.6 million shares."

The company has approximately $250 million available under its current board authorized repurchase program. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.5 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $34.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $1.5 million, which are now being redeemed in full. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43 days at September 30, 2015 and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 38.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $159.7 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 49.4 days at September 30, 2015, which was lower than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014. 
In November, we will be launching Pipeline Punch, as well as Ultra Black nationally. Our reposition of Monster Energy Rehab, Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines all continue to make good progress. We are planning to launch additional new products early in 2016. Gross sales in October 2015 in dollars adjusted for the advanced purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 6.8% higher than in October 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in October adjusted for the advanced purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 10.6% higher than in October 2014. October 2014 included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. October 2014 comes to a high. October also had one less selling day than October 2014 and is also negatively impacted by the production issues experienced in Great Britain. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week, in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we continue to be pleased with the Coca-Cola transaction and the opportunity that this presents to the company. Two, North American and international gross margins are healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category is continuing to grow. Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. Ultra continues to perform well. We believe that the changes made to and the repositioning of our Rehab Juice and Punch Monster lines have been be positive. With regard to its national markets, we are particularly pleased with the performance of the number of our international markets particularly Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, Chile, Ireland and Greece. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

The second thing is we have looked at the tax rate and we believe here and obviously, we stand corrected, but we think our tax rates should be more normalized at about 37.5%."

So we believe that, that you just should not have that high regard or influence on the single-month numbers.

And if we have a portfolio that we've acquired in the Japan and just isn't one, but in other countries if there is one, then that would be managed through the Coke bottler. We've taken the [indiscernible] of the Coke distribution arrangement and contract and they will simply be managed. If in the cases where we're going to transition Monster, we're transitioned M&As deltas and managed separately. You've got Monster going into that bottler, and we obviously have bought and paid for the strategic brands, and we are going to manage those brands. It is our job, obviously, to cry, which is different to how Coke obviously look at their competitors. But now that we have both brands in a country, we're going to look to try and segment them and position them differently. But they both are important brands. They both are in each country or are good contributors to our bottom line and to our growth as a company and to giving us a stronger position in the overall, in the energy category in that country if you aggregate the 2 brands. In many countries, it gives us a very strong and leading position, which, I think, also helps us. And obviously from a management point of view, where we can use the same staff, we will try to rationalize it. But in some cases, we feel you do need additional staffs that you take and focus on their own brand in a country. So there only will be attrition -- the attrition will come by from if the brand is not strong enough in the particular country to sustain its distribution or shelf space then, there will attrition. But obviously, we're going to try and put focus on it and try and avoid that. So at the moment, obviously, we gained through learning curve with some of the new brands. We are repositioning the new brands. We are looking to redesign them and reevaluate their size containers and whether we have a different size or a single size in some markets, there are too many size containers and different flavors in different countries for the same brand. We're trying to rationalize some of the -- that improve some of the flavors. We have plans to introduce a new -- some innovation and some new flavors for these brands, the strategic brands in 2016. So we are positive about them and that they will be managed to differently, and they will managed separately, but we obviously are looking to continue to put support behind and to do our best with both -- with all the brands that we have in our portfolio, with the energy focus that remains our focus in that category."

And again, without -- having taken the final decision, it is unlikely that we're going to have some sort of massive national launch with big TV campaigns behind it. We like to go into a country, we'll take a number of areas or a number of types of change or clause of business and focus on that and roll it up. And it may mean that it takes -- sometime, it doesn't -- it may not go through all of the provinces. China is very, very big, like I say, in America, how would we launch. We launch in America in one county, in San Diego. Red Bull launched in one county in Northern California. And then you sit down and grow from there and develop it. We think that, that's type of launch and not necessarily one county or only one city but, that type of launch is far better. If it's a smaller country, it's a lot easier to get your distribution up, but China is a massive country, it's like a continent. And we're going to -- we're still working through the strategy as to how do we launch, where do we launch, which cities do we launch in, do we launch a little slower in 2 different or 3 different types of cities to more modern or a little more traditional. Get the response and see how we're positioning the brand. We are going into a new market with a new culture and new consumers, and it is very, very -- we believe, very -- a great opportunity for the company, an enormous drag, but we need to do it correctly, and we need to do it right. And we are right in the middle of those process. So it's premature for us to give you any further direction. As to the process, there are a number of alternative categories in which we believe our drinks can control. We made applications in 2 places for our products in 2 or 3 different categories. Those are currently being processed. I don't know how long it will take. We don't think that they will take that long, but we think we're hoping in the next few months to start getting some positive response and maybe get some approvals. But we really don't know how long it is. We've not done it before, so we don't know. And we do have sort of different ingredients and therefore, different timeline. We can't just simply look back and compare a soda and say, well, how long does it take for a soda to get approved? I mean, it's a different product with different ingredients, but we are still believe that we have a good prospects of launching in the first half perhaps a little later than -- and thought maybe a few months ago, but we still think that we have a good chance of going in the first half of launching in China. Perhaps Hilton will then take the -- your other question."

As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company closed on June 12, 2015. We are continuing to implement our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. Our transition in Germany in July was successfully implemented, and we are starting to see an improvement in the quality of our distribution with and execution by their bottler. We are also pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the Coca-Cola Hellenic group that will be applied across 28 countries serviced by them for Coca-Cola. Monster is currently being distributed through the Hellenic group in approximately 14 countries. We are currently in the process of signing agreements and planning for the transitions and/or launches of Monster in the remaining 14 countries within the Hellenic group's distribution network. Of particular note are our plans to transition our brand from our existing distributors in Italy, Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia to Hellenic, as well as to launch Monster in Russia through Hellenic before the end of this year. Another substantial opportunity for us with Hellenic is the planned launch of Monster in Nigeria in 2016. We have commenced discussions regarding the production of Monster locally with Hellenic in Nigeria, which is one of the 2 largest energy drink markets in Africa, the other being South Africa. 
Besides the agreement with Hellenic, we have also reach definitive agreements with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Spain and Portugal, which are large markets for Monster. We are planning to transition Monster in Spain and Portugal from our existing distributors to Coca-Cola Iberian Partners early in the first quarter of 2016. We have had positive discussions with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Southern Africa and are in the process of commencing the distribution of Monster in a number of countries in Southern and Central Africa through Coca-Cola bottlers. We are planning to commence local production of Monster in South Africa in the next few months. We are also planning to launch Monster in China. We have filed applications for approval of our product and have commenced negotiations with the Coca-Cola bottlers for production and distribution of Monster in China. Although the approval process could take longer, we are still planning to launch Monster in China in the first half of 2016. 
We are also pleased to report that we entered into a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola Beverage Company owned by LG Household & Health Care Limited in Korea to distribute Monster in South Korea and are in the process of making transition arrangements with them. We are continuing negotiations regarding the prospective transitioning of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South and Central America, as well as in Australia. While we have made good progress, many legal and financial issues still need to be resolved. We are hopeful that we will be able to make further progress over the next few months. 
We have also engaged in ongoing negotiations to transition Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of smaller countries worldwide. 
We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola energy brands, which we acquired and refer to as our strategic brands as a concentrate business similar to the manner in which the Coca-Cola Company operated such business prior to the closing of the transaction. Under the concentrate model, concentrate and/or beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients and containers to produce the finished product. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product's model for our own Monster energy drinks, consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. Such arrangements will form part of our Finished Products segment. As previously indicated, our reportable segments will reflect our view of the business going forward. In this quarter, we report on 3 operating and reportable segments. One, Finished Product, the principal product of which include the company's Monster energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment. Two, Concentrate, the principal product of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Three, other, the principal products of which includes the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, including those, which previously comprised the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea brand. Sales in the quarter continued to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements, as well as the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network given the anticipated implementation of the transitions in their territories. Additionally, our bottler in Great Britain experienced production issues causing production to be suspended for a number of weeks towards the end of the quarter and most of October, resulting in lost sales to us both for the quarter and in October. Although substantial progress was made during the third quarter, results were still affected by out of stocks at retail, although at a lower level than in the previous quarter. 
Gross sales for the 2015 third quarter were $862.4 million compared to gross sales of $738.1 million in the comparable third quarter of 2014, an increase of 16.8%. Net sales in the 2015 third quarter was $756.6 million as compared to $636 million in the same period last year, an increase of 19%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $34.1 million on gross sales, and approximately $28.6 million on net sales. Gross and net sales were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the quarter due to a price increase effective August 31, 2015 on certain of our Monster 16-ounce energy drinks. We estimate that approximately $12 million of gross sales and $11 million of net sales in the quarter were attributable to such advance purchases. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 61.5% as compared to 53.8% for the comparable 2014 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, as well as the sale of the non-energy brands, the price increase referred to earlier, lower costs of certain raw materials and changes in product sales mix. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 3.5% for the 2015 third quarter compared to 4.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% compared to 10.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Advertising costs, sponsorships and endorsements, as well as commissions and royalties were all higher in the third quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 third quarter were 8.8% as compared to 9.2% for the corresponding quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with the Coca-Cola transaction. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $7.4 million in the same quarter last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $207.8 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $173.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 20%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $170.6 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $136.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 25.2%. 
Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $34.1 million and on net sales of approximately $28.6 million. Including gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 24, 2015, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandises, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots increased by 10.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9.3% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 6.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased 11.2%, sales of Rockstar increased by 28.5%; sales of 5-Hour increased 2.8%; and sales of AMP decreased 3.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 24, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 4.3% over the same period last year, while NOS is up 3.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5.5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 11.2%; Rockstar was up 32.1%; 5-Hour was up 3.5%; and AMP was down 6.6%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended October 24, 2015, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 34.9%. NOS's share decreased by 0.2 of a point to 3.9%, Full Throttle share decreased 0.2 of a point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.8 points to 34.8%, slightly below Monster share. Rockstar share was up 1.5 points at 8.2%, which is similar to the market share Rockstar had 2 years ago. 5-Hours' share was lower at 8.2% and AMP's share decrease 0.3 points to 2%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 24, 2015, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 5.9% higher than in the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 16.6% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 19, 2015 the energy drink category increased 8%. Monster sales were up 32% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 5.7 points to 30.4% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 2.5 points to 39.1%. Rockstar sales increased 6% and its market share decreased 0.4 points to 16%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 31% in the month of August 2015. Monster sales increased 24%. Our market share decreased 1.8 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired brands, increased 8% while our Burn's market share decreased 1.1 points to 5.2%. Red Bull sales increased 8% and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 17.8%. Vive 100's market share increased 5.1 points to 26.9, while Boost market share decreased 0.1 of a point to 13.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ended September 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12% in Great Britain, from 16.6% to 19.4% in France; and from 8.9% to 12% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 8% to 9% in Sweden; from 7.9% to 8.7% in Belgium; and from 5.6% to 6.1% in The Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended in the August 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 17.6% to 15.7% in South Africa, although in local currencies, sales were higher. Monster's retail market chain value for the 13 weeks ending September 2015 in Spain decreased from 22.7% to 22.1% and in Italy decreased from 12.6% to 10.3%. These latter 3 markets all have independent distributors. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of September 2015 from 28.2% to 29.4%. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and the IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 18.3% as compared to 11.8% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of September declined from 5.7 to 3.7 as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, for the month of September 2015, the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 30% to 39.2%. The launch of Monster Energy Ultra in Japan has been positive and sales continue to be solid. As stated earlier, the company has revised its report of both segments into Finished Products, Concentrate and other. Net sales for the Finished Products segment, formerly DSD segment, but excluding Peace Tea, increased 15.5% to $686.7 million and operating income for the Finished Products segment increased 25.3% to $289.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. 
Net sales for the Finished Products segment were negatively impacted by approximately $23.1 million of foreign currency movements and operating income for the Finished Products segment was negatively impacted by approximately $2.5 million of distributor termination costs. 
Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment was $69.9 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2015 and operating income for the Concentrate segment was $45.3 million. Net sales for the Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $5.5 million of foreign currency movements. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the other segment during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $41.6 million of net sales in the third quarter of 2014. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the third quarter in local currencies increased 45.4% and 19.9% in dollars over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 38% in the same period last year to 51.5% during the quarter. While Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe throughout the third quarter, growth in Spain and Italy, in particular, were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty following the Coca-Cola transaction. We believe that this situation will be reversed once Monster is transitioned in these countries to the Coca-Cola bottlers. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. EMEA traded profitably during the third quarter. We are continuing with the launch of Mega Monster in 553-ml cans in limited additional markets in Europe. Response from consumers has been positive, and we believe sales from Mega Monster are largely incremental to sales of our original Monster 500-ml size products. In particular, in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales guidance, as well as increased market share. 
It is noteworthy that in many of our international markets where our distribution partners anticipate the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels as compared to the same period last year were markedly lower than the sales levels in those markets which are being managed by the Coca-Cola bottler system, also as compared to last year. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 64% in local currencies, and 42.6% in dollars over the comparable quarter last year. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean in the third quarter increased 65.8% in local currencies and 45.7% in dollars over the comparable period in 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions in Brazil, along with the uncertainty for the distributor there associated with the Coca-Cola transaction. 
In Japan, net sales increased by 11% in dollars and 34.1% in local currency during the quarter, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, net sales increased by 48.8% in dollars and 72.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the region in the third quarter of 2015. India continues to be impacted by regulatory issues and we continue to incur losses there in the third quarter. We are addressing these issues and hope to achieve a resolution in the near future. 
We continue to be actively involved in discussions with prospective Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous companies around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating a large number of local production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. As previously reported, we have reformulated and repositioned our Muscle Monster line. In September, a new Juice Monster drink named Pipeline Punch was launched exclusively with 7-Eleven. During the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of the common stock at an average purchase price of $134.43 per share. Purchases were made under a prior repurchase program authorized by the board, which has been exhausted, as well as under the new $500 million share repurchase program announced in September 2015. Subsequent to the close of the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.6 million shares."

The company has approximately $250 million available under its current board authorized repurchase program. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.5 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $34.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $1.5 million, which have now being redeemed in full. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43 days at September 30, 2015 and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 38.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $159.7 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 49.4 days at September 30, 2015, which was lower than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014. 
In November, we will be launching Pipeline Punch, as well as Ultra Black nationally. Our reposition of Monster Energy Rehab, Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines all continue to make good progress. We are planning to launch additional new products early in 2016. Gross sales in October 2015 in dollars adjusted for the advance purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 6.8% higher than in October 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in October adjusted for the advance purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 10.6% higher than in October 2014. October 2014 included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. October 2014 comes to a high. October also had one less selling day than October 2014 and is also negatively impacted by the production issues experienced in Great Britain. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week, in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we continue to be pleased with the Coca-Cola transaction and the opportunity that this presents to the company. Two, North American and international gross margins are healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category is continuing to grow. Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. Ultra continues to perform well. We believe that the changes made to and the repositioning of our Rehab, Juice and Punch Monster lines have been be positive. With regard to its national markets, we are particularly pleased with the performance of the number of our international markets particularly Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, Chile, Ireland and Greece. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

The whole strategy is that in those countries that we stay with our existing distributors like Japan, then they will stay with whatever portfolio they have. And if we have a portfolio that we've acquired, in Japan there just isn't one, but in other countries where there is one, then that would be managed through the Coke bottler. We've taken the assignment of the Coke distribution arrangement and contract and they will simply be managed. If in the cases where we're going to transition Monster, we're transitioned M&As deltas [ph] and managed separately. You've got Monster going into that bottler, and we obviously have bought and paid for the strategic brands, and we are going to manage those brands. It is our job, obviously to try, which is different to how Coke obviously look at their competitors. But now that we have both brands in a country, we're going to look to try and segment them and position them differently. But they both are important brands. They both are in each country, are good contributors to our bottom line and to our growth as a company and to giving us a stronger position in the overall, in the energy category in that country if you aggregate the 2 brands. In many countries, it gives us a very strong and leading position, which, I think, also helps us. And obviously from a management point of view, where we can use the same staff, we will try to rationalize it. But in some cases, we feel you do need additional staffs so that they can focus on their own brand in a country. So there only will be attrition -- the attrition will come by from if the brand is not strong enough in the particular country to sustain its distribution or shelf space then, there will attrition. But obviously, we're going to try and put focus on it and try and avoid that. So at the moment, obviously, we're going through learning curve with some of the new brands. We are repositioning the new brands. We are looking to redesign them and reevaluate their size containers and whether we have a different size or a single size in some markets, there are too many size containers and different flavors in different countries for the same brand. We're trying to rationalize some of the -- and improve some of the flavors. We have plans to introduce a new -- some innovation and some new flavors for these brands, the strategic brands in 2016. So we are positive about them but that they will be managed to differently, and they will managed separately, but we obviously are looking to continue to put support behind and to do our best with both -- with all the brands that we have in our portfolio, with the energy focus that remains our focus in that category."

Any risk that it gets delayed into the back half? And then just in terms of distribution opportunity, just given the strength of the Coca-Cola system in that country, do you expect to see distribution ramp up pretty quickly in China versus some of the other countries that you've entered? And then the second question is really on return of capital that in prior calls, you have commented on the board actively looking at ways to return more cash to shareholders. Obviously, you still have a pretty sizable cash balance on your balance sheet, but any sort of update in terms of the board's willingness to actually take on some leverage and return even more cash to shareholders?"

I'll address the first one, is divide the questions up. On distribution in China, we are looking at going into China not very differently to how we've addressed most of the markets where we believe we have the best prospects of success. And again, without -- having taken the final decision, it is unlikely that we're going to have some sort of massive national launch with big TV campaigns behind it. We like to go into a country, we'll take a number of areas or a number of types of chains or class of business and focus on that and roll it up. And it may mean that it takes -- sometime, it doesn't -- it may not go through all of the provinces. China is very, very big, like I say, in America, how would we launch. We launched in America in one county, in San Diego. Red Bull launched in one county in Northern California. And then you sit down and grow from there and develop it. We think that, that's type of launch and not necessarily one county or only one city but, that type of launch is far better. If it's a smaller country, it's a lot easier to get your distribution up, but China is a massive country, it's like a continent. And we're going to -- we're still working through the strategy as to how do we launch, where do we launch, which cities do we launch in, do we launch a little slower in 2 different or 3 different types of cities, more modern or a little more traditional. Get the response and see how we're positioning the brand. We are going into a new market with a new culture and new consumers, and it is very, very -- we believe, very -- a great opportunity for the company, an enormous drag, but we need to do it correctly, and we need to do it right. And we are right in the middle of those process. So it's premature for us to give you any further direction. As to the process, there are a number of alternative categories in which we believe our drinks can control. We made applications in 2 places for our products in 2 or 3 different categories. Those are currently being processed. I don't know how long it will take. We don't think that they will take that long, but we think we're hoping in the next few months to start getting some positive response and maybe get some approvals. But we really don't know how long it is. We've not done it before, so we don't know. And we do have sort of different ingredients and therefore, different timeline. We can't just simply look back and compare a soda and say, well, how long does it take for a soda to get approved? I mean, it's a different product with different ingredients, but we are still believe that we have a good prospects of launching in the first half perhaps a little later than thought maybe a few months ago, but we still think that we have a good shot of going in -- the first half of launching in China. Perhaps Hilton will then take the -- your other question."
