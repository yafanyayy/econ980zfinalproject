Our Q2 results reflect continued progress, as we transform Cisco to become the #1 IT company. In the quarter, we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We gen",2836,"Mel, thank you very much. Our Q2 results reflect continued progress, as we transform Cisco to become the #1 IT company. 
In the quarter, we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We delivered this strong performance despite a volatile economic environment. Our strong momentum is the direct result of how well we have managed our company transformation over the last 3-plus years and our leadership position in the key technology transitions such as cloud, mobility, Big Data, security, collaboration and the Internet of Everything. 
The 4 key takeaways I have from this quarter are the following: first, we are executing well and growing at a healthy pace in a tough environment; second, we saw very good balance growth, the best balance in 12 quarters across the majority of our key geographies, product categories and customer segments; third, our financials are very strong, and we continue to deliver value for our shareholders with strong earnings, cash generation and capital return, including another $0.02 dividend increase to $0.21 per quarter; and fourth, every country, every city, every business, every home and every car is becoming digital. In our view, Cisco is better positioned than any other company to help our customers reinvent their business and technology strategies as they become digital organizations. 
Today, every company in every industry is a technology digital company, something people would not have said a year ago. Over the last month, I've met individually with over 100 business and government leaders. Without exception, these leaders recognize the role technology plays in their future, not just how it creates opportunity but also risk. Customers around the world, both business and governments, are aligning with strategic partners in order to be more successful in the digital transition. They're increasing choosing Cisco as their strategic partner, and you are seeing the evidence in our financial performance. 
Let's start with the basic question, like why Cisco. With the network at the center, Cisco has the portfolio and ability to bring our customer solutions to drive down cost, help secure their businesses and increase the speed and agility so they can innovate across their own organizations. In our view, our track record of disrupting markets by leveraging the power of Internet is unmatched. Our strategy has always been based on understanding the direction of market transitions, transforming our sales to meet the needs of our customers and demonstrating the courage to disrupt not just the markets but even ourselves. 
The market is moving fast, and change is exponential. We are in the strong position today we are today because we've made dramatic moves in how we're innovating, how we're interfacing with our most important customers and how we're organized. To ensure Cisco is leading where the market is going, most companies resist changing until it's too late, and their market credibility is eroding, a classic innovator's dilemma. It was our choice to move early and boldly with incredible speed to realign 40% of our employees to priority areas, to reorganize from product groups and to integrate solution teams, to replace more than 30% of our leaders. We are seeing the results in our relevancy with our customers and our operational excellence, and that is driving our financial performance. Whereas in fiscal year '11, we have added $4.9 billion in revenue, with about $300 million in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, with every dollar of revenue we've added over this transition period, we've only added about $0.06 of non-GAAP OpEx. I think you'll find this as best-in-class by factor of five- to tenfold. 
In the '90s, we were the best example of a company capitalizing on the Internet, and that gave us tremendous credibility with customers and fueled our growth. Today, as every company becomes digital, every CEO knows he or she needs to evolve the organization, to move with speed, agility and efficiency, the Internet of Everything will demand of them. Our strategy is to be the model in how we reorganize and the customers we're driving as a result, and we've the heavy lifting with our peers, and customers are just starting. As a result, I'm now spending a significant amount of time with our customers' executive teams and in their boardrooms discussing how they organize for digitization, innovation, security and the Internet of Everything. We could not be better positioned in the market. We've worked very hard to get here. And the opportunity goes very much like it did in the '90s when the Internet became mission-critical to our customers. 
We have said for several years that we believe the impact of Internet of Everything would be 5 to 10x greater than that of the Internet today. At CES and the World Economic Forum, most every leader we saw agreed. We have been building for this opportunity. We have the innovation, operational excellence, speed, agility and efficiencies in our business to drive the greatest possible benefit for our customers, our partners and our shareholders. 
On the guidance. As we've said for the last 2 quarters, we are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing well again. We are well positioned to a positive turn in either search provider or emerging markets, but we are not modeling those turns for several quarters despite the better results we saw in this last quarter for reasons you're all very much aware of. 
For Q3, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.51 to $0.53. 
Let me now provide some additional detail on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments, products and services business within our portfolio. 
In terms of business momentum, as a reminder, the geographies are primarily the way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year, unless otherwise noted. 
We finished the quarter with product orders up 5% and product book-to-bill greater than 1. 
Let's move first to the Americas. The U.S. continued to accelerate growing 7% compared with Q1 3% growth. Latin America returned to double-digit growth at 12% versus Q1 of 5% and negative growth in fiscal year '14. Strengthened U.S. public sector continued growing 17%, with U.S. federal growing 23% and U.S. state and local growing 8%. 
Moving on to our Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. As we said on last quarter's conference call, we were more optimistic about Europe than most of our peers. And we saw that business play out as we called, with growth in the EMEA up 7% year-over-year. 
We saw phenomenal execution in the U.K., up 17%; Germany, up 12%; and [indiscernible] in the industry is coming even close to Southern Europe actually grew 7% year-over-year, speaking to the relevancy that we provide to companies and governments. 
Over the last 6 quarters, our growth year-over-year in EMEA has grown from minus 4% to minus 2%, to minus 1% to 2%, to 6% in Q1 and now 7% in Q2. And we remain cautiously optimistic. 
In Asia Pacific, Japan and China. In China, in particular, we continued to see challenges that all of you are aware of, and we saw our China business decline by 19%. However, we saw India grow by 11%. The rest of APJC, not including China, was down 1% this quarter. 
And finally, emerging markets. Emerging markets total grew 1%, with emerging markets excluding BRICS plus Mexico up 8%, a major change from last quarter. 
We continue to see the BRICS by symmetrical challenge down 6% in total, with Russia down 16%; Brazil down 8%; China, as I've said earlier, down 19%. We did see growth in Mexico up 21%; India up 11%. While we are pleased with these results, we believe it is still way too early to call a turn in emerging markets and are modeling for them to be challenging for several more quarters. 
Customer segments. Total global commercial grew at a healthy 8%. Our success in the U.S. commercial continues to be very strong, up 12% in Q2. We have built a model based on success in the U.S. commercial and best practices from around the world and have implemented the model outside the U.S., seeing our orders grow from down 5% in fiscal year '14 to up 4% year-to-date. In total Cisco business terms, that improved performance added a full [ph] point to our company's growth rates. 
Our new operating model and global service provider is also showing similar traction. This quarter, our Service Provider business was down 1% after having been down on average 10% or more for the last 5 quarters. Like many in the industry, we are modeling total Global Service Provider CapEx down in the mid-single-digits for calendar year 2015. 
We are focused on growing share of wallet. We believe we are very well positioned in terms of our portfolio and how we've aligned with our Service Provider customers. But we expect the next several quarters to continue to be challenging and Service Provider, along with emerging markets, remain our 2 challenged areas. 
Total Global Enterprise grew 10% versus 2% in Q1. We did see U.S. Enterprise grow a bit slower than expected at 3% growth due in part to the timing of some very large deals. 
The U.S. Enterprise pipeline continues to see rapid growth in very large multi-yield deals, which benefits Cisco every several years. 
Our Global Enterprise U.S. customers, which are the largest 28 enterprise accounts, not included in our regular U.S. enterprise discussion, grew about 30% year-over-year. 
Global public-sector continued to be solid at 7% growth year-over-year. 
I will now move on to discussion of our products and Services business, which I will discuss in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated. 
Starting with switching. We saw very strong switching growth of 11%, with strong performance in both the data center switching and our campus switching business. We were specially pleased with the continued momentum of our Nexxus ACI portfolio, including the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9K and the APIC Controller. 
As an example, the Nexus 3K plus 9K grew 350% year-over-year. 
We have seen the Nexus 9K and ACI customers grow each quarter from 580 customers 2 quarters ago to 970 customers last quarter to 1,700 this quarter. 
80 [ph] customers, APIC customers grew to over 300, and the Nexus 9K passed the 1 million installed port mark this quarter, less than 1 year after the first shipments. 
We are pulling away from our competitors and leading into both SDN thought leadership and customer implementations. 
The market has recognized the benefit of ACI as compared to PowerPoint concepts of aspirational competitors. ACI and APIC will become the cornerstone of the next generation of network and architectures for many years, much like the UCS has become in the data center. 
I am particularly pleased that we have tapped gross margins extremely stable in switching and have actually grown gross margins and many of our products hedging areas, which were already very strong in new areas such as the ACI portfolio. 
Moving on to data center, which grew an impressive 40%. UCS has now reached over $3 billion revenue run rate, with over 41,000 customers. More than 85% of the Fortune 500 have chosen UCS because of the innovative architecture, with particular traction in cloud, Big Data and enterprise application solutions. 
The innovation underlying UCS, the convergence of compute, network and storage is continuing to fuel our growth in the data center and differentiates Cisco. Now we are converging networking, applications, security with scale for our ACI platform. And we are doing it with a speed and a scale of that no one else is coming close to. 
Next 2 [ph] NGN routing, which grew 2% year-over-year in terms of revenue. We saw strong performance in high-end routing up 5%, with continued strong performance in our new product introductions such as the CRS-X and NCS. 
With the global macro changes and headwinds like net neutrality and industry consolidation, we expect this business to be challenged going forward, but we believe we are taking market share, and we will continue to take market share. 
Wireless had another strong quarter, up 18% year-over-year compared with Q1, which was up 11%. We saw strong growth in our traditional business, but in Meraki, cloud networking business continues its stellar growth, up another 100%, with an annualized run rate of approximately $400 million. 
Security grew 6%, with orders growing even faster. We saw very strong adoption of our Cisco ASA with FirePOWER Services, which integrates our Sourcefire software products together. Our acquisition strategy and our security business have been very successful, as we integrate the various elements to our overall security architecture. We fight point players in some areas, but no other vendor can play at the level across the enterprise that our customers need. 
In this volatile environment, where change happening faster than ever before, the importance of security has never been more significant. The level of danger has been raised from a firewall breach to the potential for enterprise destruction, and having robust, security solutions before, during and after attack is people [indiscernible]. In this environment, customers are migrating to partners they can trust, who will lead with innovation and who will be around tomorrow. This trusted partnership is core to our success and drives everything we do. Cisco is the #1 security player in terms of revenue, and we are progressing nicely toward our goal of becoming the #1 security company in terms of mindshare, which, literally, we announced 1.5 years ago and [indiscernible] to do so. 
Moving on to collaboration. Last quarter, we boldly stated our intention is to lead in the next generation of collaboration and become the #1 collaboration player. After a complete portfolio of refresh and 4 quarters of decline, we made very good progress this quarter, with growth of 10%. Kelly, I think it was flat or negative last quarter, if I remember. Within collaboration, the strongest growth came from our TelePresence business, where we saw on the back of our new TelePresence portfolio a 60% growth in units and revenue growth of 35%. We continue to grow our recruiting business in collaboration. Our deferred collaboration revenue was up 26% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. 
SP Video declined 19%. We've announced key partnership wins to develop the next-generation end-to-end innovative solutions by the set-top box to the cloud. 
Service revenues grew 5%. We saw our portfolio in cloud, security, consulting and analytics all growing double digits. This quarter, we launched Cisco Connected Analytics strategy to manage that explosive growth of data at the edge of the networks. 
As the Internet of Everything evolves, we forecast as much as 50% of the data will be handled, and decisions will be made at the edge of the network. Given this growth position in the network on Cisco is the only company positioned to manage and capture the insight from distributed data. This has the potential to be an important growth area for Cisco and, even more importantly, to drive the value of the Internet of Everything. 
Let me provide an update on Cisco's momentum in the cloud. Cisco's cloud strategy is pervasive throughout our portfolio. We continue to lead in the high [indiscernible] file market, and our intercloud momentum continues. As you look at our cloud business, I will look at the following metrics to track our success; first, Cisco's leadership and cloud infrastructure was once more reaffirmed with the release of the latest Synergy Groups Research report showing we have retained and strengthened our #1 position for sales of hardware and software used to build cloud infrastructure; second, we are growing our cloud Services, including managed security, Project Squared and collaboration, EnergyWise and Meraki Enterprise. Cisco and Telstra are now both in production with OpenStack-based public cloud Services; and third, our InterCloud in that [indiscernible] revenue to grow and now exceeds over 50 partners within 400 data centers across more than 50 countries. Rob, just a great job by your team and your leadership. 
Customers are doing fabric and ACI to implement highly secure and on premise hybrid cloud capabilities across heterogeneous environments. 
To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about stand-alone products. They are about new revenue streams, growth and outcomes; about securing and about managing their businesses; about how they have to reorganize to drive the innovation their survival requires. We are executing across our business because we are bringing together our product leadership in every category in the architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes. 
I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments on the quarter and guidance for the next quarter. Kelly, welcome, and great to have you leading you to conference call."

Overall, we had a strong quarter and executed well. From top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion, growing 7%. We grew profit faster than revenue, with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 13",1072,"Thanks, John. Overall, we had a strong quarter and executed well. From top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion, growing 7%. We grew profit faster than revenue, with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 13%. 
Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.46. 
Product revenue increased 8%, and service revenue increased 5%, with product book-to-build greater than 1. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%. 
In our guidance last quarter, we told you that we expected total non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%. For Q2, our total non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP product gross margins came in at 61.7% and 60.8%, respectively, reflecting the mix of our business and especially the strength of UCS. 
Non-GAAP service gross margin was 64.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.0 billion or 33.3% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.1% in Q1 of fiscal year '15. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 5% quarter-over-quarter and up 6% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software. 
Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q2 of fiscal year '15 included a pretax gain of $126 million or approximately $0.02 per share related to the reorganization of our investment in VCE. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
Now moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate, which was 22% consistent with our expectations. 
In connection with the recently reinstated U.S. federal R&D tax credit, we had a tax benefit of $91 million related to fiscal 2014 that we excluded from our non-GAAP net income. The extension of the R&D tax credit did not have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate during Q2 and is not expecting to have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate for the remainder of fiscal '15 since the benefit only expanded through December 31, 2014. 
We ended the quarter with our headcount at 70,112, a decrease of 2,135 from Q1. 
As a reminder, we took restructuring actions to invest in growth, innovation and talent while managing costs and driving efficiencies. 
We announced and completed 1 acquisition during the quarter, [indiscernible], a provider of network and security consulting services to enhance our offering to our customers. 
Looking at our geographic segment results. In terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, our Americas segment was up 10%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 3%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.0%, EMEA was 61.8% and APJC was 60.3%. 
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $53.0 billion, including a $3.2 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.9 billion during the quarter. 
Deferred revenue was $14 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 14%, largely driven by subscription-based offerings, while services deferred revenue grew 2%. 
We continued to build a greater mix of recurring revenue, as reflected in our deferred revenue balance. 
Our DSO was strong at 35 days as compared to 36 days in Q2 of fiscal year '14. 
In Q2, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders and included $1.2 billion through share repurchases and $974 million through our quarterly dividend. In the first half of fiscal year '15, we have returned approximately $4.2 billion or 86% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $2 billion of dividends. 
In addition, today, our Board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share, an approximately 11% increase, reflecting a yield of approximately 3.1%. 
We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy. 
Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and actual results could be above or below guidance. 
The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. 
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate GAAP gross margin be in the range of 61% to 62%, and as we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, [indiscernible] and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the third quarter. 
Our Q3 '15 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53. 
We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.09 to $0.12 per share in Q3 '15. 
The range includes a pretax charge of up to $100 million in Q3 '15 as a result of the restructuring action that we announced in the first quarter. During Q2, we recognized a pretax charge of -- in our GAAP financial statement of $59 million [ph] related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year '15. 
Please see the slides the company this webcast for more details. 
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant. 
Our guidance does not assume significant improvement in energy markets or the service provider segment in the near future. Although we believe we are secreting well and the rapid each transforming market, it is have so consultancy in mind, we will continue to whatever that is all can the outcome one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
I'll now hand it back to John, verse summary comments."
19691,283133258,760251,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter, which were the best result in 3 years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products and segments, reflect the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the strongest",864,"Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter, which were the best result in 3 years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products and segments, reflect the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the strongest it's ever been. Our vision has always been to change the way the people work, live, play and learn. And you've heard us say this for nearly 20 years. Digitization is the next and perhaps the most significant evolution of our vision. 
At CES, 15 years ago, we showed a network car, Wi-Fi-enabled and connected to a coffee shop, so you can order your own drinks and make changes to that. Fast-forward to several years ago. We introduced the market to the Internet of Everything. While the concept with thought leadership for many years, this year, companies and countries are seeing the Internet of Everything as a business imperative and top priority. 
To take advantage of the Internet of Everything, every country, company, city, home and car has to be digital. The single most important investments are the center of this digital business and technology strategy for our customers. And at the center of that will be the intelligent network, from the data center to the edge to the cloud, all brought together with an end-to-end security, and Cisco has never ever been better positioned. 
In the '90s when companies need to get online on the Internet, Cisco was the thought leader. The company was the product leadership, and the best example of a company capitalizing on all the transitions. Our customers wanted our help and to follow our example. 
Fast-forward to today. The next generation of the Internet, the Internet of Everything should generate at least 5xto 10x the value of the first generation of the Internet to date. Again, no one is better positioned than Cisco in terms of strategy, market position, product leadership, architectures and organization structure. 
I am not sure those outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have implemented over the last year largely because of our ability to continue to deliver to long-term value to our customers and to our shareholders, despite the challenges in the market. 
Most companies wait to change until they have to. When it's obvious, it is often game over, and those companies could be left behind. 
In the last year, we were wound to disrupt our leadership position, for example, in switching and routing by introducing entirety you platforms. We knew we of the short-term impact but with the market how we would grow. Once again, we did what we said we would do. This is just one of many examples, and these are exactly the hard decisions our customers, employees, partners and shareholders have trusted us to make so we can lead in these market transitions. 
I want to congratulate and thank the Cisco team for believing in division and executing one of the most successful company transformations the industry has witnessed. 
Very few companies could do what we have done with the speed and the results we have driven. And the opportunity we created for our selves is truly exciting and, in many ways, just getting started. 
Our transformational work will continuously help our customers digitize everything, secure everything and organize their companies, their governments, their businesses for the Internet of Everything. Because of the agility we've built into our organization and our ability to align directly with our customers' goals, we are helping our customers with their business outcomes. 
And let me be very direct here. We are winning very large service provider, enterprise and public sector deals that we would not have won just as recently as 1 year ago. 
We do see our competitors struggling and know we are not immune from economic or other challenges in the market. While we believe we have positioned the company better than any of our peers, we do still see the same challenges we had discussed in the past few quarters, specifically emerging markets and service providers as continuing to provide a negative drag for the next few quarters. 
What I believe the market now understand is that Cisco is managing effectively through a challenging macro, leading through transitions, disrupting markets, increasing our relevancy with our customers and delivering value to our shareholders. 
Looking forward, we've laid an incredibly exciting foundation for future growth, innovation and leadership; reinventing the network with application-centric infrastructure, a platform at the very early stages of its future potential; our leadership in security, the most important topic in IT today in many ways; our emerging role in data and analytics at the edge and how we will bring all these together to enable the Internet of Everything. We have our stakes in the ground to capture tremendous opportunities in front of us and are well on our way to become the #1 IT company. 
The momentum in the business feels extremely good, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We will now move, Mel, to what I enjoy the most, which is the Q&A session. And so it's over to you, Mel? And I'll [indiscernible]. I'll do better this time."

Our advanced Services, it's an area that we're moving very aggressively in. And that's where you see all a little bit of the pull-down on the services model. And as you become outcome-based, as you refocus on these new growth areas, being able to literally digitize the country come digitize the city, digitize a manufacturing company, a health care company, et cetera, you saw us invest an awful lot of vertical consultancy. You saw us invest in security in a big way with major expectations in terms of expertise centers, et cetera, and in cloud. So we're going to continue to make investments in these areas become.

Security, it'll be bumpy. We've reorganized organization and we aligned purity across the whole globe with a separate salesforce. Estimate those changes, U of those of it of momentum before you pick it up. The order growth was actually up 9% for security. I expect security to grow very healthy as we move forward.

So our assumption is any gain in service providers will be shared of wallet gain and market share gain. What makes me very, very bullish on this is on the things we can control. If you watch get of sales, Kelly said make yes on Services, [indiscernible] Kelly's engineering, we are now winning big service writer deals that we would not even have been in the game in 1 year or 2 ago.

You can never do exactly what we you want, but having to add 5 quarters of 10% or more negative service provider growth, I would rather go on from negative 10 to negative 5 or 6, to negative 1 then positive even up from there. We got a couple of deals this quarter, which calls to go from minus 10 to minus 1. That's more than, I think, anybody else anticipated in the marketplace, especially when you have areas like SP Video, which drag you down 2 or 3 points off of that. I just didn't want the market getting ahead of us. My comfort level with seeing growth this year by the end of the year and probably before that is extremely good in this market, but I'm modeling a lot year gains and market share gains.

It doesn't mean the deal size may not be as large or it does mean there may be pressure on discounts to provide a total solution. And when you see us grow at 20% across Southern Europe, I mean, I'm not aware of anybody else that is growing in Southern Europe much less than the top of numbers. It speaks to our strategy working. Foreign exchange does have an impact on it, and Kelly maybe, if you like to add some additional to that?"

In the quarter, we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We delivered this strong performance despite a volatile economic environment. Our strong momentum is the direct result of how well we have managed our company transformation over the last 3-plus years and our leadership position in the key technology transitions such as cloud, mobility, Big Data, security, collaboration and the Internet of Everything.
The 4 key takeaways I have from this quarter are the following: first, we are executing well and growing at a healthy pace in a tough environment; second, we saw very good balanced growth, the best balanced in 12 quarters across the majority of our key geographies, product categories and customer segments; third, our financials are very strong, and we continue to deliver value for our shareholders with strong earnings, cash generation and capital return, including another $0.02 dividend increase to $0.21 per quarter; and fourth, every country, every city, every business, every home and every car is becoming digital. In our view, Cisco is better positioned than any other company to help our customers reinvent their business and technology strategies as they become digital organizations.
Today, every company in every industry is a technology digital company, something people would not have said a year ago. Over the last month, I've met individually with over 100 business and government leaders. Without exception, these leaders recognize the role technology plays in their future, not just how it creates opportunity but also risk. Customers around the world, both business and governments, are aligning with strategic partners in order to be more successful in the digital transition. They're increasingly choosing Cisco as their strategic partner, and you are seeing the evidence in our financial performance. 
Let's start with the basic question, like why Cisco. With the network at the center, Cisco has the portfolio and ability to bring our customer solutions to drive down cost, help secure their businesses and increase the speed and agility so they can innovate across their own organizations. In our view, our track record of disrupting markets by leveraging the power of the Internet is unmatched. Our strategy has always been based on understanding the direction of market transitions, transforming our sales to meet the needs of our customers and demonstrating the courage to disrupt not just the markets but even ourselves.
The market is moving fast, and change is exponential. We are in the strong position today -- we are today because we've made dramatic moves in how we're innovating, how we're interfacing with our most important customers and how we're organized. To ensure Cisco is leading where the market is going. Most companies resist changing until it's too late, and their market credibility has eroded, a classic innovator's dilemma. It was our choice to move early and boldly with incredible speed to realign 40% of our employees to priority areas, to reorganize from product groups into integrated solution teams, to replace more than 30% of our leaders. We are seeing the results in our relevancy with our customers and our operational excellence, and that is driving our financial performance. Whereas in fiscal year '11, we have added $4.9 billion in revenue, with about $300 million in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, with every dollar of revenue we've added over this transition period, we've only added about $0.06 of non-GAAP OpEx. I think you'll find this as best-in-class by a factor of five- to tenfold.
In the '90s, we were the best example of a company capitalizing on the Internet, and that gave us tremendous credibility with customers and fueled our growth. Today, as every company becomes digital, every CEO knows he or she needs to evolve the organization, to move with speed, agility and efficiency. The Internet of Everything will demand of them. Our strategy is to be the model in how we reorganize and the customers we're driving as a result, and we've done the heavy-lifting with our peers, and customers are just starting. As a result, I'm now spending a significant amount of time with our customers' executive teams and in their boardrooms discussing how they organize for digitization, innovation, security and the Internet of Everything. We could not be better positioned in the market. We've worked very hard to get here. And the opportunity feels very much like it did in the '90s, when Internet became mission-critical to our customers.
We have said for several years that we believe the impact of the Internet of Everything would be 5 to 10x greater than that of the Internet today. At CES and the World Economic Forum, most every leader we saw agreed. We have been building for this opportunity. We have the innovation, operational excellence, speed, agility and efficiencies in our business to drive the greatest possible benefit for our customers, our partners and our shareholders.
Onto guidance. As we've said for the last 2 quarters, we are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing well again. We are well positioned to a positive turn in either search provider or emerging markets, but we are not modeling those turns for several quarters despite the better results we saw in this last quarter for reasons we all are very much aware of.
For Q3, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.51 to $0.53.
Let me now provide some additional detail on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments, products and services business within our portfolio.
In terms of business momentum, as a reminder, the geographies are primarily the way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year, unless otherwise noted.
We finished the quarter with product orders up 5% and product book-to-bill greater than 1.
Let's move first to the Americas. The U.S. continued to accelerate, growing 7% compared with Q1, 3% growth. Latin America returned to double-digit growth at 12% versus Q1 of 5% and negative growth in fiscal year '14. Strength in the U.S. public sector continued, growing 17%, with U.S. federal growing 23% and U.S. state and local growing 8%.
Moving on to our Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. As we said on last quarter's conference call, we were more optimistic about Europe than most of our peers. And we saw that business play out as we called, with growth in EMEA of 7% year-over-year.
We saw phenomenal execution in the U.K., up 17%; Germany, up 12%; and something no one else in the industry is coming even close to, Southern Europe actually grew 20% year-over-year, speaking to the relevancy that we provide to companies and governments.
Over the last 6 quarters, our growth year-over-year in EMEA has gone from minus 4% to minus 2%, to minus 1% to 2%, to 6% in Q1 and now 7% in Q2. And we remain cautiously optimistic.
In Asia Pacific, Japan and China. In China, in particular, we continue to see challenges that all of you are aware of, and we saw our China business decline by 19%. However, we saw India grow by 11%. The rest of APJC, not including China, was down 1% this quarter.
And finally, emerging markets. Emerging markets total grew 1%, with emerging markets excluding BRICS plus Mexico up 8%, a major change from last quarter.
We continue to see the BRICS plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total, with Russia down 16%; Brazil down 8%; China, as I've said earlier, down 19%. We did see growth in Mexico up 21%; India up 11%. While we are pleased with these results, we believe it is still way too early to call a turn in emerging markets and are modeling for them to be challenging for several more quarters.
Customer segments. Total global commercial grew a healthy 8%. Our success in the U.S. commercial continues to be very strong, up 12% in Q2. We have built a model based on success in the U.S. commercial and best practices from around the world and have implemented the model outside the U.S., seeing our orders grow from down 5% in fiscal year '14 to up 4% year-to-date. In total Cisco business terms, that improved performance added a 4 full point to our company's growth rates.
Our new operating model and global service provider is also showing similar traction. This quarter, our Service Provider business was down 1% after having been down on average 10% or more for the last 5 quarters. Like many in the industry, we are modeling total Global Service Provider CapEx down in the mid-single-digits for calendar year 2015.
We are focused on growing share of wallet. We believe we are very well positioned in terms of our portfolio and how we've aligned with our Service Provider customers. But we expect the next several quarters to continue to be challenging and Service Provider, along with emerging markets, remain our 2 challenged areas.
Total Global Enterprise grew 10% versus 2% in Q1. We did see U.S. Enterprise grow a bit slower than expected at 3% growth, due in part to the timing of some very large deals.
The U.S. Enterprise pipeline continues to see rapid growth in very large multi-year deals, which should benefit Cisco every several years.
Our Global Enterprise U.S. customers, which are the largest 28 enterprise accounts, not included in our regular U.S. enterprise discussion, grew about 30% year-over-year.
Global public sector continued to be solid at 7% growth year-over-year.
I will now move on to discussion of our products and services business, which I will discuss in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated.
Starting with switching. We saw very strong switching growth of 11%, with strong performance in both the data center switching and our campus switching business. We were specially pleased with the continued momentum of our Nexus ACI portfolio, including the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9K and the APIC Controller.
As an example, the Nexus 3K plus 9K grew 350% year-over-year.
We have seen the Nexus 9K and ACI customers grow each quarter from 580 customers 2 quarters ago to 970 customers last quarter to 1,700 this quarter.
APIC customers grew to over 300, and the Nexus 9K passed the 1 million installed port mark this quarter, less than 1 year after the first shipments.
We are pulling away from our competitors and leading in both the SDN thought leadership and customer implementations.
The market has recognized the benefit of ACI as compared to PowerPoint concepts of aspirational competitors. ACI and APIC will become the cornerstone of the next generation of network and architectures for many years, much like the UCS has become in the data center.
I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching and have actually grown gross margins in many of our product switching areas which were already very strong and new areas such as the ACI portfolio.
Moving on to data center, which grew an impressive 40%. UCS has now reached over $3 billion revenue run rate, with over 41,000 customers. More than 85% of the Fortune 500 have chosen UCS because of the innovative architecture, with particular traction in cloud, Big Data and enterprise application solutions.
The innovation underlying UCS, the convergence of compute, network and storage, is continuing to fuel our growth in the data center and differentiate Cisco. Now we are converging networking, applications, security with scale for our ACI platform. And we are doing it with a speed and a scale that no one else is coming close to.
Next, to NGN routing, which grew 2% year-over-year in terms of revenue. We saw strong performance in high-end routing, up 5%, with continued strong performance in our new product introductions such as the CRS-X and NCS.
With the global macro changes and headwinds like net neutrality and industry consolidation, we expect this business to be challenged going forward, but we believe we are taking market share and will continue to take market share.
Wireless had another strong quarter, up 18% year-over-year compared with Q1, which was up 11%. We saw strong growth in our traditional business, but in Meraki, cloud networking business continues its stellar growth, up another 100%, with an annualized run rate of approximately $400 million.
Security grew 6%, with orders growing even faster. We saw very strong adoption of our Cisco ASA with FirePOWER services, which integrates our Sourcefire software products together. Our acquisition strategy in our security business has been very successful, as we integrate the various elements into our overall security architecture. We fight point players in some areas, but no other vendor can play at the level across the enterprise that our customers need.
In this volatile environment, where change happening faster than ever before, the importance of security has never been more significant. The level of danger has been raised from a firewall breach to the potential for enterprise destruction, and having robust, security solutions before, during and after attack is table stakes. In this environment, customers are migrating to partners they can trust, who will lead with innovation and who will be around tomorrow. This trusted partnership is core to our success and drives everything we do. Cisco is the #1 security player in terms of revenue, and we are progressing nicely toward our goal of becoming the #1 security company in terms of mind share, which, literally, we announced 1.5 years ago an intention to do so.
Moving on to collaboration. Last quarter, we boldly stated our intention is to lead in the next generation of collaboration and become the #1 collaboration player. After a complete portfolio refresh and 4 quarters of decline, we made very good progress this quarter, with growth of 10%. Kelly, I think it was flat or negative last quarter, if I remember. Within collaboration, the strongest growth came from our TelePresence business, where we saw on the back of our new TelePresence portfolio a 60% growth in units and revenue growth of 35%. We continue to grow our recurring business in collaboration. Our deferred collaboration revenue was up 26% in the quarter to $1.1 billion.
SP Video declined 19%. We've announced key partnership wins to develop the next-generation end-to-end video solutions from the set-top box to the cloud.
Service revenues grew 5%. We saw our portfolio in cloud, security, consulting and analytics all grew in double digits. This quarter, we launched Cisco Connected Analytics strategy to manage the explosive growth of data at the edge of the networks.
As the Internet of Everything evolves, we forecast as much as 50% of the data will be handled and decisions will be made at the edge of the network. Given Cisco's position in the network, Cisco is the only company positioned to manage and capture the insight from distributed data. This has the potential to be an important growth area for Cisco and, even more importantly, to drive the value of the Internet of Everything.
Let me now provide an update on Cisco's momentum in the cloud. Cisco's cloud strategy is pervasive throughout our portfolio. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market, and our InterCloud momentum continues. As you look at our cloud business, I would look at the following metrics to track our success. First, Cisco's leadership in cloud infrastructure was once more reaffirmed with the release of the latest Synergy Group's research report showing we have retained and strengthened our #1 position for sales of hardware and software used to build cloud infrastructure. Second, we are growing our cloud services, including managed security, Project Squared and Collaboration, EnergyWise and Meraki for enterprise. Cisco and Telstra are now both in production with OpenStack-based public cloud Services. And third, our InterCloud ecosystem continues to grow and now exceeds over 50 partners within 400 data centers across more than 50 countries. Rob, just a great job by your team and your leadership.
Customers are using InterCloud fabric and ACI to implement highly secure and on-premise hybrid cloud capabilities across heterogeneous environments.
To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about standalone products. They are about new revenue streams, growth and outcomes; about securing and about managing their businesses; about how they have to reorganize to drive the innovation their survival requires. We are executing across our business because we are bringing together our product leadership in every category in the architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes.
I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments on the quarter and guidance for the next quarter. Kelly, welcome, and great to have you leading the conference call."

From a top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion, growing 7%. We grew profit faster than revenue, with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 13%.
Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.46.
Product revenue increased 8%, and service revenue increased 5%, with product book-to-bill greater than 1. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%.
In our guidance last quarter, we told you that we expected total non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%. For Q2, our total non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP product gross margins came in at 61.7% and 60.8%, respectively, reflecting the mix of our business and especially the strength of UCS.
Non-GAAP service gross margin was 64.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.0 billion or 33.3% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.1% in Q1 of fiscal year '15.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 5% quarter-over-quarter and up 6% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software.
Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q2 of fiscal year '15 included a pretax gain of $126 million or approximately $0.02 per share related to the reorganization of our investment in VCE. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Now moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate, which was 22%, consistent with our expectations.
In connection with the recently reinstated U.S. federal R&D tax credit, we had a tax benefit of $91 million related to fiscal 2014 that we excluded from our non-GAAP net income. The extension of the R&D tax credit did not have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate during Q2 and is not expected to have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate for the remainder of fiscal '15 since the benefit only extended through December 31, 2014.
We ended the quarter with our headcount at 70,112, a decrease of 2,135 from Q1.
As a reminder, we took restructuring actions to invest in growth, innovation and talent while managing costs and driving efficiencies.
We announced and completed 1 acquisition during the quarter, Neohapsis, a provider of network and security consulting services, to enhance our offerings to our customers.
Looking at our geographic segment results. In terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, our Americas segment was up 10%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 3%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.0%, EMEA was 61.8% and APJC was 60.3%.
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $53.0 billion, including a $3.2 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.9 billion during the quarter.
Deferred revenue was $14 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 14%, largely driven by subscription-based offerings, while services deferred revenue grew 2%.
We continued to build a greater mix of recurring revenue, as reflected in our deferred revenue balance.
Our DSO was strong at 35 days as compared to 36 days in Q2 of fiscal year '14.
In Q2, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders that included $1.2 billion through share repurchases and $974 million through our quarterly dividend. In the first half of fiscal year '15, we have returned approximately $4.2 billion or 86% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $2 billion of dividends.
In addition, today, our board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share, an approximate 11% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.1%.
We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy.
Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and actual results could be above or below guidance.
The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. And as we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range.
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the third quarter.
Our Q3 '15 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53.
We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.09 to $0.12 per share in Q3 '15.
The range includes a pretax charge of up to $100 million in Q3 '15 as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q2, we recognized a pretax charge of -- in our GAAP financial statement of $69 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year '15.
Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant.
Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets or the service provider segment in the near future. Although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, with these types of uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments."
19691,283133258,760564,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter, which were the best result in 3 years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products and segments, reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the stronges",873,"Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter, which were the best result in 3 years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products and segments, reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the strongest it's ever been. Our vision has always been to change the way that people work, live, play and learn. And you've heard us say this for nearly 20 years. Digitization is the next and perhaps the most significant evolution of our vision.
At CES, 15 years ago, we showed a network car, Wi-Fi-enabled and connected to a coffee shop, so you could order your own drinks and make changes to that. Fast-forward to several years ago. We introduced the market to the Internet of Everything. While the concept's with thought leadership for many years, this year, companies and countries are seeing the Internet of Everything as a business imperative and top priority.
To take advantage of the Internet of Everything, every country, company, city, home and car has to be digital. The single most important investments are at the center of their digital business and technology strategy for our customers. And at the center of that will be the intelligent network, from the data center to the edge to the cloud, all brought together with an end-to-end security, and Cisco has never ever been better positioned.
In the '90s when companies need to get online on the Internet, Cisco was the thought leader, the company with the product leadership and the best example of a company capitalizing on all the transitions. Our customers wanted our help and to follow our example.
Fast-forward to today. The next generation of the Internet, the Internet of Everything, should generate at least 5 to 10x the value of the first generation of the Internet to date. Again, no one is better positioned than Cisco in terms of strategy, market position, product leadership, architectures and organization structure.
I am not sure those outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have implemented over the last year, largely because of our ability to continue to deliver to the long-term value to our customers and to our shareholders despite the challenges in the market.
Most companies wait to change until they have to. When it's obvious, it is often game over, and those companies get left behind.
In the last year, we were willing to disrupt our leadership position, for example, in switching and routing, by introducing entirely new platforms. We knew we would see a short-term impact but told the market how we would grow. Once again, we did what we said we would do. This is just one of many examples, and these are exactly the hard decisions our customers, employees, partners and shareholders have trusted us to make so we can lead in these market transitions.
I want to congratulate and thank the Cisco team for believing in the vision and executing one of the most successful company transformations the industry has witnessed.
Very few companies could do what we have done with the speed and the results we have driven. And the opportunity we created for ourselves is truly exciting and, in many ways, just getting started.
Our transformational work will continue as we help our customers digitize everything, secure everything and organize their companies, their governments, their businesses for the Internet of Everything. Because of the agility we've built into our organization and our ability to align directly with our customers' goals, we are helping our customers with their business outcomes.
And let me be very direct here. We're winning very large service provider, enterprise and public sector deals that we would not have won just as recently as 1 year ago.
We do see our competitors struggling and know we are not immune from economic or other challenges in the market. While we believe we have positioned the company better than any of our peers, we do still see the same challenges we had discussed in the past few quarters, specifically emerging markets and service providers, as continuing to provide a negative drag for the next few quarters.
What I believe the market now understands is that Cisco is managing effectively through a challenging macro, leading through transitions, disrupting markets, increasing our relevancy with our customers and delivering value to our shareholders.
Looking forward, we've laid an incredibly exciting foundation for future growth, innovation and leadership, reinventing the network with application-centric infrastructure, a platform at the very early stages of its future potential, our leadership in security, the most important topic in IT today in many ways, our emerging role in data and analytics at the edge and how we will bring all these together to enable the Internet of Everything. We have our stakes in the ground to capture tremendous opportunities in front of us and are well on our way to become the #1 IT company.
The momentum in the business feels extremely good, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We will now move, Mel, to what I enjoy the most, which is the Q&A section. And it's over to you, Mel. And I'll try to keep my answers tight, and I'll do better this time."

We probably had 8 or 9 areas that were very close to half growth rate we've had in 2 years. And you're focusing me on the 2 challenges, more than fair. So let's go to the issue of services gross margins. If you watch, we start with the big picture. Our revenue growth areas, what is our gross margins, our OpEx. Kelly and I have a lot of leverage we can pull within that. Within the gross margins, we have never been more comfortable. And actually, I said this almost 3 or 4 quarters ago, Mel, I've never been more comfortable with any aspect of our business and our ability to maintain gross margins. It's a mix issue as you go through it. To the Services question, we've had great Services gross margins, unequaled in the industry. Gary, our technical services, what you and Joe Pinto have done is amazing there. Our advanced services is an area that we're moving very aggressively in. And that's where you would see a little bit of the pull-down on the services model. And as you become outcome-based, as you refocus on these new growth areas, being able to literally digitize a country, digitize a city, digitize a manufacturing company, a health care company, et cetera, you saw us invest an awful lot in vertical consultancy. You saw us invest in security in a big way with major expectations in terms of expertise centers, et cetera, and in cloud. So we're going to continue to make investments in these areas. And I'm very comfortable with our gross margin portfolio. I actually think our gross margins has been the most predictable part of our total business although we have a lot of various variables in that. On security. Security will occasionally be bumpy. We've reorganized our organization and realigned security across the whole globe with a separate sales force. As you make those changes, you occasionally lose a little bit of momentum before you pick it up. The order growth was actually at 9% for security. I expect security to grow very healthily as we move forward. And you'll continue to see us make a number of both resource investments in areas like services, sales investments to really lead in that, and consultancy, in a way that really brings this picture to life. But I think you're going to see good growth there out of our security business. I think we're positioned extremely well. And I kind of in a fun way challenge you, when an enterprise customer has 45 to 60 security players in their environment, how many they really have? When you look at the CEO in the eye, and they go,  ""I get it, John. We've got to consolidate this, and the networks where it's going to get consolidated."" So I'm very comfortable in terms of our security growth over time. Do not see any issues in terms of strategy, vision or margins here."

And when you sit across from a customer, if you could have been at WEF, and I could take this to our shareholders, anybody who walk out of WEF, 21 of the sessions were about Cisco-related areas, from what you're going to do with infrastructure to digitizing countries, to cities, to how you bring this to bear, to how does it affect the environment. We're right in the middle. And in so many different ways, we are not just in thought leadership. No one can compete. Individual pinpoint products are going to get killed in this marketplace. And the different competitive models that you see evolving or different models, we saw it coming for 4 to 5 years. So yes, I feel really good. And the only area that I would be critical of is we got to do better in service provider video. And when you have a portfolio like we have and customer segments and products, it feels good. But to your point, our relevance in major government bids and major enterprise bids, we're winning bids that we would not have come close to in a year ago. And it isn't just for winning from the beginning, we've got an ability to adjust in engineering and sales and services to meet their needs, the speed we're not in, and candidly, we're taking on the competitors. It really feels good and it's really fun. See you tomorrow, by the way, Simona. Looking forward to be in -- on stage with you. Go easy on your question tomorrow on me."

My premise on service providers is you're going to see negative growth in terms of CapEx for this year. I met a lot of the experts saying it's actually going to be uglier in the next 6 months than it will the back half of the year. So our assumption is any gain in service providers will be share of wallet gain and market share gains. What makes me very, very bullish on this is on the things we can control. If you watch what Nick [indiscernible] has done services, Kelly is engineering, we are now winning big service provider deals that we would not even have been in the game in 1 year or 2 ago. And our ability to do this at a different margin level, our agility on this, and we'll take it to our competitors, and you're seeing this across the board. I would have vastly preferred it. You can never do it exactly how you want, but having to add 5 quarters of 10% or more negative service provider growth, I would rather go on from negative 10 to negative 5 or 6, to negative 1 then positive then up from there. We got a couple of deals running this quarter, which caused us to go from minus 10 to minus 1. That's more than, I think, anybody else anticipated in the marketplace, especially when you have areas like SP Video, which dragged you down by 2 or 3 points off of that. I just didn't want the market getting ahead of us. My comfort level with seeing growth this year, by the end of the year and probably before that, is extremely good in this market, but I'm modeling all wallet share gains and market share gains. I do not think Service Provider CapEx will be up this year. I hope I'm wrong. In which case, we'll get more of our share there. So I feel very, very good in the positioning. Was there a second question on this? Okay. Thanks, James."

We've got an amazing team with several older players around this table being examples of it. And we'll make this a nonissue as we make the transition. To the first part of the question, no, I disagree with your basic premise. We don't give booking by category, by seasonality. But if you watch our normal booking trends, and if you watch where we've gone, and let's use total bookings as an example, from Q1 to Q2, it was up at the very high end of our seasonality bookings sequentially and the year-over-year numbers. So either way you want to measure it, we're in good shape on that. I do agree with several of your premises in terms of the 9K growth. It feels very, very good. Rod, you got to know I completely disagree dramatically with your comment about our switching products commoditizing. They're going the opposite way. This is one that I think you're going to see us get our competitors very aggressively. And even in merchant silicon like the Nexus 3000, we're doing extremely well in terms of growth in gross margins. It's an architectural play now. We saw this coming 4.5 years ago. With switching, you got to have security, you got to have collaboration, that's got to integrate to processor capability. It's got to tie the Internet of Everything. There has to be an architecture that brings this together, business results. And I think our relevance and our value to the customers are going the exact opposite way. We have shown remarkable consistency in switching gross margins. And I feel very, very good about our future on that one, Rod."

And even though we'll face new competitors, white label, et cetera, in this market, we saw that, as I said, coming a long time ago. And this is where it isn't about switching the data centers. It's about convergence, about switching with storage, with servers, with security even within the data center, and then the ability with application centric infrastructure to ran that in a data center or a cloud, in the WAN, all the way to the edge. And that's about applications, again, with the network, with security, with scale. You combine those 2 and we're almost unbeatable in the approach. You do have a natural update cycle of new products coming in, and there was probably a little bit of a stall when we stalled ourselves a year ago deliberately. And we knew what we're doing, but we needed to transition to the new high-end switching and needed to signal people where we're going. There are additional drivers. We're starting to win network refresh, and some competitors' refresh purely because of security, saying in this environment, they aren't going to take risk on a business where we're just going to -- I can't say crash. Yes, I can, versus white label. This is where we're going to really crash the white label people. I mean, it's got to be a security architecture type of approach. If you just say, I'm going to get merchant silicon and throw software on top of it and run data centers and run LANs and everything, all it takes is one breach and you've done more damage to your brand as a company or as a government than you could in 100 years of savings on a little bit of switching difference. And that's before you get to the outcomes in terms of the direction. Now is switching going to grow at double digits? Of course not. But I think more down the mid-single-digits, and it will go up and down depending on the quarter. And there'll be a different mix in the data center versus campus."

And this movie I have seen before, I wish I could just bottle with and I wish I could bottle the conversations that we're in with government leaders and business leaders. And how different than before, it's just not one product area, it's how we can bring architectures together with services and the different sales motion. We have the courage to disrupt ourselves starting 3 years ago, and we did a huge amount of organizational evolution over the last year that allowed us to do fast innovation and agility and speed with which others cannot meet. There is no surprises to us in the market, and I mean none at the present time. It's playing out very much like we expected. It's a world that pace of change will go exponentially. But as you walk away, just kind of think about it, executing extremely well and healthy growth. Digitization will be 10x, I think, we'll say 5 to 10x to keep things solid, the impact of the Internet of Everything really affects every country, every citizen in the world and every company. Our product portfolio across the board, you saw all but one area increase, and it's nice when I get beat up on just 6% growth. I mean, that is a pleasant position to be in, Kelly, probably one we won't always experience as nicely as that. The balance geographically and even our headwind areas, while we've seen that there'll be a couple more quarters to work through, showed a lot of progress. And it means we are positioned as they eventually turn in emerging markets, which they will. And there will always be challenges in a group like China and Russia and Brazil. But the rest of them feel headed in the right direction pretty well. And if you watch what we're doing in terms of our product leadership in each category and then integrated them together with architecture, it feels good. So I get pumped up. It hasn't changed, and I hope that came across. The pace of change and the new competitors and new challenges is something that will not change. It  will go up exponentially.

We gene",2839,"Mel, thank you very much. Our Q2 results reflect continued progress, as we transform Cisco to become the #1 IT company.
In the quarter, we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We delivered this strong performance despite a volatile economic environment. 
Our strong momentum is the direct result of how well we have managed our company transformation over the last 3-plus years and our leadership position in the key technology transitions such as cloud, mobility, Big Data, security, collaboration and the Internet of Everything.
The 4 key takeaways I have from this quarter are the following: First, we are executing well and growing at a healthy pace in a tough environment; second, we saw very good balanced growth, the best balance in 12 quarters across the majority of our key geographies, product categories and customer segments; third, our financials are very strong, and we continue to deliver value for our shareholders with strong earnings, cash generation and capital return, including another $0.02 dividend increase to $0.21 per quarter; and fourth, every country, every city, every business, every home and every car is becoming digital. In our view, Cisco is better positioned than any other company to help our customers reinvent their business and technology strategies as they become digital organizations.
Today, every company in every industry is a technology digital company, something people would not have said a year ago. Over the last month, I've met individually with over 100 business and government leaders. Without exception, these leaders recognize the role technology plays in their future, not just how it creates opportunity, but also risk. Customers around the world, both business and governments, are aligning with strategic partners in order to be more successful in the digital transition. They're increasingly choosing Cisco as their strategic partner, and you are seeing the evidence in our financial performance. 
Let's start with the basic question, like why Cisco? With the network at the center, Cisco has the portfolio and ability to bring our customer solutions to drive down cost, to help secure their businesses and increase the speed and agility so they can innovate across their own organizations. In our view, our track record of disrupting markets by leveraging the power of the Internet is unmatched. Our strategy has always been based on understanding the direction of major market transitions, transforming our sales to meet the needs of our customers and demonstrating the courage to disrupt not just the markets but even ourselves.
The market is moving fast, and change is exponential. We are in the strong position today we are today because we've made dramatic moves in how we're innovating, how we're interfacing with our most important customers and how we're organized to ensure Cisco is leading where the market is going. Most companies resist changing until it's too late, and their market credibility has eroded; a classic innovator's dilemma. It was our choice to move early and boldly with incredible speed to realign 40% of our employees to priority areas, to reorganize from product groups into integrated solution teams, to replace more than 30% of our leaders. We are seeing the results in our relevancy with our customers and our operational excellence, and that is driving our financial performance, where since fiscal year '11, we have added $4.9 billion in revenue, with about $300 million in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, for every dollar of revenue we've added over this transition period, we've only added about $0.06 of non-GAAP OpEx. I think you'll find this is best-in-class by a factor of five- to tenfold.
In the '90s, we were the best example of a company capitalizing on the Internet, and that gave us tremendous credibility with customers and fueled our growth. Today, as every company becomes digital, every CEO knows he or she needs to evolve the organization, to move with speed, agility and efficiency the Internet of Everything will demand of them. 
Our strategy is to be the model in how we reorganize and the customers we're driving as a result, and we've done the heavy-lifting with our peers, and customers are just starting. As a result, I'm now spending a significant amount of time with our customers' executive teams and in their boardrooms discussing how they organize for digitization, innovation, security and the Internet of Everything. We could not be better positioned in the market. We've worked very hard to get here. And the opportunity feels very much like it did in the '90s, when Internet became mission-critical to our customers.
We have said for several years that we believe the impact of the Internet of Everything would be 5 to 10x greater than that of the Internet today. At CES and the World Economic Forum, most every leader we saw agreed. We had been building for this opportunity. We have the innovation, operational excellence, speed, agility and efficiencies in our business to drive the greatest possible benefit for our customers, our partners and our shareholders.
On to guidance. As we've said for the last 2 quarters, we are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing well again. We are well positioned for a positive turn in either Service Provider or emerging markets, but we are not modeling those turns for several quarters despite the better results we saw in this last quarter for reasons we all are very much aware of.
For Q3, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.51 to $0.53.
Let me now provide some additional detail on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments, products and services business within our portfolio.
In terms of business momentum, as a reminder, the geographies are primarily the way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year, unless otherwise noted.
We finished the quarter with product orders up 5% and product book-to-bill greater than 1.
Let's move first to the Americas. The U.S. continued to accelerate, growing 7% compared with Q1, 3% growth. Latin America returned to double-digit growth at 12% versus Q1 of 5% and negative growth in fiscal year '14. Strength in the U.S. public sector continued, growing 17%, with U.S. federal growing 23% and U.S. state and local growing 8%.
Moving on to our Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. As we said on last quarter's conference call, we were more optimistic about Europe than most of our peers. And we saw that business play out as we called, with growth in EMEA of 7% year-over-year.
We saw phenomenal execution in the U.K., up 17%; Germany, up 12%; and something no one else in the industry is coming even close to, Southern Europe actually grew 20% year-over-year, speaking to the relevancy that we provide to companies and governments. Over the last 6 quarters, our growth year-over-year in EMEA has gone from minus 4% to minus 2%, to minus 1%, to 2%, to 6% in Q1 and now 7% in Q2. And we remain cautiously optimistic.
In Asia Pacific, Japan and China. In China, in particular, we continue to see challenges that all of you are aware of, and we saw our China business decline by 19%. However, we saw India grow by 11%. The rest of APJC, not including China, was down 1% this quarter.
And finally, emerging markets. Emerging markets total grew 1%, with emerging markets excluding BRICs plus Mexico up 8%, a major change from last quarter.
We continue to see the BRICs plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total, with Russia down 16%; Brazil down 8%; China, as I've said earlier, down 19%. We did see growth in Mexico up 21%; India up 11%. While we are pleased with these results, we believe it is still way too early to call a turn in emerging markets and are modeling for them to be challenging for several more quarters.
Customer segments. Total global Commercial grew a healthy 8%. Our success in the U.S. Commercial continues to be very strong, up 12% in Q2. We have built a model based on success in the U.S. commercial and best practices from around the world and have implemented the model outside the U.S., seeing our orders grow from down 5% in fiscal year '14 to up 4% year-to-date. In total Cisco business terms, that improved performance added a 4 full point to our company's growth rates.
Our new operating model and global Service Provider is also showing similar traction. This quarter, our Service Provider business was down 1% after having been down on average 10% or more for the last 5 quarters. Like many in the industry, we are modeling total global Service Provider CapEx down in the mid-single digits for calendar year 2015.
We are focused on growing share of wallet. We believe we are very well positioned in terms of our portfolio and how we've aligned with our Service Provider customers. But we expect the next several quarters to continue to be challenging and Service Provider, along with emerging markets, remain our 2 challenged areas.
Total global Enterprise grew 10% versus 2% in Q1. We did see U.S. Enterprise grow a bit slower than expected at 3% growth, due in part to the timing of some very large deals. The U.S. Enterprise pipeline continues to see rapid growth in very large multiyear deals, which should benefit Cisco over several years.
Our global Enterprise U.S. customers, which are the largest 28 Enterprise accounts, not included in our regular U.S. Enterprise discussion, grew about 30% year-over-year. Global public sector continued to be solid at 7% growth year-over-year.
I will now move on to a discussion of our products and services business, which I will discuss in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching. We saw very strong switching growth of 11%, with strong performance in both the data center switching and our campus switching business. 
We were especially pleased with the continued momentum of our Nexus ACI portfolio, including the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9K and the APIC Controller. As an example, the Nexus 3K plus 9K grew 350% year-over-year. We have seen the Nexus 9K and ACI customers grow each quarter from 580 customers 2 quarters ago to 970 customers last quarter to 1,700 this quarter. APIC customers grew to over 300, and the Nexus 9K passed the 1 million installed port mark this quarter, less than 1 year after the first shipments.
We are pulling away from our competitors and leading in both the SDN thought leadership and customer implementations.
The market has recognized the benefit of ACI as compared to PowerPoint concepts of aspirational competitors. ACI and APIC will become the cornerstone of the next generation of network and architectures for many years, much like the UCS has become in the data center.
I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching and have actually grown gross margins in many of our product switching areas which were already very strong in new areas such as the ACI portfolio.
Moving on to data center, which grew an impressive 40%. UCS has now reached over $3 billion revenue run rate, with over 41,000 customers. More than 85% of the Fortune 500 have chosen UCS because of the innovative architecture, with particularly traction in cloud, Big Data and enterprise application solutions.
The innovation underlying UCS, the convergence of compute, network and storage, is continuing to fuel our growth in the data center and differentiate Cisco. Now we are converging networking, applications, security with scale for our ACI platform. And we are doing it with a speed and a scale that no one else is coming close to.
Next, to NGN routing, which grew 2% year-over-year in terms of revenue. We saw strong performance in high-end routing, up 5%, with continued strong performance in our new product introductions such as the CRS-X and NCS.
With the global macro changes and headwinds like net neutrality and industry consolidation, we expect this business to be challenged going forward, but we believe we are taking market share and will continue to take market share.
Wireless had another strong quarter, up 18% year-over-year compared with Q1, which was up 11%. We saw strong growth in our traditional business, but in Meraki, cloud networking business continues its stellar growth, up another 100%, with an annualized run rate of approximately $400 million.
Security grew 6%, with orders growing even faster. We saw A very strong adoption of our Cisco ASA with FirePOWER services, which integrates our Sourcefire software products together. Our acquisition strategy in our Security business has been very successful, as we integrate the various elements into our overall security architecture. We fight point players in some areas, but no other vendor can play at the level across the enterprise that our customers need.
In this volatile environment1, with change happening faster than ever before, the importance of security has never been more significant. The level of danger has been raised from a firewall breach to the potential for enterprise destruction, and having robust, security solutions before, during and after attack is table stakes. In this environment, customers are migrating to partners they can trust, who will lead with innovation and who will be around tomorrow. This trusted partnership is core to our success and drives everything we do. Cisco is the #1 security player in terms of revenue, and we are progressing nicely toward our goal of becoming the #1 security company in terms of mind share, which, literally, we announced 1.5 years ago an intention to do so.
Moving on to collaboration. Last quarter, we boldly stated our intention is to lead in the next generation of collaboration and become the #1 collaboration player. After a complete portfolio refresh and 4 quarters of decline, we made very good progress this quarter, with growth of 10%. Kelly, I think it was flat or negative last quarter, if I remember. 
Within collaboration, the strongest growth came from our TelePresence business, where we saw, on the back of our new TelePresence portfolio, a 60% growth in units and revenue growth of 35%. We continue to grow our recurring business in collaboration. Our deferred collaboration revenue was up 26% in the quarter to $1.1 billion.
SP Video declined 19%. We've announced key partnership wins to develop the next-generation end-to-end video solutions from the set-top box to the cloud.
Service revenues grew 5%. We saw our portfolio in cloud, security, consulting and analytics all grew in double digits. This quarter, we launched Cisco Connected Analytics strategy to manage the explosive growth of data at the edge of the networks.
As the Internet of Everything evolves, we forecast as much as 50% of the data will be handled and decisions will be made at the edge of the network. Given Cisco's position in the network, Cisco is the only company positioned to manage and capture the insight from distributed data. This has the potential to be an important growth area for Cisco and, even more importantly, to drive the value of the Internet of Everything.
Let me now provide an update on Cisco's momentum in the cloud. Cisco's cloud strategy is pervasive throughout our portfolio. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market, and our InterCloud momentum continues. As you look at our cloud business, I would look at the following metrics to track our success. First, Cisco's leadership in cloud infrastructure was once more reaffirmed with the release of the latest Synergy Group's research report showing we have retained and strengthened our #1 position for sales of hardware and software used to build cloud infrastructure. 
Second, we are growing our cloud services, including managed security, Project Squared and Collaboration, EnergyWise and Meraki for enterprise. Cisco and Telstra are now both in production with OpenStack-based public cloud services. And third, our InterCloud ecosystem continues to grow and now exceeds over 50 partners within 400 data centers across more than 50 countries. Rob, just a great job by your team and your leadership.
Customers are using InterCloud fabric and ACI to implement highly secure and on-premise hybrid cloud capabilities across heterogeneous environments.
To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about stand-alone products. They are about new revenue streams, growth and outcomes; about securing and about managing their businesses; about how they have to reorganize to drive the innovation their survival requires. We are executing across our business because we are bringing together our product leadership in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes.
I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments on the quarter and guidance for the next quarter. Kelly, welcome, and great to have you leading the conference call."

From a top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion, growing 7%. We grew profit faster than revenue, with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 13%. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.46.
Product revenue increased 8%, and service revenue increased 5%, with product book-to-bill greater than 1. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%.
In our guidance last quarter, we told you that we expected total non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%. For Q2, our total non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP product gross margins came in at 61.7% and 60.8%, respectively, reflecting the mix of our business and especially the strength of UCS.
Non-GAAP service gross margin was 64.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.0 billion or 33.3% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.1% in Q1 of fiscal year '15.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 5% quarter-over-quarter and up 6% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software.
Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q2 of fiscal year '15 included a pretax gain of $126 million or approximately $0.02 per share related to the reorganization of our investment in VCE. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Now moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate, which was 22%, consistent with our expectations. In connection with the recently reinstated U.S. Federal R&D tax credit, we had a tax benefit of $91 million related to fiscal 2014 that we excluded from our non-GAAP net income. The extension of the R&D tax credit did not have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate during Q2 and is not expected to have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate for the remainder of fiscal '15 since the benefit only extended through December 31, 2014.
We ended the quarter with our headcount at 70,112, a decrease of 2,135 from Q1. As a reminder, we took restructuring actions to invest in growth, innovation and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies.
We announced and completed 1 acquisition during the quarter, Neohapsis, a provider of network and security consulting services, to enhance our offerings to our customers.
Looking at our geographic segment results. In terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, our Americas segment was up 10%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 3%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.0%, EMEA was 61.8% and APJC was 60.3%.
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $53.0 billion, including a $3.2 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.9 billion during the quarter.
Deferred revenue was $14 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 14%, largely driven by subscription-based offerings, while Services' deferred revenue grew 2%. We continue to build a greater mix of recurring revenue, as reflected in our deferred revenue balance.
Our DSO was strong at 35 days as compared to 36 days in Q2 of fiscal year '14.
In Q2, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders that included $1.2 billion through share repurchases and $974 million through our quarterly dividend. In the first half of fiscal year '15, we have returned approximately $4.2 billion or 86% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $2 billion of dividends.
In addition, today, our board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share, an approximate 11% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.1%. We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy.
Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and actual results could be above or below guidance.
The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. And as we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by 1 point in either direction from our guidance range.
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the third quarter.
Our Q3 '15 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53.
We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.09 to $0.12 per share in Q3 '15. The range includes a pretax charge of up to $100 million in Q3 '15 as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q2, we recognized a pretax charge of -- in our GAAP financial statements of $69 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year '15. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant.
Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets or the Service Provider segment in the near future. Although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, with these types of uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats 1 quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments."

Our results this quarter, which were the best results in 3 years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products and segments, reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the stronge",872,"Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter, which were the best results in 3 years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products and segments, reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the strongest it's ever been. Our vision has always been to change the way that people work, live, play and learn. And you've heard us say this for nearly 20 years. Digitization is the next and perhaps the most significant evolution of our vision.
At CES, 15 years ago, we showed a network car, Wi-Fi-enabled and connected to a coffee shop, so you could order your own drinks and make changes to that. Fast-forward to several years ago. We introduced the market to the Internet of Everything. While the concepts were thought leadership for many years, this year, companies and countries are seeing the Internet of Everything as a business imperative and top priority.
To take advantage of the Internet of Everything, every country, company, city, home and car has to be digital. The single most important investments are at the center of their digital business and technology strategy for our customers. And at the center of that will be the intelligent network, from the data center, to the edge through the cloud, all brought together with an end-to-end security, and Cisco has never ever been better positioned.
In the '90s when companies needed to get online on the Internet, Cisco was the thought leader, the company with the product leadership and the best example of a company capitalizing on all the transitions. Our customers wanted our help and to follow our example.
Fast-forward to today. The next generation of the Internet, the Internet of Everything, should generate at least 5 to 10x the value of the first generation of the Internet to date. Again, no one is better positioned than Cisco in terms of strategy, market position, product leadership, architectures and organization structure.
I am not sure those outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have implemented over the last year, largely because of our ability to continue to deliver to the long-term value to our customers and to our shareholders despite the challenges in the market.
Most companies wait to change until they have to, when it's obvious and it's often game over, and those companies get left behind. In the last year, we were willing to disrupt our leadership position, for example, in switching and routing, by introducing entirely new platforms. We knew we'd see a short-term impact but told the market how we would grow. Once again, we did what we said we would do. This is just one of many examples, and these are exactly the hard decisions our customers, employees, partners and shareholders have trusted us to make so we can lead in these market transitions.
I want to congratulate and thank the Cisco team for believing in the vision and executing one of the most successful company transformations the industry has witnessed. Very few companies could do what we have done with the speed and the results we have driven. And the opportunity we created for ourselves is truly exciting and, in many ways, just getting started.
Our transformational work will continue as we help our customers digitize everything, secure everything and organize their companies, their governments, their businesses for the Internet of Everything. 
Because of the agility we've built into our organization and our ability to align directly with our customers' goals, we are helping our customers with their business outcomes. And let me be very direct here. We're winning very large Service Provider, Enterprise and Public Sector deals that we would not have won just as recently as 1 year ago.
We do see our competitors struggling and know we are not immune from economic or other challenges in the market. While we believe we have positioned the company better than any of our peers, we do still see the same challenges we had discussed in the past few quarters, specifically emerging markets and service providers, as continuing to provide a negative drag for the next few quarters.
What I believe the market now understands is that Cisco is managing effectively through a challenging macro, leading through transitions, disrupting markets, increasing our relevancy with our customers and delivering value to our shareholders.
Looking forward, we've laid an incredibly exciting foundation for future growth, innovation and leadership, reinventing the network with application-centric infrastructure, a platform at the very early stages of its future potential, our leadership in security, the most important topic in IT today in many ways, our emerging role in data and analytics at the edge and how we will bring all this together to enable the Internet of Everything. 
We have our stakes in the ground to capture tremendous opportunities in front of us and are well on our way to become the #1 IT company. The momentum in the business feels extremely good, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. 
We will now move, Mel, to what I enjoy the most, which is the Q&A section. And it's over to you, Mel. And I'll try to keep my answers tight, and I'll do better this time."

We probably had 8 or 9 areas that were very close to the half's growth rate we've had in 2 years. And you're focusing me on the 2 challenges, more than fair. So let's go to the issue of Services gross margins. If you watch, we start with the big picture. Our revenue growth areas, what is our gross margins, our OpEx. Kelly and I have a lot of leverage we can pull within that. Within the gross margins, we have never been more comfortable. And actually, I said this almost 3 or 4 quarters ago, Mel, I've never been more comfortable with any aspect of our business and our ability to maintain gross margins. It's a mix issue as you go through it. To the Services question, we've had great Services gross margins, unequaled in the industry. Gary, our technical services, what you and Joe Pinto have done is amazing there. Our advanced services is an area that we're moving very aggressively in. And that's where you see a little bit of the pull-down on the services model. And as you become outcome-based, as you refocus on these new growth areas, being able to literally digitize a country, digitize a city, digitize a manufacturing company, a health care company, et cetera, you saw us invest an awful lot in vertical consultancy. You saw us invest in security in a big way with major expectations in terms of expertise centers, et cetera, and in cloud. So we're going to continue to make investments in these areas. And I'm very comfortable with our gross margin portfolio. I actually think our gross margins has been the most predictable part of our total business although we have a lot of various variables in that. On security. Security will occasionally be bumpy. We reorganized our organization and realigned security across the whole globe with a separate sales force. As you make those changes, you occasionally lose a little bit of momentum before you pick it up. The order growth was actually at 9% for security. I expect security to grow very healthily as we move forward. And you'll continue to see us make a number of both resource investments in areas like services, sales investments to really lead in that, and consultancy, in a way that really brings this picture to life. But I think you're going to see good growth out of our security business. I think we're positioned extremely well. And I kind of in a fun way challenge you, when an enterprise customer has 45 to 60 security players in their environment, how many they really have? And you look at the CEO in the eye, and they go, ""I get it, John. We've got to consolidate this, and the network's where it's going to get consolidated."" So I'm very comfortable in terms of our security growth over time. Do not see any issues in terms of strategy, vision or margins here."

We're right in the middle. And in so many different ways, we are not just in thought leadership. No one can compete. Individual pinpoint products are going to get killed in this marketplace.

My premise on service providers is you're going to see negative growth in terms of CapEx for this year. I met a lot of the experts saying it's actually going to be uglier in the next 6 months than it will the back half of the year. So our assumption is any gain in service providers will be share of wallet gain and market share gains. What makes me very, very bullish on this is on the things we can control. If you watch what Nick Adamo gets up-sales, Kelly Ahuja that Nike have done, services, Kelly's engineering, we are now winning big Service Provider deals that we would not even have been in the game in 1 year or 2 ago. And our ability to do this at a different margin level, our agility on this, and we're taking it to our competitors, and you're seeing this across the board. I would have vastly preferred it -- you can never do it exactly how you want, but having to add 5 quarters of 10% or more negative Service Provider growth, I would rather have gone from negative 10%, to negative 5% or 6%, to negative 1%, then positive, then up from there. We got a couple of deals running this quarter, which caused us to go from minus 10% to minus 1%. That's more than, I think, anybody else anticipated in the marketplace, especially when you have areas like SP Video, which drag you down by 2 or 3 points off of that. I just didn't want the market getting ahead of us. My comfort level with seeing growth this year, by the end of the year and probably before that, is extremely good in this market, but I'm modeling all wallet share gains and market share gains. I do not think Service Provider CapEx will be up this year. I hope I'm wrong. In which case, we'll get more of our share there. So I feel very, very good in the positioning.

So either way you want to measure it, we're in good shape on that. I do agree with several of your premises in terms of the 9K growth. It feels very, very good. Rod, you got to know I completely disagree dramatically with your comment about our switching products commoditizing. They're going the opposite way. This is one that I think you're going to see us get our competitors very aggressively. And even in merchant silicon like the Nexus 3000, we're doing extremely well in terms of growth in gross margins. It's an architectural play now. We saw this coming 4.5 years ago. With switching, you've got to have security, you've got to have collaboration, that's got to integrate to processor capability. It's got to tie to the Internet of Everything. There has to be a architecture that brings this together, business results. And I think our relevance and our value to the customers are going the exact opposite way.

Wins on architectures and this whole call literally is about that. So I feel very good about our total gross margin mix. We will absolutely be aggressive when we want to move consulting, as an example, to play a much larger role in our business outcomes. But our ability to have multiple levers that we can touch on, I think feels very, very good.

And when you combine an architecture like data center with an architecture like InterCloud, with an architecture like collaboration, with an architecture like security, with architectures about Big Data at the edge of the network with mobility, we can do that in a way that no one else can to get business outcomes. Customers will pay probably 3% to 5% -- 3 to 5x more for a business outcome than they will for a stand-alone switch or a stand-alone router. So as we make that transition, this is where you really see our relevance change, and this is why when you talk about digitizing countries or digitizing cities, we're all by ourselves in our ability to do it, it's about how we bring all those together in the Internet of Everything, and that has great gross margins.

I have a question on switching. Great growth. The question is can you distinguish between plain vanilla upgrades just because you have new platforms and between really changes to the architecture of data centers?

And even though we'll face new competitors, white label, et cetera, in this market, we saw that, as I said, coming a long time ago. And this is where it isn't about switching the data center. It's about convergence, about switching with storage, with servers, with security even within the data center, and then the ability with application-centric infrastructure to run that in a data center or a cloud, in the WAN, all the way to the edge. And that's about applications, again, with the network, with security, with scale. You combine those 2 and we're almost unbeatable in the approach. You do have a natural upgrade cycle with new products coming in, and there was probably a little bit of a stall when we stalled ourselves a year ago deliberately and we knew what we're doing. But we needed to transition to the new high-end switching and needed to signal people where we're going. There are additional drivers. We're starting to win network refresh, and some competitors' refresh purely because of security. Staying in this environment, they aren't going to take risk on a business where we're just going to -- I can't say crush. Yes, I can, versus white label. This is where we're going to really crush the white label people. I mean, it's got to be a security architecture type of approach. If you just say, I'm going to get merchant silicon and throw software on top of it and run data centers and run LANs and everything, all it takes is one breach and you've done more damage to your brand as a company or as a government than you could in 100 years of saving on a little bit of switching difference. And that's before you get to the outcomes in terms of the direction. Now is switching going to grow at double digits? Of course not. But I think more down the mid-single digits, and it will go up and down depending on the quarter. And there'll be a different mix in the data center versus campus."

We are, however, going to continue to partner with NetApp, which is a great relationship, almost no competitive overlap. And we announced what we're doing with IBM. And I think to the second part of your question, when we talk about pace of change, it means that your strategic partnerships, and The Wall Street Journal had an article, I think, before December, that talked about the role of strategic partnerships will dramatically change, and this will be customer partnerships as well, will be dramatically different looking out over the next several years, and determine a company's success or not in ways they haven't in the past. And part of that pace of change is you're going to have, at times, even very good customers or very good partners go into our area. We're at the center of every transition. So anytime anybody makes a networking announcement, they're going to say either this is going to hit Cisco or it doesn't. And you're going to see our evolution of our partners go in that. Having said that, you'll see us do more strategic partnering, much deeper, with many, many partners such as players like Rockwell, that you might not have thought of before or GE or players that we are literally getting closer to in terms of the direction here.

We had the courage to disrupt ourselves starting 3 years ago, and we did a huge amount of organizational evolution over the last year that allowed us to do fast innovation and agility and speed with which others cannot meet. There is no surprises to us in the market, and I mean none at the present time. It's playing out very much like we expected. It's a world that pace of change will go exponentially. But as you walk away, just kind of think about it, executing extremely well and healthy growth. Digitization will be 10x, I think, we'll say 5 to 10x to keep these solid.

But the rest of them feel headed in the right direction pretty well. 
And if you watch what we're doing in terms of our product leadership in each category and then integrating them together with architecture, it feels good. So I get pumped up. It hasn't changed, and I hope that came across. 
The pace of change and the new competitors and new challenges is something that will not change. It will go up exponentially. I believe we're going to become the #1 IT company, and our goal was to show you that and get the reward our shareholders, our customers, employees deserve.

Our Q2 results reflect continued progress, as we transform Cisco to become the #1 IT company.In the quarter, we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We gene",2839,"Mel, thank you very much. Our Q2 results reflect continued progress, as we transform Cisco to become the #1 IT company.
In the quarter, we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We delivered this strong performance despite a volatile economic environment. 
Our strong momentum is the direct result of how well we have managed our company transformation over the last 3-plus years and our leadership position in the key technology transitions such as cloud, mobility, Big Data, security, collaboration and the Internet of Everything.
The 4 key takeaways I have from this quarter are the following: First, we are executing well and growing at a healthy pace in a tough environment; second, we saw very good balanced growth, the best balance in 12 quarters across the majority of our key geographies, product categories and customer segments; third, our financials are very strong, and we continue to deliver value for our shareholders with strong earnings, cash generation and capital return, including another $0.02 dividend increase to $0.21 per quarter; and fourth, every country, every city, every business, every home and every car is becoming digital. In our view, Cisco is better positioned than any other company to help our customers reinvent their business and technology strategies as they become digital organizations.
Today, every company in every industry is a technology digital company, something people would not have said a year ago. Over the last month, I've met individually with over 100 business and government leaders. Without exception, these leaders recognize the role technology plays in their future, not just how it creates opportunity, but also risk. Customers around the world, both business and governments, are aligning with strategic partners in order to be more successful in the digital transition. They're increasingly choosing Cisco as their strategic partner, and you are seeing the evidence in our financial performance. 
Let's start with the basic question, like why Cisco? With the network at the center, Cisco has the portfolio and ability to bring our customer solutions to drive down cost, to help secure their businesses and increase the speed and agility so they can innovate across their own organizations. In our view, our track record of disrupting markets by leveraging the power of the Internet is unmatched. Our strategy has always been based on understanding the direction of major market transitions, transforming our sales to meet the needs of our customers and demonstrating the courage to disrupt not just the markets but even ourselves.
The market is moving fast, and change is exponential. We are in the strong position today we are today because we've made dramatic moves in how we're innovating, how we're interfacing with our most important customers and how we're organized to ensure Cisco is leading where the market is going. Most companies resist changing until it's too late, and their market credibility has eroded; a classic innovator's dilemma. It was our choice to move early and boldly with incredible speed to realign 40% of our employees to priority areas, to reorganize from product groups into integrated solution teams, to replace more than 30% of our leaders. We are seeing the results in our relevancy with our customers and our operational excellence, and that is driving our financial performance, where since fiscal year '11, we have added $4.9 billion in revenue, with about $300 million in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, for every dollar of revenue we've added over this transition period, we've only added about $0.06 of non-GAAP OpEx. I think you'll find this is best-in-class by a factor of five- to tenfold.
In the '90s, we were the best example of a company capitalizing on the Internet, and that gave us tremendous credibility with customers and fueled our growth. Today, as every company becomes digital, every CEO knows he or she needs to evolve the organization, to move with speed, agility and efficiency the Internet of Everything will demand of them. 
Our strategy is to be the model in how we reorganize and the customers we're driving as a result, and we've done the heavy-lifting with our peers, and customers are just starting. As a result, I'm now spending a significant amount of time with our customers' executive teams and in their boardrooms discussing how they organize for digitization, innovation, security and the Internet of Everything. We could not be better positioned in the market. We've worked very hard to get here. And the opportunity feels very much like it did in the '90s, when Internet became mission-critical to our customers.
We have said for several years that we believe the impact of the Internet of Everything would be 5 to 10x greater than that of the Internet today. At CES and the World Economic Forum, most every leader we saw agreed. We had been building for this opportunity. We have the innovation, operational excellence, speed, agility and efficiencies in our business to drive the greatest possible benefit for our customers, our partners and our shareholders.
On to guidance. As we've said for the last 2 quarters, we are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing well again. We are well positioned for a positive turn in either Service Provider or emerging markets, but we are not modeling those turns for several quarters despite the better results we saw in this last quarter for reasons we all are very much aware of.
For Q3, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.51 to $0.53.
Let me now provide some additional detail on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments, products and services business within our portfolio.
In terms of business momentum, as a reminder, the geographies are primarily the way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year, unless otherwise noted.
We finished the quarter with product orders up 5% and product book-to-bill greater than 1.
Let's move first to the Americas. The U.S. continued to accelerate, growing 7% compared with Q1, 3% growth. Latin America returned to double-digit growth at 12% versus Q1 of 5% and negative growth in fiscal year '14. Strength in the U.S. public sector continued, growing 17%, with U.S. federal growing 23% and U.S. state and local growing 8%.
Moving on to our Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. As we said on last quarter's conference call, we were more optimistic about Europe than most of our peers. And we saw that business play out as we called, with growth in EMEA of 7% year-over-year.
We saw phenomenal execution in the U.K., up 17%; Germany, up 12%; and something no one else in the industry is coming even close to, Southern Europe actually grew 20% year-over-year, speaking to the relevancy that we provide to companies and governments. Over the last 6 quarters, our growth year-over-year in EMEA has gone from minus 4% to minus 2%, to minus 1%, to 2%, to 6% in Q1 and now 7% in Q2. And we remain cautiously optimistic.
In Asia Pacific, Japan and China. In China, in particular, we continue to see challenges that all of you are aware of, and we saw our China business decline by 19%. However, we saw India grow by 11%. The rest of APJC, not including China, was down 1% this quarter.
And finally, emerging markets. Emerging markets total grew 1%, with emerging markets excluding BRICs plus Mexico up 8%, a major change from last quarter.
We continue to see the BRICs plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total, with Russia down 16%; Brazil down 8%; China, as I've said earlier, down 19%. We did see growth in Mexico up 21%; India up 11%. While we are pleased with these results, we believe it is still way too early to call a turn in emerging markets and are modeling for them to be challenging for several more quarters.
Customer segments. Total global Commercial grew a healthy 8%. Our success in the U.S. Commercial continues to be very strong, up 12% in Q2. We have built a model based on success in the U.S. commercial and best practices from around the world and have implemented the model outside the U.S., seeing our orders grow from down 5% in fiscal year '14 to up 4% year-to-date. In total Cisco business terms, that improved performance added a 4 full point to our company's growth rates.
Our new operating model and global Service Provider is also showing similar traction. This quarter, our Service Provider business was down 1% after having been down on average 10% or more for the last 5 quarters. Like many in the industry, we are modeling total global Service Provider CapEx down in the mid-single digits for calendar year 2015.
We are focused on growing share of wallet. We believe we are very well positioned in terms of our portfolio and how we've aligned with our Service Provider customers. But we expect the next several quarters to continue to be challenging and Service Provider, along with emerging markets, remain our 2 challenged areas.
Total global Enterprise grew 10% versus 2% in Q1. We did see U.S. Enterprise grow a bit slower than expected at 3% growth, due in part to the timing of some very large deals. The U.S. Enterprise pipeline continues to see rapid growth in very large multiyear deals, which should benefit Cisco over several years.
Our global Enterprise U.S. customers, which are the largest 28 Enterprise accounts, not included in our regular U.S. Enterprise discussion, grew about 30% year-over-year. Global public sector continued to be solid at 7% growth year-over-year.
I will now move on to a discussion of our products and services business, which I will discuss in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching. We saw very strong switching growth of 11%, with strong performance in both the data center switching and our campus switching business. 
We were especially pleased with the continued momentum of our Nexus ACI portfolio, including the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9K and the APIC Controller. As an example, the Nexus 3K plus 9K grew 350% year-over-year. We have seen the Nexus 9K and ACI customers grow each quarter from 580 customers 2 quarters ago to 970 customers last quarter to 1,700 this quarter. APIC customers grew to over 300, and the Nexus 9K passed the 1 million installed port mark this quarter, less than 1 year after the first shipments.
We are pulling away from our competitors and leading in both the SDN thought leadership and customer implementations.
The market has recognized the benefit of ACI as compared to PowerPoint concepts of aspirational competitors. ACI and APIC will become the cornerstone of the next generation of network and architectures for many years, much like the UCS has become in the data center.
I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching and have actually grown gross margins in many of our product switching areas which were already very strong in new areas such as the ACI portfolio.
Moving on to data center, which grew an impressive 40%. UCS has now reached over $3 billion revenue run rate, with over 41,000 customers. More than 85% of the Fortune 500 have chosen UCS because of the innovative architecture, with particularly traction in cloud, Big Data and enterprise application solutions.
The innovation underlying UCS, the convergence of compute, network and storage, is continuing to fuel our growth in the data center and differentiate Cisco. Now we are converging networking, applications, security with scale for our ACI platform. And we are doing it with a speed and a scale that no one else is coming close to.
Next, to NGN routing, which grew 2% year-over-year in terms of revenue. We saw strong performance in high-end routing, up 5%, with continued strong performance in our new product introductions such as the CRS-X and NCS.
With the global macro changes and headwinds like net neutrality and industry consolidation, we expect this business to be challenged going forward, but we believe we are taking market share and will continue to take market share.
Wireless had another strong quarter, up 18% year-over-year compared with Q1, which was up 11%. We saw strong growth in our traditional business, but in Meraki, cloud networking business continues its stellar growth, up another 100%, with an annualized run rate of approximately $400 million.
Security grew 6%, with orders growing even faster. We saw A very strong adoption of our Cisco ASA with FirePOWER services, which integrates our Sourcefire software products together. Our acquisition strategy in our Security business has been very successful, as we integrate the various elements into our overall security architecture. We fight point players in some areas, but no other vendor can play at the level across the enterprise that our customers need.
In this volatile environment1, with change happening faster than ever before, the importance of security has never been more significant. The level of danger has been raised from a firewall breach to the potential for enterprise destruction, and having robust, security solutions before, during and after attack is table stakes. In this environment, customers are migrating to partners they can trust, who will lead with innovation and who will be around tomorrow. This trusted partnership is core to our success and drives everything we do. Cisco is the #1 security player in terms of revenue, and we are progressing nicely toward our goal of becoming the #1 security company in terms of mind share, which, literally, we announced 1.5 years ago an intention to do so.
Moving on to collaboration. Last quarter, we boldly stated our intention is to lead in the next generation of collaboration and become the #1 collaboration player. After a complete portfolio refresh and 4 quarters of decline, we made very good progress this quarter, with growth of 10%. Kelly, I think it was flat or negative last quarter, if I remember. 
Within collaboration, the strongest growth came from our TelePresence business, where we saw, on the back of our new TelePresence portfolio, a 60% growth in units and revenue growth of 35%. We continue to grow our recurring business in collaboration. Our deferred collaboration revenue was up 26% in the quarter to $1.1 billion.
SP Video declined 19%. We've announced key partnership wins to develop the next-generation end-to-end video solutions from the set-top box to the cloud.
Service revenues grew 5%. We saw our portfolio in cloud, security, consulting and analytics all grew in double digits. This quarter, we launched Cisco Connected Analytics strategy to manage the explosive growth of data at the edge of the networks.
As the Internet of Everything evolves, we forecast as much as 50% of the data will be handled and decisions will be made at the edge of the network. Given Cisco's position in the network, Cisco is the only company positioned to manage and capture the insight from distributed data. This has the potential to be an important growth area for Cisco and, even more importantly, to drive the value of the Internet of Everything.
Let me now provide an update on Cisco's momentum in the cloud. Cisco's cloud strategy is pervasive throughout our portfolio. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market, and our InterCloud momentum continues. As you look at our cloud business, I would look at the following metrics to track our success. First, Cisco's leadership in cloud infrastructure was once more reaffirmed with the release of the latest Synergy Group's research report showing we have retained and strengthened our #1 position for sales of hardware and software used to build cloud infrastructure. 
Second, we are growing our cloud services, including managed security, Project Squared and Collaboration, EnergyWise and Meraki for enterprise. Cisco and Telstra are now both in production with OpenStack-based public cloud services. And third, our InterCloud ecosystem continues to grow and now exceeds over 50 partners within 400 data centers across more than 50 countries. Rob, just a great job by your team and your leadership.
Customers are using InterCloud fabric and ACI to implement highly secure and on-premise hybrid cloud capabilities across heterogeneous environments.
To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about stand-alone products. They are about new revenue streams, growth and outcomes; about securing and about managing their businesses; about how they have to reorganize to drive the innovation their survival requires. We are executing across our business because we are bringing together our product leadership in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes.
I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments on the quarter and guidance for the next quarter. Kelly, welcome, and great to have you leading the conference call."

Overall, we had a strong quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion, growing 7%. We grew profit faster than revenue, with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, up",1077,"Thanks, John. Overall, we had a strong quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion, growing 7%. We grew profit faster than revenue, with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 13%. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.46.
Product revenue increased 8%, and service revenue increased 5%, with product book-to-bill greater than 1. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%.
In our guidance last quarter, we told you that we expected total non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%. For Q2, our total non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP product gross margins came in at 61.7% and 60.8%, respectively, reflecting the mix of our business and especially the strength of UCS.
Non-GAAP service gross margin was 64.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.0 billion or 33.3% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.1% in Q1 of fiscal year '15.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 5% quarter-over-quarter and up 6% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software.
Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q2 of fiscal year '15 included a pretax gain of $126 million or approximately $0.02 per share related to the reorganization of our investment in VCE. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Now moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate, which was 22%, consistent with our expectations. In connection with the recently reinstated U.S. Federal R&D tax credit, we had a tax benefit of $91 million related to fiscal 2014 that we excluded from our non-GAAP net income. The extension of the R&D tax credit did not have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate during Q2 and is not expected to have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate for the remainder of fiscal '15 since the benefit only extended through December 31, 2014.
We ended the quarter with our headcount at 70,112, a decrease of 2,135 from Q1. As a reminder, we took restructuring actions to invest in growth, innovation and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies.
We announced and completed 1 acquisition during the quarter, Neohapsis, a provider of network and security consulting services, to enhance our offerings to our customers.
Looking at our geographic segment results. In terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, our Americas segment was up 10%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 3%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.0%, EMEA was 61.8% and APJC was 60.3%.
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $53.0 billion, including a $3.2 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.9 billion during the quarter.
Deferred revenue was $14 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 14%, largely driven by subscription-based offerings, while Services' deferred revenue grew 2%. We continue to build a greater mix of recurring revenue, as reflected in our deferred revenue balance.
Our DSO was strong at 35 days as compared to 36 days in Q2 of fiscal year '14.
In Q2, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders that included $1.2 billion through share repurchases and $974 million through our quarterly dividend. In the first half of fiscal year '15, we have returned approximately $4.2 billion or 86% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $2 billion of dividends.
In addition, today, our board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share, an approximate 11% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.1%. We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy.
Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and actual results could be above or below guidance.
The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. And as we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by 1 point in either direction from our guidance range.
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the third quarter.
Our Q3 '15 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53.
We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.09 to $0.12 per share in Q3 '15. The range includes a pretax charge of up to $100 million in Q3 '15 as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q2, we recognized a pretax charge of -- in our GAAP financial statements of $69 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year '15. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant.
Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets or the Service Provider segment in the near future. Although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, with these types of uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats 1 quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments."
19691,283133258,760623,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter, which were the best results in 3 years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products and segments, reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the stronge",872,"Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter, which were the best results in 3 years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products and segments, reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the strongest it's ever been. Our vision has always been to change the way that people work, live, play and learn. And you've heard us say this for nearly 20 years. Digitization is the next and perhaps the most significant evolution of our vision.
At CES, 15 years ago, we showed a network car, Wi-Fi-enabled and connected to a coffee shop, so you could order your own drinks and make changes to that. Fast-forward to several years ago. We introduced the market to the Internet of Everything. While the concepts were thought leadership for many years, this year, companies and countries are seeing the Internet of Everything as a business imperative and top priority.
To take advantage of the Internet of Everything, every country, company, city, home and car has to be digital. The single most important investments are at the center of their digital business and technology strategy for our customers. And at the center of that will be the intelligent network, from the data center, to the edge through the cloud, all brought together with an end-to-end security, and Cisco has never ever been better positioned.
In the '90s when companies needed to get online on the Internet, Cisco was the thought leader, the company with the product leadership and the best example of a company capitalizing on all the transitions. Our customers wanted our help and to follow our example.
Fast-forward to today. The next generation of the Internet, the Internet of Everything, should generate at least 5 to 10x the value of the first generation of the Internet to date. Again, no one is better positioned than Cisco in terms of strategy, market position, product leadership, architectures and organization structure.
I am not sure those outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have implemented over the last year, largely because of our ability to continue to deliver to the long-term value to our customers and to our shareholders despite the challenges in the market.
Most companies wait to change until they have to, when it's obvious and it's often game over, and those companies get left behind. In the last year, we were willing to disrupt our leadership position, for example, in switching and routing, by introducing entirely new platforms. We knew we'd see a short-term impact but told the market how we would grow. Once again, we did what we said we would do. This is just one of many examples, and these are exactly the hard decisions our customers, employees, partners and shareholders have trusted us to make so we can lead in these market transitions.
I want to congratulate and thank the Cisco team for believing in the vision and executing one of the most successful company transformations the industry has witnessed. Very few companies could do what we have done with the speed and the results we have driven. And the opportunity we created for ourselves is truly exciting and, in many ways, just getting started.
Our transformational work will continue as we help our customers digitize everything, secure everything and organize their companies, their governments, their businesses for the Internet of Everything. 
Because of the agility we've built into our organization and our ability to align directly with our customers' goals, we are helping our customers with their business outcomes. And let me be very direct here. We're winning very large Service Provider, Enterprise and Public Sector deals that we would not have won just as recently as 1 year ago.
We do see our competitors struggling and know we are not immune from economic or other challenges in the market. While we believe we have positioned the company better than any of our peers, we do still see the same challenges we had discussed in the past few quarters, specifically emerging markets and service providers, as continuing to provide a negative drag for the next few quarters.
What I believe the market now understands is that Cisco is managing effectively through a challenging macro, leading through transitions, disrupting markets, increasing our relevancy with our customers and delivering value to our shareholders.
Looking forward, we've laid an incredibly exciting foundation for future growth, innovation and leadership, reinventing the network with application-centric infrastructure, a platform at the very early stages of its future potential, our leadership in security, the most important topic in IT today in many ways, our emerging role in data and analytics at the edge and how we will bring all this together to enable the Internet of Everything. 
We have our stakes in the ground to capture tremendous opportunities in front of us and are well on our way to become the #1 IT company. The momentum in the business feels extremely good, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. 
We will now move, Mel, to what I enjoy the most, which is the Q&A section. And it's over to you, Mel. And I'll try to keep my answers tight, and I'll do better this time."

We probably had 8 or 9 areas that were very close to the half's growth rate we've had in 2 years. And you're focusing me on the 2 challenges, more than fair. So let's go to the issue of Services gross margins. If you watch, we start with the big picture. Our revenue growth areas, what is our gross margins, our OpEx. Kelly and I have a lot of leverage we can pull within that. Within the gross margins, we have never been more comfortable. And actually, I said this almost 3 or 4 quarters ago, Mel, I've never been more comfortable with any aspect of our business and our ability to maintain gross margins. It's a mix issue as you go through it. To the Services question, we've had great Services gross margins, unequaled in the industry. Gary, our technical services, what you and Joe Pinto have done is amazing there. Our advanced services is an area that we're moving very aggressively in. And that's where you see a little bit of the pull-down on the services model. And as you become outcome-based, as you refocus on these new growth areas, being able to literally digitize a country, digitize a city, digitize a manufacturing company, a health care company, et cetera, you saw us invest an awful lot in vertical consultancy. You saw us invest in security in a big way with major expectations in terms of expertise centers, et cetera, and in cloud. So we're going to continue to make investments in these areas. And I'm very comfortable with our gross margin portfolio. I actually think our gross margins has been the most predictable part of our total business although we have a lot of various variables in that. On security. Security will occasionally be bumpy. We reorganized our organization and realigned security across the whole globe with a separate sales force. As you make those changes, you occasionally lose a little bit of momentum before you pick it up. The order growth was actually at 9% for security. I expect security to grow very healthily as we move forward. And you'll continue to see us make a number of both resource investments in areas like services, sales investments to really lead in that, and consultancy, in a way that really brings this picture to life. But I think you're going to see good growth out of our security business. I think we're positioned extremely well. And I kind of in a fun way challenge you, when an enterprise customer has 45 to 60 security players in their environment, how many they really have? And you look at the CEO in the eye, and they go, ""I get it, John. We've got to consolidate this, and the network's where it's going to get consolidated."" So I'm very comfortable in terms of our security growth over time. Do not see any issues in terms of strategy, vision or margins here."

My premise on service providers is you're going to see negative growth in terms of CapEx for this year. I met a lot of the experts saying it's actually going to be uglier in the next 6 months than it will the back half of the year. So our assumption is any gain in service providers will be share of wallet gain and market share gains. What makes me very, very bullish on this is on the things we can control. If you watch what Nick Adamo gets up-sales, Kelly Ahuja that Nike have done, services, Kelly's engineering, we are now winning big Service Provider deals that we would not even have been in the game in 1 year or 2 ago. And our ability to do this at a different margin level, our agility on this, and we're taking it to our competitors, and you're seeing this across the board. I would have vastly preferred it -- you can never do it exactly how you want, but having to add 5 quarters of 10% or more negative Service Provider growth, I would rather have gone from negative 10%, to negative 5% or 6%, to negative 1%, then positive, then up from there. We got a couple of deals running this quarter, which caused us to go from minus 10% to minus 1%. That's more than, I think, anybody else anticipated in the marketplace, especially when you have areas like SP Video, which drag you down by 2 or 3 points off of that. I just didn't want the market getting ahead of us. My comfort level with seeing growth this year, by the end of the year and probably before that, is extremely good in this market, but I'm modeling all wallet share gains and market share gains. I do not think Service Provider CapEx will be up this year. I hope I'm wrong. In which case, we'll get more of our share there. So I feel very, very good in the positioning.

But if you watch our normal booking trends, and if you watch where we've gone, and let's use total bookings as an example, from Q1 to Q2, it was up at the very high end of our seasonality bookings sequentially and the year-over-year numbers. So either way you want to measure it, we're in good shape on that. I do agree with several of your premises in terms of the 9K growth. It feels very, very good. Rod, you got to know I completely disagree dramatically with your comment about our switching products commoditizing. They're going the opposite way. This is one that I think you're going to see us get our competitors very aggressively. And even in merchant silicon like the Nexus 3000, we're doing extremely well in terms of growth in gross margins. It's an architectural play now. We saw this coming 4.5 years ago.

First of all, Europe was 7% growth, which I don't think anybody else is getting. You take Russia out, it would have been 9% growth. But you did see remarkable growth across many of the countries, where they're really being impacted by foreign exchange, et cetera. The way we look at foreign exchange, we do business in dollars, as most of you know on that, so we perhaps enter all the correlation as quickly as others. But it does mean the deal size may not be as large or it does mean that there might be pressure on discounts to provide a total solution. And when you see us grow at 20% across Southern Europe, I mean, I'm not aware of anybody else that is growing in Southern Europe, period, much less those type of numbers. It speaks to our strategy working. Foreign exchange does have some impact on it and, Kelly, maybe if you'd like to add some addition to that?"

I have a question on switching. Great growth. The question is can you distinguish between plain vanilla upgrades just because you have new platforms and between really changes to the architecture of data centers?

Is there any is there any way we can have evidence that the cycle is longer rather than shorter when it comes to switching?"

And even though we'll face new competitors, white label, et cetera, in this market, we saw that, as I said, coming a long time ago. And this is where it isn't about switching the data center. It's about convergence, about switching with storage, with servers, with security even within the data center, and then the ability with application-centric infrastructure to run that in a data center or a cloud, in the WAN, all the way to the edge. And that's about applications, again, with the network, with security, with scale. You combine those 2 and we're almost unbeatable in the approach. You do have a natural upgrade cycle with new products coming in, and there was probably a little bit of a stall when we stalled ourselves a year ago deliberately and we knew what we're doing. But we needed to transition to the new high-end switching and needed to signal people where we're going. There are additional drivers. We're starting to win network refresh, and some competitors' refresh purely because of security. Staying in this environment, they aren't going to take risk on a business where we're just going to -- I can't say crush. Yes, I can, versus white label. This is where we're going to really crush the white label people. I mean, it's got to be a security architecture type of approach. If you just say, I'm going to get merchant silicon and throw software on top of it and run data centers and run LANs and everything, all it takes is one breach and you've done more damage to your brand as a company or as a government than you could in 100 years of saving on a little bit of switching difference. And that's before you get to the outcomes in terms of the direction. Now is switching going to grow at double digits? Of course not. But I think more down the mid-single digits, and it will go up and down depending on the quarter. And there'll be a different mix in the data center versus campus."

We are, however, going to continue to partner with NetApp, which is a great relationship, almost no competitive overlap. And we announced what we're doing with IBM. And I think to the second part of your question, when we talk about pace of change, it means that your strategic partnerships, and The Wall Street Journal had an article, I think, before December, that talked about the role of strategic partnerships will dramatically change, and this will be customer partnerships as well, will be dramatically different looking out over the next several years, and determine a company's success or not in ways they haven't in the past. And part of that pace of change is you're going to have, at times, even very good customers or very good partners go into our area. We're at the center of every transition. So anytime anybody makes a networking announcement, they're going to say either this is going to hit Cisco or it doesn't. And you're going to see our evolution of our partners go in that. Having said that, you'll see us do more strategic partnering, much deeper, with many, many partners such as players like Rockwell, that you might not have thought of before or GE or players that we are literally getting closer to in terms of the direction here. Relationship with EMC is very, very good. We like them, they like us, and we do a lot of business together. I think, Gary, the run rate was 50% year-over-year growth together plus some?"

And how different than before, it's just not one product area, it's how we can bring architectures together with services and a different sales motion. 
We had the courage to disrupt ourselves starting 3 years ago, and we did a huge amount of organizational evolution over the last year that allowed us to do fast innovation and agility and speed with which others cannot meet. There is no surprises to us in the market, and I mean none at the present time. It's playing out very much like we expected. It's a world that pace of change will go exponentially. But as you walk away, just kind of think about it, executing extremely well and healthy growth. Digitization will be 10x, I think, we'll say 5 to 10x to keep these solid.

And it means we are positioned as they eventually turn in emerging markets, which they will. And there will always be challenges in a group like China and Russia and Brazil. But the rest of them feel headed in the right direction pretty well. 
And if you watch what we're doing in terms of our product leadership in each category and then integrating them together with architecture, it feels good. So I get pumped up. It hasn't changed, and I hope that came across. 
The pace of change and the new competitors and new challenges is something that will not change. It will go up exponentially. I believe we're going to become the #1 IT company, and our goal was to show you that and get the reward our shareholders, our customers, employees deserve.

We delivered revenues of $12.1 billion, up 5%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.54, up 6%. We maintained strong non-GAAP gross margins at 62.5%, generated $3.0 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
last week was a great week for us, as we announced the CO who will lead Cisco in its next chapter. I am extremely excited to be joined today by Cisco's newly named CEO, Chuck Robbins. Chuck, welcome very much. I am confident you will come to understand why the Cisco Board of Directors and I are so convinced he is the right leader for Cisco right now. 
As I reflect back, I'm extremely honored and proud to have led Cisco for the last 20-plus years. We set out the change the way the world works, lives, learns and plays, and while many thought this was a very ambitious and unobtainable goal, we absolutely have achieved that goal. 
We have delivered incredible innovation and have disrupted markets and at times ourselves. We have seen many competitors come and go. We've had our setbacks but always come back even stronger, something almost no other technology company has done. 
We have remained incredibly focused on delivering for our shareholders. We are a cash and profit machine and have maintained our margins over time by delivering sustainable differentiation through integrated architectures based on intelligent networks. 
What I am most proud of, however, is how well positioned we are to repeat the success of this last 20 years. 
Across every market and every industry, we are moving from the information age to the digital age, and the pace of change is only accelerating. Cisco is in a very strong leadership position. Our vision and strategy are working, as every company, city and country becomes digital. They're realizing Cisco is best positioned to help them as they become digital organizations. 
What our customers recognize is Cisco's unique track record and ability to anticipate, transition and deliver the innovations to help our customers adapt and accelerate in this new environment. Cisco's sustainable differentiation over time, as reflecting our strong gross margins, profitability and cash generation, is the result of our ability to deliver integrated architectures and solutions with scale, speed and security no one else can. 
We've moved from selling boxes, cloud, mobility or any other solution to partner with customers on their outcomes, 44,000 jobs in Barcelona, education and health care accessible to virtually every home in Israel, entirely new cloud-based revenue streams for service providers and General Motors smart factory of the future. 
Competitors selling low-cost technology building blocks can't compete with our total cost advantage, operational efficiency, security and speed to result that Cisco provides. And when there is an issue, we have all seen the nightmare of trying to identify where and who to call translate into billions in lost business and reputational damages. 
When companies and countries go digital, IT becomes a board-level concern and reliability, security, trust matter more than ever. The Cisco brand is behind every one of our architectures matters more now than ever. 
We are seeing our move from selling boxes to selling outcomes translate into strong execution in a tough global market. We are seeing many areas of strength, including global enterprise with order growth of 7%, global commercial orders up 6% and global public sector orders up 7%. 
The U.S., excluding Service Provider, was particularly strong, with [indiscernible] U.S. Enterprise order growth up 21%, U.S. commercial order growth of 11% and U.S. public sector order growth of 10%. 
We saw good revenue growth across almost all of our technologies. The volatility in Service Provider in emerging markets we have discussed in prior quarters continues. Our Service Provider business remains challenged, both globally and in the U.S. Service Provider orders globally decreased 7%, and U.S. Service Provider orders declined 17%. Emerging market orders were flat, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 6% while the remaining emerging markets grew 6%. I believe, we have organized well to capture more than our share in these markets and positioned ourselves for their inevitable upturns. 
Like every other company, we are also managing the impact of currency fluctuations globally. Kelly and I are both very pleased with the focus of the whole company on maintaining stable gross margins in this environment. We were specially pleased with how the sales teams have held gross margins in a very tough foreign exchange environment. Repeating the common theme, those critics that felt new software or business models would have a major negative impact on our business and our margins were just wrong. 
Clearly, there are more positive than headwinds, and I am very pleased with our solid execution. At a time when many of our peers are seeing revenues decline, we delivered profitable growth as we said we would and order delivered -- over delivered almost on every metric we set. 
Now I will move on to guidance. I continue to be pleased with our execution in a tough environment, the strength of our financial model and the return we continue to drive for our shareholders. For Q4, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. 
Let me now provide some additional details on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments and product and services business with our portfolio.
As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted. 
We finished the quarter with product orders up 2%, and product book-to-bill is greater than 1. Moving first to the Americas. Americas grew in total 2%. I discussed upfront the U.S. public sector growth of 10%, with the U.S. federal growth up 24% and state and local up 1%. We also discussed the very strong U.S. Enterprise growth of 21% and U.S. Commercial growth of 11%. and U.S. Service Provider was down 17%. Latin America had another strong double-digit growth quarter. 
Moving on to Europe, Middle East and Africa. We saw Europe, Middle East and Africa growth of 2%. Europe first turned up for us 5 quarters ago and, since then, has averaged mid-single-digit growth, including this quarter. If you take out Russia, we saw solid growth across all of Europe, Middle East and Africa of 4%. 
We were pleased to see Asia Pacific, Japan and China return to growth, growing 1%. And just to give an idea of what sometimes the merger markets have an impact on in terms of our business, with Asia Pacific, China, Japan and China minus China, growing at 8%. 
And finally, emerging countries. Emerging markets in total were flat. The emerging markets, excluding BRICs plus Mexico, grew 6%. As discussed, we continue to see the BRICs plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total, with Russia down 41%, Brazil down 10% and China down 20%. We did see strong growth in Mexico, up 53%; and India, up 6%. 
We are modeling the volatility in emerging markets to continue for several more quarters. 
Now moving on to customer segments. We discussed the strong growth of total global enterprise up 7%, with total global commercial up 6% and global public sector up 7%. The new models we have implemented globally in each of these segments are working. 
In Enterprise, the shift to selling outcomes, not products, is resulting in larger opportunities and dramatic increases in pipeline. In U.S. Enterprise, for example, the value of our pipeline of deals over $1 million increased approximately 60% year-over-year, with the average deal size up over 30%. 
We are managing continued challenges in our Service Provider business, which declined 7%, as Global Service Provider CapEx remained under pressure and industry consolidation continues. We believe the organizational changes we have made in our Global Service Provider organization are working, and we are very focused on growing our share of wallet. 
At Mobile World Congress earlier this year, we issued announcements with over 10 global service providers, including the launch of Cloud VP and service with Deutsche Telekom, connected car service with AT&T and a small sales solution for large enterprise deployments with Vodafone. 
Now moving on to products and service. I will discuss products and service business in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching. We saw another solid quarter in switching, with growth of 6%. The strong momentum of our Application Centric Infrastructure portfolio continues. The Nexus 3K plus 9K grew 144%. We added over 970 new Nexus 9K customers and ACI customers this quarter to reach a total of over 2,650 customers. 
The APIC Controller customers grew from over 300 last quarter to 580 this quarter. Nonpay orders plus ASIC grew sequentially 27%, and we expect that sequential growth to accelerate in Q4. 
We also saw good momentum in our campus portfolio, especially in fixed. We did see some pressure in our modular switching, as we managed to transition in the high-end of our switching portfolio. As we discussed, we expect this transition to continue for a few more quarters. 
I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching even as we're driving our product transition in the data center. Moving on to the data center. UCS momentum continues with over $3 billion in revenue run rate, with over 43,800 UCS customers. The number of repeat UCS customers grew 34% year-over-year. The innovation UCS brought to the market and architecture that convergence networking, servers and storage has disrupted the market, and Cisco went from nowhere to the market share leader in x86 plays in the U.S. and the #2 player worldwide, with more than 85% of the Fortune 500 companies now investing in UCS. 
We continue to see significant growth with our converged offerings, including VCE and FlexPod, in addition to the positive initial ramp with our IBM versus Stack solutions. 
We had a solid quarter in NGN routing, which grew 4%. We saw solid performance in high-end routing again this quarter, up 5%, supported by strong momentum in our new product introductions, including the CRS-X and NCS, which were both up over 200%. This growth is a direct result of the transition we drove in our core routing over the last several years. 
During the quarter, Verizon announced it is moving to a next-generation 100-gig metro network in the U.S. And then it will test and deploy Cisco networking convergent systems, the NCS. No one thought we were even in this game. Our ability to win the deal was entirely driven by our new generation in terms of engineering organization, our ability to deliver integrated architectures, our agility with engineering to realign resources quickly, the speed of our innovation and our unique ability to partner with our customer to shape their future and the future of the industry. 
Moving on to wireless. We saw solid growth of 9%. Meraki continued with just very strong momentum, up 92% year-over-year, and it drove most of our growth this quarter in the wireless category, as they add new customers to their cloud managed wireless platform. We did see some softness in public sector wireless spending, driven primarily by e-rate funding timing. 
Security growth rebounded to a strong 14%, with orders growing even faster. We saw a number of strong trends and data points that support our strategy to drive to an integrated security architecture across our customers' organizations. Customers are realizing that dozens of security vendors in their business are not solving their challenges. 
As everything in the world becomes digital, they want a player who can set, step up and be their trusted partner across the board. No one is better positioned than Cisco. We are -- we believe we are the only player capable of providing an integrated architecture across intelligent networks and are confident in our strategy to be the #1 security company for our customers. 
A few examples of our momentum include: in this quarter, we signed a record number of security enterprise license agreements. Our FirePOWER series, which integrates our Sourcefire software are continuing to show very strong momentum, far exceeding our initial forecast; and we saw continued strong traction and growth in our advanced threat solutions, including advanced malware protection everywhere and cyber threat defense. 
Moving on to collaboration. Our Collaboration momentum continues, with revenue growth of 7%. This quarter was a strong quarter for TelePresence endpoints, with revenue up 19% and unit orders up a record 66%. The team is on a mission to put Collaboration in every office and every room. Our strategy is to deliver a new generation of product experiences at significantly lower prices, and it is working. We also saw strong performance of our cloud-based offerings, with conferencing growth of 11%. More people than ever are using WebEx, with a number of available users going over 28% to over 15 million users. 
In the quarter, we launched Spark for Teams, which is proven to be a strong play in the very hot business messaging market. SP Video declined 5%. We continue to focus on improving profitability in this business, as we develop next-generation end-to-end video solutions, combining hardware, software and services. 
Services revenue grew 3%, with orders growing faster than revenue. We saw growth in both technical and advanced services. And our portfolio of cloud, security, consulting and analytics grew in double digits again this quarter. 
Our gross margins continued to lead the industry by a significant amount and remained very stable in terms of services gross margin in the 65% range, plus or minus 1 point or 2. 
We continue to believe our strategy to provide higher value to our customers by delivering business outcomes is working. The opportunities that are ahead of us, as we move into the Internet of Everything, are very real. We look at the increased security requirements and the demand for security consultancy services. We also focus on the need to manage and capture insights for data distribution across the enterprise and network. We are moving rapidly to build the capabilities across our portfolio to differentiate Cisco's leadership in the Internet of Everything. 
Now let me provide an update on Cisco's momentum in cloud. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market and increase our InterCloud momentum. This quarter, we launched Phase 2 of our InterCloud strategy, linking different clouds together using interoperable and app-centric software to create hybrid clouds. Rob, thank you so much for your leadership here. The team's doing a great job. You're welcome. 
During the quarter, we announced Cisco and Microsoft will integrate Cisco cloud innovations with Microsoft Azure to help service providers more quickly and cost efficiently launch new applications. We will also extended the enterprise class security and services in customer private clouds to Microsoft Azure with Cisco cloud services router to 1000b [ph]. 
Within our strategy to work across hyper visors and stacks, we continue our investment in OpenStack, with the launch at our Worldwide Partners Conference at Cisco OpenStack private cloud solutions aimed at on-premise cloud capabilities for application developers. 
To summarize my comments. Our customer conversations today are not about stand-alone products. They are simply about digitization, growth, new revenue streams for them, innovation and business outcomes. We believe we are a point away from our competition using the same formula that we've always used, integrating our industry-leading products in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes. We've created this opportunity, and it is ours to execute. 
I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments of the quarter and guidance for next quarter. To you, Kelly."

Overall, we had a very solid quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $12.1 billion, increasing 5%, and we expanded our non-GAAP operating margin to 28.6%, with both non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS growing 6% to $2.8 billion and $0.54, respectively. 
Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.47. 
Product revenue increased 6% and service revenue increased 3%, with product book-to-bill greater than 1. For Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin came in at 62.5% and 61.8%, respectively. The increase in our non-GAAP product gross margin as compared to Q2 was driven by improved productivity, partially offset by product mix and pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 65.0%. 
Looking at our geographic segment results in terms of total revenue. Our Americas segment was up 8%. EMEA was up 2%, and APJC was down 1%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.9%. EMEA was 62.5%, while APJC was 61.2%.
Our non-GAAP operating expense is up $4.1 billion -- or were $4.1 billion, up 3% or 33.9% as a percentage of revenue as compared to 34.6% in Q3 of fiscal year '14. 
Our headcount increased by approximately 800 to 70,951, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software. 
A non-GAAP tax provision rate of 22% for the quarter was consistent with our expectations. Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share included a benefit of $164 million or approximately $0.03 per share related to the charge we recorded in Q2 of '14 for a supplier component matter. The adjustment in the reduction of the liability, reflecting lower-than-expected cost to remediate the impacted products with our customers. This amount is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $54.4 billion, including $2.6 billion available on the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $3.0 billion during the quarter. 
Deferred revenue was $14.2 billion, up 8%. Product deferred revenue grew in the double digits again this quarter at 12%, driven largely by subscription-based offerings, while Services deferred revenue also grew, up 6%, reflecting an increase in multi-year service arrangements. 
We continue to build a greater mix of recurring revenue, as reflected in our deferred revenue. 
Our DSO was 37 days as compared to 35 days in Q3 of '14. 
In Q3, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders that included $1.0 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend, which we increased 11% last quarter. So far, in fiscal year '15, we have returned approximately $6.2 billion or 83% of free cash flow to our shareholders comprised of $3.2 billion of share repurchases and $3.0 billion of dividends.
Now let me provide a few comments on our guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And actual results could be above or below guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis, with reconciliation to GAAP. 
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 1% to 3% growth on a year-over-year basis. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and pricing. 
As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by 1 point in either direction of our guidance range. 
Or non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% [ph] in the fourth quarter. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q4 '15. The range includes a pretax charge of approximately $100 million as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. 
During Q3, we recognized pretax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $24 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year '15. 
Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details. 
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant.
We believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, and we'll continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats 1 quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on this financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments."

I believe Cisco is in a very positive inflection point. In our 1997 Annual Report, when it was not obvious that the Internet would take off, we boldly declared that an Internet revolution would alter the fortune",755,"Kelly, thank you very much, and nice job. I believe Cisco is in a very positive inflection point. 
In our 1997 Annual Report, when it was not obvious that the Internet would take off, we boldly declared that an Internet revolution would alter the fortune of companies, countries and people, and we saw it come to life. A number of years ago, we started talking about the next phase of Internet, the Internet of Everything, that will be much bigger than the last. And it will require everything to become digital. At the time, almost no one understood what we saw. Today, it's everyone's idea. 
The conversations we are having today with our customers are so similar in many ways to those that we had 20 years ago. We have always been at the example and saw the transitions early. And when others start noticing them, they are well underway. As we help companies, cities, countries digitize, the outcomes are exciting, job creation, quality of life, efficient use of resources. Our customers feel the pace of change accelerating, and they see the disruption in the industry and market. They know their success depends on fast innovation, digitizing their business, entirely new IT organization structures and business organization structures. Whether they are the disruptor or the incumbent, they are coming to Cisco as their strategic partner in the digital transformation. 
As they build their businesses around mobile, cloud, social, data and analytics, they recognize that integrated architectures, with the intelligent networks at the core, will accelerate or, if they don't take advantage of it, inhibit their ability to move with the speed, scale and security required. 
In simple terms, they know they will either disrupt or be disrupted. 
I am spending more and more of my time with CEOs, board of directors and government leaders to explain the combination of technological, organizational and process transformation to meet these goals of our customers. And as in the '90s, in order to be a true partner to our customers, we have to lead by example. Cisco is the reference point for how you reinvent yourself, to embrace the opportunities of digitization and the speed of innovation required for the future. 
We are 3 years ahead and making our own transitions. And with the pace of change in our market, 3 years makes a huge difference. What does that mean for Cisco and our shareholders? First, we spent the last 20 years moving everything to IP and taking advantage of convergence. The intelligent network is at the center of every market transition, and no one comes close to Cisco when it comes to the network. As 50 billion more devices come online, we have a strong hand to play and we are playing it. 
Second, we are driving outcomes for our customers through architectures. This is how we differentiate against White Label and single-product companies, and you can see this in our financial results: our margin stability, operating leverage, market share and growth. 
Third, in a digital world, security becomes even more important. Cisco is the logical choice as we combine a security architecture of across the intelligent network. Understanding the directions of the market and challenging ourselves to reinvent is how we address this opportunity and drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
There could not be a better time to begin Cisco's next chapter, and there is no one more excited than I am to have Chuck Robbins as the next CEO for Cisco. I want to thank the Cisco employees who are leading our change and driving our innovation, and your patient and energy is making Cisco's future possible. Chuck, I know you will leverage the things that have made us great to date. I also know you'll make changes when needed and drive innovation and new capabilities at a faster pace. 
Cisco's momentum is strong and we are extremely well positioned for the opportunities created by digitization. Every business and government leader is learning the benefits of becoming digital. Growth, leadership, efficiency, productivity, conservation, safety, quality of life and education, these outcomes that are at the core of what Cisco has enabled for the last 20 years. We wanted the use of the Internet to change the way we work, live, learn and play, and that's exactly what we've done in the past and what we will do even more in the future. 
With that now, we'll move to the session that I enjoy much, which is the Q&A. Let me turn it over to you."

Mel, I'm probably going to break a couple of my golden rules of 20 years with something my comments today. Joe, can do the same thing after 10 years on the job. But answering them in sequence. First of all, the opportunity is",809,"Got you, and it's always fun. Mel, I'm probably going to break a couple of my golden rules of 20 years with something my comments today. Joe, can do the same thing after 10 years on the job. But answering them in sequence. First of all, the opportunity is definitely a revenue growth and profit growth. And as you sell solutions moving to outcomes, and you can do that much faster because of your architectures and your intelligent network, you get margin stability and premiums to go with it. Let me use maybe just a couple quick examples of how I'd illustrate that. In the U.S. Enterprise, if we would've told you that the top U.S. Enterprise accounts under Breitenstein were to be able to grow at 21% year-over-year, you'd say, ""I doubt that."" But it took us a while. There were a couple of funds in the transition. But if you now grow at that rate, and have the number of large opportunities increase at the pace that we saw, you can see an inflection point, which will absolutely translate not just to growth in U.S. Enterprise, but globally. And let me give an idea how that pipeline is expanding. We now sell business transformations, what Brian and Sandy do there together, in their present time, we have 1,200 projects going on business transformation and outcomes. That is a pipeline of $3.7 billion in opportunity over the next 18 months. Now we won't get all of that, but it gives you an idea of how rapidly that project has changed. They sell to the business community, the Board or the CIO as opposed to responding RFPs. In the last quarter alone, you had 540 new projects in the quarter put into this pipeline, and they had a potential of $915 million. What Chuck has done so well, whether it's in the Enterprise business, and you take it globally, Chuck, and taken that model and rebuilding in our strategy, envision strategy make it together, is exactly one of the reasons he got this job. The commercial market phase in the U.S. has grown for 6 quarters in a row at approximately 10% to 11%. No one else in the world is doing those numbers. Again, Simona, it is purely business-based outcomes and selling architectures. And what Chuck has done there is he's taken what Alice and Gleeson did, taken at all on a global basis and so you see the same opportunity from that perspective. In terms of our 2 headwinds, the emerging markets is hard to call. And I think it's often easy to take out a couple pieces and say, ""This is what our growth would've been otherwise."" But think about it. Our profit emerging markets is now down to 3 major countries only: It's China, Asia Pacific, without China and set of growing at 1% would've grown at 8%. Chuck, you and I go there every quarter, because maybe go [indiscernible]. Will turnaround governments get along. Russia and Europe, 41%, and it took down the numbers there  fair's amount. But Service Provider, which was our biggest hit this quarter versus last quarter, instead of being down 1% was down 7%, and Mel, we said last quarter, it's going to take us time to get this fixed. We didn't expect a positive upturn. I'm going to break one of my roles. I feel very comfortable as you see the next several quarters, Kelly, that's one Chuck, one of my bad habits I want you to keep. Particular that Service Provider, we'll turn that back positive. Organization changes that Chuck made in the field, the in a very organization sideways focus on outcomes, knocking down literally silos over 60 business units that now are integrated toward outcomes together. That will turn back positive, and we aren't modeling it because CapEx is going to increase. We do not think it will in the second half of the year. We think, actually, our share of wallet is going to change. Now let me put these pieces together. When you win a Verizon deal; people that it did what that was that. That was optical in an area that we had traditionally not been strong in. Because he organized our sales engine different, our service engines different and our R&D engine different, we understood what the customer wanted, we understood on-the-fly how we realign resources, we invested how you're going to have a win rate that is much higher than everywhere for end market we haven't been strong. So all those, Simona, translate into revenue growth and profit growth. So am I pumped? Yes. But I be more excited than ever to turn it over to Chuck and watch what's going to happen? I feel real good about our future a lot of growth in revenues, a lot of greater profits."

So John, I think the metrics that we study, and we actually get together once a week, 1 year into the announcement all InterCloud, we have 3 key areas that we focus on. The first is the impact we're having in accelerating Cisco's success in private club. You just mentioned the 21% growth at UCS. You mentioned the increase IN the number of customers from 300 to 580 with APIC. We've seen success with converse infrastructure. So maintaining that leadership position in private clouds and now, starting to track our success with the Cisco 1 cloud suite, which will bundle UP our capabilities in UCS, UCS Director, InterCloud Fabric and our Prime Service catalog. So if you look AT all the metrics, we really do think on the a scorecard or private cloud, we're doing extremely well. The second thing we're looking at through InterCloud is driving innovation through open-sourced development and you mentioned in Montréal, we had announced a private cloud version of OpenStack private clouds for developers inside the firewall. I will be tracking very closely how well we do in that environment with OpenStack. And clearly, with 65 partners embracing OpenStack in the public cloud, something you just mentioned, really tracking how will we do in delivering OpenStack in the public cloud. The monetization model is infrastructure, and we should measure how will be doing building infrastructure that will sit in private and public cloud on -- underneath of this OpenStack innovation. And the final thing, and this is just emerging but you seem some recent examples is the richness of the software catalog, Cisco breaks of InterCloud marketplace. We've seen very good momentum recently with hosted collaboration solution delivered by over 60 partners. You mentioned Rowan's [ph] announcement of Spark for Teams, and that's a pure SaaS offer. And something a lot of people might've missed was the Cisco Collaboration Knowledge SaaS offer. So in the area of Collaboration, we see a very rich set of offers, looking at that marketplace, combination of Cisco and our partners offers. Any measure those going forward. So those 3 areas, I'd say, lots of work left to do, but the scorecards looking pretty good."

Secondly, as spend engineering organization sideways and began to really focus on speed of small agile teams, and I could walk through a number of examples from mobility to security, but let's just talk about now how we're developing our high-end products. We used to think about developing a high-end product with maybe 3,000 people at least 3 to 5 years to do it. Watch how we develop our next-generation router product for these major players, and we'll do it in less than 12 months with probably 225 people. And so you're talking and if there's would say, ""Cisco, you're finally getting it. You're getting your speed of change. With that, you understand how to make the transition."" So I look at this as a very good opportunity for us to play in those with an increasing share of their spend. And different than our peers, we would do it with software independent where appropriate or combination of software, hardware and ASICs. And I really like our momentum, which is starting to get in these accounts and ranges from the Microso to of the world to the Googles of the world, to the Facebook, to the Amazons. Chuck? Any thoughts on that one?"

And we're working at portfolio now. We're working closely with many of them differently. I think you'll see us evolve that as necessary over the next couple of quarters. I think when you think about the SP space, I think the biggest thing we've done over last year, 1.5 years is that we've really achieved architecture alignment with our SP customers, understanding where they want to go and aligning our portfolio. And I think that our speed with which we've moved into the virtual managed services space and some of the wins we announced the John referenced in Mobile World Congress and some of the wins with Verizon and others, are indicative of our alignment with where they want to ago.

We believe that is going to be set up for an architectural play, and it's going to require integration with intelligence throughout the cloud, through the data centers, the LAN down to the access, combining mobile with Internet of Everything and digitization, et cetera. We're on a journey here. We love the momentum, 14% growth, with orders growing faster with us, 20% growth. And I expect us to do a lot better than that over time. The pull-through on it is very interesting because now, and this goes back to -- when we sell a product or just a architecture. When you go in and you talk about digitizing. Obviously, we talk about how although our product architectures come together. And then when we talk about security together with IOE, digitizing your company, mobile, et cetera, you suddenly see how security ties across all those. So we're starting to get upgrades, and we're learning how to sell this better. And probably again, Brian and Sandy's group have done the best job. We get hold intent of $50 million [ph] upgrades of the whole network because of the security implications, how it ties together. It also gives us the seat of the border where one on, we can say, ""You either disrupt or you die."" And on the other hand, are major Pierre of the CEO or board is but how do you have a problem. How do I minimize it? How do I know I've done everything possible? Don't save me a couple of hundred thousand dollars on a White Label box the cost [indiscernible] problem. So our win rate goes way up, and our relevance goes way up. And you will continue to see of move in terms of additional processor go to the future.

Candidly, between players that perhaps aren't as strategic well positioned. And when we see that happen, that usually creates opportunity for Cisco. And that's when these take advantage of those situations. The others that you see out there are more driven based on real strategic alignment and strategic acceleration. And those are typically done, I believe, companies, who are strategically that are positioned to the marketplace relative to what's going on, which is where I would argue we are right now. So when I think about it, you'll see us take advantage of the latter. We'll leverage our go-to-market, our scale, our channel to accelerate time-to-market. And what I would -- the example I would give you is Meraki. We paid $1.2 billion for Meraki when it had $100 million in bookings. And now we're on a $600 million bookings run rate by bringing that inside and leveraging what we're able to do pick and that's what you'll see from us in the future, which is really, I think, M&A that fits within our innovation strategy, with a great deal of accountability."

We want to grow our revenue in the short-term and long-term. Our profit of the short-term and long-term, faster revenue. But we clearly are moving rapidly to that transition. Probably the best example to give you on what's been successful would be the example in terms of what we're doing in the security space, in terms of Meraki, where you begin to probably split $2 for $1, $2 for current, $1 for later. And as Chuck said, you start with $100 million pace and you go all the way to the $600 million pace fairly quickly. The second would be collaboration. The numbers will great on Collaboration at 7% growth. And Telepresence units were 66% year-over-year growth.

But what I loved about this quarter with Collaboration is their deferred revenue went up 20% to $1.1 billion on the quarter. So you're beginning to build recurring revenue and deferred revenue pipeline that feels very good. In terms of our capital allocation, you're going to see us remain committed to delivering on our capital allocation, as Kelly has outlined. And we'll continue to be aggressive with the minimum of the free cash flow going to our shareholders. And you'll see us -- we wouldn't -- as far as the dividend, we didn't anticipate revenue rates in it. And we're going to see if active the share repurchases well in terms of the capital allocation.

So all this garbage about you players coming in and software coming in and White Label killing our approach was entirely wrong. The feeder system looks very good. If you watch at the campus level, you have all of the drivers of low-end switching from IOE to digitization to security to mobility, all driving these upgrades in wireless. Then at the high-end, we're in the middle of a transition, which we executed remarkably well, and we took the bank. We announced the product early, we know there'll be a transition from the 9K to the 7K. The 9K growth is off the charts. We are we are bidding our competitors that you or worried about. We moved past them in less than 1 year of shipment. We're growing sequentially 27% for our competitors are modeling to the market, flat sequential growth.

It's education.  It's the citizens' experience. And the businesses, it goes across all industries. And what you do is you pull everything at one way. And so we think the total value of digitizing the company or a country. You suddenly see, where we do these programs, those accounts grow at 10%, 15% faster than what they do during our prior model in terms of the opportunity on it. And in terms of routing and switching, you can see the numbers. I would expect there are segments of the market and FST and emerging come back to life, and then they will. I think, SPA, we will see in a couple of quarters not because of the CapEx spend our positioning. And emerging, eventually, these 3 countries will level back out. You will see the architecture sales for that segment routing grow well. Now the point to tell you is ask. Everything we feel the others, grows to switching and routing. And this is where intelligent and the network and our speed of architecture is outcomes that is not that, and that would drive the Services, Gary. That would drive the margins, Kelly, across the board that we get. You might think about going to defining a little bit more the bottom line is was of our customers that are with us on the digitization don't even thing about us as routing and switching anymore. And fast growing areas of collaboration, but messaging is one of the hottest areas growing period across the board in terms of the approach. Collaboration, if we can get 3% to 5% productivity in a company, I think what we're doing around this particularly and TelePresence, all come together, we can do it. So it in assisting us I think you're going to see our areas outside of switching revenue growing rapidly. The cool thing is, bolsters through switching of routing.

Both of the U.S., if you take out one of the large service providers, you are all of a sudden talking down 17%. You're talking down 6%. And the cable players had the other parts, and we're starting to grow in many of these players globally. And it's just a few of them that have a major impact. To the third part of the question. It takes. When Chuck announced the collaboration -- the commercial operation here, Chuck then put Alice in charge of the global basis. But it takes clearly a year to go through this transformation. And some countries pick it quicker than others. And sometimes, you have to get somebody a nudge after the fact. Ryan's total business transformation you just got and time. So even with what's with an, disruption as they move rapidly to this when you saw the low for couple of quarters before it took up.

It's a nice way of saying it's a multi-year journey. The cool thing is, using U.S. Enterprise as an example, I think undergoing, pop in excess for rating. And you'll see that around the world we feel comfortable in the long-term growth of of, not just looking out a year or 2. But we will get more than our fair share. Now let me put this in proper perspective. If you watch where we are, all of our major IT players, almost about exception, are going down year-over-year. I mean, it's a disaster in the market. We go, if the government point of a numbers we just gave you, we will be at a record earnings per share and a record quarter in terms of revenue.

We do the new mobility capability with data combining Wi-Fi with 3G and 4G in a way with 18 people in 8 months. You make moves in security the same way. You bring spark to life with business messaging with 200 people. We can now rival the best startups in our world and outexecute their because they can build all that for the capability. What gets me very comfortable about our future. Recognize our competitors come and go. I mean, Chuck, I'm thinking about playing Gulf lately but exciting part about where we are is you and I are on the 18th toll, and we already had 5 strokes in team play. And all of our competitors have difficult both of into the woods and they're looking forward to it. You're going to finish off this game. And by the time we are through, there so that ability for the golf balls. I mean, if you really look at the market and you think about innovations breaking the company in half and having to roll the dice in providing 2 companies that are really 5 companies into one and begin to think about having to cut expenses are medically and then doubling down move the software and play only. And we said this year that at the sales meeting, people forget that's just 8  months ago, that if you look at key competitors like HP and Alcatel-Lucent and Arista and VMware and Avaya, is winning several more, we said half of those would exist in a meaningfully us competitors to us into Europe. Nobody. Look where we are already in 8 months. It's a nice way of saying we're going to become the #1 IT company. It's been a tremendous honor to lead this organization. It's one that will do better after me than during my time, and that's the way of saying about your kids. This team has built a tremendous strength. They're going to be even better in the future. So it's really been fun for me. It's also going to be fun being your wingman, Chuck. I'll spend my time where you want to spend it. Enjoy this moment in this much like when around the day mill. You judge, got to run a lot this morning, and I did. And I was determined to step when you course record with our run. I got stopped in the first half now, never seen this before in my life. The biggest business of ever seen is probably 12-point maybe 14-point was right in my past, 10 feet from me. And I looked it right in the eye and said, First, I was annoyed, trying to cut my timing and going to reelect, you want enjoy the moment and how special that was. But I lost my timing. I didn't make it by 10 seconds. But it's a nice way of saying that we're a competitive organization, one that is far from perfect, and I've been far from perfect leader. But one him order to be leading less like a family that I want this even better as I move on to the next phase of my career, which is more one of a coach. So Chuck, enjoy the momentum. You're going to be a fantastic new CEO and you're going to do great things here at Cisco, and this team is unbeatable."

I am pleased to report another very solid quarter for Cisco. We delivered revenues of $12.1 billion, up 5%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.54, up 6%.

We delivered revenues of $12.1 billion, up 5%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.54, up 6%. We maintained strong non-GAAP gross margins at 62.5%, generated $3.0 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Last week was a great week for us, as we announced the CEO who will lead Cisco in its next chapter. I am extremely excited to be joined today by Cisco's newly named CEO, Chuck Robbins. Chuck, welcome very much. I am confident you will come to understand why the Cisco Board of Directors and I are so convinced he is the right leader for Cisco right now. 
As I reflect back, I'm extremely honored and proud to have led Cisco for the last 20-plus years. We set out the change the way the world works, lives, learns and plays, and while many thought this was a very ambitious, if not unobtainable, goal, we absolutely have achieved that goal. 
We have delivered incredible innovation and have disrupted markets and, at times, ourselves. We have seen many competitors come and go. We've had our setbacks but always come back even stronger, something almost no other technology company has done. 
We have remained incredibly focused on delivering for our shareholders. We are a cash and profit machine and have maintained our margins over time by delivering sustainable differentiation through integrated architectures based on intelligent networks. 
What I'm most proud of, however, is how well positioned we are to repeat the success of this last 20 years. 
Across every market and every industry, we are moving from the information age to the digital age, and the pace of change is only accelerating. Cisco is in a very strong leadership position. Our vision and strategy are working, as every company, city and country becomes digital. They're realizing Cisco is best positioned to help them as they become digital organizations. 
What our customers recognize is Cisco's unique track record and ability to anticipate, transition and deliver the innovation to help our customers adapt and accelerate in this new environment. Cisco's sustainable differentiation, over time, as reflected in our strong gross margins, profitability and cash generation, is the result of our ability to deliver integrated architectures and solutions with scale, speed and security no one else can. 
We've moved from selling boxes, cloud, mobility or any other solution to partner with customers on their outcomes, 44,000 jobs in Barcelona, education and health care accessible to virtually every home in Israel, entirely new cloud-based revenue streams for service providers and General Motors smart factory of the future. 
Competitors selling low-cost technology building blocks can't compete with our total cost advantage, operational efficiency, security and speed to results that Cisco provides. And when there is an issue, we have all seen the nightmare of trying to identify where and who to call translate into billions in lost business and reputational damages. 
When companies and countries go digital, IT becomes a board-level concern, and reliability, security, trust matter more than ever. The Cisco brand behind every one of our architectures matters more now than ever. 
We are seeing our move from selling boxes to selling outcomes translate into strong execution in a tough global market. We are seeing many areas of strength, including global enterprise with order growth of 7%, global commercial orders up 6% and global public sector orders up 7%. 
The U.S., excluding Service Provider, was particularly strong, with Brian Marlier's U.S. Enterprise order growth of 21%, U.S. commercial order growth of 11% and U.S. public sector order growth of 10%. We saw good revenue growth across almost all of our technologies. 
The volatility in Service Provider in emerging markets we have discussed in prior quarters continues. Our Service Provider business remains challenged, both globally and in the U.S. Service Provider orders globally decreased 7%, and U.S. Service Provider orders declined 17%. Emerging market orders were flat, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 6%, while the remaining emerging markets grew 6%. I believe we have organized well to capture more than our share in these markets and positioned ourselves for their inevitable upturns. 
Like every other company, we are also managing the impact of currency fluctuations globally. Kelly and I are both very pleased with the focus of the whole company on maintaining stable gross margins in this environment. We were especially pleased with how the sales teams have held gross margins in a very tough foreign exchange environment. Repeating the common theme, those critics that felt new software or business models would have a major negative impact on our business and our margins were just wrong. 
Clearly, there are more positives than headwinds, and I am very pleased with our solid execution. At a time when many of our peers are seeing revenues decline, we delivered profitable growth as we said we would and order delivered -- over-delivered almost on every metric we set. 
Now I will move on to guidance. I continue to be pleased with our execution in a tough environment, the strength of our financial model and the return we continue to drive for our shareholders. For Q4, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. 
Let me now provide some additional details on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments and product and services business within our portfolio.
As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted. 
We finished the quarter with product orders up 2% and product book-to-bill greater than 1. Moving first to the Americas. Americas grew in total 2%. I discussed upfront the U.S. public sector growth of 10%, with the U.S. federal growth up 24% and state and local up 1%. We also discussed the very strong U.S. Enterprise growth of 21% and U.S. Commercial growth of 11%. And the U.S. Service Provider was down 17%. Latin America had another strong double-digit growth quarter. 
Moving on to Europe, Middle East and Africa. We saw Europe, Middle East and Africa growth of 2%. Europe first turned up for us 5 quarters ago and, since then, has averaged mid-single-digit growth, including this quarter. If you take out Russia, we saw solid growth across all of Europe, Middle East and Africa of 4%. 
We were pleased to see Asia Pacific, Japan and China return to growth, growing 1%. And just to give you an idea of what sometimes the emerging markets have an impact on in terms of our business, with Asia Pacific, China -- Japan and China, minus China, growing at 8%. 
And finally, emerging countries. Emerging markets in total were flat. The emerging markets, excluding BRICs plus Mexico, grew 6%. As discussed, we continue to see the BRICs plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total, with Russia down 41%, Brazil down 10% and China down 20%. We did see strong growth in Mexico, up 53%; and India, up 6%. We are modeling the volatility in emerging markets to continue for several more quarters. 
Now moving on to customer segments. We discussed the strong growth of total global enterprise up 7%, with total global commercial up 6% and global public sector up 7%. The new models we have implemented globally in each of these segments are working. 
In Enterprise, the shift to selling outcomes, not products, is resulting in larger opportunities and dramatic increases in pipeline. In U.S. Enterprise, for example, the value of our pipeline of deals over $1 million increased approximately 60% year-over-year, with the average deal size up over 30%. 
We are managing continued challenges in our Service Provider business, which declined 7%, as Global Service Provider CapEx remained under pressure and industry consolidation continues. We believe the organizational changes we have made in our Global Service Provider organization are working, and we are very focused on growing our share of wallet. 
At Mobile World Congress earlier this year, we issued announcements with over 10 Global Service Providers, including the launch of Cloud VP [ph] and service with Deutsche Telekom, connected car service with AT&T and a small cell solution for large enterprise deployments with Vodafone. 
Now moving on to products and service. I will discuss products and service business in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching. We saw another solid quarter in switching, with growth of 6%. The strong momentum of our Application Centric Infrastructure portfolio continues. The Nexus 3K plus 9K grew 144%. We added over 970 new Nexus 9K customers and ACI customers this quarter to reach a total of over 2,650 customers. The APIC controller customers grew from over 300 last quarter to 580 this quarter. 9K orders plus ASIC grew sequentially 27%, and we expect that sequential growth to accelerate in Q4. 
We also saw good momentum in our campus portfolio, especially in fixed. We did see some pressure in our modular switching, as we managed to transition in the high end of our switching portfolio. As we discussed, we expect this transition to continue for a few more quarters. 
I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching even as we're driving our product transition in the data center. 
Moving on to the data center. UCS momentum continues with over $3 billion in revenue run rate, with over 43,800 UCS customers. The number of repeat UCS customers grew 34% year-over-year. The innovation UCS brought to the market and architecture that converges networking, servers and storage has disrupted our market, and Cisco went from nowhere to the market share leader in x86 blades in the U.S. and the #2 player worldwide, with more than 85% of the Fortune 500 companies now investing in UCS. 
We continue to see significant growth with our converged offerings, including VCE and FlexPod, in addition to the positive initial ramp with our IBM VersaStack solution. 
We had a solid quarter in NGN routing, which grew 4%. We saw solid performance in high-end routing again this quarter, up 5%, supported by strong momentum in our new product introductions, including the CRS-X and NCS, which were both up over 200%. This growth is a direct result of the transition we drove in our core routing over the last several years. 
During the quarter, Verizon announced it is moving to a next-generation 100-gig metro network in the U.S. and that it will test and deploy Cisco Networking Convergence Systems, the NCS. No one thought we were even in this game. Our ability to win the deal was entirely driven by our new generation in terms of engineering organization, our ability to deliver integrated architectures, our agility with engineering to realign resources quickly, the speed of our innovation and our unique ability to partner with our customer to shape their future and the future of the industry. 
Moving on to wireless. We saw solid growth of 9%. Meraki continued with just very strong momentum, up 92% year-over-year, and it drove most of our growth this quarter in the wireless category, as they add new customers to their cloud managed wireless platform. We did see some softness in public sector wireless spending, driven primarily by E-Rate funding timing. 
Security growth rebounded to a strong 14%, with orders growing even faster. We saw a number of strong trends and data points that support our strategy to drive to an integrated security architecture across our customers' organizations. Customers are realizing that dozens of security vendors in their business are not solving their challenges. 
As everything in the world becomes digital, they want a player who can set, step up and be their trusted partner across the board. No one is better positioned than Cisco. We are -- we believe we are the only player capable of providing an integrated architecture across intelligent networks and are confident in our strategy to be the #1 security company for our customers. 
A few examples of our momentum include: in this quarter, we signed a record number of security enterprise license agreements. Our FirePOWER series, which integrates our Sourcefire software, are continuing to show very strong momentum, far exceeding our initial forecast; and we saw continued strong traction and growth in our advanced threat solutions, including advanced malware protection everywhere and cyber threat defense. 
Moving on to Collaboration. Our Collaboration momentum continues, with revenue growth of 7%. This quarter was a strong quarter for TelePresence endpoints, with revenue up 19% and unit orders up a record 66%. The team is on a mission to put Collaboration in every office and every room. Our strategy is to deliver a new generation of product experiences at significantly lower prices, and it is working. We also saw strong performance of our cloud-based offerings, with conferencing growth of 11%. More people than ever are using WebEx, with a number of billable users growing over 28% to over 15 million users. 
In the quarter, we launched Spark for teams, which is proven to be a strong play in the very hot business messaging market. SP Video declined 5%. We continue to focus on improving profitability in this business, as we develop next-generation end-to-end video solutions, combining hardware, software and services. 
Services revenue grew 3%, with orders growing faster than revenue. We saw growth in both technical and advanced services. And our portfolio of cloud, security, consulting and analytics grew in double digits again this quarter. 
Our gross margins continued to lead the industry by a significant amount and remained very stable in terms of services gross margin in the 65% range, plus or minus 1 point or 2. 
We continue to believe our strategy to provide higher value to our customers by delivering business outcomes is working. The opportunities that are ahead of us, as we move into the Internet of Everything, are very real. We look at the increased security requirements and the demand for security consultancy services. We also focus on the need to manage and capture insights for data distribution across the enterprise and network. We are moving rapidly to build the capabilities across our portfolio to differentiate Cisco's leadership in the Internet of Everything. 
Now let me provide an update on Cisco's momentum in cloud. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market and increase our InterCloud momentum. This quarter, we launched Phase 2 of our InterCloud strategy, linking different clouds together using interoperable and app-centric software to create hybrid clouds. Rob, thank you so much for your leadership here. The team's doing a great job."

We will also extend the enterprise class security and services in customer private clouds to Microsoft Azure with Cisco cloud services router to 1000V. 
Within our strategy to work across hyper visors and stacks, we continue our investment in OpenStack, with the launch at our Worldwide Partners Conference of Cisco OpenStack Private Cloud solutions aimed at on-premise cloud capabilities for application developers. 
To summarize my comments. Our customer conversations today are not about stand-alone products. They are simply about digitization, growth, new revenue streams for them, innovation and business outcomes. We believe we are a point away from our competition using the same formula that we've always used, integrating our industry-leading products in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes. We've created this opportunity, and it is ours to execute. 
I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments in the quarter and guidance for next quarter. To you, Kelly."

Overall, we had a very solid quarter and executed well.

Overall, we had a very solid quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $12.1 billion, increasing 5%, and we expanded our non-GAAP operating margin to 28.6%, with both non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS growing 6% to $2.8 billion and $0.54, respectively. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.47. 
Product revenue increased 6%, and service revenue increased 3%, with product book-to-bill greater than 1. For Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin came in at 62.5% and 61.8%, respectively. The increase in our non-GAAP product gross margin as compared to Q2 was driven by improved productivity, partially offset by product mix and pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 65.0%. 
Looking at our geographic segment results in terms of total revenue. Our Americas segment was up 8%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC was down 1%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.9%, EMEA was 62.5% while APJC was 61.2%.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $4.1 billion -- or were $4.1 billion, up 3% or 33.9% as a percentage of revenue as compared to 34.6% in Q3 of fiscal year '14.
Our headcount increased by approximately 800 to 70,951, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software. 
The non-GAAP tax provision rate of 22% for the quarter was consistent with our expectations. Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share included a benefit of $164 million or approximately $0.03 per share related to the charge we recorded in Q2 of '14 for a supplier component matter. The adjustment is a reduction of the liability, reflecting lower-than-expected cost to remediate the impacted products with our customers. This amount is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $54.4 billion, including $2.6 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $3.0 billion during the quarter. 
Deferred revenue was $14.2 billion, up 8%. Product deferred revenue grew in the double digits again this quarter at 12%, driven largely by subscription-based offerings, while Services deferred revenue also grew, up 6%, reflecting an increase in multi-year service arrangements. We continue to build a greater mix of recurring revenue as reflected in our deferred revenue. 
Our DSO was 37 days as compared to 35 days in Q3 of '14. 
In Q3, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders that included $1.0 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend, which we increased 11% last quarter. So far, in fiscal year '15, we have returned approximately $6.2 billion or 83% of free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $3.2 billion of share repurchases and $3.0 billion of dividends.
Now let me provide a few comments on our guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And actual results could be above or below guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. 
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 1% to 3% growth on a year-over-year basis. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and pricing. 
As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by 1 point in either direction of our guidance range. 
Or non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the fourth quarter. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q4 '15. The range includes a pretax charge of approximately $100 million as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. 
During Q3, we recognized pretax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $24 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year '15. 
Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details. 
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant.
We believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, and we'll continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats 1 quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments."

I believe Cisco is in a very positive inflection point. 
In our 1997 annual report, when it was not obvious that the Internet would take off, we boldly declared that an Internet revolution would alter the fortune of companies, countries and people, and we saw it come to life. A number of years ago, we started talking about the next phase of the Internet, the Internet of Everything, that will be much bigger than the last. And it will require everything to become digital. At the time, almost no one understood what we saw. Today, it's everyone's idea. 
The conversations we are having today with our customers are so similar in many ways to those that we had 20 years ago. We have always been at the example and saw the transitions early. And when others start noticing them, they are well underway. As we help companies, cities, countries digitize, the outcomes are exciting, job creation, quality of life, efficient use of resources. Our customers feel the pace of change accelerating, and they see the disruption in every industry and market. They know their success depends on fast innovation, digitizing their business, entirely new IT organization structures and business organization structures. Whether they are the disruptor or the incumbent, they are coming to Cisco as their strategic partner in the digital transformation. 
As they build their businesses around mobile, cloud, social, data and analytics, they recognize that integrated architectures, with the intelligent networks at the core, will accelerate or, if they don't take advantage of it, inhibit their ability to move with the speed, scale and security required. In simple terms, they know they will either disrupt or be disrupted. 
I am spending more and more of my time with CEOs, board of directors and government leaders to explain the combination of technological, organizational and process transformation to meet these goals of our customers. And as in the '90s, in order to be a true partner to our customers, we have to lead by example. Cisco is the reference point for how you reinvent yourself, to embrace the opportunities of digitization and the speed of innovation required for the future. 
We are 3 years ahead in making our own transitions. And with the pace of change in our market, 3 years makes a huge difference. What does this mean for Cisco and our shareholders? First, we spent the last 20 years moving everything to IP and taking advantage of convergence. The intelligent network is at the center of every market transition, and no one comes close to Cisco when it comes to the network. As 50 billion more devices come online, we have a strong hand to play, and we are playing it. 
Second, we are driving outcomes for our customers through architectures. This is how we differentiate against White Label and single-product companies, and you can see this in our financial results: our margin stability, operating leverage, market share and growth. 
Third, in a digital world, security becomes even more important. Cisco is the logical choice as we combine a security architecture across the intelligent network. Understanding the directions of market and challenging ourselves to reinvent is how we address this opportunity and drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
There could not be a better time to begin Cisco's next chapter, and there is no one more excited than I am to have Chuck Robbins as the next CEO for Cisco. I want to thank the Cisco employees who are leading our change and driving our innovation, and your patience and energy is making Cisco's future possible. Chuck, I know you will leverage the things that have made us great to date. I also know you'll make changes when needed and drive innovation and new capabilities at a faster pace. 
Cisco's momentum is strong, and we are extremely well positioned for the opportunities created by digitization. Every business and government leader is learning the benefits of becoming digital. Growth, leadership, efficiency, productivity, conservation, safety, quality of life and education, these outcomes that are at the core of what Cisco has enabled for the last 20 years. We wanted to use the Internet to change the way we work, live, learn and play, and that's exactly what we've done in the past and what we will do even more in the future. 
With that, Mel, we'll move to the session that I enjoy most, which is the Q&A. Let me turn it over to you."

And I just wanted to understand if that is something that you expect us to see externally in terms of accelerating revenue growth. Or do you think that because you're also transitioning to more software in a recurring revenue model, that's going to really mask it because we're going to have that business mix? And then in terms of timing, if is something that you think will accelerate the business, are you looking at the next couple of quarters or more the next couple of years? Just wanted to get a sense of the timing of the inflection."
19691,293032209,814488,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 13, 2015",2015-05-13,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Got you. And it's always fun.

But answering them in sequence. First of all, the opport",862,"Got you. And it's always fun. Mel, I'm probably going to break a couple of my golden rules of 20 years with some of my comments today. And Chuck, you can do the same thing after 10 years in the job. But answering them in sequence. First of all, the opportunity is absolutely in revenue growth and profit growth. And as you sell solutions moving to outcomes, and you can do that much faster because of your architectures and the intelligent network, you get margin stability and premiums to go with it. Let me use maybe just a couple quick examples of how I'd illustrate that. In the U.S. Enterprise, if we would have told you that the top U.S. Enterprise accounts under Brian's team were to be able to grow at 21% year-over-year, you'd say, ""I doubt that."" But it took us a while, and we're a couple of months in the transition. But when you now grow at that rate and have the number of large opportunities increase at the pace that we saw, you can see an inflection point which will absolutely translate not just to growth in U.S. Enterprise but globally. And let me give you an idea how that pipeline is expanding. We now sell business transformations, what Brian and Sandy do there together. In the present time, we have 1,200 projects going on business transformation and outcomes. That is a pipeline of $3.7 billion in opportunity over the next 18 months. Now we won't get all of that, but it gives you an idea of how rapidly that project has changed. They sell to the business community with support of the CIO as opposed to respond to RFPs. In the last quarter alone, you had 540 new projects in the quarter put into this pipeline, and they had a potential of $915 million. What Chuck has done so well, whether it's in the Enterprise business, and you take it globally, Chuck, and taking that model and rebuilding our business and strategy, vision and strategy make it together, is exactly one of the reasons he got this job. The commercial marketplace in the U.S. has grown for 6 quarters in a row at approximately 10% to 11%. No one else in the world is doing those numbers. Again, Simona, it is purely business-based outcomes and selling architectures. And what Chuck has done there is he's taken what Alison Gleeson did and taken it on a global basis. And so you see the same opportunity from that perspective. In terms of our 2 headwinds, the emerging markets is hard to call. And I think it's often easy to take out a couple pieces and say, ""This is what our growth would have been otherwise."" But think about it. Our problem [ph] in emerging markets is now down to 3 major countries: It's China, Asia Pacific, without China, instead of growing at 1% would have grown at 8%. Chuck, you and I are going over there every quarter, which is mainly you going and me occasionally following. But we'll eventually get that one turned around assuming our governments get along. Russia and Europe, 41%, and it took down the numbers there at fair amount. But Service Provider, which was our biggest hit this quarter versus last quarter, instead of being down 1% was down 7%. And Mel, we said last quarter, it's going to take us time to get this fixed. We didn't expect a positive upturn. Here I'm going to break one of my rules. I feel very comfortable, as you'll see in the next several quarters -- Kelly is cringing, but that's all right. Kelly, you'll get used to it. Chuck, this is one of my bad habits I want you to keep. But if you look at Service Provider, we'll turn that back positive. The organization changes that Chuck made in the field, that Pankaj turned into engineering the organization sideways to focus on outcomes, knocking down literally silos over 60 business units that now are integrated toward outcomes together, that will turn back positive. And we aren't modeling it because CapEx is going to increase. We do not think it will in the second half of the year. We think, actually, our share of wallet is going to change. Now let me put these pieces together. When you win a Verizon deal, people didn't get what that was. That was optical in an area that we've traditionally not been strong in. Because we organize our sales engine different, our service engines different and our R&D engine different, we understood what the customer wanted, we understood on the fly how we'd realign resources, we understood how you're going to have a win rate that is much higher than every before in markets that we haven't traditionally been as strong. So all those, Simona, translate into revenue growth and profit growth. So am I pumped? Oh yes. And could I be more excited than ever to turn it over to Chuck and watch what's going to happen? I feel real good about our future, a lot of growth in revenues and a lot of growth in profits."

And the pieces that were missing was how do you go into this new environment, where each of these ""public clouds and clouds"" are separate and you have -- they'd be on different vendors or different companies the ability to go into it. And so what we're looking at, at first, is an architecture, and it cements our relationships in service providers. And then, it really comes through to how do you monetize it over time. And this would take time to monetize. But the effect we see indirectly is already huge, when you talk about a Deutsche Telecom or a Telstra and our relationships with those. So Rob, a little bit in terms of how you made your success, but prior to we get into the monetization stage."

So John, I think the metrics that we study, and we actually get together once a week. 1 year into the announcement of InterCloud, we have 3 key areas that we focus on. The first is the impact we're having in accelerating Cisco's success in private cloud. You just mentioned the 21% growth of UCS. You mentioned the increase in the number of customers from 300 to 580 with APIC. We've seen success with converged infrastructure. So maintaining that leadership position in private clouds and now starting to track our success with the Cisco ONE cloud suite, which will bundle up our capabilities in UCS, UCS Director, InterCloud Fabric and our Prime service catalog. So if you looked at all the metrics, we really do think on the scorecard of private cloud, we're doing extremely well. The second thing we're looking at through InterCloud is driving innovation through open-source development. And you mentioned in Montréal that we had announced the private cloud version of OpenStack, OpenStack private cloud for developers inside the firewall. I will be tracking very closely how well we do in that environment with OpenStack. And clearly, with 65 partners embracing OpenStack in the public cloud, something that we just mentioned, we're really tracking how well we do in delivering OpenStack in the public cloud. The monetization model is infrastructure, and we should measure how well we do in building the infrastructure that will sit in private and public cloud on -- underneath of this OpenStack innovation. And the final thing, and this is just emerging but you've seen some recent examples is the richness of the software catalog that Cisco breaks to the InterCloud marketplace. We've seen very good momentum recently with Hosted Collaboration Solution delivered by over 60 partners. You mentioned Rowan's announcement of Spark for teams, and that's a pure SaaS offer. And something a lot of people might have missed was the Cisco Collaboration Knowledge SaaS offer. So in the area of Collaboration, you see a very rich set of offers. We're looking at that marketplace, which will be a combination of Cisco and our partners' offers, and we measure those going forward. So those 3 areas, I'd say, lots of work left to do, but the scorecard is looking pretty good."

Our role in that is evolving and candidly, we're starting to move much faster. If you watch our ability to bring new products to market, you're going to see us have all 10 of the major players as key customers shortly. And up to recently, as you know, we were missing largely in one of those. Secondly, as Pankaj has turned this engineering organization sideways and began to really focus on speed of small agile teams. And I could walk through a number of examples from mobility to security, but let's just talk about now how we develop our high-end products. We used to think about developing a high-end product with maybe 3,000 people at least 3 to 5 years to do it. Watch how we develop our next-generation router products for these major players, and we'll do it in less than 12 months with probably 225 people. And so you're talking and what these players would say is, ""Cisco, you're finally getting it. You're getting your speed of change with that. You understand how to make the transition."" So I look at this as a very good opportunity for us to play in those with an increasing share of their spend. And different than our peers, we would do it with software, independent where appropriate, or a combination of software, hardware and ASICs. And I really like our momentum we're starting to get in these accounts. And it ranges from the Microsoft sort of world to the Google sort of world, to the Facebooks, to the Amazons. Chuck? Any thoughts on that one?"

And I think that will allow us to deal with, Brian, the shift that you highlighted from CapEx spend to some of the Web 2.0 players, and we're working that portfolio now. We're working closely with many of them, and I think you'll see us evolve that as necessary over the next couple of quarters. I think when you think about the SP space, I think the biggest thing we've done over last year, 1.5 years, is that we've really achieved architectural alignment with our SP customers, understanding where they want to go and aligning our portfolio. And I think that our speed with which we've moved into the virtual managed services space and some of the wins that we announced that John referenced in Mobile World Congress and some of the wins with Verizon and others are indicative of our alignment with where they want to go.

We're the largest volume player at only 7.5% of the market. And you know our view. We don't enter markets where we don't have a good chance of getting to 40% market share with sustainable differentiation. We believe it's going to be set up for an architectural play, and it's going to require integration with intelligence throughout the cloud, throughout the data centers, the WAN down to the access, combining mobile with the Internet of Everything and digitization, et cetera. We are on a journey here. We love the momentum, 14% growth, with orders growing faster, that was 20% growth. And I expect us to do a lot better than that over time. The pull-through on it is very interesting because, now, and this goes back to -- when we sell, we don't sell a product or just a architecture. When you go in and you talk about digitizing your company, we talk about how all of our product architectures come together. And then, when we talk about security together with IOE, digitizing your company, mobile and et cetera, you suddenly see how security ties across all of those. So we're starting to get upgrades, and we're learning how to sell this better. And probably again, Brian and Sandy's group have done the best job. We get whole -- $10 million to $50 million upgrades of the whole network because of the security implications, how it ties together. It also gives us a seat at the board room where, on the one hand, we can say, ""You either disrupt or you die."" And on the other hand, your major fear of a CEO or a board is what happens if we have a problem, how do I minimize it, how do I know I've done everything possible. And don't save me a couple of hundred thousand dollars on a White Label box that causes me a problem. So our win rate goes way up, and our relevance goes way up. And you will continue to see us move in terms of additional moves as we go in the future. Chuck, I'm going to ask you maybe just to comment about his indirect question, which is acquisitions. Don't tie it down to a specific industry, but your overall view of innovation, how we defined it before and your thoughts about are we going to continue with the model if that includes acquisitions in that model."

So as I think about M&A activity going forward, I think if you look back at our strategy for innovation, it has always combined a combination of internal R&D, partnerships and acquisitions. If you just look at the landscape today that we see in the consolidation of many of our peers and competitors -- and John, you've been talking about brutal consolidation for a few quarters now, many of what we -- many of those that we see out there now are really around cost synergies candidly that are between players that perhaps aren't as strategically well positioned. And when we see that happen, that usually creates opportunity for Cisco. And that's when we usually take advantage of those situations. The others that you see out there are more driven based on real strategic alignment and strategic acceleration. And those are typically done, I believe, by companies who are strategically better positioned in the marketplace relative to what's going on, which is where I would argue we are right now. So when I think about it, you'll see us take advantage of the latter. We'll leverage our go-to-market, our scale, our channel to accelerate time-to-market. And what I would -- the example I would give you is Meraki. We paid $1.2 billion for Meraki when it had $100 million in bookings. And now we're on a $600 million bookings run rate by bringing that inside and leveraging what we're able to do. And that's what you'll see from us in the future which is really, I think, M&A that fits within our innovation strategy, with a great deal of accountability."

I really want to focus secondly on clarity and simplification of our messages, and that's internal and external. We'll take what Gary has done and built with a lot of the operational capabilities and the processes that he's built, and we'll double down on that and continue to work, and that includes across revenue opportunities, expense areas as well as gross margins. And then, finally, we'll double down on our culture because I think one of the things that has just made Cisco fantastic are our people, so that's a big focus area for me as well."

You are going to see us move more and more into recurring revenue and deferred revenue. The art is to do both at the same time. Chuck and I both [indiscernible]. We want to grow our revenue in the short-term and long-term, our profits in the short-term and long-term faster than revenue. So we clearly are moving rapidly to that transition. Probably the best example to give you on what's been successful would be the example in terms of what we're doing in the security space, in terms of Meraki, where you begin to probably split it $2 for $1, $2 is for current, $1 is for later. And as Chuck said, you start with a $100 million base and you go all the way to the $600 million base fairly quickly. The second would be collaboration. The numbers were great on Collaboration at 7% growth and TelePresence units at 66% year-over-year growth. But -- and the new products being developed in -- and I think it was 12 months with -- to prototype and 18 months to market with only 200 people. But what I loved about this quarter with Collaboration is their deferred revenue went up 20% to $1.1 billion on the quarter. So you're beginning to build recurring revenue and deferred revenue pipeline that feels very good. In terms of our capital allocation, you're going to see us remain committed to delivering on our capital allocation, as Kelly has outlined. And we'll continue to be aggressive with the minimum of our free cash flow going to our shareholders. And you'll see us -- we wouldn't have started the dividend if we didn't anticipate regularly raising it. And you're going to see us be active in the share repurchase as well in terms of the capital allocation. So no major change there, Mark."

I know, in the year-over-year, it looks good, but that's because last year was so bad. So I'm trying to kind of do look at the sequentials to see how -- what the growth is looking like. And the question is, why don't we see higher numbers with switching? What prevents the numbers from going up? And maybe you can relate here to units versus prices. I'm trying to see if it's a pricing issue rather than a units issue."

And if you -- if I would've told anybody in this call 2 years ago that I'd be getting questions about switching revenues only growing 6% in the quarter, you'd have said, ""You've got to be kidding me,"" because everybody is modeling 0 and they're modeling margins to go down. Kelly, our margins on the switching actually were at the higher end of our range. They've been remarkably consistent for the last 8 quarters. So all this garbage about new players coming in and software coming in and White Label killing our approach was entirely wrong. And the feeder system looks really good. If you watch at the campus level, you have all of the drivers of low-end switching, from IOE to digitization to security to mobility, all driving these upgrades in wireless. And then, at the high-end, we're in the middle of a transition, which we executed remarkably well. And we took the bang. We announced the products early. We knew there'll be a transition from the 9K to the 7K. The 9K growth is off the charts. We are on a -- my word selection, we are bidding our competitors that you all were worried about. We moved past them in less than 1 year of shipment. We're growing sequentially 27% when our competitors are modeling to the market a flat sequential growth. That is market share gains at tremendous speed. Now it's going to take us a couple more quarters to work through the 7K decline and get it balanced out. And you'll see us move a lot of the capabilities of the 9K to the 7K over the next couple of quarters. And I know, Chuck, you've got that one with Pankaj and the balance. So the bottom line on switching, we're taking share. We feel really good. We're going to kick the other competitors, and it's a very good growth market. And I will never apologize for growth in mid-single digits on switching."

My question and the question I get from investors a lot is how is Cisco doing relative to expanding the footprint beyond kind of the core switching and routing business? It's still 45% of your revenue today. So as you look at that pipeline, around digital transformation, what's the attach rate on servers, software, services? Can you give us some sort of color that -- some sort of leading indicator that -- to let us understand how well you're doing relative to expanding the overall footprint as you help enterprises transform their businesses?"

But almost all of these sales are no longer about switching and routing. They are purely outcome-based, and it is GDP growth. It's inclusion of minorities. It's job creation. It's health care. It's education.  It's the citizens' experience in the businesses. It goes across to all industries. And what you do is you pull through everything at one time. And so we think about the total value of digitizing the company or a country. You suddenly see, where we do these programs, those accounts grow at 10%, 15% faster than what they do during our prior model in terms of the opportunity on it. And in terms of routing and switching, you can see the numbers. I would expect the other segments of the market, SP and emerging, come back to life, and they will. I think SP, we will see in a couple of quarters not because of CapEx spend but our positioning. And emerging, eventually, these 3 countries will level back out. You will see the architecture sales for that segment, outside switching and routing, grow well. Now the point that Tal just asked, every time we sell these others, it pulls through switching and routing. And this is where intelligence in the network and our speed of architectures get outcomes that those do not. And that would drive the services, Gary. That would drive the margins, Kelly, across the board that we get. We might think about a way of defining it a little bit more, but the bottom line is most of our customers that are with us on the digitization don't even think about us as routing and switching anymore. And the fast growing areas of collaboration business messaging is one of the hottest areas growing, period, across the board in terms of the approach. Collaboration, if we can get 3% to 5% productivity in a company, and I think what we're doing around the Spark capability and the TelePresence, when this all come together, we can do it. So it's a nice way of saying I think you're going to see our areas outside of switching and routing grow rapidly. The cool thing is it pulls through switching and routing, and the best of all, architectures beats White Label and pre-software."

And then second, regarding the transformation point, which is very evident in your U.S. results, which are quite impressive, what is it in that pitch that doesn't resonate or takes a long time to resonate everywhere else?

So I don't want to mislead anybody with the 5% revenue number. But the exciting part is we're picking up our momentum in the cloud segment of this and the software end of the cloud, which is clearly where we want the revenue to go. The architectural play wins here. Set-top boxes are tactical, but cloud winning on video [indiscernible] is doing there is strategic to us. Go to the U.S., if you take out one of the large service providers, you are all of a sudden, instead of talking down 17%, you're talking down 6%. And the cable players had the other parts. And we're starting to grow in many of these players globally. And it's just a few of them that have a major impact. To the third part of the question, it takes a wealth -- when Chuck announced and did the collaboration -- I'm sorry, the commercial operation here, Chuck then put Alice in charge of this on a global basis. But it takes nearly a year to go through this transformation. And some countries pick it up quicker than others. And sometimes, you have to give somebody's countries a nudge after the fact. Brian's total business transformation that he and Sandy are leading, that takes longer to roll out and more time. So even if you've watched with them there was a disruption as they move rapidly to this, where you saw the business is actually slow for a couple of quarters before it took up. And then, there's the whole coordination with engineering and one of the key reasons that Chuck got this job among others is his ability to coordinate these resources together into vision and strategy to determine the outcomes in terms of the direction. It's a nice way of saying it's a multi-year journey. The cool thing is, using U.S. Enterprise as an example, once they got it going, the pipeline is accelerating, and you'll see that around the world. And that's why we feel comfortable with the long-term growth, Simona, not just looking out a year or 2. But we will get more than our fair share. Now let me put this in proper perspective. If you watch where we are, all of our major IT players, almost without exception, are going down year-over-year. I mean it's a disaster in the market. We will -- if we hit our midpoint of the numbers we just gave you, we will be at a record earnings per share and a record quarter in terms of revenue. So we're taking share spend and position in the market extremely well as we go forward. So I feel very good about where we're positioned, Mel. And you're nicely saying that's going to be my last question? 
All right.  Let me move to close a little bit. 
It's been an honor. First, I want to thank all of you around this table. This leadership team is amazing in our virtual table, the operating committee and leaders, it really has been an honor. It has been fun. It's been challenging. And I'm just very humbled by having this chance for 20 years. Chuck, you're going to love this job. When I look about the -- where we are today, what excites me the most is what we've done on the culture and how we've built an engine of innovation. And if you watch the innovation we're talking about in many of these areas, what used to take thousands of people, Pankaj does with 20. We do the new mobility capability with data combining Wi-Fi with 3G and 4G in a way with 18 people in 8 months. You make moves in security the same way. You bring Spark to life with business messaging with 200 people. We can now rival the best startups there are in the world and out-execute them because they can build off of that capability. What gets me very comfortable about our future, I said nicely our competitors come and go. I mean, Chuck, I'm thinking about playing golf lately, but the exciting part about where we are is that you and I are on the 18th hole, and we're already ahead by 5 strokes in team play, and all of our competitors had hit their golf balls off into the woods and they're looking for it. And we're going to finish off this game. And by the time we are through, they're still going to be looking for their golf balls. I mean, if you really look at the market and you think innovation is breaking the company in half and having to roll the dice of combining 2 companies that are really 5 companies into one, and you begin to think about having to cut expenses dramatically and then double down that you can move to a software play only. And when we said this year that -- at the sales meeting -- and people forget that's just 8  months ago, that if you look at key competitors like HP and Alcatel-Lucent and Arista and VMware and Avaya, and we named several more, we said half of those won't exist in a meaningful way as competitors to us in a year. And everybody kind of said, ""Yes, right."" Look where we are already in 8 months. It's a nice way of saying we're going to become the #1 IT company. It's been a tremendous honor to lead this organization. It's one that will do better after me than during my time, and that's the way of saying like your kids. This team has built a tremendous strength. They're going to do even better in the future. So it's really been fun for me. It's also going to be fun being your wingman, Chuck. But it's -- I'll have to spend my time where you want me to spend it. And enjoy this moment and it's much like when I ran the day, Mel. You judge, you said go out and run a lot this morning. And I did, and I was determined to set my new course record when I ran. I got stopped in the first half, Mel. I've never seen this before in my life, but the biggest buck I've ever seen is probably up 12 point, maybe 14 point, was right in my path, 10 feet from me. And I looked it right in the eye. And at first, I was annoyed because I was trying to just set my timing. And then I realized you want to enjoy the moment and how special that was. But I lost -- I missed my timing there. I didn't make it by 10 seconds. But it's a nice way of saying that we're a competitive organization, one that is far from perfect, and I've been a far from perfect leader, but one that I'm very honored to have led. And it's really nice, like a family, that I want this to do even better as I move on to the next stage of my career, which is more one of a coach. So Chuck, enjoy the moment. You're going to be a fantastic new CEO, and you're going to do great things here at Cisco. And this team is literally unbeatable."

We delivered revenues of $12.1 billion, up 5%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.54, up 6%. We maintained strong non-GAAP gross margins at 62.5%, generated $3.0 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Last week was a great week for us, as we announced the CEO who will lead Cisco in its next chapter. I am extremely excited to be joined today by Cisco's newly named CEO, Chuck Robbins. Chuck, welcome very much. I am confident you will come to understand why the Cisco Board of Directors and I are so convinced he is the right leader for Cisco right now. 
As I reflect back, I'm extremely honored and proud to have led Cisco for the last 20-plus years. We set out to change the way the world works, lives, learns and plays, and while many thought this was a very ambitious, if not unobtainable, goal, we absolutely have achieved that goal. 
We have delivered incredible innovation and have disrupted markets and, at times, ourselves. We have seen many competitors come and go. We've had our setbacks but always come back even stronger, something almost no other technology company has done. 
We have remained incredibly focused on delivering for our shareholders. We are a cash and profit machine and have maintained our margins over time by delivering sustainable differentiation through integrated architectures based on intelligent networks. 
What I'm most proud of, however, is how well positioned we are to repeat the success of this last 20 years. Across every market and every industry, we are moving from the information age to the digital age, and the pace of change is only accelerating. Cisco is in a very strong leadership position. Our vision and strategy are working, as every company, city and country becomes digital. They're realizing Cisco is best positioned to help them as they become digital organizations. 
What our customers recognize is Cisco's unique track record and ability to anticipate transitions and deliver the innovation to help our customers adapt and accelerate in this new environment. Cisco's sustainable differentiation, over time, as reflected in our strong gross margins, profitability and cash generation, is the result of our ability to deliver integrated architectures and solutions with scale, speed and security no one else can. 
We've moved from selling boxes, cloud, mobility or any other solutions to partner with customers on their outcomes: 44,000 jobs in Barcelona, education and health care accessible to virtually every home in Israel, entirely new cloud-based revenue streams for service providers and General Motors' smart factory of the future. 
Competitors selling low-cost technology building blocks can't compete with our total cost advantage, operational efficiency, security and speed to results that Cisco provides. And when there is an issue, we have all seen the nightmare of trying to identify where and who to call translate into billions in lost business and reputational damages. 
When companies and countries go digital, IT becomes a board-level concern, and reliability, security, trust matter more than ever. The Cisco brand behind every one of our architectures matters more now than ever. 
We are seeing our moves from selling boxes to selling outcomes translate into strong execution in a tough global market. We are seeing many areas of strength, including global enterprise, with order growth of 7%, global commercial orders up 6% and global public sector, orders up 7%. 
The U.S., excluding Service Provider, was particularly strong, with Brian Marlier's U.S. Enterprise order growth of 21%, U.S. Commercial order growth of 11% and U.S. Public Sector order growth of 10%. We saw good revenue growth across almost all of our technologies. 
The volatility in Service Provider in emerging markets we have discussed in prior quarters continues. Our Service Provider business remains challenged, both globally and in the U.S. Service Provider orders globally decreased 7%, and U.S. Service Provider orders declined 17%. Emerging market orders were flat, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 6%, while the remaining emerging markets grew 6%. I believe we have organized well to capture more than our share in these markets and positioned ourselves for their inevitable upturns. 
Like every other company, we are also managing the impact of currency fluctuations globally. Kelly and I are both very pleased with the focus of the whole company on maintaining stable gross margins in this environment. We were especially pleased with how the sales teams have held gross margins in a very tough foreign exchange environment. Repeating the common theme, those critics that felt new software or business models would have a major negative impact on our business and our margins were just wrong. 
Clearly, there are more positives than headwinds, and I am very pleased with our solid execution. At a time when many of our peers are seeing revenues decline, we delivered profitable growth as we said we would and order delivered -- over-delivered almost on every metric we set. 
Now I will move on to guidance. I continue to be pleased with our execution in a tough environment, the strength of our financial model and the return we continue to drive for our shareholders. For Q4, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. 
Let me now provide some additional details on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments and product and services business within our portfolio. As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted. 
We finished the quarter with product orders up 2% and product book-to-bill greater than 1. Moving first to the Americas. Americas grew in total 2%. I discussed upfront the U.S. Public Sector growth of 10%, with the U.S. federal growth up 24% and state and local up 1%. We also discussed the very strong U.S. Enterprise growth of 21% and U.S. Commercial growth of 11%. And the U.S. Service Provider was down 17%. Latin America had another strong double-digit growth quarter. 
Moving on to Europe, Middle East and Africa. We saw Europe, Middle East and Africa growth of 2%. Europe first turned up for us 5 quarters ago and, since then, has averaged mid-single digit growth, including this quarter. If you take out Russia, we saw solid growth across all of Europe, Middle East and Africa of 4%. 
We were pleased to see Asia Pacific, Japan and China return to growth, growing 1%. And just to give you an idea of what sometimes the emerging markets have an impact on in terms of our business, with Asia Pacific, China -- Japan and China, minus China, growing at 8%. 
And finally, emerging countries. Emerging markets in total were flat. The emerging markets, excluding BRICs plus Mexico, grew 6%. As discussed, we continue to see the BRICs plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total, with Russia down 41%, Brazil down 10% and China down 20%. We did see strong growth in Mexico, up 53%; and India, up 6%. We are modeling the volatility in emerging markets to continue for several more quarters. 
Now moving on to customer segments. We discussed the strong growth of total Global Enterprise up 7%, with total Global Commercial up 6% and Global Public Sector up 7%. The new models we have implemented globally in each of these segments are working. 
In Enterprise, the shift to selling outcomes, not products, is resulting in larger opportunities and dramatic increases in pipeline. In U.S. Enterprise, for example, the value of our pipeline of deals over $1 million increased approximately 60% year-over-year, with the average deal size up over 30%. 
We are managing continued challenges in our Service Provider business, which declined 7%, as Global Service Provider CapEx remained under pressure and industry consolidation continues. We believe the organizational changes we have made in our Global Service Provider organization are working, and we are very focused on growing our share of wallet. 
At Mobile World Congress earlier this year, we issued announcements with over 10 global service providers, including the launch of Cloud VPN service with Deutsche Telekom, connected car service with AT&T and a small cell solution for large enterprise deployments with Vodafone. 
Now moving on to products and service. I will discuss products and service business in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching. We saw another solid quarter in switching, with growth of 6%. The strong momentum of our Application Centric Infrastructure portfolio continues. The Nexus 3K plus 9K grew 144%. We added over 970 new Nexus 9K customers and ACI customers this quarter to reach a total of over 2,650 customers. The APIC controller customers grew from over 300 last quarter to 580 this quarter. 9K orders plus ASIC grew sequentially 27%, and we expect that sequential growth to accelerate in Q4. 
We also saw good momentum in our campus portfolio, especially in fixed. We did see some pressure in our modular switching, as we managed in the transition in the high end of our switching portfolio. As we discussed, we expect this transition to continue for a few more quarters. 
I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching even as we're driving our product transition in the data center. 
Moving on to the data center. UCS momentum continues with over $3 billion in revenue run rate, with over 43,800 UCS customers. The number of repeat UCS customers grew 34% year-over-year. The innovation UCS brought to the market and architecture that converges networking, servers and storage has disrupted our market, and Cisco went from nowhere to the market share leader in x86 blades in the U.S. and the #2 player worldwide, with more than 85% of the Fortune 500 companies now investing in UCS. 
We continue to see significant growth with our converged offerings, including VCE and FlexPod, in addition to the positive initial ramp with our IBM VersaStack solution. 
We had a solid quarter in NGN routing, which grew 4%. We saw solid performance in high-end routing again this quarter, up 5%, supported by strong momentum in our new product introductions, including the CRS-X and NCS, which were both up over 200%. This growth is a direct result of a transition we drove in our core routing over the last several years. 
During the quarter, Verizon announced it is moving to a next-generation 100-gig metro network in the U.S. and that it will test and deploy Cisco Networking Convergence Systems, the NCS. No one thought we were even in this game. Our ability to win the deal was entirely driven by our new generation in terms of engineering organization, our ability to deliver integrated architectures, our agility with engineering to realign resources quickly, the speed of our innovation and our unique ability to partner with our customer to shape their future and the future of the industry. 
Moving on to wireless. We saw solid growth of 9%. Meraki continued with just very strong momentum, up 92% year-over-year, and it drove most of our growth this quarter in the wireless category, as they add new customers to their cloud managed wireless platform. We did see some softness in public sector wireless spending, driven primarily by E-Rate funding timing. 
Security growth rebounded to a strong 14%, with orders growing even faster. We saw a number of strong trends and data points that support our strategy to drive to an integrated security architecture across our customers' organizations. Customers are realizing that dozens of security vendors in their business are not solving their challenges. 
As everything in the world becomes digital, they want a player who can set, step up and be their trusted partner across the board. No one is better positioned than Cisco. We are -- we believe we are the only player capable of providing an integrated architecture across intelligent networks and are confident in our strategy to be the #1 security company for our customers. 
A few examples of our momentum include: in this quarter, we signed a record number of security enterprise license agreements. Our FirePOWER series, which integrates our Sourcefire software, are continuing to show very strong momentum, far exceeding our initial forecast; and we saw continued strong traction and growth in our advanced threat solutions, including Advanced Malware Protection everywhere and Cyber Threat Defense. 
Moving on to Collaboration. Our Collaboration momentum continues, with revenue growth of 7%. This quarter was a strong quarter for TelePresence endpoints, with revenue up 19% and unit orders up a record 66%. The team is on a mission to put Collaboration in every office and every room. Our strategy is to deliver a new generation of product experiences at significantly lower prices, and it is working. We also saw strong performance of our cloud-based offerings, with conferencing growth of 11%. More people than ever are using WebEx, with a number of billable users growing over 28% to over 15 million users. 
In the quarter, we launched Spark for teams, which is proving to be a strong play in the very hot business messaging market. SP Video declined 5%. We continue to focus on improving profitability in this business, as we develop next-generation end-to-end video solutions, combining hardware, software and services. 
Services revenue grew 3%, with orders growing faster than revenue. We saw growth in both technical and advanced services. And our portfolio of cloud, security, consulting and analytics grew in double digits again this quarter. 
Our gross margins continued to lead the industry by a significant amount and remained very stable in terms of services gross margin in the 65% range, plus or minus 1 point or 2. 
We continue to believe our strategy to provide higher value to our customers by delivering business outcomes is working. The opportunities that are ahead of us, as we move into the Internet of Everything, are very real. We look at the increased security requirements and the demand for security consultancy services. We also focus on the need to manage and capture insights for data distribution across the enterprise and network. We are moving rapidly to build the capabilities across our portfolio to differentiate Cisco's leadership in the Internet of Everything. 
Now let me provide an update on Cisco's momentum in cloud. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market and increase our InterCloud momentum. This quarter, we launched Phase 2 of our InterCloud strategy, linking different clouds together using interoperable and app-centric software to create hybrid clouds. Rob, thank you so much for your leadership here. The team's doing a great job."

Within our strategy to work across hyper visors and stacks, we continue our investment in OpenStack, with the launch at our Worldwide Partners Conference of Cisco OpenStack Private Cloud solutions aimed at on-premise cloud capabilities for application developers. 
To summarize my comments. Our customer conversations today are not about stand-alone products. They are simply about digitization, growth, new revenue streams for them, innovation and business outcomes. We believe we are 1 point away from our competition using the same formula that we've always used, integrating our industry-leading products in every category, into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes. We've created this opportunity, and it is ours to execute. 
I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments in the quarter and guidance for next quarter. To you, Kelly."

Overall, we had a very solid quarter and executed well.

Overall, we had a very solid quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $12.1 billion, increasing 5%, and we expanded our non-GAAP operating margin to 28.6%, with both non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS growing 6% to $2.8 billion and $0.54, respectively. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.47. 
Product revenue increased 6%, and service revenue increased 3%, with product book-to-bill greater than 1. For Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin came in at 62.5% and 61.8%, respectively. The increase in our non-GAAP product gross margin as compared to Q2 was driven by improved productivity, partially offset by product mix and pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 65.0%. 
Looking at our geographic segment results in terms of total revenue. Our Americas segment was up 8%; EMEA was up 2%; and APJC was down 1%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.9%; EMEA was 62.5%; while APJC was 61.2%.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $4.1 billion -- or were $4.1 billion, up 3% or 33.9% as a percentage of revenue as compared to 34.6% in Q3 of fiscal year '14.
Our headcount increased by approximately 800 to 70,951, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software. 
The non-GAAP tax provision rate of 22% for the quarter was consistent with our expectations. Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share included a benefit of $164 million or approximately $0.03 per share related to the charge we recorded in Q2 of '14 for a supplier component matter. The adjustment is a reduction of the liability, reflecting lower-than-expected cost to remediate the impacted products with our customers. This amount is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $54.4 billion, including $2.6 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $3.0 billion during the quarter. 
Deferred revenue was $14.2 billion, up 8%. Product deferred revenue grew in the double digits again this quarter at 12%, driven largely by subscription-based offerings, while Services deferred revenue also grew, up 6%, reflecting an increase in multiyear service arrangements. We continue to build a greater mix of recurring revenue as reflected in our deferred revenue. 
Our DSO was 37 days as compared to 35 days in Q3 of '14. 
In Q3, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders that included $1.0 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend, which we increased 11% last quarter. So far, in fiscal year '15, we have returned approximately $6.2 billion or 83% of free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $3.2 billion of share repurchases and $3.0 billion of dividends.
Now let me provide a few comments on our guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And actual results could be above or below guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. 
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 1% to 3% growth on a year-over-year basis. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and pricing. 
As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by 1 point in either direction of our guidance range. 
Or non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the fourth quarter. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q4 '15. The range includes a pretax charge of approximately $100 million as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. 
During Q3, we recognized pretax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $24 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year '15. 
Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details. 
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant.
We believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, and we'll continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats 1 quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments."

I believe Cisco is at a very positive inflection point. In our 1997 annual report, when it was not obvious that the Internet would take off, we boldly declared that an Internet revolution would alter the fortune of companies, countries and people, and we saw it come to life. 
A number of years ago, we started talking about the next phase of the Internet, the Internet of Everything, that will be much bigger than the last. And it would require everything to become digital. At the time, almost no one understood what we saw. Today, it's everyone's idea. 
The conversations we are having today with our customers are so similar in many ways to those that we had 20 years ago. We have always been at the example and saw the transitions early. And when others start noticing them, they are well underway. As we help companies, cities, countries digitize, the outcomes are exciting, job creation, quality of life, efficient use of resources. Our customers feel the pace of change accelerating, and they see the disruption in every industry and market. They know their success depends on fast innovation, digitizing their business, entirely new IT organization structures and business organization structures. Whether they are the disruptor or the incumbent, they are coming to Cisco as their strategic partner in the digital transformation. 
As they build their businesses around mobile, cloud, social, data and analytics, they recognize that integrated architectures, with the intelligent networks at the core, will accelerate or, if they don't take advantage of it, inhibit their ability to move with the speed, scale and security required. In simple terms, they know they will either disrupt or be disrupted. 
I am spending more and more of my time with CEOs, board of directors and government leaders to explain the combination of technological, organizational and process transformation to meet these goals of our customers. And as in the '90s, in order to be a true partner to our customers, we have to lead by example. Cisco is the reference point for how you reinvent yourself, to embrace the opportunities of digitization and the speed of innovation required for the future. 
We are 3 years ahead in making our own transitions. And with the pace of change in our market, 3 years makes a huge difference. What does this mean for Cisco and our shareholders? First, we spent the last 20 years moving everything to IP and taking advantage of convergence. The intelligent network is at the center of every market transition, and no one comes close to Cisco when it comes to the network. As 50 billion more devices come online, we have a strong hand to play, and we are playing it. 
Second, we are driving outcomes for our customers through architectures. This is how we differentiate against White Label and single-product companies, and you can see this in our financial results: our margin stability, operating leverage, market share and growth. 
Third, in a digital world, security becomes even more important. Cisco is the logical choice as we combine a security architecture across the intelligent network. Understanding the directions of market and challenging ourselves to reinvent is how we address this opportunity and drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
There could not be a better time to begin Cisco's next chapter, and there is no one more excited than I am to have Chuck Robbins as the next CEO for Cisco. I want to thank the Cisco employees who are leading our change and driving our innovation, and your patience and energy is making Cisco's future possible. Chuck, I know you will leverage the things that have made us great to date. I also know you'll make changes when needed and drive innovation and new capabilities at a faster pace. 
Cisco's momentum is strong, and we are extremely well positioned for the opportunities created by digitization. Every business and government leader is learning the benefits of becoming digital. Growth, leadership, efficiency, productivity, conservation, safety, quality of life and education, these outcomes that are at the core of what Cisco has enabled for the last 20 years. We wanted to use the Internet to change the way we work, live, learn and play, and that's exactly what we've done in the past and what we will do even more in the future. 
With that, Mel, we'll move to the session that I enjoy most, which is the Q&A. Let me turn it over to you."

And, Chuck, you can do the same thing after 10 years in the job. But answering them in sequence. First of all, the opportunity is absolutely in revenue growth and profit growth. And as you sell solutions moving to outcomes, and you can do that much faster because of your architectures and the intelligent network, you get margin stability and premiums to go with it. Let me use maybe just a couple quick examples of how I'd illustrate that. In the U.S. Enterprise, if we would have told you that the top U.S. Enterprise accounts under Brian's team were to be able to grow at 21% year-over-year, you'd say, ""I doubt that."" But it took us a while, and we're a couple of months in the transition. But when you now grow at that rate and have the number of large opportunities increase at the pace that we saw, you can see an inflection point which will absolutely translate not just to growth in U.S. Enterprise but globally. And let me give you an idea how that pipeline is expanding. We now sell business transformations, what Brian and Sandy do there together. In the present time, we have 1,200 projects going on business transformation and outcomes. That is a pipeline of $3.7 billion in opportunity over the next 18 months. Now we won't get all of that, but it gives you an idea of how rapidly that project has changed. They sell to the business community with support of the CIO as opposed to respond RFPs. In the last quarter alone, you had 540 new projects in the quarter put into this pipeline, and they had a potential of $915 million. What Chuck has done so well, whether it's in the Enterprise business, and you take it globally, Chuck, and taking that model and rebuilding our business and strategy, vision and strategy make it together, is exactly one of the reasons he got this job. The commercial marketplace in the U.S. has grown for 6 quarters in a row at approximately 10% to 11%. No one else in the world is doing those numbers. And again, Simona, it is purely business-based outcomes and selling architectures. And what Chuck has done there is he's taken what Alison Gleeson did and taken it on a global basis. And so you see the same opportunity from that perspective. In terms of our 2 headwinds, the emerging markets is hard to call. And I think it's often easy to take out a couple pieces and say, ""This is what our growth would have been otherwise."" But think about it. Our problem in emerging markets is now down to 3 major countries: It's China, Asia Pacific, without China, instead of growing at 1% would have grown at 8%. Chuck, you and I are going over there every quarter, which is mainly you going and me occasionally following. But we'll eventually get that one turned around assuming our governments get along. Russia and Europe, 41%, and it took down the numbers there a fair amount. But Service Provider, which was our biggest hit this quarter versus last quarter, instead of being down 1% was down 7%. And, Mel, we said last quarter, it's going to take us time to get this fixed. We didn't expect a positive upturn. Here I'm going to break one of my rules. I feel very comfortable, as you'll see in the next several quarters -- Kelly is cringing, but that's all right. Kelly, you'll get used to it. Chuck, this is one of my bad habits I want you to keep. But if you look at Service Provider, we'll turn that back positive. The organization changes that Chuck made in the field, that Pankaj turned into engineering the organization sideways to focus on outcomes, knocking down literally silos over 60 business units that now are integrated toward outcomes together, that will turn back positive. And we aren't modeling it because CapEx is going to increase. We do not think it will in the second half of the year. We think, actually, our share of wallet is going to change. Now let me put these pieces together. When you win a Verizon deal, people didn't get what that was. That was optical in an area that we've traditionally not been strong in. Because we organize our sales engine different, our service engines different and our R&D engine different, we understood what the customer wanted, we understood on the fly how we'd realign resources, we understood how you're going to have a win rate that is much higher than ever before in markets that we haven't traditionally been as strong. So all those, Simona, translate into revenue growth and profit growth. So am I pumped? Oh yes. And could I be more excited than I've ever to turn it over to Chuck and watch what's going to happen? I feel real good about our future, a lot of growth in revenues and a lot of growth in profits."

You mentioned the increase in the number of customers from 300 to 580 with APIC. We've seen success with converged infrastructure. So maintaining that leadership position in private cloud and now starting to track our success with the Cisco ONE cloud suite, which will bundle up our capabilities in UCS, UCS Director, InterCloud Fabric and our Prime service catalog. So if you looked at all the metrics, we really do think on the scorecard of private cloud, we're doing extremely well. The second thing we're looking at through InterCloud is driving innovation through open-source development. And you mentioned in Montréal that we had announced the private cloud version of OpenStack, OpenStack Private Cloud for developers inside the firewall. I will be tracking very closely how well we do in that environment with OpenStack. And clearly, with 65 partners embracing OpenStack in the public cloud, something that we just mentioned, we're really tracking how well we do in delivering OpenStack in the public cloud. The monetization model is infrastructure, and we should measure how well we do in building the infrastructure that will sit in private and public cloud on -- underneath of this OpenStack innovation. And the final thing, and this is just emerging but you've seen some recent examples, is the richness of the software catalog that Cisco breaks to the InterCloud marketplace. We've seen very good momentum recently with Hosted Collaboration Solution delivered by over 60 partners. You mentioned Rowan's announcement of Spark for teams, and that's a pure SaaS offer. And something a lot of people might have missed was the Cisco Collaboration Knowledge SaaS offer. So in the area of Collaboration, you see a very rich set of offers. We're looking at that marketplace, which will be a combination of Cisco and our partners' offers, and we measure those going forward. So those 3 areas, I'd say, lots of work left to do, but the scorecard is looking pretty good."

And then how's Cisco preparing for the CapEx, OpEx transition you're seeing with cloud services shift from buying boxes to buying services?

Our role in that is evolving and candidly, we're starting to move much faster. If you watch our ability to bring new products to market, you're going to see us have all 10 of the major players as key customers shortly. And up to recently, as you know, we were missing largely in one of those. Secondly, as Pankaj has turned this engineering organization sideways and began to really focus on speed of small agile teams, and I could walk through a number of examples from mobility to security, but let's just talk about now how we develop our high-end products. We used to think about developing a high-end product with maybe 3,000 people at least 3 to 5 years to do it. Watch how we develop our next-generation router products for these major players, and we'll do it in less than 12 months with probably 225 people. And so you're talking and what these players would say is, ""Cisco, you're finally getting it. You're getting your speed of change with that. You understand how to make the transition."" So I look at this as a very good opportunity for us to play in those with an increasing share of their spend. And different than our peers, we would do it with software, independent where appropriate, or a combination of software, hardware and ASICs. And I really like our momentum we're starting to get in these accounts. And it ranges from the Microsofts of world to the Googles of world, to the Facebooks, to the Amazons. Chuck? Any thoughts on that one?"

And I think that will allow us to deal with, Brian, the shift that you highlighted from CapEx spend to some of the Web 2.0 players, and we're working that portfolio now. We're working closely with many of them, and I think you'll see us evolve that as necessary over the next couple of quarters. I think when you think about the SP space, I think the biggest thing we've done over the last year, 1.5 years, is that we've really achieved architectural alignment with our SP customers, understanding where they want to go and aligning our portfolio. And I think that our speed with which we've moved into the virtual managed services space and some of the wins that we announced that John referenced in Mobile World Congress and some of the wins with Verizon and others are indicative of our alignment with where they want to go. And I think you'll see more of that from us in the future."

We're the largest volume player at only 7.5% of the market. And you know our view. We don't enter markets where we don't have a good chance of getting to 40% market share with sustainable differentiation. We believe it's going to be set up for an architectural play, and it's going to require integration with intelligence throughout the cloud, throughout the data centers, the WAN down to the access, combining mobile with the Internet of Everything and digitization, et cetera. We are on a journey here. We love the momentum, 14% growth, with orders growing faster, which I think was 20% growth. And I expect us to do a lot better than that over time. The pull-through on it is very interesting because, now, and this goes back to -- when we sell, we don't sell a product or just a architecture. When you go in and you talk about digitizing your company, we talk about how all of our product architectures come together. And then, when we talk about security together with IoE, digitizing your company, mobile and et cetera, you suddenly see how security ties across all of those. So we're starting to get upgrades, and we're learning how to sell this better and probably again, Brian and Sandy's group have done the best job. We get whole -- $10 million to $50 million upgrades of the whole network because of the security implications, how it ties together. It also gives us a seat at the boardroom where, on the one hand, we can say, ""You either disrupt or you die."" And on the other hand, your major fear of a CEO or a board is what happens if we have a problem, how do I minimize it, how do I know I've done everything possible. And don't save me a couple of hundred thousand dollars on a White Label box that causes me a problem. So our win rate goes way up, and our relevance goes way up. And you will continue to see us move in terms of additional moves as we go in the future. Chuck, I'm going to ask you maybe just to comment about his indirect question, which is acquisitions. Don't tie it down to a specific industry, but your overall view of innovation, how we defined it before and your thoughts about are we going to continue with the model if that includes acquisitions in that model."

So as I think about M&A activity going forward, I think if you look back at our strategy for innovation, it has always combined a combination of internal R&D, partnerships and acquisitions. And if you just look at the landscape today that we see in the consolidation of many of our peers and competitors, and, John, you've been talking about brutal consolidation for a few quarters now, many of what we -- many of those that we see out there now are really around cost synergies candidly that are between players that perhaps aren't as strategically well positioned. And when we see that happen, that usually creates opportunity for Cisco. And that's when we usually take advantage of those situations. The others that you see out there are more driven based on real strategic alignment and strategic acceleration. And those are typically done, I believe, by companies who are strategically better positioned in the marketplace relative to what's going on, which is where I would argue we are right now. So when I think about it, you'll see us take advantage of the latter. We'll leverage our go-to-market, our scale, our channel to accelerate time-to-market. And what I would -- the example I would give you is Meraki. We paid $1.2 billion for Meraki when it had $100 million in bookings. And now we're on a $600 million bookings run rate by bringing that inside and leveraging what we're able to do. And that's what you'll see from us in the future which is really, I think, M&A that fits within our innovation strategy, with a great deal of accountability."

You are going to see us move more and more into recurring revenue and deferred revenue. The art is to do both at the same time. Chuck and I both believe in the end. We want to grow our revenue in the short term and long term, our profits in the short term and long term faster than revenue. So we clearly are moving rapidly to that transition. Probably the best example to give you on what's been successful would be the example in terms of what we're doing in the security space, in terms of Meraki, where you begin to probably split it $2 for $1, $2 is for current, $1 is for later. And as Chuck said, you start with a $100 million base and you go all the way to the $600 million base fairly quickly. The second would be Collaboration. The numbers were great on Collaboration at 7% growth and TelePresence units at 66% year-over-year growth. But -- and their new products being developed in -- and I think it was 12 months with -- to prototype and 18 months to market with only 200 people. But what I loved about this quarter with Collaboration is their deferred revenue went up 20% to $1.1 billion on the quarter. So you're beginning to build recurring revenue and deferred revenue pipeline that feels very good. In terms of our capital allocation, you're going to see us remain committed to delivering on our capital allocation, as Kelly has outlined. And we'll continue to be aggressive with the minimum of our free cash flow going to our shareholders. And you'll see us -- we wouldn't have started the dividend if we didn't anticipate regularly raising it. And you're going to see us be active in the share repurchase as well in terms of the capital allocation. So no major change there, Mark."

Kelly, our margins on the switching actually were at the higher end of our range. They've been remarkably consistent for the last 8 quarters. So all this garbage about new players coming in and software coming in and White Label killing our approach was entirely wrong. And the feeder system looks really good. If you watch at the campus level, you have all of the drivers of low-end switching, from IoE to digitization to security to mobility, all driving these upgrades in wireless. And then, at the high-end, we're in the middle of a transition, which we executed remarkably well. And we took the bang. We announced the products early. We knew there'd be a transition from the 9K to the 7K. The 9K growth is off the charts. We are -- I want to be careful with my word selection. We are beating our competitors that you all were worried about. We moved past them in less than 1 year of shipment. We're growing sequentially 27% when our competitors are modeling to the market flat sequential growth. That is market share gains at tremendous speed. Now it's going to take us a couple more quarters to work through the 7K decline and get it balanced out. And you'll see us move a lot of the capabilities of the 9K to the 7K over the next couple of quarters. And I know, Chuck, you've got that one with Pankaj and the balance. So the bottom line on switching, we're taking share. We feel really good. We're going to kick the other competitors, and it's a very good growth market.

And in terms of routing and switching, you can see the numbers. I would expect there are other segments of the market and SP and emerging, come back to life, and they will. I think SP, we will see in a couple of quarters not because of CapEx spend but our positioning. And emerging, eventually, these 3 countries will level back out. You will see the architecture sales for that segment, outside switching and routing, grow well. Now the point that Tal just asked, every time we sell these others, it pulls through switching and routing. And this is where intelligence in the network and our speed of architectures get outcomes where those do not. And that would drive the services, Gary. That would drive the margins, Kelly, across the board that we get. We might think about a way of defining it a little bit more, but the bottom line is most of our customers that are with us on the digitization don't even think about us as routing and switching anymore. And the fast-growing areas of Collaboration, business messaging is one of the hottest areas growing, period, across the board in terms of the approach. Collaboration, if we can get 3% to 5% productivity in a company, and I think what we're doing around the Spark capability and the TelePresence, with this all coming together, we can do it. So it's a nice way of saying I think you're going to see our areas outside of switching and routing grow rapidly. The cool thing is it pulls through switching and routing, and the best of all, architectures beats White Label and pre-software."

Your routing business was actually up on a year-over-year basis. And yes, your Service Provider video was down 5%. But can you give us a little bit -- make up the sort of the difference? What are the other product categories in which you're seeing issues or challenges on the Service Provider side? And then second, regarding the transformation point, which is very evident in your U.S. results, which are quite impressive, what is it in that pitch that doesn't resonate or takes a long time to resonate everywhere else? Why is that not something that drives Europe up as well 10%, 15%?"

So I don't want to mislead anybody with the 5% revenue number. But the exciting part is we're picking up our momentum in the cloud segment of this and the software end of the cloud, which is clearly where we want the revenue to go. The architectural play wins here. Set-top boxes are tactical, but cloud winning on video, what Collette is doing there is strategic to us. Go to the U.S., if you take out one of the large service providers, you are all of a sudden, instead of talking down 17%, you're talking down 6%. And the cable players had the other parts. So we're starting to grow in many of these players globally. And it's just a few of them that have a major impact. To the third part of the question, it takes a while. When Chuck announced and did the collaboration -- I'm sorry, the commercial operation here, Chuck then put Alice in charge of this on a global basis. But it takes nearly a year to go through this transformation. And some countries pick it up quicker than others. And sometimes, you have to give some of these countries a nudge after the fact. Brian's total business transformation that he and Sandy are leading, that takes longer to roll out and more time. So even if you've watched with them there was a disruption as they move rapidly to this, where you saw the business actually slow for a couple of quarters before it took up. And then, there's the whole coordination with engineering and one of the key reasons that Chuck got this job, among others, is his ability to coordinate these resources together into vision and strategy to determine the outcomes in terms of the direction. It's a nice way of saying it's a multiyear journey. The cool thing is, using U.S. Enterprise as an example, once they got it going, the pipeline is accelerating, and you'll see that around the world. And that's why we feel comfortable with the long-term growth, Simona (sic) [Ittai] not just looking out a year or 2. But we will get more than our fair share. Now let me put this in proper perspective. If you watch where we are, all of our major IT players, almost without exception, are going down year-over-year. I mean it's a disaster in the market. We will -- if we hit our midpoint of the numbers we just gave you, we will be at a record earnings per share and a record quarter in terms of revenue. So we're taking share spend and position in the market extremely well as we go forward. So I feel very good about where we're positioned, Mel. And you're nicely saying that's going to be my last question? 
All right.  Let me move to close a little bit. It's been an honor. First, I want to thank all of you around this table. This leadership team is amazing in our virtual table, the Operating Committee and leaders, it really has been an honor. It has been fun. It's been challenging. And I'm just very humbled by having this chance for 20 years. Chuck, you're going to love this job. 
When I look about the -- where we are today, what excites me the most is what we've done on the culture and how we've built an engine of innovation. And if you watch the innovation we're talking about in many of these areas, what used to take thousands of people, Pankaj does with 20. We do the new mobility capability with data combining Wi-Fi with 3G and 4G in a way with 18 people in 8 months. You make moves in security the same way. You bring Spark to life with business messaging with 200 people. We can now rival the best startups there are in the world and out-execute them because they can build off of that capability. 
What gets me very comfortable about our future, I say it nicely, our competitors come and go. I mean, Chuck, I'm thinking about playing golf lately, but the exciting part about where we are is that you and I are on the 18th hole, and we're already ahead by 5 strokes in team play, and all of our competitors had hit their golf balls off into the woods and they're looking for it. And we're going to finish off this game. And by the time we are through, they're still going to be looking for their golf balls. I mean, if you really look at the market and you think innovation is breaking the company in half and having to roll the dice of combining 2 companies that are really 5 companies into one, and you begin to think about having to cut expenses dramatically and then double down that you can move to a software play only. And when we said this year that -- at the sales meeting -- and people forget that's just 8 months ago, that if you look at key competitors like HP and Alcatel-Lucent and Arista and VMware and Avaya, and we named several more, we said half of those won't exist in a meaningful way as competitors to us in a year. And everybody kind of said, ""Yes, right."" Look where we are already in 8 months. It's a nice way of saying we're going to become the #1 IT company. It's been a tremendous honor to lead this organization. It's one that will do better after me than during my time, and that's the way of saying like your kids. This team has built a tremendous strength. They're going to do even better in the future. 
So it's really been fun for me. It's also going to be fun being your wingman, Chuck. But it's -- I'll have to spend my time where you want me to spend it. And enjoy this moment and it's much like when I ran the day, Mel. You judge, you said go out and run a lot this morning. And I did, and I was determined to set my new course record when I ran. I got stopped in the first half, Mel. I've never seen this before in my life, but the biggest buck I've ever seen is probably up 12 point, maybe 14 point, was right in my path, 10 feet from me. And I looked it right in the eyes. And at first, I was annoyed because I was trying to just set my timing. And then I realized you want to enjoy the moment and how special that was. But I lost -- I missed my timing though. I didn't make it by 10 seconds. But it's a nice way of saying that we're a competitive organization, one that is far from perfect, and I've been a far from perfect leader, but one that I'm very honored to have led. And it's really nice, like a family, that I want this to do even better as I move on to the next stage of my career, which is more one of a coach. So Chuck, enjoy the moment. You're going to be a fantastic new CEO, and you're going to do great things here at Cisco. And this team is literally unbeatable."

While this is only my third week officially in the CEO role, we really hit the ground running since my appointment was announced on May 4. I believe that I'm stepping into this role at an incredible time for the company. John's vision and leadership have set Cisco up for the future that I believe will be even better than our past. John is an industry icon, a global community leader, a friend, and as Executive Chairman, I'm excited that our customers, partners, employees and shareholders will continue to benefit from his contribution in key priority areas, and I look forward to this partnership going forward. 
Over the last 90 days, we've seen an infectious energy emerge at Cisco, and we've made strong moves around the four focus areas that I laid out, accelerating what's working and changing what's not, simplifying our business, driving operational rigor and investing in our talent and our culture. We will continue to move quickly, and going forward, it is my pleasure to be transparent on what we are doing on what we're doing, and more importantly, why we are doing it. 
As we closed out our fiscal year, we delivered record revenues and record non-GAAP EPS for both Q4 and fiscal year '15. We're growing our business and earnings while driving the evolution of our portfolio and how we bring increasing value to our customers. We demonstrated our continued commitment to driving shareholder value, and in FY '15, returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. 
Cisco is in a very strong position. Our results remain work with and/or at last several years trend forming Cisco in today's rapidly changing market. When I think about our strategy, I look at the huge market opportunity that exist as businesses and government to use technology to drive their growth and operational efficiency. This is why our customers are moving to digital and is our #1 priority. 
In the digital world, data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on-premise, at the edge and in the cloud. The network plays an increasingly important role, enabling our customers to aggregate, automate and draw insights from this highly distributed data call with security and speed. This is driving into adopting entirely new IT architectures in order good structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and it is how we will continue to drive our differentiated strategy and prioritization in our business. This is something our customers and our partners appreciate, and starting today and over the coming months, it is my goal to simplify and bridge for you how Cisco's unique position in the significant market translates into growth in profits for our shareholders both today and over the long term. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kelly, Toronto our execution on our financial strategy."

I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with profitable growth. We saw good top line growth in Q4 with a record $12.8 billion in revenue, up 4%, bring our full year fiscal year '15 revenue to $49.2 billion, also growing 4%. Successful portfolio refreshes across almost every product area and effective resource reallocations to growth areas fueled revenue growth in Q4 in every product area, except for SP Video. Specifically in Q4, the continued traction of the new core platform and high-end routing drove routing revenue growth of 3%. Switching grew 2%, with very strong 200-plus percent growth of ACI, both the 9k and APIC, and strong performance in the Catalyst business. And the refresh of the entire collaboration product like him accelerated our collaboration growth so 14%. 
Data Center grew 14% with continued market leadership of UCS. Wireless grew 7%, driven continued Meraki momentum, and security grew 4%. In Security this quarter, we saw the acceleration and the shift from hardware to software. Our customers are rapidly adopting our subscription-based and softer offerings, which is helping us build a greater mix of recurring revenue. This transition is accelerating and will remain a focus for us going forward. 
Security and collaboration both had deferred revenue growth of over 20% at the end of the quarter, and we saw some pot of revenue growth double-digit again this quarter, up 21%. Product orders in Q4 grew 4% year-over-year, with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. 
Looking at the geographies, which is a primarily way run our business, the Americas grew 7%, EMEA declined 1% and APJC declined by 1%. Total emerging markets declined 2%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 7%. 
Looking at customer segments. We were pleased to see a return to positive growth of 2% in Service Provider. Commercial grew 11%, Enterprise globally declined 1% and public sector grew 4%. 
From a profitability perspective, in Q4, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 7%. GAAP EPS was $0.45. For the full year, we grew non-GAAP EPS 7% to $2.21, with GAAP EPS of $1.75. Q4 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 6%. GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. 
The focus the teams have placed on gross margin stability through technology innovation, sustainable differentiation and cost savings continues to pay off in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 62.1% [ph] with non-GAAP product gross margin of 61.0% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 65.9%. Strong operational rigor resulted in non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 at 32.8% of revenue and a non-GAAP operating margin that expanded to 29.3%. As I stated at Cisco Live! we are making the right that's and driving disciplined and we're reinvest, helping to ensure we get the best return on our investments. We believe continued operational discipline, combined with portfolio optimization, can drive our operating margin even higher from where we are now over the long term. 
Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the way the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software and security. In Q4, we announced an agreement to sell the client premises equipment portion of our SP Video-connected devices units of French-based Technicolor for approximately $600 million in cash and stock, subject to certain adjustments. We will continue to refocus our investment to Service Provider Video towards cloud and software-based services. We expect the transaction to close at the end of Q2 of fiscal year '16 and expect to see at approximately 1 point benefit to our non-GAAP gross margin rate and negligible net income impact after close. 
We also announced our intent to acquire the cloud-based security company, OpenDNS. The OpenDNS acquisition aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription Services and drive the value of analytics and our security offering. In Q4, we also closed 2 acquisitions to further complement our software collaboration and cloud offerings. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the allocation of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth area. 
Services revenues grew 4% in Q4. Double-digit growth in our advanced services portfolio of cloud, security, consulting and analytics reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes. Further extending our renewal capabilities, which is highly profitable for us, last week, we completed acquisition of Maintenance Net, a cloud-based software platform that uses data analytics and automation to manage renewals of recurring customer contracts. 
Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value. In Q4, we increased operating cash flow 15% to a record $4.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $60.4 billion, with $7 billion available in the U.S., and in Q4, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend. 
For the full year, we generated strong operating cash flows of $12.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.3 billion. We returned $8.3 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. 
We are also committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price, to drive our growth strategy. 
To summarize, in Q4 and for the full year 2015, we executed well against our business and financial strategy and saw that execution reflected in our profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We have also demonstrated a firm commitment to delivering shareholder value. 
Let me now go through the guidance for the first quarter fiscal '16, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. 
In terms of total revenue, we expect it to be in the range of 2% to 4% growth year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 61% to 62%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%, up 1% from the prior fiscal year. This represents approximately $0.01 of impact to EPS. As the U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.11 to $0.15. Further details related to this range are included in that slide and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back to Chuck the summarize the call."

I believe our strategy and execution have enabled our performance to be quite differentiated from our peers. We delivered record revenue and non-GAAP EPS and drove positive growth in new orders while increasing our deferred revenue on the product side by 21%. We are these strong results all as we transition our business. Let me give you some clear examples. 
First, as we look at collaboration business, 2 years ago, we said we would overhaul our portfolio and shift it toward more recurring revenue. We delivered revenue growth of 14% and saw deferred revenue growth over 20% on the strength of our subscription and SaaS businesses. As we look at security, in a highly distributed digital world, security is the top concern for our customers. We are pushing threats-centric security everywhere across the index, driving our FirePOWER security services across hundreds of thousands of ASA firewall platforms and ISR routers. 
In Q4, we added customers more than 15x faster than Sourcefire at the time of the acquisition. We're quickly building a substantial software subscription business in our security portfolio, and you see that in a 26% growth of deferred revenue in Q4 for security. 
Assuming we continue to execute, I'm confident that we'll see high double-digit growth in the back half of this year. 
In switching, we are driving the transition to the Nexus 3K, 9K and ACI, and in the quarter, we grew revenue across those product families to $438 million, growing more than 100% year-over-year and more than 50% sequentially. We 
added 1,400 new 9K customers, bringing us to over 4,100 total, and 26 of our 28 largest Enterprise customers are now 9K customers with 30% of them new in Q4. 
In high-end routing, we continue to drive  the transition in the core and saw both of our new platforms grow in triple digits. We've solidified our lead in this market. 
And with Meraki, customers are rapidly adopting this new cloud-based consumption model. 3 years ago, we bought Meraki for $1.2 billion, with $100 million of annual orders. We closed this year with almost $1 billion order run rate, scaling the business through our global commercial channels. These are just a few examples of what we are capable of when we focus, and this is what I intend to accelerate. We've only begun to scratch the surface on how we can take advantage of our scale and relevance in this digital transition and how we deliver our technology to our customers. The strategic role Cisco is playing is at the center of the digital transition today and in the future, and this is why I strongly believe Cisco's best years are ahead of us. Mel, let's open up for questions."

Number one, I am very bullish about where we are with our security portfolio. I think the team has done a tremendous job, the factory driven the transition and that they have begun from hardware to software, in subscription business. As we stated the deferred revenue was up over 20%, I think 26% in the quarter. Software is now 47% of our security portfolio. On the FirePOWER Services, which is where we have our malware capabilities, we had almost 3,000 new customers, which before the quarter, I think, we had 3,000 customers, so we doubled the number during the quarter. And what we plan to do now is take that across all of our 275,000 ASA firewall customers.

The thing the teams to have great job of covering that transition pick up again will be good for us in the long run. As it relates to our portfolio, when we think about this, we clear you're going to have to continue to expand our offerings for the customers, and we'll do that through a combination of internal R&D, acquisitions where needed, partnerships where they make sense, coinnovation where it makes sense.

Our U.S. Commercial business this past quarter grew 19%, and that's 23 consecutive quarters of positive growth, and 16 of those have been double digits. So we've had very consistent performance.

And I think we're doing that very well in Enterprise, nothing because of that are really good job of that in commercial.

We had adjusted our cost structure where needed, and we've invested in areas where we've seen growth, as you would expect. And we believe that as the macro and the geopolitical issues resolve themselves, we think will be of the beneficiary of that. The other comment I'll just make on emerging is that if you just look at the immune numbers and you remove Russia, EMEA was actually positive. So it was up plus 1 without Russia. So overall, the emerging continue to be a little bit of a strain."

While this is only my third week officially in the CEO role, we really hit the ground running since my appointment was announced on May 4. I believe that I'm stepping into this role at an incredible time for the company. John's vision and leadership have set Cisco up for the future that I believe will be even better than our past. John is an industry icon, a global community leader, a friend, and as Executive Chairman, I'm excited that our customers, partners, employees and shareholders will continue to benefit from his contribution in key priority areas, and I look forward to this partnership going forward. 
Over the last 90 days, we've seen an infectious energy emerge at Cisco, and we've made strong moves around the 4 focus areas that I laid out, accelerating what's working and changing what's not, simplifying our business, driving operational rigor and investing in our talent and our culture. We will continue to move quickly, and going forward, it is my intention to be transparent on what we were doing -- what we are doing, and more importantly, why we are doing it. 
As we closed out our fiscal year, we delivered record revenues and record non-GAAP EPS for both Q4 and fiscal year '15. We're growing our business and earnings while driving the evolution of our portfolio and how we bring increasing value to our customers. We demonstrated our continued commitment to driving shareholder value, and in FY '15, returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. 
Cisco is in a very strong position. Our results reflect the work we've done over the last several years, transforming Cisco in today's rapidly changing market. When I think about our strategy, I look at the huge market opportunity that exists as businesses and governments use technology to drive their growth and operational efficiency. This is why our customers are moving to digital and this is our #1 priority. 
In the digital world, data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on-premise, at the edge and in the cloud. The network plays an increasingly important role, enabling our customers to aggregate, automate and draw insights from this highly distributed data with security and speed. This is driving them to to adopt entirely new IT architectures and organizational structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and it is how we will continue to drive our differentiated strategy and prioritization in our business. This is something our customers and our partners appreciate, and starting today and over the coming months, it is my goal to simplify and bridge for you how Cisco's unique position in the significant market translates into growth in profits for our shareholders both today and over the long term. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kelly, to run through our execution on our financial strategy."

I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with profitable growth. We saw good top line growth in Q4 with a record $12.8 billion in revenue, up 4%, bring our full year fiscal year '15 revenue to $49.2 billion, also growing 4%. Successful portfolio refreshes across almost every product area and effective resource reallocations to growth areas fueled revenue growth in Q4 in every product area, except for SP Video. Specifically in Q4, the continued traction of the new core platform then high-end routing drove routing revenue growth of 3%. Switching grew 2%, with very strong 200-plus percent growth of ACI, both the 9k and APIC, and strong performance in the Catalyst business. And the refresh of the entire collaboration product line accelerated our collaboration growth to 14%. 
Data Center grew 14% with continued market leadership of UCS. Wireless grew 7%, driven continued Meraki momentum, and security grew 4%. In Security this quarter, we saw the acceleration and a shift from hardware to software. Our customers are rapidly adopting our subscription-based and software offerings, which is helping us build a greater mix of recurring revenue. This transition is accelerating and will remain a focus for us going forward.
Security and collaboration both had deferred revenue growth of over 20% at the end of the quarter, and we saw total deferred product revenue growth double-digit again this quarter, up 21%. Product orders in Q4 grew 4% year-over-year, with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. 
Looking at the geographies, which is a primarily way run our business, the Americas grew 7%, EMEA declined 1% and APJC declined by 1%. Total emerging markets declined 2%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 7%. 
Looking at customer segments. We were pleased to see a return to positive growth of 2% in Service Provider. Commercial grew 11%, Enterprise globally declined 1% and public sector grew 4%. 
From a profitability perspective, in Q4, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 7%. GAAP EPS was $0.45. For the full year, we grew non-GAAP EPS 7% to $2.21, with GAAP EPS of $1.75. Q4 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 6%. GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. 
The focus the teams have placed on gross margin stability through technology innovation, sustainable differentiation and cost savings continues to pay off in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 62.1%,  with non-GAAP product gross margin of 61.0% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 65.9%. Strong operational rigor resulted in non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 at 32.8% of revenue and a non-GAAP operating margin that expanded to 29.3%. As I stated at Cisco Live! we are making the right bets in riding [ph] discipline in where we invest, helping to ensure we get the best return on our investments. We believe continued operational discipline, combined with portfolio optimization, can drive our operating margin even higher from where we are now over the long term. 
Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the way the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software and security. In Q4, we announced an agreement to sell the client premises equipment portion of our SP Video-connected devices units to French-based Technicolor for approximately $600 million in cash and stock, subject to certain adjustments. We will continue to refocus our investment in Service Provider Video towards cloud- and software-based services. We expect the transaction to close at the end of Q2 of fiscal year '16 and expect to see an approximate 1-point benefit to our non-GAAP gross margin rate and negligible net income impact after close. 
We also announced our intent to acquire the cloud-based security company, OpenDNS. The OpenDNS acquisition aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services and drive the value of analytics and our security offerings. In Q4, we also closed 2 acquisitions to further complement our software collaboration and cloud offerings. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the allocation of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas. 
Services revenues grew 4% in Q4. Double-digit growth in our advanced services portfolio of cloud, security, consulting and analytics reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes. Further extending our renewal capabilities, which is highly profitable for us, last week, we completed the acquisition of Maintenance Net, a cloud-based software platform that uses data analytics and automation to manage renewals of recurring customer contracts. 
Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value. In Q4, we increased operating cash flow 15% to a record $4.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $60.4 billion, with $7 billion available in the U.S. And in Q4, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend. 
For the full year, we generated strong operating cash flows of $12.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.3 billion. We returned $8.3 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. We are also committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price, to drive our growth strategy. 
To summarize, in Q4 and for the full year 2015, we executed well against our business and financial strategy and saw that execution reflected in our profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We have also demonstrated a firm commitment to delivering shareholder value. 
Let me now go through the guidance for the first quarter fiscal '16, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. 
In terms of total revenue, we expect it to be in the range of 2% to 4% growth year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 61% to 62%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%, up 1% from the prior fiscal year. This represents approximately $0.01 of impact to EPS. If the U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.11 to $0.15. Further details related to this range are included in the slide and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back to Chuck the summarize the call."

I believe our strategy and execution have enabled our performance to be quite differentiated from our peers. We delivered record revenue and non-GAAP EPS and drove positive growth in new orders while increasing our deferred revenue on the product side by 21%. We are these strong results all as we transition our business. Let me give you some clear examples. 
First, as we look at collaboration business, 2 years ago, we said we would overhaul our portfolio and shift it towards more recurring revenue. We delivered revenue growth of 14% and saw deferred revenue growth over 20% on the strength of our subscription and SaaS businesses. As we look at security, in a highly distributed digital world, security is the top concern for our customers. We are pushing threat-centric security everywhere across the extended network,, driving our FirePOWER security services across hundreds of thousands of ASA firewall platforms and ISR routers. 
In Q4, we added customers more than 15x faster than Sourcefire at the time of the acquisition. We're quickly building a substantial software subscription business in our security portfolio, and you see that in the 26% growth of deferred revenue in Q4 for security. Assuming we continue to execute, I'm confident we'll see high double-digit growth in the back half of this year. 
In switching, we're driving the transition to the Nexus 3K, 9K and ACI. And in the quarter, we grew revenue across those product families to $438 million, growing more than 100% year-over-year and more than 50% sequentially. We 
added 1,400 new 9K customers, bringing us to over 4,100 total, and 26 of our 28 largest Enterprise customers are now 9K customers with 30% of them new in Q4. 
In high-end routing, we continue to drive the transition in the core and saw both of our new platforms grow in triple digits. We've solidified our lead in this market. 
And with Meraki, customers are rapidly adopting this new cloud-based consumption model. 3 years ago, we bought Meraki for $1.2 billion, with $100 million of annual orders. We closed this year with almost $1 billion order run rate, scaling the business through our global commercial channels. These are just a few examples of what we are capable of when we focus, and this is what I intend to accelerate. We've only begun to scratch the surface on how we can take advantage of our scale and relevance in this digital transition and how we deliver our technology to our customers. The strategic role Cisco is playing is at the center of the digital transition today and in the future, and it's why I strongly believe Cisco's best years are ahead of us.

Number one, I am very bullish about where we are with our security portfolio. I think the team has done a tremendous job. They have actually driven the transition and that we have begun from hardware to software and subscription business. As we stated the deferred revenue was up over 20%, I think 26% in the quarter. Software is now 47% of our security portfolio. On the FirePOWER Services, which is where we have our malware capabilities, we had an almost 3,000 new customers, which before the quarter, I think, we had 3,000 customers, so we doubled the number during the quarter. And what we plan to do now is take that across all of our 275,000 ASA firewall customers. And I do feel comfortable that in the next couple of quarters, we'll get the revenue back in the double digits. so again, I think it's a transition that we're pushing. I think thing the team's doing a great job of accelerating that transition. I think it'll be good for us in the long run. As it relates to our portfolio, when we think about this, we clearly are going to have to continue to expand our offerings for the customers, and we'll do that through a combination of internal R&D, acquisitions where needed, partnerships where they make sense, co-innovation where it makes sense. So we'll be looking at all alternatives."

This is why when you look at our Enterprise segment this quarter, it doesn't concern me. When you look at our commercial business, our selling motions, our solutions and everything we do are the same. There's just much a broader base of customers to balance it across. So we grew the global business and commercial 11%. Just a couple other data points for you. Our U.S. Commercial business this past quarter grew 19%, and that's 23 consecutive quarters of positive growth, and 16 of those have been double digits. So we've had very consistent performance. I think the key is that we have really shifted both our solutions and our technology as well as our selling motion and our services capability to be much more tightly aligned with how the technology aligns to our customers' businesses issues. And I think we're doing that very well in Enterprise, and I think the teams have done a really good job of that in commercial. And those commercial customers, those mid-range customers, we see it time and time again, they tend to be the early adopters of our new technology because they view it as a way to accelerate their business, to drive their competitiveness, and they just always seem to adopt early.

While this is only my third week officially in the CEO role, we've really hit the ground running since my appointment was announced on May 4. I believe that I'm stepping into this role at an incredible time for the company. John's vision and leadership have set Cisco up for the future that I believe will be even better than our past. John is an industry icon, a global community leader, a friend, and as Executive Chairman, I'm excited that our customers, partners, employees and shareholders will continue to benefit from his contribution in key priority areas, and I look forward to this partnership going forward. 
Over the last 90 days, we've seen an infectious energy emerge at Cisco, and we've made strong moves around the 4 focus areas that I laid out: accelerating what's working and changing what's not; simplifying our business; driving operational rigor and investing in our talent and our culture. We will continue to move quickly, and going forward, it is my intention to be transparent on what we were doing -- what we are doing, and more importantly, why we are doing it. 
As we closed out our fiscal year, we delivered record revenues and record non-GAAP EPS for both Q4 and fiscal year '15. We're growing our business and earnings while driving the evolution of our portfolio and how we bring increasing value to our customers. We demonstrated our continued commitment to driving shareholder value, and in FY '15, returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. 
Cisco is in a very strong position. Our results reflect the work we've done over the last several years, transforming Cisco in today's rapidly changing market. When I think about our strategy, I look at the huge market opportunity that exists as businesses and governments use technology to drive their growth and operational efficiency. This is why our customers are moving to digital and it is their #1 priority. 
In the digital world, data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on-premise, at the edge and in the cloud. The network plays an increasingly important role, enabling our customers to aggregate, automate and draw insights from this highly distributed data with security and speed. This is driving them to adopt entirely new IT architectures and organizational structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and it is how we will continue to drive our differentiated strategy and prioritization in our business. This is something our customers and our partners appreciate, and starting today and over the coming months, it is my goal to simplify and bridge for you how Cisco's unique position in the significant market translates into growth in profits for our shareholders both today and over the long term. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kelly, to run through our execution on our financial strategy."

I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with profitable growth. We saw good top line growth in Q4 with a record $12.8 billion in revenue, up 4%, bring our full year fiscal year '15 revenue to $49.2 billion, also growing 4%. Successful portfolio refreshes across almost every product area and effective resource reallocations to growth areas fueled revenue growth in Q4 in every product area, except for SP Video. Specifically in Q4, the continued traction of the new core platform in high-end routing drove routing revenue growth of 3%. Switching grew 2%, with very strong 200-plus percent growth of ACI, both the 9k and APIC, and strong performance in the Catalyst business. And the refresh of the entire collaboration product line accelerated our collaboration growth to 14%. 
Data Center grew 14% with continued market leadership of UCS. Wireless grew 7%, driven continued Meraki momentum, and security grew 4%. In Security this quarter, we saw the acceleration and a shift from hardware to software. Our customers are rapidly adopting our subscription-based and software offerings, which is helping us build a greater mix of recurring revenue. This transition is accelerating and will remain a focus for us going forward.
Security and collaboration both had deferred revenue growth of over 20% at the end of the quarter, and we saw total deferred product revenue growth double-digit again this quarter, up 21%. Product orders in Q4 grew 4% year-over-year, with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. 
Looking at the geographies, which is a primarily way run our business, the Americas grew 7%, EMEA declined 1% and APJC declined by 1%. Total emerging markets declined 2%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 7%. 
Looking at customer segments. We were pleased to see a return to positive growth of 2% in Service Provider. Commercial grew 11%, Enterprise globally declined 1% and public sector grew 4%. 
From a profitability perspective, in Q4, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 7%. GAAP EPS was $0.45. For the full year, we grew non-GAAP EPS 7% to $2.21, with GAAP EPS of $1.75. Q4 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 6%. GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. 
The focus the teams have placed on gross margin stability through technology innovation, sustainable differentiation and cost savings continues to pay off in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 62.1%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 61.0% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 65.9%. Strong operational rigor resulted in non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 at 32.8% of revenue and a non-GAAP operating margin that expanded to 29.3%. As I stated at Cisco Live! we are making the right bets and driving discipline in where we invest, helping to ensure we get the best return on our investments. We believe continued operational discipline, combined with portfolio optimization, can drive our operating margin even higher from where we are now over the long term. 
Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the way -- the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software and security. In Q4, we announced an agreement to sell the client premises equipment portion of our SP Video-connected devices units to French-based Technicolor for approximately $600 million in cash and stock, subject to certain adjustments. We will continue to refocus our investment in Service Provider Video towards cloud- and software-based services. We expect the transaction to close at the end of Q2 of fiscal year '16 and expect to see an approximate 1-point benefit to our non-GAAP gross margin rate and negligible net income impact after close. 
We also announced our intent to acquire the cloud-based security company, OpenDNS. The OpenDNS acquisition aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services and drive the value of analytics and our security offerings. In Q4, we also closed 2 acquisitions to further complement our software collaboration and cloud offerings. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the allocation of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas. 
Services revenues grew 4% in Q4. Double-digit growth in our advanced services portfolio of cloud, security, consulting and analytics reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes. Further extending our renewal capabilities, which is highly profitable for us, last week, we completed the acquisition of MaintenanceNet, a cloud-based software platform that uses data analytics and automation to manage renewals of recurring customer contracts. 
Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value. In Q4, we increased operating cash flow 15% to a record $4.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $60.4 billion, with $7 billion available in the U.S. And in Q4, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend. 
For the full year, we generated strong operating cash flows of $12.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.3 billion. We returned $8.3 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. We are also committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price, to drive our growth strategy. 
To summarize, in Q4 and for the full year 2015, we executed well against our business and financial strategy and saw that execution reflected in our profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We have also demonstrated our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value. 
Let me now go through the guidance for the first quarter fiscal '16, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. 
In terms of total revenue, we expect it to be in the range of 2% to 4% growth year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 61% to 62%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%, up 1% from the prior fiscal year. This represents approximately $0.01 of impact to EPS. If the U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.11 to $0.15. Further details related to this range are included in the slide and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back to Chuck the summarize the call."

I believe our strategy and execution have enabled our performance to be quite differentiated from our peers. We delivered record revenue and non-GAAP EPS and drove positive growth in new orders while increasing our deferred revenue on the product side by 21%. We are these strong results all as we transition our business. Let me give you some clear examples. 
First, as we look at collaboration business, 2 years ago, we said we would overhaul our portfolio and shift it towards more recurring revenue. We delivered revenue growth of 14% and saw deferred revenue growth over 20% on the strength of our subscription and SaaS businesses. As we look at security, in a highly distributed digital world, security is the top concern for our customers. We are pushing threat-centric security everywhere across the extended network, driving our FirePOWER security services across hundreds of thousands of ASA firewall platforms and ISR routers. 
In Q4, we added customers more than 15x faster than Sourcefire at the time of the acquisition. We're quickly building a substantial software subscription business in our security portfolio, and you see that in the 26% growth of deferred revenue in Q4 for security. Assuming we continue to execute, I'm confident we'll see high double-digit growth in the back half of this year. 
In switching, we're driving the transition to the Nexus 3K, 9K and ACI. And in the quarter, we grew revenue across those product families to $438 million, growing more than 100% year-over-year and more than 50% sequentially. We added 1,400 new 9K customers, bringing us to over 4,100 total, and 26 of our 28 largest Enterprise customers are now 9K customers with 30% of them new in Q4. 
In high-end routing, we continue to drive the transition in the core and saw both of our new platforms grow in triple digits which solidified our lead in this market. 
And with Meraki, customers are rapidly adopting this new cloud-based consumption model. Three years ago, we bought Meraki for $1.2 billion, with $100 million of annual orders. We closed this year with almost $1 billion order run rate, scaling the business through our global commercial channels. These are just a few examples of what we are capable of when we focus, and this is what I intend to accelerate. We've only begun to scratch the surface on how we can take advantage of our scale and relevance in this digital transition and how we deliver our technology to our customers. The strategic role Cisco is playing is at the center of the digital transition today and in the future, and it's why I strongly believe Cisco's best years are ahead of us. 
Mel, let's open up for questions."

Number one, I am very bullish about where we are with our security portfolio. I think the team has done a tremendous job. They have actually driven the transition and that we have begun from hardware to software and subscription business. As we stated the deferred revenue was up over 20%, I think 26% in the quarter. Software is now 47% of our security portfolio. On the FirePOWER Services, which is where we have our malware capabilities, we added almost 3,000 new customers, which before the quarter, I think, we had 3,000 customers, so we doubled the number during the quarter. And what we plan to do now is take that across all of our 275,000 ASA firewall customers. And I do feel comfortable that in the next couple of quarters, we'll get the revenue back in the double digits. So, I think it's a transition that we're pushing. I think thing the team's doing a great job of accelerating that transition. I think it'll be good for us in the long run. As it relates to our portfolio, when we think about this, we clearly are going to have to continue to expand our offerings for the customers, and we'll do that through a combination of internal R&D, acquisitions where needed, partnerships where they make sense, co-innovation where it makes sense. So we'll be looking at all alternatives."

So looking at our backlog, it was down marginally from 1 year ago. And as you know, it's a point in time. I think the big difference when you compare that to the great strength you're seeing in our product deferred revenue being up is as soon as we invoice it out of our invoice, whatever it is, the hardware or the software, we remove it from backlog. And then obviously, then as we get our cash for things or we defer it for deals, it goes into that deferred. So there's a bit of a disconnect between the two of when it is actually invoiced out.

Our teams have done a great job. We're proud of what they've done. We made some changes over the last 18 months internally in engineering and services and in sales to better position us. And I think that had a lot about to do with it. I also think that we have really gotten to a point of, what I'd say, architectural vision alignment with most of our customers. We saw balance throughout the quarter in SP. We saw good performance from data center, collaboration, high-end routing, even SP Mobility. And so while we're pleased with the 2%, we're still cautiously optimistic about where we go. I think that on the second half of the year, right now, relative to when you think about SP CapEx, there are a lot of -- there's a lot of movement right now around the expectations for that in the second half. And candidly, we have not modeled any significant increase in the second half of CapEx spend from SP. And if does occur, then we'll certainly benefit from that.

This is why when you look at our Enterprise segment this quarter, it doesn't concern me. When you look at our commercial business, our selling motions, our solutions and everything we do are the same. There's just much a broader base of customers to balance it across. So we grew the global business and commercial 11%. Just a couple other data points for you. Our U.S. Commercial business this past quarter grew 19%, and that's 23 consecutive quarters of positive growth, and 16 of those have been double digits. So we've had very consistent performance. I think the key is that we have really shifted both our solutions and our technology as well as our selling motion and our services capability to be much more tightly aligned with how the technology aligns to our customers' businesses issues. And I think we're doing that very well in Enterprise, and I think the teams have done a really good job of that in commercial. And those commercial customers, those mid-range customers, we see it time and time again, they tend to be the early adopters of our new technology because they view it as a way to accelerate their business, to drive their competitiveness, and they just always seem to adopt early. Meraki has clearly been a big success for us, as I said earlier, relative to exiting Q4, almost on a $1 billion run rate from an order perspective. And we continue to see it being a relevant portion of particularly, the lower end of our commercial market, K-12 market. And not only wireless, but also we're seeing an expansion into manage cloud switching as well as security.

We grew our revenue 4% and delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 9%. We delivered very strong non-GAAP gross margins, and our non-GAAP operating margin was the best we've seen in over 9 years. 
I recognize that our Q2 guidance was -- that we just provided is below what the market had expected. In Q1, we saw lower-than-expected order growth, driven largely by uncertainty for macro and currency impacts, primarily outside the U.S. Despite these headwinds, I believe we are executing incredibly well in a challenging environment. 
Let me tell you simply how I see it. We had a great quarter, guided to solid growth in Q2 and feel good about our momentum and how we are positioned for the second half of the year. 
As I look at the big picture, I'm extremely pleased with the speed with which our teams are executing. We have a clear strategy and are confident that we are making the right transitions in our business, investing where we need to for future growth, profitability and market leadership. Specifically, we are accelerating our ability to deliver on the growth opportunities in front of us. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace. So far, in FY '16, we're seeing 25% increase in major new product introductions, and 3 of our internal startups brought solutions to market this quarter working with our key customers. These startups are bringing incredible technology from concept to delivery in under 12 months. Stay tuned next week for announcements around an additional project that we codeveloped with one of the world's largest web scale players. 
In this quarter alone, we closed 3 acquisitions, recently announced 4 new acquisitions and formed to 3 new strategic partnerships. Partners like Apple, [indiscernible] and Ericsson see Cisco as a market leader they want to work with to move faster and drive greater value to customers and the market. 
I believe we will see several points of growth from these partnerships over the next few years.
We're also aggressively driving our cloud businesses. We've always had a hybrid cloud strategy, and it is increasingly clear that every one of our customers want both public and private cloud capabilities in a hybrid cloud. 
On the public cloud side, Cisco is a leading provider of infrastructure to the web scale and SP customers as they build out their public cloud infrastructure. It's just one data point. Our business with the largest web scale players grew over 20% again this quarter. 
Within the enterprise, we are winning in public cloud and are focused on automating and driving public cloud economics across our customers' entire infrastructure. We saw this opportunity to drive 24% growth in UCS, and our next-generation data center switching portfolio, which is our 3K, 9K and ACI, is now at a $2 billion run rate, with over $500 million in revenue this quarter, growing over 140% year-over-year, with sequential growth of 26%. This performance is much stronger than that of our competitors who claim they are outpacing and outperforming us. 
And our own cloud services continue to grow well. WebEx, one of the largest enterprise SaaS applications in the world, grew revenue over 23% this quarter, and we continue to move more of our portfolio to cloud-based delivery models. 
As we delivered more of our portfolio and software and cloud models, we are driving consistent double-digit growth and deferred revenue. We saw software and subscription product deferred revenue up 36%. Security deferred revenue grew 31% as we sell next-generation firewall and threat defense software to our over 200,000 firewall customers. 
Our collaboration deferred revenue grew 18%, and our Meraki cloud networking business, where we deliver networking as-a-service, grew revenue over 60%. While we still have work to do across our portfolio, I'm incredibly pleased with our continued focus and speed of execution. We will continue to make the necessary strategic moves to drive our success.
Over the last quarter, I spent hundreds of hours with our customers and partners around the world, and they have reaffirmed my confidence in our ability to execute against the opportunity in front of us. 
While the market continues to move at an accelerated pace, our customers know they must move with speed as they embark on their digital transitions. It's clear to me that they also understand the central and critical role that the network plays in that transition. And they are looking to us to be a strategic partner to drive their growth and build their digital organization, cities and countries. 
We are doing the right things to capitalize on this opportunity, and as I told our teams this past week, I have never been more optimistic. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials."
19691,309209051,902671,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2015",2015-11-12,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. Starting with our first pillar of delivering profitable growth.",1007,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with our first pillar of delivering profitable growth. We saw good top line growth in Q1 with $12.7 billion and total revenue up [ph] 4%. Product revenue grew 4%, with solid growth in switching, data center, wireless, security and collaborations. More specifically, in Q1, switching grew 5%. In addition to the 3K, 9K and ACI momentum of over 140%, we continue to see strength in the Catalyst business. 
Data Center grew 24%, demonstrating our continued market leadership. Wireless grew 7%, driven by the Meraki business. Security was up 7%, with deferred revenue growth of 31%. And collaboration grew 17%, with deferred revenue up 18%. 
In total, deferred revenue had solid double-digit growth of 10%, with products deferred revenue up 16% and services up 7%. 
Product deferred revenue, driven by our subscription and software businesses, grew 36%. We do see the transition to subscription revenue accelerating, as I mentioned in the last earnings call. 
We did see routing decline 8%, but we do expect routing revenue to return to growth due to timing of some large deals we saw in Q1. Services revenue grew 1%, largely driven by weakness in Service Provider. Product orders grew 3% with the book-to-bill below 1, which is in line with our typical Q1 but slightly lighter than we had expected. 
Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run our business, Americas grew 1%, EMEA grew 3% and APJC was up 9%. Total emerging markets grew a very solid 11%, with the BRICS plus Mexico accelerating to 21% growth. 
In terms of customer segment, Service Provider grew 6%. Enterprise declined 3% based on the uncertainty from macro challenges, consistent with what others are seeing. Commercial grew 7%, which signals to us the broad strength of our portfolio. Public Sector was flat. 
From a profitability perspective, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.48. Q1 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion. 
We drove the strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 62.3% [ph] and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.2%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were well-controlled at 32.7% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 30.5%. 
We are ensuring we make the right investment and divestment decisions through disciplined portfolio management. 
Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software and services and security. 
We've been very active from an M&A perspective on lining our investments to key growth areas. We closed 3 acquisitions in Q1 with OpenDNS and [indiscernible] in software and security and Maintenance Net in services. We also announced the acquisitions of Portcullis and Lancope in security, [indiscernible] in data and analytics and 1 mainstream and cloud-based video. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the investment of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas. 
Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value. In Q1, we increased operating cash flow 11% to $2.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $59.1 billion, with $5 billion available in the U.S. And we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.1 billion of dividends. The total share returned to shareholders represents a return of 91% of our free cash flow, more than consistent with our commitment to shareholders of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually. 
Overall, Q1 was a strong quarter. As you review the financials, you see good top line growth, record profitability and operating leverage, a very strong doubts you with growth in deferred revenue and strong cash generation. We executed well, consistent with our business and financial strategy. 
Now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. As a reminder, in Q4, we announced an agreement to sell that client premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business to Technicolor. The transaction is currently going through regulatory approval, and we are working to close the during the second quarter. In order to provide a clear view of our continuing expected financial performance, we have normalized our second quarter guidance to exclude the CPE business for both Q2 fiscal year '16 and Q2 fiscal year '15. We have provided historical financial information for the CPE business in the slides that accompany this call. 
So now on to our Q2 guidance. We are executing very well in a challenging global environment but did see the macro challenges driving uncertainty that impacted our Q1 order growth. As a result, the guidance for Q2, excluding the CPE businesses, is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of 0% to 2% year-over-year; we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62% to 63%; the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%; and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%. 
The tax rate does not include any impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.55. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.14. For details related to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call."

So as I look back at the last 90 days in my first quarter, I am more optimistic than ever about Cisco's feature. 
Yes, the guidance we just gave for Q2 is lower than what the market had expected, and I don't take that lightly. But for me, nothing has changed in how I feel about the business. We are moving incredibly fast and doing all the right things to drive our growth and strategic relevance. 
We expect the result of these moves will start showing up in the coming quarters. 
Every one of our customers, established industry leaders and disruptive challengers, is focused on how they manage, automate and secure the explosion of connections and data across their digital organization. Our portfolio has never been stronger, more relevant and more strategic. And we're hearing this record from our customers and our partners. The opportunity is ours to capitalize on. 
We have a clear vision and strategy and executing well very well. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace, acquiring strategic assets, codeveloping with our customers and building a new set of strategic partnerships. I believe our speed and execution are truly differentiating us in the market, and we've just begun to scratch the surface of what's possible. 
And Mel, I'll turn it back over to you for questions."

We think our customers are moving to hybrid cloud environment, which I think is indicative of the $0.5 billion that we did in our data next-generation data center switching portfolio this quarter. And so we're actually very comfortable with our portfolio. If you think about our U.S. commercial business and then our global commercial business, our U.S. commercial business was up 12%. And it is a good proxy of how our portfolio is playing in that space. And we firmly believe that if there was a significant difference in the transition of workloads to public cloud, we would sit there first. So we're very comfortable with our Enterprise strategy right now."

So it's part of what we're driving to offset the competitive pressures that we have naturally in the tech space. So I think it's definitely a good execution by the teams. The way that we make sure also that we're not doing a trade-off, like you mentioned, because we are driving for growth and profits, is we look at things like when rates, we look at things like obviously market share.

So from an FX perspective, us, like every other multinationals, are feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar. For us, it's a little more difficult to quantify because we sell 90% of our products in U.S. dollars. But I can tell you, when I look at the countries that we do sell in local currency, which for us is like Australia, Canada, parts of Japan, for those countries alone where I can't quantify, it was almost 2 points of just pure translation on our top line growth. So for the rest of our business that's sold outside the U.S., there is certainly impact. It's just hard for us to quantify it directly. So again, we try to see if we're getting less -- if the demand is under pressure by the number of deals that we have in the pipeline or things along those lines as well as if we see pressure from our sales teams to discount heavily. So what I'd say is yes, us like every other multi-multinational is feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar.

If you think about what happens in the data center as you've got the traditional data center switching architecture, and then you've got our computer platforms that we sell and then we have the next-generation data center switching architecture. And the historical architecture, we know, has been declining as customers transition. Our UCS business was up 24% this quarter, so we're very pleased with those results. And then if you look at the next-generation data center, that's the business that we said eclipsed $0.5 billion this quarter growing at 140%. So what I've said about our switching business is that in the second half of the year, we expect the inflection point between the next-generation volume and the historical generation to sort of -- we expect to hit that inflection point. I think you're seeing the next-generation switching in the data center continued to contribute to some of the improvement that you saw.

And it's driven by a couple of things, and we talked about this before. It is isolated largely to our -- within service revenue, the Service Provider segment, within there. So the Service Provider has been a headwind been for us up until the last quarter or so. So the model typically, it takes longer for services to feel the impact when the product side was down. Same way, it takes a little bit longer, a few quarters before they start to see it when the section, the product side comes up. So we are seeing some of that as well is just the Service Provider segment in general. They're going through a lot of transition as well. So that's a tough segment for us. But it's largely isolated for that. The only other piece I'll add to that is we are feeling very good about the outlook in services. If you look at our services deferred revenue, that went up 7% year-over-year this quarter, which is $600-plus million, almost $700 million. And that's the strongest growth we've seen on that metric for a while. So we feel good about more multi-year deals coming in and future revenue coming from that. But clearly, this quarter, at 1%, it's on the low end and isolated in the Service Provider section."

So they're very, very big quarters for us on the UCSF, on our data center of us, that's a big part of what's driving it. And conversely, Q2 and Q4 are typically higher. Now I would say again, again, we had very, very good execution across the board on gross margins and again, driven by the performance by the team on the productivity side. So again, that will continue to help. When I go to Q2 guidance, you picked right up on it. Q1 still had the set-top box business in it. In my guidance for Q2, I completely removed the set-top box business, which is why it's up a full point of our typical guidance of 61% to 62%. We're now up to 62% to 63% for that benefit. So just to remind you, when we got rid of that business, which we are working to close this quarter, we'll see a benefit of approximately 1 point on gross margin, about 0.5 point on operating margin rate and very negligible and EPS level of things falling through. So we're baking that in the guidance and since my guidance excludes that altogether. But overall, again, just attributed to the disciplined work on BCP on the productivity side as well as the sales teams being very disciplined on pricing."

And we also have some, as I said in the earlier comments, we also have some new introductions that'll be coming out in the next week or so. So you'll see that. So we feel pretty reasonably well about our routing performance over the coming quarters. From a security perspective, I think that the team has done a great job. They've integrated the source fire malware capabilities into our firewalls and into some of our routing platforms. So they've done the hard integration work. Last quarter, we added over 2,000 new amp customers, which is advanced malware solution. We now have over 8,000 customers there. The revenue grew 7%, but our deferred grew 31% as they've continued to transition the business to more of a software and subscription.

When I look at the amount of our revenue coming off the balance sheet on the product side, it continues to increase, and that's how we're driving all our business units. We continue to find those and build those solutions. I'd say Meraki is a good example and our Cloud Networking Group, where basically it's 1/3 of their business gets deferred the way they sell their solution. So we're going to see more and more of that as we go forward. And we'll see the benefit of that not only on more predictable revenue but also strong margins. Operating margin is to address that. Again, we had -- it was a great quarter for operating margin. I would say, again, we talked about the benefit we're seeing on gross margin. We are being disciplined to make the right trade-offs.

I guess I'm wondering have you hit kind of the bottom in some of the areas of the world? And the foreign exchange currency impact starts to kind of come off over time. So how big is the impact and what does it come off is the question."

So what I was referencing -- so again, I think, for sure, the impact that we can see on the countries where we sell in local currency, which is only a few countries, is about 2 points, right? So for all the other countries, including the emerging markets and Europe, it's hard for us, because we sell in dollars, to really quantify the impact, but there is certainly an impact on-demand. You're right about Brazil and Russia. They have been challenged for some time. I think the growth in our emerging being up 11% is largely driven by the strength of India and Mexico, which have been very strong for the last 5 quarters. And now adding on to that, China was having broad-based strength is really driving that back up. If I back out those -- the BRIC countries, right, the rest of the emerging markets are, I would say, not really growing. They're flattish to up to 3% when I exclude the BRIC and countries because they are feeling the impact, I would say, of currency. And I think we're still the uncertainty with if the U.S. rate is interest rates, what that will further due to U.S. dollar strength. So it's tough to have a full view quantification of it, but we do think while there is the right state where they are today, it might get a little easier of a headwind as we move forward through the year. Now it's just I think the answer to the and the parts are feeling as well as in interest rates uncertainty going forward."

We grew our revenue 4% and delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 9%. We delivered very strong non-GAAP gross margins, and our non-GAAP operating margin was the best we've seen in over 9 years. 
I recognize that our Q2 guidance was -- that we just provided is below what the market had expected. In Q1, we saw lower-than-expected order growth, driven largely by uncertainty for macro and currency impacts, primarily outside the U.S. Despite these headwinds, I believe we are executing incredibly well in a challenging environment. 
Let me tell you simply how I see it. We had a great quarter, guided to solid growth in Q2 and feel good about our momentum and how we are positioned for the second half of the year. 
As I look at the big picture, I'm extremely pleased with the speed with which our teams are executing. We have a clear strategy and are confident that we are making the right transitions in our business, investing where we need to for future growth, profitability and market leadership. Specifically, we are accelerating our ability to deliver on the growth opportunities in front of us. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace. So far, in FY '16, we're seeing 25% increase in major new product introductions, and 3 of our internal startups brought solutions to market this quarter working with our key customers. These startups are bringing incredible technology from concept to delivery in under 12 months. Stay tuned next week for announcements around an additional project that we codeveloped with one of the world's largest web scale players. 
In this quarter alone, we closed 3 acquisitions, recently announced 4 new acquisitions and formed 3 new strategic partnerships. Partners like Apple, Inspur and Ericsson see Cisco as the market leader they want to work with to move faster and drive greater value to customers and the market. 
I believe we will see several points of growth from these partnerships over the next few years.
We are also aggressively driving our cloud businesses. We've always had a hybrid cloud strategy, and it is increasingly clear that every one of our customers want both public and private cloud capabilities in a hybrid cloud. 
On the public cloud side, Cisco is a leading provider of infrastructure to the web scale and SP customers as they build out their public cloud infrastructure as just one data point. Our business with the largest web scale players grew over 20% again this quarter. 
Within the enterprise, we are winning in private cloud and are focused on automating and driving public cloud economics across our customers' entire infrastructure. We saw this opportunity to drive 24% growth in UCS, and our next-generation data center switching portfolio, which is our 3K, 9K and ACI, is now at a $2 billion run rate, with over $500 million in revenue this quarter, growing over 140% year-over-year, with sequential growth of 26%. This performance is much stronger than that of our competitors who claim they are outpacing and outperforming us. 
And our own cloud services continue to grow well. WebEx, one of the largest enterprise SaaS applications in the world, grew revenue over 23% this quarter, and we continue to move more of our portfolio to cloud-based delivery models. 
As we deliver more of our portfolio and software and cloud models, we are driving consistent double-digit growth and deferred revenue. We saw software and subscription product deferred revenue up 36%. Security deferred revenue grew 31% as we sell next-generation firewall and threat defense software to our over 200,000 firewall customers. 
Our collaboration deferred revenue grew 18%, and our Meraki cloud networking business, where we deliver networking as-a-service, grew revenue over 60%. While we still have work to do across our portfolio, I'm incredibly pleased with our continued focus and speed of execution. We will continue to make the necessary strategic moves to drive our success.
Over the last quarter, I've spent hundreds of hours with our customers and partners around the world, and they have reaffirmed my confidence in our ability to execute against the opportunity in front of us. 
While the market continues to move at an accelerated pace, our customers know they must move with speed as they embark on their digital transitions. It's clear to me that they also understand the central and critical role that the network plays in that transition. And they are looking to us to be a strategic partner to drive their growth and build their digital organization, cities and countries. 
We are doing the right things to capitalize on this opportunity, and as I told our teams this past week, I have never been more optimistic. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials."
19691,309209051,902848,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2015",2015-11-12,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. Starting with our first pillar of delivering profitable growth.",1001,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with our first pillar of delivering profitable growth. We saw good top line growth in Q1 with $12.7 billion and total revenue up 4%. Product revenue grew 4%, with solid growth in switching, data center, wireless, security and collaborations. More specifically, in Q1, switching grew 5%. In addition to the 3K, 9K and ACI momentum of over 140%, we continue to see strength in the Catalyst business. 
Data Center grew 24%, demonstrating our continued market leadership. Wireless grew 7%, driven by the Meraki business. Security was up 7%, with deferred revenue growth of 31%. And collaboration grew 17%, with deferred revenue up 18%.  In total, deferred revenue had solid double-digit growth of 10%, with products deferred revenue up 16% and services up 7%. 
Product deferred revenue, driven by our subscription and software businesses, grew 36%. We do see the transition to subscription revenue accelerating, as I mentioned in the last earnings call. 
We did see routing decline 8%. We do expect routing revenue to return to growth due to timing of some large deals we saw in Q1. Services revenue grew 1%, largely driven by weakness in Service Provider. Product orders grew 3% with a book-to-bill below 1, which is in line with our typical Q1s but slightly lighter than we had expected. 
Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run our business, Americas grew 1%, EMEA grew 3% and APJC was up 9%. Total emerging markets grew a very solid 11%, with the BRICS plus Mexico accelerating to 21% growth. 
In terms of customer segment, Service Provider grew 6%. Enterprise declined 3% based on the uncertainty from macro challenges, consistent with what others are seeing. Commercial grew 7%, which signals to us the broad strength of our portfolio. Public Sector was flat. 
From a profitability perspective, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.48. Q1 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion. 
We drove the strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 62.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.2%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were well-controlled at 32.7% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 30.5%. 
We are ensuring we make the right investment and divestment decisions through disciplined portfolio management. 
Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software, services and security. 
We've been very active from an M&A perspective on aligning our investments to key growth areas. We closed 3 acquisitions in Q1 with OpenDNS and Pawaa in software and security and MaintenanceNet in services. We also announced the acquisitions of Portcullis and Lancope in security, ParStream in data and analytics and 1 Mainstream in cloud-based video. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the investment of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas. 
Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value. In Q1, we increased operating cash flow 11% to $2.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $59.1 billion, with $5 billion available in the U.S. And we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.1 billion of dividends. The total share returned to shareholders represents a return of 91% of our free cash flow, more than consistent with our commitment to shareholders of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually. 
Overall, Q1 was a strong quarter. As you review the financials, you see good top line growth, record profitability and operating leverage, a very strong balance sheet with growth in deferred revenue and strong cash generation. We executed well, consistent with our business and financial strategy. 
Now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. As a reminder, in Q4, we announced an agreement to sell that client premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business to Technicolor. The transaction is currently going through regulatory approval, and we are working to close it during the second quarter. In order to provide a clear view of our continuing expected financial performance, we have normalized our second quarter guidance to exclude the CPE business for both Q2 fiscal year '16 and Q2 fiscal year '15. We've provided historical financial information for the CPE business in the slides that accompany this call. 
So now on to our Q2 guidance. We are executing very well in a challenging global environment but did see the macro challenges driving uncertainty that impacted our Q1 order growth. As a result, the guidance for Q2, excluding the CPE businesses, is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of 0% to 2% year-over-year; we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62% to 63%; the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%; and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%. 
The tax rate does not include any impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.55. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.14. Further details related to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call."

We are moving incredibly fast and doing all the right things to drive our growth and strategic relevance.  We expect the result of these moves will start showing up in the coming quarters. 
Every one of our customers, established industry leaders and disruptive challengers, is focused on how they manage, automate and secure the explosion of connections and data across their digital organization. Our portfolio has never been stronger, more relevant and more strategic. And we're hearing this directly from our customers and our partners. The opportunity is ours to capitalize on. 
We have a clear vision and strategy and are well very well.

And so we're actually very comfortable with our portfolio. If you think about our U.S. commercial business and then our global commercial business, our U.S. commercial business was up 12%. And it is a good proxy of how our portfolio is playing in that space. And we firmly believe that if there was a significant difference in the transition of workloads to public clouds, we would see it there first.

When we saw the upside from a year-over-year perspective here, we just had a really, really strong productivity this quarter in gross margin on the product side that drove a lot of the benefit. And again, it's what the engineering teams are working on. It's what supply chain is driving. So it's part of what we're driving to offset the competitive pressures that we have naturally in the tech space. So I'd say it's definitely a good execution by the teams.

So from an FX perspective, us, like every other multinationals, are feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar.

But I can tell you, when I look at the countries that we do sell in local currency, which for us is like Australia, Canada, parts of Japan, for those countries alone where I can't quantify it, it was almost 2 points of just pure translation on our top line growth. So for the rest of the -- of our business that's sold outside the U.S., there is certainly impact. It's just hard for us to quantify it directly. So again, we try to see if we're getting less -- if the demand is under pressure by the number of deals that we have in the pipeline or things along those lines, as well as if we see pressure from our sales teams to discount heavily. So what I'd say is yes, us, like every other multinational, is feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollars.

The switching, I think the biggest thing that I've talked about over the last few months is that we've been going through this transition of the next-generation data center. If you think about what happens in the data center as you've got the traditional data center switching architecture and then you've got our compute platforms that we sell, and then we have the next-generation data center switching architecture and the historical architecture we know has been declining as customers transition. Our UCS business was up 24% this quarter, so we're very pleased with those results. And then if you look at the next-generation data center, that's the business that we said eclipsed $0.5 billion this quarter, growing at 140%. So what I've said about our switching business is that in the second half of the year, we expect the inflection point between the next-generation volume and the historical generation to sort of -- we expect to hit that inflection point. So I think you're seeing that next-generation switching in the data center continued to contribute to some of the improvement that you saw.

And it's driven by a couple of things, and we've talked about this before. It is isolated largely to our -- within service revenue, the Service Provider segment, within there. So the Service Provider has been a headwind been for us up until the last quarter or so. So the model, typically, it takes longer for services to feel the impact when the product side goes down. Same way, it takes a little bit longer, a few quarters, before they start to see it when the section, the product side comes up. So we are seeing some of that, as well as just the Service Provider segment in general. They're going through a lot of transition as well. So that's a tough segment for us. But it's largely isolated to that. The only other piece I'll add to that is we are feeling very good about the outlook in services. If you look at our services deferred revenue, that went up 7% year-over-year this quarter, which is $600-plus million, almost $700 million. And that's the strongest growth we've seen on that metric for a while. So we feel good about more multi-year deals coming in and future revenue coming from that. But clearly, this quarter, at 1%, it's on the low end and isolated in the Service Provider section."

So they're very, very big quarters for us on the UCS side, on our data center business, so that's a big part of what's driving it. So -- and conversely, Q2s and Q4s are typically higher. Now I would say, again, we had very, very good execution across the board on gross margins, and again, driven by the performance by the teams on the productivity side. So again, that will continue to help. When I go to Q2 guidance, you picked right up on it. Q1 still had the set-top box business in it. In my guidance for Q2, I completely removed the set-top box business, which is why it's up a full point of our typical guidance of 61% to 62%. We're now up to 62% to 63% for that benefit. So just to remind you, when we get rid of that business, which we are working to close this quarter, we'll see a benefit of approximately 1 point on gross margin, about 0.5 point on operating margin rate and very negligible at the EPS level of things falling through. So we're baking that in the guidance since my guidance excludes that altogether. But overall, again, I just attribute it to the disciplined work on VCP [ph] on the productivity side as well as the sales teams being very disciplined on pricing."

So we feel pretty reasonably well about our routing performance over the coming quarters. From a security perspective, I think that the team has done a great job. They've integrated the source fire malware capabilities into it -- into our firewalls and into some of our routing platforms. So they've done the hard integration work. Last quarter, we added over 2,000 new AMP customers, which is the advanced malware solution. We now have over 8,000 customers there. The revenue grew 7%, but our deferred grew 31% as they've continued to transition the business to more of a software and subscription.

I'd say Meraki is a good example in our Cloud Networking Group, where basically it's 1/3 of their business gets deferred the way they sell their solution. So we're going to see more and more of that as we go forward. And we'll see the benefit of that, not only on more predictable revenue but also strong margins.

They see workloads that make tremendous sense to be in the public cloud. And then their mission-critical, high-performance applications that they will continue to run in a private cloud. And we believe that we can provide the bridge for those customers. And I think if you look at our UCS growth and you look at our next-gen data center growth, that would suggest customers are still building out data centers and still building out private public cloud to take advantage of the requirements they have in high-performance applications, security, mission-critical nature. So we think it's going to be both. And we have a strategy that not only is focused on providing the best infrastructure that we can to those public and service providers who are providing web and cloud services as well as the private cloud as well as the elements of our portfolio where it makes sense to be delivered as a cloud service. We'll continue to make those moves like we have with Meraki as well as security as well as collaboration."

So in the campus environment, we've seen several drivers over the last few quarters. This whole move to the Internet of Things and the connectivity of more and more devices, some of which are connected hardwired, others which are just increasing the wireless spectrum and the bandwidth required, the transition in the wireless access to higher speeds like 80211ac as well as the strength we've seen in our video endpoint business also translates through to, in many cases, refreshes of the networking infrastructure. And then finally, I think we see customers who are trying to beef up their security and are looking at some of the features that we can build into our campus platforms to increase their security. So those are some of the drivers that we see there. When I look at the data center, I think, frankly, the teams just built an incredible architecture. And it is built to really lower the operating costs and increase our customers' ability to implement policy in the data center in an automated way. I think they've also built incredible high-performance platforms and have given the customer the choice of both merchant as well as high-performance ASICs. And I think that the customers are seeing it. In the 9K, we added another 900 customers in the quarter. And we're now over 5,000 customers with our Nexus 9K and it's the fastest-ramping data center product that we've ever had. So I think it's a testament to what the teams have built."

You're right about Brazil and Russia. They have been challenged for some time. I think the growth in our emerging, being up 11%, is largely driven by the strength of India and Mexico, which have been very strong for the last 5 quarters. And now, adding on to that, China was having broad-based strength is really driving that back up. If I back out those -- the BRIC countries, right, the rest of the emerging markets are, I would say, not really growing. They're flattish to up to 3% when I exclude the BRIC countries because they are feeling the impact, I would say, of currency. And I think there is still the uncertainty with if the U.S. rates, its interest rates, what that will further do to U.S. dollar strength. So it's tough to have the full view quantification of it, but we do think while there -- if the rate stayed where they are today, it might get a little easier of a headwind as we move forward through the year.

We grew our revenue 4% and delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 9%. We delivered very strong non-GAAP gross margins, and our non-GAAP operating margin was the best we've seen in over 9 years. 
I recognize that our Q2 guidance was -- that we just provided is below what the market had expected. In Q1, we saw lower-than-expected order growth, driven largely by uncertainty for macro and currency impacts, primarily outside the U.S. Despite these headwinds, I believe we are executing incredibly well in a challenging environment. 
Let me tell you simply how I see it. We had a great quarter, guided to solid growth in Q2 and feel good about our momentum and how we are positioned for the second half of the year. 
As I look at the big picture, I'm extremely pleased with the speed with which our teams are executing. We have a clear strategy and are confident that we are making the right transitions in our business, investing where we need to for future growth, profitability and market leadership. Specifically, we are accelerating our ability to deliver on the growth opportunities in front of us. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace. So far, in FY '16, we're seeing 25% increase in major new product introductions, and 3 of our internal startups brought solutions to market this quarter working with our key customers. These startups are bringing incredible technology from concept to delivery in under 12 months. Stay tuned next week for announcements around an additional project that we codeveloped with one of the world's largest web scale players. 
In this quarter alone, we closed 3 acquisitions, recently announced 4 new acquisitions and formed 3 new strategic partnerships. Partners like Apple, Inspur and Ericsson see Cisco as the market leader they want to work with to move faster and drive greater value to customers and the market. 
I believe we will see several points of growth from these partnerships over the next few years.
We are also aggressively driving our cloud businesses. We've always had a hybrid cloud strategy, and it is increasingly clear that every one of our customers want both public and private cloud capabilities in a hybrid cloud. 
On the public cloud side, Cisco is a leading provider of infrastructure to the web scale and SP customers as they build out their public cloud infrastructure as just one data point. Our business with the largest web scale players grew over 20% again this quarter. 
Within the enterprise, we are winning in private cloud and are focused on automating and driving public cloud economics across our customers' entire infrastructure. We saw this opportunity to drive 24% growth in UCS, and our next-generation data center switching portfolio, which is our 3K, 9K and ACI, is now at a $2 billion run rate, with over $500 million in revenue this quarter, growing over 140% year-over-year, with sequential growth of 26%. This performance is much stronger than that of our competitors who claim they are outpacing and outperforming us. 
And our own cloud services continue to grow well. WebEx, one of the largest enterprise SaaS applications in the world, grew revenue over 23% this quarter, and we continue to move more of our portfolio to cloud-based delivery models. 
As we deliver more of our portfolio and software and cloud models, we are driving consistent double-digit growth and deferred revenue. We saw software and subscription product deferred revenue up 36%. Security deferred revenue grew 31% as we sell next-generation firewall and threat defense software to our over 200,000 firewall customers. 
Our collaboration deferred revenue grew 18%, and our Meraki cloud networking business, where we deliver networking as-a-service, grew revenue over 60%. While we still have work to do across our portfolio, I'm incredibly pleased with our continued focus and speed of execution. We will continue to make the necessary strategic moves to drive our success.
Over the last quarter, I've spent hundreds of hours with our customers and partners around the world, and they have reaffirmed my confidence in our ability to execute against the opportunity in front of us. 
While the market continues to move at an accelerated pace, our customers know they must move with speed as they embark on their digital transitions. It's clear to me that they also understand the central and critical role that the network plays in that transition. And they are looking to us to be a strategic partner to drive their growth and build their digital organization, cities and countries. 
We are doing the right things to capitalize on this opportunity, and as I told our teams this past week, I have never been more optimistic. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials."

I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. Starting with our first pillar of delivering profitable growth.",1001,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with our first pillar of delivering profitable growth. We saw good top line growth in Q1 with $12.7 billion and total revenue up 4%. Product revenue grew 4%, with solid growth in switching, data center, wireless, security and collaborations. More specifically, in Q1, switching grew 5%. In addition to the 3K, 9K and ACI momentum of over 140%, we continue to see strength in the Catalyst business. 
Data Center grew 24%, demonstrating our continued market leadership. Wireless grew 7%, driven by the Meraki business. Security was up 7%, with deferred revenue growth of 31%. And collaboration grew 17%, with deferred revenue up 18%.  In total, deferred revenue had solid double-digit growth of 10%, with products deferred revenue up 16% and services up 7%. 
Product deferred revenue, driven by our subscription and software businesses, grew 36%. We do see the transition to subscription revenue accelerating, as I mentioned in the last earnings call. 
We did see routing decline 8%. We do expect routing revenue to return to growth due to timing of some large deals we saw in Q1. Services revenue grew 1%, largely driven by weakness in Service Provider. Product orders grew 3% with a book-to-bill below 1, which is in line with our typical Q1s but slightly lighter than we had expected. 
Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run our business, Americas grew 1%, EMEA grew 3% and APJC was up 9%. Total emerging markets grew a very solid 11%, with the BRICS plus Mexico accelerating to 21% growth. 
In terms of customer segment, Service Provider grew 6%. Enterprise declined 3% based on the uncertainty from macro challenges, consistent with what others are seeing. Commercial grew 7%, which signals to us the broad strength of our portfolio. Public Sector was flat. 
From a profitability perspective, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.48. Q1 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion. 
We drove the strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 62.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.2%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were well-controlled at 32.7% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 30.5%. 
We are ensuring we make the right investment and divestment decisions through disciplined portfolio management. 
Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software, services and security. 
We've been very active from an M&A perspective on aligning our investments to key growth areas. We closed 3 acquisitions in Q1 with OpenDNS and Pawaa in software and security and MaintenanceNet in services. We also announced the acquisitions of Portcullis and Lancope in security, ParStream in data and analytics and 1 Mainstream in cloud-based video. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the investment of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas. 
Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value. In Q1, we increased operating cash flow 11% to $2.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $59.1 billion, with $5 billion available in the U.S. And we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.1 billion of dividends. The total share returned to shareholders represents a return of 91% of our free cash flow, more than consistent with our commitment to shareholders of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually. 
Overall, Q1 was a strong quarter. As you review the financials, you see good top line growth, record profitability and operating leverage, a very strong balance sheet with growth in deferred revenue and strong cash generation. We executed well, consistent with our business and financial strategy. 
Now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. As a reminder, in Q4, we announced an agreement to sell that client premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business to Technicolor. The transaction is currently going through regulatory approval, and we are working to close it during the second quarter. In order to provide a clear view of our continuing expected financial performance, we have normalized our second quarter guidance to exclude the CPE business for both Q2 fiscal year '16 and Q2 fiscal year '15. We've provided historical financial information for the CPE business in the slides that accompany this call. 
So now on to our Q2 guidance. We are executing very well in a challenging global environment but did see the macro challenges driving uncertainty that impacted our Q1 order growth. As a result, the guidance for Q2, excluding the CPE businesses, is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of 0% to 2% year-over-year; we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62% to 63%; the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%; and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%. 
The tax rate does not include any impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.55. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.14. Further details related to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call."

So as I look back at the last 90 days in my first quarter, I am more optimistic than ever about Cisco's future. 
Yes, the guidance we just gave for Q2 is lower than what the market had expected, and I don't take that lightly. But for me, nothing has changed in how I feel about the business. We are moving incredibly fast and doing all the right things to drive our growth and strategic relevance.  We expect the result of these moves will start showing up in the coming quarters. 
Every one of our customers, established industry leaders and disruptive challengers, is focused on how they manage, automate and secure the explosion of connections and data across their digital organization. Our portfolio has never been stronger, more relevant and more strategic. And we're hearing this directly from our customers and our partners. The opportunity is ours to capitalize on. 
We have a clear vision and strategy and are well very well. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace, acquiring strategic assets, codeveloping with our customers and building a new set of strategic partnerships. I believe our speed and execution are truly differentiating us in the market, and we've just begun to scratch the surface of what's possible. 
And Mel, I'll turn it back to you for questions."

And so we're actually very comfortable with our portfolio. If you think about our U.S. commercial business and then our global commercial business, our U.S. commercial business was up 12%.

And again, it's what the engineering teams are working on. It's what supply chain is driving. So it's part of what we're driving to offset the competitive pressures that we have naturally in the tech space. So I'd say it's definitely a good execution by the teams. The way that we make sure also that we're not doing a trade-off, like you mentioned, because we are driving for growth and profits, is we look at things like win rates, we look at things like, obviously, market share.

So from an FX perspective, us, like every other multinationals, are feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar. For us, it's a little more difficult to quantify because we sell 90% of our products in U.S. dollars. But I can tell you, when I look at the countries that we do sell in local currency, which for us is like Australia, Canada, parts of Japan, for those countries alone where I can quantify it, it was almost 2 points of just pure translation on our top line growth. So for the rest of the -- of our business that's sold outside the U.S., there is certainly impact. It's just hard for us to quantify it directly. So again, we try to see if we're getting less -- if the demand is under pressure by the number of deals that we have in the pipeline or things along those lines, as well as if we see pressure from our sales teams to discount heavily. So what I'd say is yes, us, like every other multinational, is feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollars. But I think our sales teams are executing extremely well through that and being able to sell the value of our solutions despite that.

If you think about what happens in the data center as you've got the traditional data center switching architecture and then you've got our compute platforms that we sell, and then we have the next-generation data center switching architecture and the historical architecture we know has been declining as customers transition. Our UCS business was up 24% this quarter, so we're very pleased with those results. And then if you look at the next-generation data center, that's the business that we said eclipsed $0.5 billion this quarter, growing at 140%. So what I've said about our switching business is that in the second half of the year, we expect the inflection point between the next-generation volume and the historical generation to sort of -- we expect to hit that inflection point. So I think you're seeing that next-generation switching in the data center continued to contribute to some of the improvement that you saw.

And it's driven by a couple of things, and we've talked about this before. It is isolated largely to our -- within service revenue, the Service Provider segment, within there. So the Service Provider has been a headwind been for us up until the last quarter or so. So the model, typically, it takes longer for services to feel the impact when the product side goes down. Same way, it takes a little bit longer, a few quarters, before they start to see it when the section, the product side comes up. So we are seeing some of that, as well as just the Service Provider segment in general. They're going through a lot of transition as well. So that's a tough segment for us. But it's largely isolated to that. The only other piece I'll add to that is we are feeling very good about the outlook in services. If you look at our services deferred revenue, that went up 7% year-over-year this quarter, which is $600-plus million, almost $700 million. And that's the strongest growth we've seen on that metric for a while. So we feel good about more multi-year deals coming in and future revenue coming from that.

Now I would say, again, we had very, very good execution across the board on gross margins, and again, driven by the performance by the teams on the productivity side. So again, that will continue to help. When I go to Q2 guidance, you picked right up on it. Q1 still had the set-top box business in it. In my guidance for Q2, I completely removed the set-top box business, which is why it's up a full point of our typical guidance of 61% to 62%. We're now up to 62% to 63% for that benefit. So just to remind you, when we get rid of that business, which we are working to close this quarter, we'll see a benefit of approximately 1 point on gross margin, about 0.5 point on operating margin rate and very negligible at the EPS level of things falling through. So we're baking that in the guidance since my guidance excludes that altogether. But overall, again, I just attribute it to the disciplined work on VCP [ph] on the productivity side as well as the sales teams being very disciplined on pricing."

And then my second question is related -- somewhat related, just trying to get a sense for how we should think about security. I know that, that's been a sector or segment that's been growing slower than the market. It's clearly a point of emphasis for Cisco. Just wondering how we should think about that and your efforts starting to manifest themselves."

On the routing side, James, you nailed it, it's a timing issue. We had good order growth. Our new routing platforms, the new platform that we've introduced were up in triple digits again from an orders perspective. So we do expect that, that will bounce back. And we also have some, as I said in the earlier comments, we also have some new introductions that'll be coming out in the next week or so. So you'll see that. So we feel pretty reasonably well about our routing performance over the coming quarters. From a security perspective, I think that the team has done a great job. They've integrated the source fire malware capabilities into it -- into our firewalls and into some of our routing platforms. So they've done the hard integration work. Last quarter, we added over 2,000 new AMP customers, which is the advanced malware solution. We now have over 8,000 customers there. The revenue grew 7%, but our deferred grew 31% as they've continued to transition the business to more of a software and subscription. And the team's pretty confident that in the second half of the year, we can be back in the mid- to high teens from a revenue growth in security."

When I look at the amount of our revenue coming off the balance sheet on the product side, it continues to increase, and that's how we're driving all our business units, to continue to find those and build those solutions. I'd say Meraki is a good example in our Cloud Networking Group, where basically it's 1/3 of their business gets deferred the way they sell their solution. So we're going to see more and more of that as we go forward. And we'll see the benefit of that, not only on more predictable revenue but also strong margins. I'd say on the operating margins, to address that. Again, we had -- it was a great quarter for operating margins. I would say, again, we talked about the benefit we're seeing on gross margins. We are being disciplined to make the right trade-offs. We're going to fluctuate always between quarters, but we are, again, driving for that profitable growth, and we are looking relentlessly for more efficiencies so we can fund the investments into the internal R&D and go-to-market."

Likewise, in India, where we've been focused on a lot of country digitization efforts there with the Prime Minister and many of the ministries. And they really see the value of technology and what it can do for their country. It, too, was up over 40%. Then when you look at the rest of Asia, it was a real challenge. I believe it was negative 8% for the rest. And we did see some uncertainty creep in relative to those countries, particularly who had trading relationships with China.

So in the campus environment, we've seen several drivers over the last few quarters. This whole move to the Internet of Things and the connectivity of more and more devices, some of which are connected hardwired, others which are just increasing the wireless spectrum and the bandwidth required, the transition in the wireless access to higher speeds like 80211ac as well as the strength we've seen in our video endpoint business also translates through to, in many cases, refreshes of the networking infrastructure. And then finally, I think we see customers who are trying to beef up their security and are looking at some of the features that we can build into our campus platforms to increase their security. So those are some of the drivers that we see there. When I look at the data center, I think, frankly, the teams have just built an incredible architecture. And it is built to really lower the operating costs and increase our customers' ability to implement policy in the data center in an automated way. I think they've also built incredible high-performance platforms and have given the customer the choice of both merchant as well as high-performance ASICs.

You're right about Brazil and Russia. They have been challenged for some time. I think the growth in our emerging, being up 11%, is largely driven by the strength of India and Mexico, which have been very strong for the last 5 quarters. And now, adding on to that, China was having broad-based strength is really driving that back up. If I back out those -- the BRICM countries, right, the rest of the emerging markets are, I would say, not really growing. They're flattish to up to 3% when I exclude the BRICM countries because they are feeling the impact, I would say, of currency. And I think there is still the uncertainty with if the U.S. rates, its interest rates, what that will further do to U.S. dollar strength. So it's tough to have the full view quantification of it, but we do think while there -- if the rate stayed where they are today, it might get a little easier of a headwind as we move forward through the year.
