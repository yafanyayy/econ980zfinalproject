Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we walk through the results in the quarter, I'd like to reflect on the milestones that we achieved in 2014.To start, turning to Slide 3. We leveraged significant",1336,"Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we walk through the results in the quarter, I'd like to reflect on the milestones that we achieved in 2014.
To start, turning to Slide 3. We leveraged significant market momentum to deliver another strong year of financial results, generating $2.44 billion of revenue, up 14% year-over-year, and over $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA or 46% margin and growing AFFO 12% to $762 million.
Second, we established Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud by partnering with an all-start list of cloud providers including , Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft, and won business from a host of enterprises who are taking advantage of their to implement fiber cloud architectures at Equinix. We have continue to innovate and enhance our offer set to help transform enterprise IT, launching 2 new solutions in 2014, Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange.
The traction we are seeing is very compelling as hundreds of customers are now using these solutions to improve network and enterprise application performance as well as accelerating cloud and option.
Third, we expanded our global platform, completing 10 major IBX expansions in 2014, including projects in Amsterdam, , SÃ£o Paulo, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. We are successfully creating value over the long term through our development pipeline, achieving attractive returns that help the yield on stabilized assets with our premium value proposition.
Given the market strength, we are continuing to grow our presence in core markets, and in the first half of this year, we are opening 5 new IBXs in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto as well as a new metro in Melbourne, Australia.
Fourth, we extended our position as the global interconnection leader, with interconnection revenue continuing to outpace overall revenue, growing 16% year-over-year and further demonstrating the strength of our ecosystems. Customers interconnecting across Platform Equinix resulted in 18,500 new cross connects in 2014, with a notable uptick in the latter half of the year, driven by strong growth in the network and acceleration of private connections to the cloud.
Our digital exchanges also saw a sizable increase in both traffic and sales, adding approximately 600 ports in 2014, about 2.5x more as than the prior year.
And finally, we successfully began operating as a REIT on January 1 and are very pleased to announce our first quarterly dividend program. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, including raising and refinancing our high-yield notes and senior debt in the fourth quarter and feel very good about our liquidity position and capital structure. This strategic and operational flexibility will allow for continued reinvestment in our business and new market development along with distributions to our shareholders on a quarterly basis.
As we enter 2015, we see continued momentum in our core business and are well positioned to execute on emerging growth opportunities by expanding our rest of market and further enhancing our solutions portfolio.
As applications become increasingly interactive, solving conflicts interconnection is mission-critical for today's business. We believe our global scale as well as our network and cloud puts us in a unique position to solve these challenges. Today we have over 4,800 customers and expect to significantly expand our customer base over the next several years as Platform Equinix becomes increasingly relevant to a larger universe of buyers.
Now turning to the quarter. We delivered record growth and net bookings driven by strong performance across all 3 regions, solid new customer additions and continued expansion of our cloud ecosystem. An increase in global deployment and accelerated interconnection growth are helping contribute to firm and reduces churn. We continue to see customers expand their geographic reach across Platform Equinix, and today 67% of recurring revenues across multiple regions, up from 63% last year, and 81% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 79% last year.
Now let me share the highlights of our industry vertical performance this past quarter. Our network vertical delivered steady growth as carriers upgrade core code and infrastructure to support exponential traffic growth in new services, and several of our most strategic customers begin to bundle Equinix to their custom-enterprise solutions. Network interconnection also experienced strong growth as both connections to and from our network customers grew more than 20% year-over-year. Emerging demand for mobile platforms is generating new business, and wins in this vertical include ee, the UK's largest 4G operator, and True Phone, a global network operator. Content and digital media delivered a record quarter with healthy demand from large content players and rapid growth in our advertising subsegment, which is gaining traction as real-time ad placement becomes a cornerstone of the company's advertising strategy.
Private option is on the rise among content media companies as they leverage the scaling advantages offered by cloud and seek the low-latency to deliver the highest quality user experience. For example, global publishing company recently chose to Microsoft Azure through Equinix Cloud Exchange inside our London IBX in order to achieve levels of security and latency with improved operational resilience and flexibility.
Turning to financial services. We saw steady growth and continued progress in diversifying our financial services business across insurance, retail banking and digital payments and processing. Our 5 largest financial deals of the quarter came from these sectors, including a top 15 global retail bank, a top 5 global insurance firm and the third largest global payment and analytics provider. Electronic payments, in particular is an area where we have been increasingly focused, and we see potential for a digital commerce ecosystem to emerge spanning multiple industries. We have captured over 50 customers in the digital commerce space, including , a global payments technology provider, leveraging Equinix's network density and cloud connectivity to enable global payments for merchants from anywhere in the world.
Turning to our cloud and enterprise verticals. The enterprise shift from centralized in-house IT infrastructure to distributed hybrid and public cloud architectures is driving an incremental and transformational opportunity that we expect to be Equinix top growth over the next several years. In the fourth quarter, cloud and IT services again delivered record booking, and we now have over 1,250 cloud and IT service companies driving 27% of our revenues. Expansions on AWS, Oracle, Microsoft and systems drove strong momentum in the quarter, and we saw an uptick in larger footprint deals as the size of deployment for public and private cloud access nodes have expanded given the rapid growth in this market.
Cloud service providers continue to chose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment, cutting-edge application performance and unmatched reliability. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our intelligent switching platform that enables companies to connect directly and securely to multiple cloud and network providers, continues to scale and is now live in 19 markets globally. Over 100 companies, enterprises, networks and cloud service providers have joined the Equinix Cloud Exchange and new wins include Google, IBM Software, Fusion Apps as well as, and Telecom Italia. Google and IBM software are 2 important platform wins that enhance the cloud ecosystem. Equinix will offer performance to Google cloud platform in 15 markets and to the IBM Software platform in 9 markets this year.
On the enterprise side, as leading companies around the globe operate increasingly interconnected and on-demand business models, we are experiencing significant momentum in the enterprise market. Over 100 customers have deployed Performance Hub, our targeted solution that allows customers to deploy IT resources closer to the user population and provide secure high-bandwidth connectivity to a variety of networks in cloud. This distributed interconnection data center computing allowed provide significant benefits in both application and network performance. Enterprise wins include General Electric as well as GP Strategies, a management consulting and engineering services firm, and Metso, a leading process provider for mining and oil and gas.
So let me stop here and turn the call over to Keith to provide some deeper results -- deeper details of the results in the quarter."

Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone.To start, I'd like to first review some of our 2014 highlights and then I'll turn to our fourth quarter performance.We reported revenues of $2.44 billion, representing an almost 14% [ph] year-over-y",2379,"Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone.
To start, I'd like to first review some of our 2014 highlights and then I'll turn to our fourth quarter performance.
We reported revenues of $2.44 billion, representing an almost 14% [ph] year-over-year growth rate. All 3 regions delivered better than expectation, with EMEA and Asia-Pacific showing reported growth of 21% and 19%, respectively, while the Americas region produced greater-than-expected growth of 9% on its much larger base.
We continue to balance margin expectation with a reinvestment in the business to drive our future growth. Our gross profit margin was 51% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% after taking into consideration significant investment and expansion activities across the regions as well as directing approximately $30 million in operating expenses to fund new product innovations such as Cloud Exchange and Performance Hub.
Also, in 2014, we continue to scale our go-to-market efforts to better position ourselves to attract the enterprise customer. Despite these investments, our margins remained stable, and we continue to target a longer-term objective of achieving 50% adjusted EBITDA margins or better.
We continue to focus on the balance sheet and find ways to optimize our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we refreshed our debt structure and secured $2.75 billion of new financing. This puts us in a great position to fund both our existing and new initiatives and invest in the development pipeline and fund our quarterly dividend.
So let me now turn to Slide 4 as I'd like to highlight how we allocated the resources in 2014. First, we generated approximately $709 million in adjusted cash from operations and then reinvested $660 million of this cash into development and other project that have consistently high levels of return, including our newly opened Melbourne and Singapore IBXs. We now have 103 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint in the world. we purchased the remaining shares of in Brazil and now own 100% of this important South American asset.
Also, we continue to increase the number of [indiscernible] owned and developed for our current and our future Melbourne IBXs. And finally, we repurchased 298 million of Equinix stock in 2014 and completed a 416 million [ph] special distribution for stockholders, which included $83 million in cash.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Simply put, it was another outstanding quarter for the Equinix team. Our strategy continues to deliver better-than-expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record growth and net bookings, and our quarterly key metrics remained solid, including MRR per cabinet, especially on an FX basis, and net cabinets billing. Also, our interconnection were again outstanding as we added 5,600 net cross connects and 130 [ph] exchange ports this quarter alone.
As depicted on Slide 5, global Q4 revenues were $638.1 million, our 48th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, up 3% quarter-on-quarter and up 13% [ph] over the same period last year.
Our overperformance was due to higher gross bookings, more in MRR turn and continued custom sales order activity. Our Q4 revenue performance net of our FX hedges absorbs an $8.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $1 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Currency volatility against all of our operating currencies cause significant FX headwinds this quarter and meaningfully affected our 2015 guidance. Our largest exposure to FX movements related to the weakening of the Brazilian real, the British pound and the euro. For 2015, we've layered in new hedges approximating 80% coverage against our EMEA operating currencies for the full year. beside the negative FX impact on our 2015 guidance, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has created a $100 million FX headwind against revenues and a $47 million headwind against our adjusted EBITDA.
G&A expenses increased $147.8 million for the quarter, higher than guidance, primarily due to the December change in our commission practices where our sales reps will now earn their sales commission when their order is booked versus when the order is billed. This change was made to better align our comp practices with the market and to enable us to better track these costs as we measure our business performance. As a result, we accelerated on a onetime basis $7 million of sales commission cost into the fourth quarter. This was not included in our prior guidance.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $294.4 million, at the top end of our guidance range and up 12% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $1.1 million currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $3.4 million net positive impact when compared to the FX guidance rates.
In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $355.1 million. Consistent with our comments from the last earnings call, a large portion of this write-off at the deferred tax assets totaling $324 million as we formalized our conversion to a REIT. Also, we recorded a $106 million loss on debt extinguishment related to our refinancing efforts.
Our Q4 operating decreased over the prior quarter to $202.3 million, largely due to increased cash interest and taxes paid. Also, our DSOs improved 2 days to 37 days. Our AFFO for the year was $761.7 million, higher than our expectations mainly due to lower-than-expected recurring CapEx and cash taxes.
MRR churn was better than anticipated at 1.9%, the second quarter in a row where we're below the 2% and we believe reflects some level of stabilization of this key metric. For the full year 2015, we expect our MRR churn rate to range between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, although we do expect the average to be at the lower end of this range.
Now moving on to our comments on REIT. Well, we've officially begun operating as a REIT as of January 1, 2015 which is a significant and exciting for the company. That said, we give you a perspective on how we structured our REIT assets with place a majority of our U.S. and European assets along with our Japanese assets under the qualified REIT structure or QRS. With the rest of Asia, Brazil and Canada placed in our TRS or taxable REIT structure. This important to note taxable income from our QRS businesses is what drives our dividend payout requirement. In addition, while we don't have yet our, we continue to expect to receive a favorable PLR in 2015.
On Slide 6, we summarized our expected REIT cash cost and taxes. we expect our second special distribution to range between $580 million and $680 million to be paid in Q4 in 2015. Our REIT cash should approximate $12 million in 2015, including 2 million of onetime cost finalized REIT structure.
And finally, we expect our effective worldwide tax rate, excluding REIT-related cash taxes to range between 10% and 15% in 2015, although this range may narrow as we continue to review our tax operating structure.
Turning to Slide 7, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong quarter, delivering its second highest with record cross connects additions. These results clearly show the benefits from our core strategy. The Americas revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter and 10% over that same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis.
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 5% over the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. America adjusted EBITDA margin was 47% for the quarter, a step up over the prior quarter due to lower seasonal utility expenses. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $7 million to integrate our ALOG business.
Americas [indiscernible] billing increased by 500 [ph] in the quarter, lower than last quarter, largely due to timing of installations. We added a record 3,500 net cross connects and 95 exchange ports in Q4, highlighting the strong demand  for our Americas digital exchanges.
With respect to region's new builds, we're expanding our Dallas 2 IBX in the market, which is the primary interconnection in the Dallas market.
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 8. EMEA delivered a strong quarter with record gross bookings, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses. Revenues were up 6% quarter-on-quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our EMEA business continues to capture market share, growing twice as fast as the regional competitors. Also, we'd like to highlight the improved German performance throughout the year, the result of new leadership, better execution and renewed focus across our German team.
Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 1% over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased slightly to 42% due to one-off costs in the fourth quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues increased 2% over prior quarter and up 29% over the same quarter last year and represents 9% of the region's recurring revenues. We added 1,200 net in the quarter and EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 600.
Moving to expansion opportunities. The [indiscernible] performed very well in 2014, and we've seen a substantial increase in our rate compared to the prior year. To support this were expanding with our Frankfurt 2 and our Frankfurt 4 IBXs. We're also the third phase of our Amsterdam 3 asset to respond to sales momentum in the Dutch business. Located on the Amsterdam park, this is second most location in Europe and an important interconnection hub for our customers.
Now looking at Asia-Pacific, please refer to Slide 9. Asia-Pacific revenues were up 7% over the prior quarter and 29% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by a record gross booking in the cloud and IT services and network segment. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 9% over the last quarter and 34% over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was up 3% quarter-over-quarter largely due to increased and a steady increase in interconnection revenues. Also, cabinets billing building increased by 700 over the prior quarter. We added 900 net cross connects and interconnection revenues remained at 12% in the region's recurring revenues.
In December, we opened our first data center in Melbourne, Australia, expanding Platform Equinix to 33 markets. In Melbourne, business already logged more than 40 new customers, including 11 network service providers. 
We're also expanding into Hong Kong market with new phases in both Hong Kong 1 and Hong Kong 2 IBXs to support deployments from the digital media and financial verticals.
And now looking at our balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. Fourth quarter was very active from a capital structure perspective. We settled our 2014, we completed 2 new debt deals, securing $2.75 billion in fundings. We used the proceeds from these offerings to redeem our 7% senior notes, the payment and we pay our prior term loan. These transactions effectively lowered the average cost of our debt financings to 4.93%. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion [ph] of cash and a net debt leverage ratio decreased to 3x [ph] of Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA.
Now switching to AFFO and our dividend outlook for -- on Slide 11. For 2015, we expect the AFFO to be greater than $810 million or growing 12% on a constant currency basis. This guidance absorbs $43 million in negative FX headwinds as well as an incremental $27 million in interest expense related to our November financing.
Also, today, we're excited to announce our first quarterly dividend of $1.69 per share, a very important milestone for Equinix. We expect to pay out 100% of our QRS taxable income. Our current AFFO payout ratio approximates 48%, the result of significant international assets still structured under our TRS as well as significant tax depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses.
For 2015 [ph] and beyond, we'll continue to review our QRS TRS REIT structure. It's important to know that our goal is to maximize total shareholder return. This is facilitated by our flexibility to support our growing cash dividend as we continue to scale our business and more of our assets moving to the QRS structure while continuing to invest in our development activities.
Turning to Slide 12. Given the cash and balance the sheet, add to that our growing cash flows, plus our debt capacity, we're well-positioned to fund our 2015 development activities, pay our quarterly dividends, including the 2015 special distribution, and service our debt obligations. As a REIT, our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio will remain at 3 to 4x. This level of debt provides us a strategic and operational flexibility we need to execute against our business needs.
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 13. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $238.5 million, [ph] including recurring CapEx of $33 million, in line with our guidance. We currently have 16 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 15 are or incremental. Also note, we've finalized the breakout of CapEx between recurring and nonrecurring for our AFFO definition. This is the format we'll be reporting on, on a go-forward basis.
Turning to Slide 14. The operating performance of our stabilized 69 [ph] global IBX and expansion projects that we open for more than 1 year continue to perform well with revenues up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Currently these projects generated 32% cash-on-cash return on invested and are 82% utilized.
And lastly, one final point. as part of the REIT conversion, we'll continue to roll our incremental financial data to enable our investors to back and analyze the business. This quarter, we added a supplemental section to our earnings deck, which now includes our non-financial metrics and expansion sheet as well as some additional disclosure. Starting in Q1, we expect to add additional materials to this earnings deck, including the components of NAV and NOI.
So let me stop there and turn it back to Steve."

Let me now cover our 2015 strategy and outlook on Slide 15. Our focus in 2015 is driven by 3 strategic priorities, designed to further differentiate our global data centers services and extend Platform Equinix.
First, we will continue to drive differentiated growth by deepening our existing ecosystems and applying particular focus on capturing the expanded opportunity in cloud and enterprise. With both network and cloud density that is unparalleled, we aim to become the provider of choice for the new age of enterprise IT. We will continue to invest meaningfully in innovation to deliver enhanced offers for multi-cloud consumption and build out our cloud service provider ecosystem, anchored by cloud technology leaders.
Second, to tackle these opportunities effectively, we will also invest in our go-to-market and our global platform to broaden our reach, scale, scale our organization and deliver premium customer service. We will do this by expanding our channel program to enhance our reach into the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators and key platform partners such as Microsoft, Net App and Cisco, working in tandem with our direct sales engine. Additionally, we are delivering on our commitment to build a professional services practice that aids enterprises in designing next-generation starting with our acquisition of Nimbo and established market leader in enabling hybrid cloud. In parallel, we are expanding our sales support and enablement functions, including our solution architects and sales engineers that the selling process.
To support these efforts and the growth of our sales engine, we are driving global consistency and alignment through our Equinix Customer One program. This initiative is enhancing our customer's experience through global standardization of our products and streamlining our process. We've successfully rolled this out in Asia in the fourth quarter, and we'll implement the EMEA and Americas regions by mid-2015.
And finally, we will continue to refine our capital allocation strategy the growth of organic and inorganic investment and the distribution of dividends while driving return on invested capital. We continue to ensure that our expansion CapEx supports our growth objectives and optimize this capital outlay while balancing project risk and customer need. Equinox has a long history of attractive returns in the development of new profits. This is done by building campuses that can be extended with additional premium-priced space connected to our maturity data centers where interconnected communities of customers have already been established.
The vast majority of our new development is in existing markets, and our unique market intelligence gained from working with customers gives us visibility into market's demand, pricing and returns. This knowledge helps us make prudent capital allocation and enables us to maintain highly differentiated project returns.
Last, I'll cover our outlook for 2015 on Slide 16 to 19. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $634 million to $638 million, which absorbs $19 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4 2014 average FX rate, a normalized constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $146 million to $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $287 million and $291 million, which includes $12 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4 2014 average FX rates and normalizing constant currency growth at 3% quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be $195 million to $205 million, which includes approximately $25 million of recurring capital expenditures.
For the full year of 2015, we expect revenues to be greater than $2.63 billion, which absorbs $100 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rate, reflecting a normalized and constant currency growth of 12%. Full year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be greater than $1.22 billion or a 46% EBITDA margin, an 80 basis point improvement over last year.
This guidance absorbs $47 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rates. We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $810 million, a 12% constant currency growth year-over-year. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to range between $700 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million [ph] of recurring capital expenditures. For 2015, we expect 95% of this capital expenditure will be for campus and existing market growth and roughly 5% for new market development.
So in closing, we are leveraging our leadership position to build unique customer offers and enhance our ecosystems by scaling the business globally. We are successfully expanding our ecosystem of cloud services, which coupled with our network density, will drive growth across our entire platform. The rapid growth of interconnection reflects the importance of Equinix as the place where leading companies comes to connect their customers and partners to accelerate the growth of their business. I'm very pleased with our position going into this year and look forward to continued progress against our objectives.
So let me stop here and open up for your questions. I'll turn it back to you."

Well, what am I sort first and foremost with the AFFO and really talk a little bit about the REIT structure. As I said in the prepared remarks, when you think about the QRS, it has majority is American business, which is, as you know, our slowest-growing business, albeit on a very large base. so our European business on a currency adjusted basis is our second fastest growing, and then the Japanese business, those are all sitting in the queue. We're not sitting in the queue is the rest of business and that is on call, that is Australia, Singapore. And so when you look at -- I'm sorry, there's Canada and Brazil. Brazil, because of the managed services business, you can appreciate it. It doesn't have the revenue type that's really suitable for REIT. So think of Brazil as being inside the T on a continuous basis. For the remaining assets, you can get a good sense, if you think about Singapore, you think about Australia, you think about into assets 2 assets in Canada, you're to have a lot of growth still coming from inside the T. And over time the reason we're structured today as is we're trying to do it tax efficiently, but we also have to meet the REIT test in 2015 with being the conversion year what assets you move in over what period of time. All that is to say when you look at the Q or you look at the T, both have very good growth potential. And over time, no longer growth in the overall business but certainly as we move assets from the T into the Q, it will give you the opportunity to get growth on the dividend."

I guess, I'd start with reminding the audience on the phone that our priorities for inorganic growth really around 3 areas. One, scaling our platform globally, very similar with what we did in Brazil, in Dubai, for example, entering those new markets over the last 18, 24 months. That's still of high interest to growing our platform globally. I guess the second component might be our continued focus on enhancing our interconnection and growing that platform very similar to what we did in Germany with the acquisition. I would tell you that we look for those kinds of places constantly. And then third, certainly growing over the last couple of years is capturing the cloud ecosystem and enhancing the enterprise capability to connect to the cloud system. And the acquisition of Nimbo, professional services capability, the things that implement is a step in that direction to accelerate our ability the cloud business. So we look at a lot of things. As you all know, the new markets include big, big like South Korea and India and going deeper in the China so going deeper into Latin America. So we're looking at lots of regions of the world. South Africa is of interest to us. So we've been pretty consistent in the places that scaling up platform in interest to us Europe. Is still obviously a very interesting marketplace for us. I wouldn't want to comment specifically on anything that we were all reading about here recently. With respect to our European business, we're very pleased with where we are with that business. As Keith mentioned, it grew 21% year-on-year. It's growing substantially faster because of the we push into that region from the other 2 regions. Interconnection growth grew 30% year-on-year, so it's doing very well. Our focus here is to continue to grow that business as it is today, and we'll continue to compete with the regional players in all parts of the world. We think we've done a very successfully. Our to continue on this global platform focus. So I don't know if you would add anything, Charles or Keith, on the European question?
On the PLR, top of everybody's mind, I think given our position on our first quarterly dividend, David, I guess all I can say is that we're still highly confident that we're going to get a response in 2015. And that's based on the existing legal precedent that's out there today in fact, that the data centers companies are currently operating as REITs. So we believe we qualified for translation of the REIT. you thought about the ball is in the IRS's court. We provided them with everything that they need. And you have to remember here also that the previous couple of players went through this process I think in LaMarr and they forget a couple of others actually or receive there a couple of those guys received their post conversion. So these conditions we're leaving in today are not terribly unusual. I think everybody's for frustrated about it they still remains that will get a positive response here in 2015."

Again, what we're seeing is our investment really responds to what we're seeing from our enterprise customers in terms of what they need to implement hybrid cloud effectively. And what we're finding is that they're at a stage where they are still examining how hybrid cloud fits, how they can implement it, which workloads they would want to consider moving into a hybrid cloud environment, which ones they may want to keep in a more traditional colocation setting, how a -- what workloads lend themselves well to a public cloud interconnect and then how to implement that over time, particularly in a highly distributed fashion globally for larger players. So that's the type of advice that they are looking for before they make commitments and execute plans on hybrid cloud implementation. And Nimbo was already actively engaged with customers of ours and with partners of ours like Microsoft in those types of discussions. So we're very excited about the opportunity, in fact, have got a ton of positive feedback from partners like Microsoft and existing customers about that capability. And so that's the essence of what they're doing. And again, it's early days, but we continue to be really optimistic about what that means for us and for our customers as they look to implement hybrid cloud. In terms of margins, I would say that the overall scale of the business there are couple of things we are -- our objective here is not to grow a professional services firm for the purpose of growing our top line. It is really to draw a pull through and demand for platform Equinix over time as a hybrid cloud. And so we're going to do that kind of business. We'll do it at reasonable margins.

And we did that for a couple of reasons. one, we wanted to take our 7% senior notes. We wanted to put a new term loan in place and also wanted a revolving line of credit. And that $1.5 billion [ph] facility between the term loan and the line of credit is very, very cheap money for us. It's up to 2%. When you think about the high yield that we did on a blended basis between the 7 [ph] and 10 [ph], 5.5%, 2% cost of capital. All that to say, as I said in my comments, our cost of funds today on a blended basis for all our financings is 4.93%. So that's the first thing. The second thing I want to leave you with is the $1.1 million, as I said, we opportunistically went to market in November. It is not our expectations that we're going to carry that level of cash on a go-forward basis. And suffice it to say, when you think about the capital investment that we're going to be making this year and you add to that basically the dividend that we are to be disbursing, plus perhaps some asset acquisitions, some land or some buildings, all of a sudden, you can get a pretty good sense of many of that with that $1.1 billion. And therefore, as you roll forward in time beyond 2015, I would expect that you would see us either continue to consume cash from the balance sheet as we generated, but also going to a revolving line of credit. And then as times permit, we go back to the market and raise more debt to fund future growth. And so that's how we're sort of see it. I would tell you, that I don't think that we're going to see a lot of cash left on our balance sheet on a regular basis given the fact that we've now converted to a REIT."

And is the AFFO formula out there now something to be considered the finalized version? And then just 1 point of clarification.

I'll take the first around large footprint and then let Keith handle the other ones. as we've said consistently over the years, our ecosystem-centric strategy is very focused on putting the right customers with the right applications into the right assets, and that really continues to be the case. But undoubtedly, as we did comment in the script, we are seeing an uptick in the requirements around, particularly for cloud service providers who are looking to rapidly scale their business on a global basis. And that's -- again, we've been -- we've always sort of always that posture, there are larger footprint deals that we believe our accretive to the overall ecosystem that we will pursue and that we believe can be sort of because of their sort of support price kind of long-term blended return. And we are seeing those and winning that type of business. And in terms of how we accommodate it, I think that I would say in Asia and Europe, we have typically sort of managed facilities as somewhat blended facilities anyway with a combination of sort of small, medium and large footprint deals going into those facilities. In the U.S, it has been a little different in that there are specific assets where we are in a better position to accommodate large footprint at the right kind of price points at the right dynamics for customers. And we continue to have that capacity available to us. And so we -- we're looking at selectively putting those into the markets around the world. And we are also looking to expand our capabilities and looking our -- at our investment portfolio and plan to continue to put the right kind of capacity in the right places and looking at evolving the offers so that we can deploy essentially hybrid infrastructures that allow us to ebb and flow with the market demand and put the right mix of larger footprint and traditional premium retail into a market at once, and doing that in a way that we also are looking to sort of face the capital more aggressively by really doing it as just in time as possible. And that's another thing that our global design and construction teams are actively looking at. So those are the things that are going on right now in terms of us being able to respond to that. We do see plenty of opportunity, and we're going to be selective about that because not every deal is something that we're going to but the ones that we think are critical to winning in the cloud and -- are things that we will pursue."

So we've firmed that up and I would tell you that our AFFO, on a principal basis, is firm. So continue to review it. I feel very, very comfortable with our target definition. As you can see by all of the disclosures we have we've had a very good of what we include the AFFO and the reconcile from EBITDA. So that's what we feel comfortable with. And we'll tell you that the $810 million -- $810 million, as I said, currency is impacting that number by $43 million, interest rate on the November finance, an opportunistic financing relative to our expectations that adds another $27 million, if we had our number would've looked for like $880 million [ph] on a constant currency basis or roughly 16% [ph] up quarter-over-quarter.
And then going back to the comment just on currency. When we look at currency, again, we did some bridges in our presentation. And so when you go pages 16 and 17, you get a pretty good sense of how currency has impacted it. Suffice it to stay, I don't have the exact number, but we give you was in the press release, we told you the rates of exchange that we're using for our currency. And embedded in that, of course, if you take euro, for example, it's trading -- spot today is roughly 1 13 [ph] and we've got a blended rate of 1 20. [ph] And still different from what we experienced last quarter where was  roughly 1 26 [ph] and we're guiding at 1 32. [ph] And all that the say is that we are looking at a relatively big currency impact on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And so as we sort of presented in our reconciliation in our bridges, you see absent taking out currency, we're reporting revenues flat quarter-over-quarter. Currency is having a 3 percentage -- 3 points [ph] of growth impact on our Q1 results. So without -- we've got the guidance rates,, we've got what you think is the size of the impact, and that should give you a good step forward and how to look at the business."

If you remember, when we went into Europe, 2008, the IBX Europe assets was the third-largest player.

And so that's one of the significant investments we're making is putting channel partners and channel program investments sort of into the system on a global basis. And we're seeing levels of engagement between ourselves and the sales teams of key partners like in, like the Microsoft, et cetera, as being a very meaningful way that we're gain access to the enterprise market.

I don't know that we know exactly what the natural sort of our churn business would be. And I think we're constantly -- we're obviously very focused on continuing the reduced churn and making sure that there are no regrettable churn losses in our business. Candidly, there are very few today. For the most part, what we see is churn associated with people optimizing platforms and footprints over time and to changing dynamic in their business. And so I don't know that we can answer. Certainly, I think that we have the opportunity to continue to reduce it over time. But I think the range that we've given you and kind of where it was in that range we expect operate is our best current view. over time, particularly as we scale enterprise opportunity and if winning the kinds of business that we expect to win around performance optimization attached to cloud exchange as part of an overall hybrid cloud implementation, we believe that we'll be very business, like much of the rest of what we offer today. So yes, we would strive to be driving that lower, that increases customer lifetime value and creates long-term intrinsic value for the business. So we're -- we will strive for that. But I think that the range that we've given is probably where we be comfortable with providing right now until we learn more."

I think, like anything, when the currencies -- when our functional currency, which is USD, is strong, clearly it gives you an opportunity to look at initiatives. And from our perspective, because we're already ingesting quite across our portfolio and across the regions, I will tell you something make us do anything radically different. But anything, when you look at it and you look at the decision went to the capital in a given market, it can work to your advantage. And so whether it's the U.S. whether it's the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar, or for that matter, the Singaporean dollar, to the extent we can use it to our advantage we certainly will. I think what's important though is if I step back, I just talk overall about our margins, which is something I really wanted to get out because there's been a number of questions on that. When I take -- when I look at '15 and we look forward and sort of the impact on currency it had on margins, why don't. First and foremost, with the guidance that we deliver we said here that we can do greater than $1.22 billion on EBITDA line. If I take you to 2014, we did $1.114 billion [ph] but included in that number of course are the REIT costs. And the REIT cost, recognizing most of those are going to go away, I add $17 million. [ph] we spent $29 million in '14, we're going to spend $12 million in '15. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our margins is 46.3%. So what we said was just on the guidance that we delivered so we can do greater than $1.22 billion. That's 46.4% margin. As we look forward, 2 things we're going to do, and Charles has talked to 1, which is investing in the channel, which is $20 million, and integrating ALOG, which is $7 million [ph]. if I add those 2 -- sort of those 2 things back, that's 47 -- sorry 47.4% margin. The other thing, currency, because we're a U.S. dollar denominated company, a lot of our cost reside in U.S. dollars. The impact of the currency affecting our revenues and our EBITDA, it's affecting our margin by another 90 basis points. so all that to say is that when I reconcile out 2015 relative to 2014, we see basically a 48.3% margin business, with some investment that we're making in channel and the invest in ALOG. That relative to what we exited in 2014, which is really an adjusted 46.3. So overall, we feel that the business is performing well. Yes, it's working a little bit today. But given our we allocate our resources, invest in the right things for our future growth, we think it's the right investment decisions to make."

We tend to look at pricing in sort of 2 primary ways. Really, the most important being yield on for our metrics. As you can see our regional results, we saw strength across all 3 regions on a constant currency basis and our MRR so we continue to really benefit from how we're managing the business both in terms of enterprise points on deals as well as -- which is really driven by deals at this point and as well as interconnection and then managing power density effectively. So those are levers that really give a strong performance on yield basis. The other of pricing is really as a set entry lower price points on deals and then obviously sort of 5 characteristics in the market influence that heavily. And I guess what I would say is, one, where we are -- we're very -- continue to be very disciplined about the deals we are pursuing and pursuing those where we have a unique and differentiated value proposition and so continuing to see pricing there. And even where there are -- where we would want to selectively pursue, say, large footprint deals or deals where the competitive overlap with other players maybe higher, what we are seeing is what I would say a favorable balance on overall supply demand across many of our markets and a general stabilization in the pricing environment."

Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we walk through the results of the quarter, I'd like to reflect on the milestones that we achieved in 2014.
To start, turning to Slide 3. We leveraged significant market momentum to deliver another strong year of financial results, generating $2.44 billion of revenue, up 14% year-over-year, and over $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA or 46% margin and growing AFFO 12% to $762 million.
Second, we established Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud by partnering with an all-star list of cloud providers including AWS, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft, and won business from a host of enterprises who are taking advantage of their presence to implement hybrid cloud architectures at Equinix. We have continued to innovate and enhance our offer set to help transform enterprise IT, launching 2 new solutions in 2014, Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange.
The traction we are seeing is very compelling as hundreds of customers are now using these solutions to improve network and enterprise application performance as well as accelerating cloud adoption.
Third, we expanded our global platform, completing 10 major IBX expansions in 2014, including projects in Amsterdam, Dallas, SÃ£o Paulo, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. We are successfully creating value over the long term through our development pipeline, achieving attractive returns and healthy yield on stabilized assets with our premium value proposition.
Given the market strength, we are continuing to grow our presence in core markets, and in the first half of this year, we are opening 5 new IBXs in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto, as well as a new metro in Melbourne, Australia.
Fourth, we extended our position as the global interconnection leader, with interconnection revenue continuing to outpace overall revenue, growing 16% year-over-year and further demonstrating the strength of our ecosystem. Customers interconnecting across Platform Equinix resulted in 18,500 new cross connects in 2014, with a notable uptick in the latter half of the year, driven by strong growth in the network and acceleration of private connections to the cloud.
Our digital exchanges also saw a sizable increase in both traffic and sales, adding approximately 600 ports in 2014, about 2.5x more adds than the prior year.
And finally, we successfully began operating as a REIT on January 1 and are very pleased to announce our first quarterly dividend program. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, including raising and refinancing our high-yield notes and senior debt in the fourth quarter and feel very good about our liquidity position and capital structure. This strategic and operational flexibility will allow for continued reinvestment in our business and new market development along with distributions to our shareholders on a quarterly basis.
As we enter 2015, we see continued momentum in our core business and are well positioned to execute on emerging growth opportunities by expanding our routes to market and further enhancing our solutions portfolio.
As applications become increasingly interactive, solving conflicts interconnection scenarios is mission-critical for today's business. We believe our global scale, as well as our network and cloud density, puts us in a unique position to solve these challenges. Today, we have over 4,800 customers and expect to significantly expand our customer base over the next several years as Platform Equinix becomes increasingly relevant to a larger universe of buyers.
Now turning to the quarter. We delivered record gross and net bookings, driven by strong performance across all 3 regions, solid new customer additions and continued expansion of our cloud ecosystem. An increase in global deployments and accelerated interconnection growth are helping contribute to firm yield and reduce churn. We continue to see customers expand their geographic reach across Platform Equinix. And today, 67% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 63% last year. And 81% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 79% last year.
Now let me share the highlights of our industry vertical performance this past quarter. Our network vertical delivered steady growth as wireline carriers upgrade core node infrastructure to support exponential traffic growth in new services, and several of our most strategic customers began to bundle Equinix into their custom enterprise solutions. Network interconnection also experienced strong growth as both connections to and from our network customers grew more than 20% year-over-year. Emerging demand for mobile platforms is generating new business, and wins in this vertical include EE, the U.K.'s largest 4G operator, and Truphone, a global mobile network operator. Content and digital media delivered a record quarter, with healthy demand from large content players and rapid growth in our advertising subsegment, which is gaining traction as real-time ad placement becomes a cornerstone of the company's advertising strategy.
Cloud adoption is on the rise among content and digital media companies as they leverage the scaling advantages offered by cloud and seek the low-latency required to deliver the highest quality user experience. For example, global publishing company HarperCollins recently chose to connect to Microsoft Azure through the Equinix Cloud Exchange inside our London IBX in order to achieve guaranteed levels of security and latency with improved operational resilience and flexibility.
Turning to financial services. We saw steady growth and continued progress in diversifying our financial services business across insurance, retail banking and digital payments and processing. Our 5 largest financial deals of the quarter came from these sectors, including a top 15 global retail bank, a top 5 global insurance firm and the third largest global payments and analytics provider. Electronic payments, in particular, is an area where we, I think, have been increasingly focused, and we see potential for a digital commerce ecosystem to emerge, spanning multiple industries. We have captured over 50 customers in the digital commerce space, including Adyen, a global payments technology provider, leveraging Equinix's network density and cloud connectivity to enable global payments for merchants from anywhere in the world.
Turning to our cloud and enterprise verticals. The enterprise shift from centralized in-house IT infrastructure to distributed hybrid and public cloud architectures is driving an incremental and transformational opportunity that we expect to be Equinix's top growth vector over the next several years. In the fourth quarter, cloud and IT services again delivered record booking, and we now have over 1,250 cloud and IT service companies driving 27% of our revenue. Expansions on AWS, Oracle, Microsoft and T-Systems drove strong momentum in the quarter, and we saw an uptick in larger footprint deals as the size of deployment for public and private cloud access nodes have expanded given the rapid growth in this market.
Cloud service providers continue to choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment, cutting-edge application performance and unmatched reliability. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our intelligent switching platform that enables companies to connect directly and securely to multiple cloud and network providers, continues to scale and is now live in 19 markets globally. Over 100 companies, enterprises, networks and cloud service providers, have joined the Equinix Cloud Exchange and new wins include Google, IBM Software, Fusionapps as well as Pacnet, Tata and Telecom Italia. Google and IBM Software are 2 important platform wins that enhance the value and diversity of our cloud ecosystem. Equinix will offer high performance direct access to Google's cloud platform in 15 markets and to the IBM Software platform in 9 markets this year.
On the enterprise side, as leading companies around the globe operate increasingly interconnected and on-demand business models, we are experiencing significant momentum in the enterprise market. Over 100 customers have deployed Performance Hub, our targeted solution that allows customers to deploy IT resources closer to the user population and provide secure high-bandwidth connectivity through a variety of networks in cloud. This distributed interconnection-based approach to data center computing provides significant benefits in both application and network performance. Enterprise wins include General Electric as well as GP Strategies, a management consulting and engineering services firm, and Metso, a leading process provider for mining and oil and gas.
So let me stop here and turn the call over to Keith to provide some deeper results -- deeper details of the results for the quarter."

Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone.
To start, I'd like to first review some of our 2014 highlights and then I'll turn to our fourth quarter performance.
We reported revenues of $2.44 billion, representing an almost 14% year-over-year growth rate. All 3 regions delivered better than expectation, with EMEA and Asia Pacific showing reported growth of 21% and 19%, respectively, while the Americas region produced greater-than-expected growth of 9% on its much larger base.
We continue to balance margin expectations with the reinvestment in the business to drive our future growth. Our gross profit margin was 51% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% after taking into consideration significant investment and expansion activities across the regions as well as directing approximately $30 million in operating expenses to fund new product innovations such as Cloud Exchange and Performance Hub.
Also, in 2014, we continue to scale our go-to-market efforts to better position ourselves to attract the enterprise customer. Despite these investments, our margins remained stable, and we continue to target a longer-term objective of achieving 50% adjusted EBITDA margins or better.
We continue to focus on the balance sheet and find ways to optimize our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we refreshed our debt structure and secured $2.75 billion of new financing. This puts us in a great position to fund both our existing and new initiatives, invest in the development pipeline and fund our quarterly dividend.
So let me now turn to Slide 4 as I'd like to highlight how we allocated the resources in 2014. First, we generated approximately $709 million in adjusted cash from operations and then reinvested $660 million of this cash into development and other projects that have consistently high levels of return, including our newly opened Melbourne and Singapore IBXs. We now have 103 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint in the world. We purchased the remaining shares of ALOG in Brazil and now own 100% of this important South American asset.
Also, we continue to increase the number of assets that's owned and developed for the purchase of land for our current and our future Melbourne IBXs. And finally, we repurchased 298 million of Equinix stock in 2014 and completed a $416 million special distribution for stockholders, which included $83 million in cash.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Simply put, it was another outstanding quarter for the Equinix team. Our strategy continues to deliver better-than-expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings, and our quarterly key metrics remained solid, including MRR per cabinet, especially on an FX-neutral basis, and net cabinets billing. Also, our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 5,600 net cross connects and 130 exchange ports this quarter alone.
As depicted on Slide 5, global Q4 revenues were $638.1 million, our 48th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 13% over the same quarter last year.
Our overperformance was due to higher gross bookings, more and unplanned MRR churn and continued custom sales order activity. Our Q4 revenue performance net of our FX hedges absorbs an $8.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $1 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Currency volatility against all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds this quarter and meaningfully affected our 2015 guidance. Our largest exposure to FX movement related to the weakening of the Brazilian real, the British pound and the euro. For 2015, we've layered in new hedges approximating 80% coverage against our EMEA operating currencies for the full year. Besides the negative FX impact on our 2015 guidance, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has created a $100 million FX headwind against revenues and a $47 million headwind against our adjusted EBITDA.
Cash SG&A expenses increased $147.8 million for the quarter, higher than guidance, primarily due to a December change in our commission practices, where our sales reps will now earn their sales commission when their order is booked versus when the order is billed. This change was made to better align our comp practices with the market and to enable us to better track these costs as we measure our business performance. As a result, we accelerated on a onetime basis $7 million of sales commission cost into the fourth quarter. This was not included in our prior guidance.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $294.4 million, at the top end of our guidance range and up 12% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $1.1 million currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $3.4 million net positive impact when compared to the FX guidance rates.
In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $355.1 million. Consistent with our comments from the last earnings call, a large portion of this loss relates to the writeoff of deferred tax assets totaling $324 million as we formalize our conversion to a REIT. Also, we recorded a $106 million loss on debt extinguishment related to our refinancing efforts.
Our Q4 operating cash flow decreased slightly over the prior quarter to $202.3 million, largely due to increased cash interest and taxes paid. Also, our DSOs improved 2 days to 37 days. Our AFFO for the year was $761.7 million, higher than our expectations, mainly due to lower-than-expected recurring CapEx and cash taxes.
MRR churn was better than anticipated at 1.9%, the second quarter in a row where we're below the 2% threshold, and we believe reflects some level of stabilization of this key metric. For the full year 2015, we expect our MRR churn rate to range between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, although we do expect the average to be at the lower end of this range.
Now moving on to our comments on REIT. Well, we've officially begun operating as a REIT as of January 1, 2015, which is a significant and exciting milestone for the company. That said, to give you a perspective on how we've structured our REIT assets, we've placed the majority of our U.S. and European assets along with our Japanese assets under the qualified REIT structure or QRS. With the rest of Asia, Brazil and Canada placed in our TRS or taxable REIT structure. This is important to note as the taxable income from our QRS business is what drives our dividend payout requirement. In addition, while we don't yet have our PLR in hand, we continue to expect to receive a favorable PLR in 2015.
On Slide 6, we summarize our expected REIT-related cash cost and taxes. We expect our second special distribution to range between $580 million and $680 million and to be paid in Q4 of 2015. Our REIT-related cash cost should approximate $12 million in 2015 and including $2 million of onetime cost to finalize the REIT structure.
And finally, we expect our effective worldwide tax rate, excluding REIT-related cash taxes, to range between 10% and 15% in 2015, although this range may narrow as we continue to review our tax operating structure.
Turning to Slide 7, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong quarter, delivering its second highest gross bookings activity with record cross-connect additions. These results clearly show the benefits from our core strategy. The Americas revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter and 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis.
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 5% over the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. America adjusted EBITDA margin was 47% for the quarter, a step-up over the prior quarter due to lower seasonal utility expenses. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $7 million to integrate our ALOG business.
Americas' net cabinets billing increased by 500 in the quarter, lower than last quarter, largely due to timing of installations. We added a record 3,500 net cross connects and 95 exchange ports in Q4, highlighting the strong demand for our Americas digital exchanges.
With respect to region's new builds, we're expanding our Dallas 2 IBX in the Infomart, which is the primary interconnection building in the Dallas market.
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 8. EMEA delivered a strong quarter with record gross bookings, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses. Revenues were up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our EMEA business continues to capture market share, growing twice as fast as our regional competitors. Also, we'd like to highlight the improved German performance throughout the year, the result of new leadership, better execution and renewed focus across our German team.
Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 1% over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased slightly to 42% due to one-off costs in the fourth quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues increased 2% over the prior quarter and up 29% over the same quarter last year and represents 9% of the region's recurring revenues. We added 1,200 net cross connects in the quarter and EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 600.
Moving to expansion opportunities. The Frankfurt market has performed very well in 2014, and we've seen a substantial increase in our fill rate compared to the prior year. To support this, we're expanding both our Frankfurt 2 and our Frankfurt 4 IBXs. We're also accelerating the third phase of our Amsterdam 3 asset to respond to sales momentum in the Dutch business. Located on the Amsterdam Science Park, this is second most fiber-dense location in Europe and an important interconnection hub for our customers.
Now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 9. Asia Pacific revenues were up 7% over the prior quarter and 29% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by record gross booking in the cloud and IT services and network segment. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 9% over the last quarter and 34% over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was up 3% quarter-over-quarter largely due to increased power density and a steady increase in interconnection revenues. Also, cabinets billing increased by 700 over the prior quarter. We added 900 net cross connects and interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues.
In December, we opened our first data center in Melbourne, Australia, expanding Platform Equinix to 33 markets. The Melbourne business already logged more than 40 new customers, including 11 network service providers.
We're also expanding into Hong Kong market with new phases in both Hong Kong 1 and Hong Kong 2 IBXs to support deployments from the digital media and financial verticals.
And now looking at our balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. Fourth quarter was very active from a capital structure perspective. We settled our 2014 converts, we completed 2 new debt deals, securing $2.75 billion in fundings. We used the proceeds from these offerings to redeem our 7% senior notes, settle the make-whole payment and repay our prior term loan. These transactions effectively lowered the average cost of our debt financings to 4.93%. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and our net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to 3x of Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA.
Now switching to AFFO and our dividend outlook for -- on Slide 11. For 2015, we expect the AFFO to be greater than $810 million or growing 12% on a constant currency basis. This guidance absorbs $43 million in negative FX headwinds as well as an incremental $27 million in interest expense related to our November financing.
Also, today, we're excited to announce our first quarterly dividend of $1.69 per share, a very important milestone for Equinix. We expect to pay out 100% of our QRS taxable income. Our current AFFO payout ratio approximates 48%, the result of significant international assets still structured under our TRS as well as significant tax depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses.
For 2016 and beyond, we'll continue to review our QRS TRS REIT structure. It's important to note that our goal is to maximize total shareholder return. This is facilitated by our flexibility to support our growing cash dividend as we continue to scale our business and more of our assets move into the QRS structure while continuing to invest in our development activities.
Turning to Slide 12. Given the cash in the balance sheet, add to that our growing cash flows, plus our debt capacity, we're well positioned to fund our 2015 development activities, pay our quarterly dividends, including the 2015 special distribution and service our debt obligations. As a REIT, our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio will remain at 3 to 4x. This level of debt provides us a strategic and operational flexibility we need to execute against our business needs.
Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 13. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $238.5 million, including recurring CapEx of $33 million, in line with our guidance. We currently have 16 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 15 are campus builds or incremental phase build. Also note, we've finalized the breakout of CapEx between recurring and nonrecurring for our AFFO definition. This is the format we'll be reporting on, on a go-forward basis.
Turning to Slide 14. The operating performance of our stabilized 69 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than 1 year continue to perform well, with revenues up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Currently these projects generate a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and are 82% utilized.
And lastly, one final point. As part of the REIT conversion, we'll continue to roll out incremental financial data to enable our investors to back and analyze the business. This quarter, we added a supplemental section to our earnings deck, which now includes our non-financial metrics and expansion sheet, as well as some additional disclosure. Starting in Q1, we expect to add additional materials to this earnings deck, including the components of NAV and NOI.
So let me stop there and turn it back to Steve."

Let me now cover our 2015 strategy and outlook on Slide 15. Our focus in 2015 is driven by 3 strategic priorities designed to further differentiate our global data centers services and extend Platform Equinix.
First, we will continue to drive differentiated growth by deepening our existing ecosystems and applying particular focus on capturing the expanded opportunity in cloud and enterprise. With both network and cloud density that is unparalleled, we aim to become the provider of choice for the new age of enterprise IT. We will continue to invest meaningfully in innovation to deliver enhanced offers for multi-cloud consumption and build out our cloud service provider ecosystem, anchored by cloud technology leaders.
Second, to tackle these opportunities effectively, we will also invest in our go-to-market and our global platform to broaden our reach, scale, scale our organization and deliver premium customer service. We will do this by expanding our channel program to enhance our reach into the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators and key platform partners such as Microsoft, NetApp and Cisco, working in tandem with our direct sales engine. Additionally, we are delivering on our commitment to build a professional services practice that aids enterprises in designing and deploying next-generation architectures starting with our acquisition of Nimbo, an established market leader in enabling hybrid cloud. In parallel, we are expanding our sales support and enablement functions, including our solution architects and sales engineers that facilitate the selling process.
To support these efforts and the growth of our sales engine, we are driving global consistency and alignment through our Equinix Customer One program. This initiative is enhancing our customer's experience through global standardization of our products and streamlining our quote-to-cash process. We've successfully rolled this out in Asia in the fourth quarter, and we'll implement the EMEA and Americas regions by mid-2015.
And finally, we will continue to refine our capital allocation strategy of profitable growth through organic and inorganic investments and the distribution of dividends while driving return on invested capital. We continue to ensure that our expansion CapEx supports our growth objectives and optimize this capital outlay while balancing project risk and customer need. Equinix has a long history of achieving attractive returns in the development of new properties. This is done by building campuses that can be extended with additional premium-priced space connected to our mature data centers where interconnected communities of customers have already been established.
The vast majority of our new development is in existing markets, and our unique market intelligence gained from working with customers gives us visibility into a market's demand, pricing and returns. This knowledge helps us make prudent capital allocation decisions and enables us to maintain highly differentiated project returns.
Last, I'll cover our outlook for 2015 on Slide 16 to 19. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $634 million to $638 million, which absorbs $19 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4 2014 average FX rate, a normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $146 million to $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $287 million and $291 million, which includes $12 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4 2014 average FX rates and normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be $195 million to $205 million, which includes approximately $25 million of recurring capital expenditures.
For the full year of 2015, we expect revenues to be greater than $2.63 billion, which absorbs $100 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rate, reflecting a normalized and constant currency growth of 12%. Total year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be greater than $1.22 billion or a 46% EBITDA margin, an 80 basis point improvement over last year.
This guidance absorbs $47 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rates. We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $810 million, a 12% constant currency growth year-over-year. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to range between $700 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. For 2015, we expect 95% of this expansion capital expenditure will be for campus and existing market builds and roughly 5% for new market development.
So in closing, we are leveraging our leadership position to build unique customer offers and enhance our ecosystems while scaling the business globally. We are successfully expanding our ecosystem of cloud services which, coupled with our network density, will drive growth across our entire platform. The rapid growth of interconnection reflects the importance of Equinix as the place where leading companies come to connect their customers and partners to accelerate the growth of their business. I'm very pleased with our position going into this year and look forward to continued progress against our objectives.
So let me stop here and open it up for questions. Liz, I'll turn it back over to you."

I guess the second question is for you, Steve, which would be, could you kind of elaborate on your appetite for a large-scale consolidating European transaction? And if so, can you give us details on that? And then the third question, I guess is the obvious one, which is a year ago, we heard that the PLR was coming in 2014. Now we're hearing in 2015, that it's coming in 2015. The question I get 10 times more often than any other fundamental question is what possible reason could there that you don't have it already? You've paid a lot of people a lot of money to help you in this process. They must be telling you something. Could you please tell us what it is?"

Why don't I start first and foremost with the sort of the AFFO and really talk a little bit about the REIT structure. As I've said in the prepared remarks, when you think about the QRS, it has majority the American business, which is, as you know, as I reported, our slowest-growing business, albeit on a very large base. So our European business on a currency-adjusted basis is our second fastest growing, and then the Japanese business, those are all sitting in the queue. What's not sitting in the queue is the rest of our Asian business. And surprise to you, that is Hong Kong, that's Australia, that's Singapore. And so when you look at -- I'm sorry, there's Canada and Brazil. Brazil, because of the managed services business, you can appreciate it. It doesn't have the revenue type that's really suitable for REIT. And so think of Brazil as being inside the T on a continuous basis. For the remaining assets, you can get a good sense. When you think about Singapore, you think about Australia, you think about [indiscernible] for Toronto 2 asset in Canada, you're going to have a lot of growth still coming from inside the T. And over time, the reason we're structured today as is, we're trying to do it tax efficiently, but we also have to meet the REIT compliance test in 2015 with being a conversion year, you have to be very thoughtful about what assets you move in over what period of time. All of that is to say when you look at the Q or you look at the T, both have very good growth potential. And over time, no longer growth in the overall business but certainly as we move assets from the T into the Q, it will give you the opportunity to get growth on the dividend."

I guess, I'd start with reminding the audience on the phone that our priorities for inorganic growth, really around 3 areas. One, scaling our platform globally, very similar with what we did in Brazil, in Dubai, for example, entering those new markets over the last 18, 24 months. That's still of high interest to growing our platform globally. I guess the second component might be our continued focus on enhancing our interconnection and growing that platform very similar to what we did in Germany with the ancotel acquisition. So I would tell you that we look for those kinds of plays constantly. And then third, certainly growing over the last couple of years is capturing the cloud ecosystem and enhancing the enterprise capability to connect to the cloud ecosystem. And the acquisition of Nimbo, its professional services capability, that's same with enterprise hybrid cloud enablement, is a step in that direction to accelerate our ability to prosecute the cloud business. So we look at a lot of things. As you all know, the new markets include big, big regions like South Korea and India and going deeper into China and going deeper into Latin America. So we're looking at lots of regions of the world. South Africa is of interest to us. So we've been pretty consistent on the places that's generally a platform of interest to us. Europe is still obviously a very interesting marketplace for us. I wouldn't want to comment specifically on anything that we were all reading about here recently. With respect to our European business, we're very pleased with where we are with that business. As Keith mentioned, it grew 21% year-on-year. It's growing substantially faster because of the inbound bookings we push into that region from the other 2 regions. Interconnection growth grew 30% year-on-year, so it's doing very, very well. Our focus here is to continue to grow that business as it is today, and we'll continue to compete with the regional players in all parts of the world. We think we've done it very successfully. Our mantra is to continue on this global platform focus. So I don't know if anybody would add anything there, Charles or Keith, on the European question. On the PLR, top of everybody's mind, I think given our position on our first quarterly dividend, David, I guess all I can say is that we're still highly confident that we're going to get a response here in 2015. And that's based on the existing legal precedence that's out there today, with the fact that many other data center companies are currently operating as REITs. So we believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT. Unfortunately, they're -- it's out of our hands right now. The ball is in the IRS's court. We provided them everything that they need. And you have to remember here also that the previous couple of players that went through this process, I think Iron Mountain and Lamar, and I forget a couple others, actually all received their -- a couple of those guys received their PLRs post conversion. So these conditions that we're living in today are not terribly unusual. I think everybody's frustrated about it but we still remain highly confident that we'll get a positive response here in 2015."

I'll take that one. I think that -- a couple of things. Again, what we're seeing is our investment in pro services really responds to what we're seeing from our enterprise customers in terms of what they need to implement hybrid cloud effectively. And what we're finding is that they're at a stage where they are still examining how hybrid cloud fits, how they can implement it, which workloads they would want to consider moving into a hybrid cloud environment, which ones they may want to keep in a more traditional co-location setting, how -- what workloads lend themselves well to a public cloud interconnect and then how to implement that over time, particularly in a highly distributed fashion globally for larger players. So that's the type of advice that they are looking for before they make commitments and execute plans on hybrid cloud implementation. And Nimbo was already actively engaged with customers of ours and with partners of ours like Microsoft in those types of discussions. And so we're very excited about the opportunity, and in fact, have gotten a ton of positive feedbacks from partners like Microsoft and existing customers about that capability. And so that's the essence of what they're doing. Again, it's early days, but we continue to be really optimistic about what that means for us and for our customers as they look to implement hybrid cloud. In terms of margins, I would say that the overall scale of the business is a couple of things. We are -- our objective here is not to grow a professional services firm for the purpose of growing our top line. It is really to drive pull-through and demand for Platform Equinix over time as a hybrid cloud enablement platform. And so we're going to do that kind of business. We'll do it at reasonable margins. They will certainly be lower than our services business. But the overall scale of the business will be relatively immaterial and not have a significant impact on the overall margin structure."

I think, look, certainly, we went to the market opportunistically in the end of November -- or sorry, in November. And we did that for a couple of reasons. One, we felt it's a good time to go and refinance. We wanted to take out our 7% senior notes. We wanted to put a new term loan in place. We also wanted to have a revolving line of credit. And that $1.5 billion facility between the term loan and the line of credit is very, very cheap money for us. It's up to 2%. When you think about the high yield that we did on a blended basis between the 7s and 10s, it's the 5.52% cost of capital. All that to say, as I said in my comments, our cost of funds today on a blended basis for all our financings is 4.93%. So that's the first thing. The second thing I want to leave you with is the $1.1 million, as I said, we opportunistically went to market in November. It is not our expectations that we're going to carry that level of cash on a go-forward basis. And suffice it to say, when you think about the capital investment that we're going to be making this year and you add to that, basically, the dividends that we're going to be disbursing, plus perhaps some asset acquisitions, some land or some buildings, all of a sudden, you can get a pretty good sense that we're going to consume a fairly many piece of that $1.1 billion. And therefore, as you roll forward in time beyond 2015, I would expect that you would see us either continue to consume cash from the balance sheet as we generated, but also going to a revolving line of credit. And then as times permit, we can go back to the market and raise more debt to fund the future growth. And so that's how we were sort of seeing it. I would tell you, I don't think that you're going to see a lot of cash left on our balance sheet on a regular basis given the fact that we've now converted to a REIT."

I'll take the first pitch around large footprint and then let Keith handle the other ones. As we've said consistently over the years, our ecosystem-centric strategy is very focused on putting the right customers with the right applications into the right assets, and that really continues to be the case. But undoubtedly, and as we did comment in the script, we are seeing an uptick in the requirements around large footprint, particularly for cloud service providers who are looking to rapidly scale their business on a global basis. And that's -- again, we've been -- we've sort of always had that posture of, hey, there are large footprint deals that we believe are accretive to the overall ecosystem story that we will pursue and that we believe can, sort of because of their ecosystem power, sort of support the right kind of long-term blended returns. And we are seeing those and winning that type of business. And in terms of how we accommodate it, I think that I would say in Asia and Europe, we have typically sort of managed our facilities as somewhat blended facilities anyway with a combination of sort of small, medium and large footprint deals going into those facilities. In the U.S, it has been a little different in that there are specific assets where we are in a better position to accommodate large footprint at the right kind of price points, at the right dynamics for customers. And we continue to have that capacity available to us. And so we were looking at selectively putting those into markets around the world. And we are also looking to expand our capabilities and looking at our investment portfolio and plan to continue to put the right kind of capacity in the right places and looking at evolving the offers so that we can deploy essentially hybrid infrastructures that allow us to ebb and flow with the market demand and put the right mix of larger footprint and traditional premium retail into a market at once, and doing that in a way that we also are looking to sort of phase the capital more aggressively by really doing it as just in time as possible. And that's another thing that our global design and construction teams are actively looking at. So those are the things that are going on right now in terms of us being able to respond to that. We do see plenty of opportunity, and we're going to be selective about that because not every deal is something that we're going to chase, but the ones that we think are critical to winning in the cloud and -- are things that we will pursue."

We've already say FFO, what I would say, first and foremost, is I think we are firm on what our calculation is going to be on a go-forward basis. We feel good about -- I mean, the biggest area that we're really focusing on those CapEx and making sure we got the recurring CapEx consistent with how we think we should be measuring this metric. And so we've firmed that up, and I would tell you that AFFO, on a principal basis, is firm. And so we continue to review it but I feel very, very comfortable with our current definition. As you can see by all the disclosures we have, we've done a very good reconciliation of what we include between the FFO and the AFFO, and we reconcile also from EBITDA to AFFO. So that's what we feel comfortable with. And we'll tell you that the $810 million -- clearly, the $810 million, as I said, currency is impacting that number by $43 million, interest piece on the November financing, as an opportunistic financing, relative to our expectations, add back another $27 million. If we hadn't done that, our number would've been more like $880 million on a constant currency basis or roughly 16% up quarter-over-quarter. And then going back to the comment just on currency. When we look at currency, again, we did some bridges in our presentation. And so when you go to pages 16 and 17, you get a pretty good sense of how currency has impacted it. Suffice it to say, I don't have the exact number, but what we give you was in the press release, we told you the rates of exchange that we're using for our currency. And embedded in that, of course, if you take euro, for example, it's trading -- spot today is roughly 1.13 and we've got a blended rate of 1.20. And it's still different from what we experienced last quarter where basically spot was roughly 1.26 and we're guiding you at 1.32. And all that to say is that we are looking at a relatively big currency impact on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And so as we sort of presented in our reconciliations, in our bridges, you'll see absent taking out currency, we're reporting revenues flat quarter-over-quarter. Currency is having a 3 percentage -- 3 points of gross impact on our Q1 results. So we've now got the guidance range, we've got what we think is the size of the impact, and that should give you a good step forward, in how to look at the business."

So the combination that you're referring to over there, we're obviously have watched it, we'll watch it. Our -- those kinds of size of companies have been on our game board forever. Our interest is, again, back to what I said earlier, which is to scale this platform globally to bolt more things on, like Brazil and Dubai. We feel like the business that we're doing in Europe, which is growing faster than both of those assets, is doing exactly what we wanted it to do. If you remember, when we went into Europe, 2008, the IXEurope asset was the third-largest player. I think at that time, Telecity, if I remember correctly, was #1, Interxion was #2. 5 years later now, with the global platform wrapped around our EMEA business, this business is growing 2x as fast as our competitors. So it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do, and that's where our priority and focus is going to remain. And we compete with regional providers all over the world. I think it'll be no different as we look at this potential combined competitor."

I guess I'll add, Jonathan, is that, again, we really operate primarily and compete primarily as a global platform. And so in our view, the combination would meaningfully change the competitive dynamic there. The assets that are in play in terms of how they meet the customers' needs are essentially the same in a post-combination world. And again, most of the customers who really resonate with the Equinix value proposition are often looking for a global player. As we've talked about and I think highlighted here in the metrics in our business, a substantial portion of our revenue is from customers who are operating with us in a multi-region way. And so we're going to continue to sell into those opportunities. We think we can compete very effectively with those companies either independently or in combination. And then as it relates to the platform players, we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing in terms of platform players and the reach that they have into the market, particularly from a cloud perspective as customers look at the hybrid cloud implementation. And so that's one of the significant investments we're making, is putting channel partners and channel program investments sort of into the system on a global basis. And we're seeing levels of engagement between ourselves and the sales teams of key partners like a NetApp, like a Microsoft, et cetera, as being a very meaningful way that we're going to gain access to the enterprise market. And when you look at that, I mean, as we talked about at Analyst Day, it's a huge addressable market. Several hundred thousand possible target customers for the services that we deliver. And we're simply not going to reach those with our direct quota-bearing headcount. And so it's critical that we invest in the programs and the channel sales resources to partner up with those types of players."

First and foremost, with the guidance that we've delivered, we said for the year, we can do greater than $1.22 billion on EBITDA line. If I take you to 2014, we did $1.114 billion but included in that number, of course, are the REIT costs. And the REIT costs, recognizing most of those are going to go away, I add $17 million. So in total, we spent $29 million in '14, we're only going to spend $12 million in '15. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our margin is 46.3%. So what we said is just on the guidance that we delivered, so we can do greater than $1.22 billion. That's 46.4% margin. As we look forward, we've announced 2 things that we're going to do, and Charles has talked to 1, which is investing in the channel, which is $20 million, and integrating ALOG, which is $7 million. If I add those 2 -- sort of those 2 things back, that's 47 -- sorry, 47.4% margin. But the other thing, currency, because we're a U.S. dollar denominated company, a lot of our cost reside in U.S. dollars. The impact of the currency affecting our revenues and our EBITDA, it's affecting our margin by another 90 basis points. So all that to say is when I reconcile out 2015 relative to 2014, we see basically a 48.3% margin business, with some discrete investments that we're making in channel and the one-off investment in ALOG. That relative to what we exited in 2014, which is really an adjusted 46.3%. So overall, we feel that the business is performing well. Currency, yes, it's working against us a little bit today. But given our ability to reallocate our resources, invest in the right things for our future growth, we think it's the right investment decisions to make."

Really, the most important being yield and our MRR per cab metrics. As you can see in our regional results, we saw strength across all 3 regions on a constant currency basis in our MRR per cab. So we continue to really benefit from how we're managing the business both in terms of entry price points on deals as well as -- which is really driven by yield discipline as well as interconnection and then managing power densities effectively. And so those levers really have given us strong performance on a yield basis. The other dimension of pricing is really, as I said, entry-level price points on deals and obviously the sort of supply-demand characteristics in the market influence that heavily. And I guess what I would say is, one, where we are -- we're being very -- continue to be very disciplined about the deals we are pursuing and pursuing those where we have a unique and differentiated value proposition. And so we continue to see firm pricing there. And even where there are -- where we would want to selectively pursue, say, larger footprint deals or deals where the competitive overlap with other players may be higher, what we are seeing is, I would say, a favorable balance on overall supply-demand across many of our markets and a general stabilization in the pricing environment."

Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we walk through the results of the quarter, I'd like to reflect on the milestones that we achieved in 2014.
To start, turning to Slide 3. We leveraged significant market momentum to deliver another strong year of financial results, generating $2.44 billion of revenue, up 14% year-over-year, and over $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA or 46% margin and growing AFFO 12% to $762 million.
Second, we established Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud by partnering with an all-star list of cloud providers including AWS, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft, and won business from a host of enterprises who are taking advantage of their presence to implement hybrid cloud architectures at Equinix. We have continued to innovate and enhance our offer set to help transform enterprise IT, launching 2 new solutions in 2014, Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange.
The traction we are seeing is very compelling as hundreds of customers are now using these solutions to improve network and enterprise application performance as well as accelerating cloud adoption.
Third, we expanded our global platform, completing 10 major IBX expansions in 2014, including projects in Amsterdam, Dallas, SÃ£o Paulo, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. We are successfully creating value over the long term through our development pipeline, achieving attractive returns and healthy yield on stabilized assets with our premium value proposition.
Given the market strength, we are continuing to grow our presence in core markets, and in the first half of this year, we are opening 5 new IBXs in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto, as well as a new metro in Melbourne, Australia.
Fourth, we extended our position as the global interconnection leader, with interconnection revenue continuing to outpace overall revenue, growing 16% year-over-year and further demonstrating the strength of our ecosystem. Customers interconnecting across Platform Equinix resulted in 18,500 new cross connects in 2014, with a notable uptick in the latter half of the year, driven by strong growth in the network and acceleration of private connections to the cloud.
Our digital exchanges also saw a sizable increase in both traffic and sales, adding approximately 600 ports in 2014, about 2.5x more adds than the prior year.
And finally, we successfully began operating as a REIT on January 1 and are very pleased to announce our first quarterly dividend program. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, including raising and refinancing our high-yield notes and senior debt in the fourth quarter and feel very good about our liquidity position and capital structure. This strategic and operational flexibility will allow for continued reinvestment in our business and new market development along with distributions to our shareholders on a quarterly basis.
As we enter 2015, we see continued momentum in our core business and are well positioned to execute on emerging growth opportunities by expanding our routes to market and further enhancing our solutions portfolio.
As applications become increasingly interactive, solving conflicts interconnection scenarios is mission-critical for today's business. We believe our global scale, as well as our network and cloud density, puts us in a unique position to solve these challenges. Today, we have over 4,800 customers and expect to significantly expand our customer base over the next several years as Platform Equinix becomes increasingly relevant to a larger universe of buyers.
Now turning to the quarter. We delivered record gross and net bookings, driven by strong performance across all 3 regions, solid new customer additions and continued expansion of our cloud ecosystem. An increase in global deployments and accelerated interconnection growth are helping contribute to firm yield and reduce churn. We continue to see customers expand their geographic reach across Platform Equinix. And today, 67% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 63% last year. And 81% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 79% last year.
Now let me share the highlights of our industry vertical performance this past quarter. Our network vertical delivered steady growth as wireline carriers upgrade core node infrastructure to support exponential traffic growth in new services, and several of our most strategic customers began to bundle Equinix into their custom enterprise solutions. Network interconnection also experienced strong growth as both connections to and from our network customers grew more than 20% year-over-year. Emerging demand for mobile platforms is generating new business, and wins in this vertical include EE, the U.K.'s largest 4G operator, and Truphone, a global mobile network operator. Content and digital media delivered a record quarter, with healthy demand from large content players and rapid growth in our advertising subsegment, which is gaining traction as real-time ad placement becomes a cornerstone of the company's advertising strategy.
Cloud adoption is on the rise among content and digital media companies as they leverage the scaling advantages offered by cloud and seek the low-latency required to deliver the highest quality user experience. For example, global publishing company HarperCollins recently chose to connect to Microsoft Azure through the Equinix Cloud Exchange inside our London IBX in order to achieve guaranteed levels of security and latency with improved operational resilience and flexibility.
Turning to financial services. We saw steady growth and continued progress in diversifying our financial services business across insurance, retail banking and digital payments and processing. Our 5 largest financial deals of the quarter came from these sectors, including a top 15 global retail bank, a top 5 global insurance firm and the third largest global payments and analytics provider. Electronic payments, in particular, is an area where we, I think, have been increasingly focused, and we see potential for a digital commerce ecosystem to emerge, spanning multiple industries. We have captured over 50 customers in the digital commerce space, including Adyen, a global payments technology provider, leveraging Equinix's network density and cloud connectivity to enable global payments for merchants from anywhere in the world.
Turning to our cloud and enterprise verticals. The enterprise shift from centralized in-house IT infrastructure to distributed hybrid and public cloud architectures is driving an incremental and transformational opportunity that we expect to be Equinix's top growth vector over the next several years. In the fourth quarter, cloud and IT services again delivered record bookings, and we now have over 1,250 cloud and IT service companies driving 27% of our revenue. Expansions on AWS, Oracle, Microsoft and T-Systems drove strong momentum in the quarter, and we saw an uptick in larger footprint deals as the size of deployment for public and private cloud access nodes have expanded given the rapid growth in this market.
Cloud service providers continue to choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment, cutting-edge application performance and unmatched reliability. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our intelligent switching platform that enables companies to connect directly and securely to multiple cloud and network providers, continues to scale and is now live in 19 markets globally. Over 100 companies, enterprises, networks and cloud service providers, have joined the Equinix Cloud Exchange and new wins include Google, IBM SoftLayer, Fusionapps as well as Pacnet, Tata and Telecom Italia. Google and IBM SoftLayer are 2 important platform wins that enhance the value and diversity of our cloud ecosystem. Equinix will offer high performance direct access to Google's cloud platform in 15 markets and to the IBM SoftLayer platform in 9 markets this year.
On the enterprise side, as leading companies around the globe operate increasingly interconnected and on-demand business models, we are experiencing significant momentum in the enterprise market. Over 100 customers have deployed Performance Hub, our targeted solution that allows customers to deploy IT resources closer to the user population and provide secure high-bandwidth connectivity to a variety of networks and cloud. This distributed interconnection-based approach to data center computing provides significant benefits in both application and network performance. Enterprise wins include General Electric as well as GP Strategies, a management consulting and engineering services firm, and Metso, a leading process provider for mining and oil and gas.
So let me stop here and turn the call over to Keith to provide some deeper results -- deeper details of the results for the quarter."

Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone.
To start, I'd like to first review some of our 2014 highlights and then I'll turn to our fourth quarter performance.
We reported revenues of $2.44 billion, representing an almost 14% year-over-year growth rate. All 3 regions delivered better than expectation, with EMEA and Asia Pacific showing reported growth of 21% and 19%, respectively, while the Americas region produced greater-than-expected growth of 9% on its much larger base.
We continue to balance margin expectations with the reinvestment in the business to drive our future growth. Our gross profit margin was 51% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% after taking into consideration significant investment in expansion activities across the regions as well as directing approximately $30 million in operating expenses to fund new product innovations such as Cloud Exchange and Performance Hub.
Also, in 2014, we continue to scale our go-to-market efforts to better position ourselves to attract the enterprise customer. Despite these investments, our margins remained stable, and we continue to target a longer-term objective of achieving 50% adjusted EBITDA margins or better.
We continue to focus on the balance sheet and find ways to optimize our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we refreshed our debt structure and secured $2.75 billion of new financing. This puts us in a great position to fund both our existing and new initiatives, invest in the development pipeline and fund our quarterly dividend.
So let me now turn to Slide 4 as I'd like to highlight how we allocated the resources in 2014. First, we generated approximately $709 million in adjusted cash from operations and then reinvested $660 million of this cash into development and other projects that have consistently high levels of return, including our newly opened Melbourne and Singapore IBXs. We now have 103 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint in the world. We purchased the remaining shares of ALOG in Brazil and now own 100% of this important South American asset.
Also, we continue to increase the number of assets that's owned and developed for the purchase of land for our current and our future Melbourne IBXs. And finally, we repurchased 298 million of Equinix stock in 2014 and completed a $416 million special distribution for stockholders, which included $83 million in cash.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Simply put, it was another outstanding quarter for the Equinix team. Our strategy continues to deliver better-than-expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings, and our quarterly key metrics remained solid, including MRR per cabinet, especially on an FX-neutral basis, and net cabinets billing. Also, our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 5,600 net cross connects and 130 exchange ports this quarter alone.
As depicted on Slide 5, global Q4 revenues were $638.1 million, our 48th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 13% over the same quarter last year.
Our overperformance was due to higher gross bookings, lower than unplanned MRR churn and continued custom sales order activity. Our Q4 revenue performance net of our FX hedges absorbs an $8.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $1 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Currency volatility against all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds this quarter and meaningfully affected our 2015 guidance. Our largest exposure to FX movement related to the weakening of the Brazilian real, the British pound and the euro. For 2015, we've layered in new hedges approximating 80% coverage against our EMEA operating currencies for the full year. Besides the negative FX impact on our 2015 guidance, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has created a $100 million FX headwind against revenues and a $47 million headwind against our adjusted EBITDA.
Cash SG&A expenses increased $147.8 million for the quarter, higher than guidance, primarily due to a December change in our commission practices, where our sales reps will now earn their sales commission when their order is booked versus when the order is billed. This change was made to better align our comp practices with the market and to enable us to better track these costs as we measure our business performance. As a result, we accelerated on a onetime basis $7 million of sales commission cost into the fourth quarter. This was not included in our prior guidance.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $294.4 million, at the top end of our guidance range and up 12% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $1.1 million currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $3.4 million net positive impact when compared to the FX guidance rates.
In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $355.1 million. Consistent with our comments from the last earnings call, a large portion of this loss relates to the writeoff of deferred tax assets totaling $324 million as we formalize our conversion to a REIT. Also, we recorded a $106 million loss on debt extinguishment related to our refinancing efforts.
Our Q4 operating cash flow decreased slightly over the prior quarter to $202.3 million, largely due to increased cash interest and taxes paid. Also, our DSOs improved 2 days to 37 days. Our AFFO for the year was $761.7 million, higher than our expectations, mainly due to lower-than-expected recurring CapEx and cash taxes.
MRR churn was better than anticipated at 1.9%, the second quarter in a row where we're below the 2% threshold, and we believe reflects some level of stabilization of this key metric. For the full year 2015, we expect our MRR churn rate to range between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, although we do expect the average to be at the lower end of this range.
Now moving on to our comments on REIT. Well, we've officially begun operating as a REIT as of January 1, 2015, which is a significant and exciting milestone for the company. That said, to give you a perspective on how we've structured our REIT assets, we've placed the majority of our U.S. and European assets along with our Japanese assets under the qualified REIT structure or QRS. With the rest of Asia, Brazil and Canada placed in our TRS or taxable REIT structure. This is important to note as the taxable income from our QRS business is what drives our dividend payout requirement. In addition, while we don't yet have our PLR in hand, we continue to expect to receive a favorable PLR in 2015.
On Slide 6, we summarize our expected REIT-related cash cost and taxes. We expect our second special distribution to range between $580 million and $680 million and to be paid in Q4 of 2015. Our REIT-related cash cost should approximate $12 million in 2015 and including $2 million of onetime cost to finalize the REIT structure.
And finally, we expect our effective worldwide tax rate, excluding REIT-related cash taxes, to range between 10% and 15% in 2015, although this range may narrow as we continue to review our tax operating structure.
Turning to Slide 7, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong quarter, delivering its second highest gross bookings activity with record cross-connect additions. These results clearly show the benefits from our core strategy. The Americas revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter and 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis.
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 5% over the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. America adjusted EBITDA margin was 47% for the quarter, a step-up over the prior quarter due to lower seasonal utility expenses. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $7 million to integrate our ALOG business.
Americas' net cabinets billing increased by 500 in the quarter, lower than last quarter, largely due to timing of installations. We added a record 3,500 net cross connects and 95 exchange ports in Q4, highlighting the strong demand for our Americas digital exchanges.
With respect to region's new builds, we're expanding our Dallas 2 IBX in the Infomart, which is the primary interconnection building in the Dallas market.
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 8. EMEA delivered a strong quarter with record gross bookings, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses. Revenues were up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our EMEA business continues to capture market share, growing twice as fast as our regional competitors. Also, we'd like to highlight the improved German performance throughout the year, the result of new leadership, better execution and renewed focus across our German team.
Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 1% over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased slightly to 42% due to one-off costs in the fourth quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues increased 2% over the prior quarter and up 29% over the same quarter last year and represents 9% of the region's recurring revenues. We added 1,200 net cross connects in the quarter and EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 600.
Moving to expansion opportunities. The Frankfurt market has performed very well in 2014, and we've seen a substantial increase in our fill rate compared to the prior year. To support this demand, we're expanding both our Frankfurt 2 and our Frankfurt 4 IBXs. We're also accelerating the third phase of our Amsterdam 3 asset to respond to sales momentum in the Dutch business. Located on the Amsterdam Science Park, this is second most fiber-dense location in Europe and an important interconnection hub for our customers.
Now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 9. Asia Pacific revenues were up 7% over the prior quarter and 29% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by record gross booking in the cloud and IT services and network segment. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 9% over the last quarter and 34% over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was up 3% quarter-over-quarter largely due to increased power density and a steady increase in interconnection revenues. Also, cabinets billing increased by 700 over the prior quarter. We added 900 net cross connects and interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues.
In December, we opened our first data center in Melbourne, Australia, expanding Platform Equinix to 33 markets. The Melbourne business already logged more than 40 new customers, including 11 network service providers.
We're also expanding into Hong Kong market with new phases in both Hong Kong 1 and Hong Kong 2 IBXs to support deployments from the digital media and financial verticals.
And now looking at our balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. Fourth quarter was very active from a capital structure perspective. We settled our 2014 converts, we completed 2 new debt deals, securing $2.75 billion in fundings. We used the proceeds from these offerings to redeem our 7% senior notes, settle the make-whole payment and repay our prior term loan. These transactions effectively lowered the average cost of our debt financings to 4.93%. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and our net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to 3x of Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA.
Now switching to AFFO and our dividend outlook for -- on Slide 11. For 2015, we expect the AFFO to be greater than $810 million or growing 12% on a constant currency basis. This guidance absorbs $43 million in negative FX headwinds as well as an incremental $27 million in interest expense related to our November financing.
Also, today, we're excited to announce our first quarterly dividend of $1.69 per share, a very important milestone for Equinix. We expect to pay out 100% of our QRS taxable income. Our current AFFO payout ratio approximates 48%, the result of significant international assets still structured under our TRS as well as significant tax depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses.
For 2016 and beyond, we'll continue to review our QRS TRS REIT structure. It's important to note that our goal is to maximize total shareholder return. This is facilitated by our flexibility to support our growing cash dividend as we continue to scale our business and more of our assets move into the QRS structure while continuing to invest in our development activities.
Turning to Slide 12. Given the cash in the balance sheet, add to that our growing cash flows, plus our debt capacity, we're well positioned to fund our 2015 development activities, pay our quarterly dividends, including the 2015 special distribution and service our debt obligations. As a REIT, our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio will remain at 3x to 4x. This level of debt provides us a strategic and operational flexibility we need to execute against our business needs.
Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 13. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $238.5 million, including recurring CapEx of $33 million, in line with our guidance. We currently have 16 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 15 are campus builds or incremental phase build. Also note, we've finalized the breakout of CapEx between recurring and nonrecurring for our AFFO definition. This is the format we'll be reporting on, on a go-forward basis.
Turning to Slide 14. The operating performance of our stabilized 69 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than 1 year continue to perform well, with revenues up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Currently these projects generate a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and are 82% utilized.
And lastly, one final point. As part of the REIT conversion, we'll continue to roll out incremental financial data to enable our investors to back and analyze the business. This quarter, we added a supplemental section to our earnings deck, which now includes our non-financial metrics and expansion sheet, as well as some additional disclosure. Starting in Q1, we expect to add additional materials to this earnings deck, including the components of NAV and NOI.
So let me stop there and turn it back to Steve."

Let me now cover our 2015 strategy and outlook on Slide 15. Our focus in 2015 is driven by 3 strategic priorities designed to further differentiate our global data centers services and extend Platform Equinix.
First, we will continue to drive differentiated growth by deepening our existing ecosystems and applying particular focus on capturing the expanded opportunity in cloud and enterprise. With both network and cloud density that is unparalleled, we aim to become the provider of choice for the new age of enterprise IT. We will continue to invest meaningfully in innovation to deliver enhanced offers for multi-cloud consumption and build out our cloud service provider ecosystem, anchored by cloud technology leaders.
Second, to tackle these opportunities effectively, we will also invest in our go-to-market and our global platform to broaden our reach, scale, scale our organization and deliver premium customer services. We will do this by expanding our channel program to enhance our reach into the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators and key platform partners such as Microsoft, NetApp and Cisco, working in tandem with our direct sales engine. Additionally, we are delivering on our commitment to build a professional services practice that aids enterprises in designing and deploying next-generation architectures starting with our acquisition of Nimbo, an established market leader in enabling hybrid cloud. In parallel, we are expanding our sales support and enablement functions, including our solution architects and sales engineers that facilitate the selling process.
To support these efforts and the growth of our sales engine, we are driving global consistency and alignment through our Equinix Customer One program. This initiative is enhancing our customer's experience through global standardization of our products and streamlining our quote-to-cash process. We've successfully rolled this out in Asia in the fourth quarter, and we'll implement the EMEA and Americas regions by mid-2015.
And finally, we will continue to refine our capital allocation strategy of profitable growth through organic and inorganic investments and the distribution of dividends while driving return on invested capital. We continue to ensure that our expansion CapEx supports our growth objectives and optimize this capital outlay while balancing project risk and customer needs. Equinix has a long history of achieving attractive returns in the development of new properties. This is done by building campuses that can be extended with additional premium-priced space connected to our mature data centers where interconnected communities of customers have already been established.
The vast majority of our new development is in existing markets, and our unique market intelligence gained from working with customers gives us visibility into a market's demand, pricing and returns. This knowledge helps us make prudent capital allocation decisions and enables us to maintain highly differentiated project returns.
Last, I'll cover our outlook for 2015 on Slide 16 to 19. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $634 million to $638 million, which absorbs $19 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4 2014 average FX rate, a normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $146 million to $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $287 million and $291 million, which includes $12 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4 2014 average FX rates and normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be $195 million to $205 million, which includes approximately $25 million of recurring capital expenditures.
For the full year of 2015, we expect revenues to be greater than $2.63 billion, which absorbs $100 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rate, reflecting a normalized and constant currency growth of 12%. Total year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be greater than $1.22 billion or a 46% EBITDA margin, an 80 basis point improvement over last year.
This guidance absorbs $47 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rates. We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $810 million, a 12% constant currency growth year-over-year. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to range between $700 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. For 2015, we expect 95% of this expansion capital expenditure will be for campus and existing market builds and roughly 5% for new market development.
So in closing, we are leveraging our leadership position to build unique customer offers and enhance our ecosystems while scaling the business globally. We are successfully expanding our ecosystem of cloud services which, coupled with our network density, will drive growth across our entire platform. The rapid growth of interconnection reflects the importance of Equinix as the place where leading companies come to connect their customers and partners to accelerate the growth of their business. I'm very pleased with our position going into this year and look forward to continued progress against our objectives.
So let me stop here and open it up for questions. Liz, I'll turn it back over to you."

I guess the second question is for you, Steve, which would be, could you kind of elaborate on your appetite for a large-scale consolidating European transaction? And if so, can you give us details on that? And then the third question, I guess is the obvious one, which is a year ago, we heard that the PLR was coming in 2014. Now we're hearing in 2015, that it's coming in 2015. The question I get 10 times more often than any other fundamental question is what possible reason could there that you don't have it already? You've paid a lot of people a lot of money to help you in this process. They must be telling you something. Could you please tell us what it is?"

As I've said in the prepared remarks, when you think about the QRS, it has majority the American business, which is, as you know, as I reported, our slowest-growing business, albeit on a very large base. So our European business on a currency-adjusted basis is our second fastest growing, and then the Japanese business, those are all sitting in the queue. What's not sitting in the queue is the rest of our Asian business. And no surprise to you, that is Hong Kong, that's Australia, that's Singapore. And so when you look at -- I'm sorry, there's Canada and Brazil. Brazil, because of the managed services business, you can appreciate it. It doesn't have the revenue type that's really suitable for REIT. And so think of Brazil as being inside the T on a continuous basis. For the remaining assets, you can get a good sense. When you think about Singapore, you think about Australia, you think about [indiscernible] for Toronto 2 asset in Canada, you're going to have a lot of growth still coming from inside the T. And over time, the reason we're structured today as is, we're trying to do it tax efficiently, but we also have to meet the REIT compliance test in 2015 with being a conversion year, you have to be very thoughtful about what assets you move in over what period of time. All of that is to say when you look at the Q or you look at the T, both have very good growth potential. And over time, not only growth in the overall business but certainly as we move assets from the T into the Q, it will give you the opportunity to get growth on the dividend."

I guess, I'd start with reminding the audience on the phone that our priorities for inorganic growth, really around 3 areas. One, scaling our platform globally, very similar with what we did in Brazil, in Dubai, for example, entering those new markets over the last 18, 24 months. That's still of high interest to growing our platform globally. I guess the second component might be our continued focus on enhancing our interconnection and growing that platform very similar to what we did in Germany with the ancotel acquisition. So I would tell you that we look for those kinds of plays constantly. And then third, certainly growing over the last couple of years is capturing the cloud ecosystem and enhancing the enterprise capability to connect to the cloud ecosystem. And the acquisition of Nimbo, its professional services capability, that's aimed at enterprise hybrid cloud enablement, is a step in that direction to accelerate our ability to prosecute the cloud business. So we look at a lot of things. As you all know, the new markets include big, big regions like South Korea and India and going deeper into China and going deeper into Latin America. So we're looking at lots of regions of the world. South Africa is of interest to us. So we've been pretty consistent on the places that's generally a platform of interest to us. Europe is still obviously a very interesting marketplace for us. I wouldn't want to comment specifically on anything that we were all reading about here recently. With respect to our European business, we're very pleased with where we are with that business. As Keith mentioned, it grew 21% year-on-year. It's growing substantially faster because of the inbound bookings we push into that region from the other 2 regions. Interconnection growth grew 30% year-on-year, so it's doing very, very well. Our focus here is to continue to grow that business as it is today, and we'll continue to compete with the regional players in all parts of the world. We think we've done it very successfully. Our mantra is to continue on this global platform focus. So I don't know if anybody would add anything there, Charles or Keith, on the European question. On the PLR, top of everybody's mind, I think given our position on our first quarterly dividend, David, I guess all I can say is that we're still highly confident that we're going to get a response here in 2015. And that's based on the existing legal precedence that's out there today, with the fact that many other data center companies are currently operating as REITs. So we believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT. Unfortunately, they're -- it's out of our hands right now. The ball is in the IRS's court. We provided them everything that they need. And you have to remember here also that the previous couple of players that went through this process, I think Iron Mountain and Lamar, and I forget a couple others, actually all received their -- a couple of those guys received their PLRs post conversion. So these conditions that we're living in today are not terribly unusual. I think everybody's frustrated about it but we still remain highly confident that we'll get a positive response here in 2015."

I'll take that one. I think that -- a couple of things. Again, what we're seeing is our investment in pro services really responds to what we're seeing from our enterprise customers in terms of what they need to implement hybrid cloud effectively. And what we're finding is that they're at a stage where they are still examining how hybrid cloud fits, how they can implement it, which workloads they would want to consider moving into a hybrid cloud environment, which ones they may want to keep in a more traditional co-location setting, how -- what workloads lend themselves well to a public cloud interconnect and then how to implement that over time, particularly in a highly distributed fashion globally for larger players. So that's the type of advice that they are looking for before they make commitments and execute plans on hybrid cloud implementation. And Nimbo was already actively engaged with customers of ours and with partners of ours like Microsoft in those types of discussions. And so we're very excited about the opportunity, and in fact, have gotten a ton of positive feedback from partners like Microsoft and existing customers about that capability. And so that's the essence of what they're doing. Again, it's early days, but we continue to be really optimistic about what that means for us and for our customers as they look to implement hybrid cloud. In terms of margins, I would say that the overall scale of the business is a couple of things. We are -- our objective here is not to grow a professional services firm for the purpose of growing our top line. It is really to drive pull-through and demand for Platform Equinix over time as a hybrid cloud enablement platform. And so we're going to do that kind of business. We'll do it at reasonable margins. They will certainly be lower than our services business. But the overall scale of the business will be relatively immaterial and not have a significant impact on the overall margin structure."

Number two, the book-to-bill interval, so certainly, there are some of that, that bleeds into the results.

I would tell you, as we look in this quarter, it's roughly just over 5 -- NRR is roughly 5% of our revenues. But relative to where we had come from, we do a little bit more.

I think, look, certainly, we went to the market opportunistically in the end of November -- or sorry, in November. And we did that for a couple of reasons. One, we felt it's a good time to go and refinance. We wanted to take out our 7% senior notes. We wanted to put a new term loan in place. We also wanted to have a revolving line of credit. And that $1.5 billion facility between the term loan and the line of credit is very, very cheap money for us. It's up 2%. When you think about the high yield that we did on a blended basis between the 7s and 10s, it's the 5.52% cost of capital. All that to say, as I said in my comments, our cost of funds today on a blended basis for all our financings is 4.93%. So that's the first thing. The second thing I want to leave you with is the $1.1 million, as I said, we opportunistically went to market in November. It is not our expectations that we're going to carry that level of cash on a go-forward basis. And suffice it to say, when you think about the capital investment that we're going to be making this year and you add to that, basically, the dividends that we're going to be disbursing, plus perhaps some asset acquisitions, some land or some buildings, all of a sudden, you can get a pretty good sense that we're going to consume a fairly meaty piece of that $1.1 billion. And therefore, as you roll forward in time beyond 2015, I would expect that you would see us either continue to consume cash from the balance sheet as we generated, but also going to a revolving line of credit. And then as times permit, we can go back to the market and raise more debt to fund the future growth. And so that's how we were sort of seeing it. I would tell you, I don't think that you're going to see a lot of cash left on our balance sheet on a regular basis given the fact that we've now converted to a REIT."

I'll take the first piece around large footprint and then let Keith handle the other ones. As we've said consistently over the years, our ecosystem-centric strategy is very focused on putting the right customers with the right applications into the right assets, and that really continues to be the case. But undoubtedly, and as we did comment in the script, we are seeing an uptick in the requirements around large footprint, particularly for cloud service providers who are looking to rapidly scale their business on a global basis. And that's -- again, we've been -- we've sort of always had that posture of, hey, there are large footprint deals that we believe are accretive to the overall ecosystem story that we will pursue and that we believe can, sort of because of their ecosystem power, sort of support the right kind of long-term blended returns. And we are seeing those and winning that type of business. And in terms of how we accommodate it, I think that I would say in Asia and Europe, we have typically sort of managed our facilities as somewhat blended facilities anyway with a combination of sort of small, medium and large footprint deals going into those facilities. In the U.S, it has been a little different in that there are specific assets where we are in a better position to accommodate large footprint at the right kind of price points, at the right dynamics for customers. And we continue to have that capacity available to us. And so we were looking at selectively putting those into markets around the world. And we are also looking to expand our capabilities and looking at our investment portfolio and plan to continue to put the right kind of capacity in the right places and looking at evolving the offers so that we can deploy essentially hybrid infrastructures that allow us to ebb and flow with the market demand and put the right mix of larger footprint and traditional premium retail into a market at once, and doing that in a way that we also are looking to sort of phase the capital more aggressively by really doing it as just in time as possible. And that's another thing that our global design and construction teams are actively looking at. So those are the things that are going on right now in terms of us being able to respond to that. We do see plenty of opportunity, and we're going to be selective about that because not every deal is something that we're going to chase, but the ones that we think are critical to winning in the cloud and -- are things that we will pursue."

We feel good about -- I mean, the biggest area that we're really focusing on those CapEx and making sure we got the recurring CapEx consistent with how we think we should be measuring this metric. And so we've firmed that up, and I would tell you that AFFO, on a principal basis, is firm. And so we continue to review it but I feel very, very comfortable with our current definition. As you can see by all the disclosures we have, we've done a very good reconciliation of what we include between the FFO and the AFFO, and we reconcile also from EBITDA to AFFO. So that's what we feel comfortable with. And we'll tell you that the $810 million -- greater than $810 million, as I said, currency is impacting that number by $43 million, interest based on the November financing, as an opportunistic financing, relative to our expectations, add back another $27 million. If we hadn't done that, our number would've been more like $880 million on a constant currency basis or roughly 16% up quarter-over-quarter. And then going back to the comment just on currency. When we look at currency, again, we did some bridges in our presentation. And so when you go to pages 16 and 17, you get a pretty good sense of how currency has impacted it. Suffice it to say, I don't have the exact number, but what we give you was in the press release, we told you the rates of exchange that we're using for our currency. And embedded in that, of course, if you take euro, for example, it's trading -- spot today is roughly 1.13 and we've got a blended rate of 1.20. And it's no different from what we experienced last quarter where basically spot was roughly 1.26 and we're guiding you at 1.32. And all that to say is that we are looking at a relatively big currency impact on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And so as we sort of presented in our reconciliations, in our bridges, you'll see absent taking out currency, we're reporting revenues flat quarter-over-quarter. Currency is having a 3 percentage -- 3 points of growth impact on our Q1 results. So we've now got the guidance range, we've got what we think is the size of the impact, and that should give you a good step forward, in how to look at the business."

I think I've stated -- I tried to be clear on the first question was asked about this, about where our priorities are for inorganic growth, and that's where the focus is. So the combination that you're referring to over there, we're obviously have watched it, we'll watch it. Our -- those kinds of size of companies have been on our game board forever. Our interest is, again, back to what I said earlier, which is to scale this platform globally, to bolt more things on, like Brazil and Dubai. We feel like the business that we're doing in Europe, which is growing faster than both of those assets, is doing exactly what we wanted it to do. If you remember, when we went into Europe, 2008, the IXEurope asset was the third-largest player. I think at that time, Telecity, if I remember correctly, was #1, Interxion was #2. 5 years later now, with the global platform wrapped around our EMEA business, this business is growing 2x as fast as our competitors. So it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do, and that's where our priority and focus is going to remain. And we compete with regional providers all over the world. I think it'll be no different as we look at this potential combined competitor."

I guess I'll add, Jonathan, is that, again, we really operate primarily and compete primarily as a global platform. And so in our view, the combination wouldn't meaningfully change the competitive dynamic there. The assets that are in play in terms of how they meet the customers' needs are essentially the same in a post-combination world. And again, most of the customers who really resonate with the Equinix value proposition are often looking for a global player. As we've talked about and I think highlighted here in the metrics in our business, a substantial portion of our revenue is from customers who are operating with us in a multi-region way. And so we're going to continue to sell into those opportunities. We think we can compete very effectively with those companies either independently or in combination. And then as it relates to the platform players, we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing in terms of platform players and the reach that they have into the market, particularly from a cloud perspective as customers look at the hybrid cloud implementation. And so that's one of the significant investments we're making, is putting channel partners and channel program investments sort of into the system on a global basis. And we're seeing levels of engagement between ourselves and the sales teams of key partners like a NetApp, like a Microsoft, et cetera, as being a very meaningful way that we're going to gain access to the enterprise market. And when you look at that, I mean, as we talked about at Analyst Day, it's a huge addressable market. Several hundred thousand possible target customers for the services that we deliver. And we're simply not going to reach those with our direct quota-bearing headcount. And so it's critical that we invest in the programs and the channel sales resources to partner up with those types of players."

And I think we're constantly -- we're obviously very focused on continuing to reduce churn and make sure that there are no regrettable churn losses in our business. And candidly, there are very few today. For the most part, what we see is frictional churn associated with people optimizing platforms and footprints over time in response to a changing dynamic in their business. And so I don't know that we can answer whether there is. Certainly, I think that we have the opportunity to continue to reduce it over time. But I think the range that we've given you and kind of where within that range we expect to operate is our best current view. Over time, and particularly as we scale the enterprise opportunity and if we're winning the kinds of business that we expect to win around Performance Hub implementation, attached to cloud exchange, as part of an overall hybrid cloud implementation, we believe that will be very sticky business, like much of the rest of what we offer today. And so yes, we would strive to be driving that lower, that increases customer lifetime value and creates long-term intrinsic value for the business. So we're going to -- we would strive for that.

And then churn-wise, I would say to be determined, right, because these new implementations, these new enterprise implementations, particularly Performance Hub, is a new offering for us. Again, we believe, based on what we're seeing, because of how it leverages our network density and how it leverages our cloud density, we think they're going to be very sticky over time.

And I want to also supplement it with your comments just on margins as well. I think, like anything, when the currencies -- when our functional currency, which is USD, is strong, clearly, it gives you an opportunity to look at initiatives. And from our perspective, because we're already ingesting quite handsomely across our portfolio and across the regions, I would tell you it's not going to make us do anything radically different. But like anything, when you look at it and you look at the decision of when to put capital work in a given market, clearly, it can work to your advantage. And so whether it's the U.S. -- sorry, whether it's the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar, or for that matter, the Singaporean dollar, to the extent that we can use it to our advantage, we certainly will. I think what's most important though is if I step back and just talk overall about our margins, which is something I really wanted to get out because there's been a number of questions that we've received on that. When I take -- when I look at '15 and we look forward and sort of the impact that currency had on our margins, why don't I just sort of walk you all through something. First and foremost, with the guidance that we've delivered, we said for the year, we can do greater than $1.22 billion on EBITDA line. If I take you to 2014, we did $1.114 billion but included in that number, of course, are the REIT costs. And the REIT costs, recognizing most of those are going to go away, I add $17 million. So in total, we spent $29 million in '14, we're only going to spend $12 million in '15. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our margin is 46.3%. So what we said is just on the guidance that we delivered, so we can do greater than $1.22 billion. That's 46.4% margin. As we look forward, we've announced 2 things that we're going to do, and Charles has talked to 1, which is investing in the channel, which is $20 million, and integrating ALOG, which is $7 million. If I add those 2 -- sort of those 2 things back, that's 47 -- sorry, 47.4% margin. But the other thing, currency, because we're a U.S. dollar denominated company, a lot of our cost reside in U.S. dollars. The impact of the currency affecting our revenues and our EBITDA, it's affecting our margin by another 90 basis points. So all that to say is when I reconcile out 2015 relative to 2014, we see basically a 48.3% margin business, with some discrete investments that we're making in channel and the one-off investment in ALOG. That relative to what we exited in 2014, which is really an adjusted 46.3%. So overall, we feel that the business is performing well. Currency, yes, it's working against us a little bit today. But given our ability to reallocate our resources, invest in the right things for our future growth, we think it's the right investment decisions to make."

Really, the most important being yield and our MRR per cab metrics. As you can see in our regional results, we saw strength across all 3 regions on a constant currency basis in our MRR per cab. So we continue to really benefit from how we're managing the business both in terms of entry price points on deals as well as -- which is really driven by deal discipline as well as interconnection and then managing power densities effectively. And so those levers really have given us strong performance on a yield basis. The other dimension of pricing is really, as I said, entry-level price points on deals and obviously the sort of supply-demand characteristics in the market influence that heavily. And I guess what I would say is, one, where we are -- we're being very -- continue to be very disciplined about the deals we are pursuing and pursuing those where we have a unique and differentiated value proposition. And so we continue to see firm pricing there. And even where there are -- where we would want to selectively pursue, say, larger footprint deals or deals where the competitive overlap with other players may be higher, what we are seeing is, I would say, a favorable balance on overall supply-demand across many of our markets and a general stabilization in the pricing environment."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This marks our 49th quarter of consecutive revenue growth, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance range as demand for interconnection continues to drive strong performance in all 3 regions. 
As depicted on Slide 3 of our presentation, despite strong currency headwinds, revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year, delivering a 48% margin. AFFO grew 28% year-over-year to $221.8 million. 
We continue to experience strong momentum delivering solid gross and net bookings and healthy fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis, low churn and strong margins. I'm also extremely proud that we were added to both the S&P 500 and the FTSE NAREIT indices, reflecting our scale, REIT structure and the important role that we play in the technology infrastructure industry. We're also working closely with the other REIT indices as we begin our journey in this new category. 
This is our first quarter reporting as a REIT, and we are evolving our message to the market as we diversify our shareholder base. We believe that many of the characteristics our traditional investor base find attractive about Equinix will translate well into the REIT domain, including our unique portfolio of assets, solid stabilized asset growth and a long history of success with new development. 
We continue to roll out incremental financial data to enable our investors to track and analyze our business, including adding disclosures around NOI, NAV and owned assets. These new segments of revenue categorized by stabilized expansion and new and by owned versus leased highlight the diversity and strength of our offers. They also demonstrate how our ecosystems and interconnect should translate into strong NOI, stable pricing and recurring and predictable bookings and returns. 
We now have over 6,300 customers around the globe, which includes 1,400 customers from our ALOG acquisition, which we now have integrated into our metrics. Today, 68% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed in more than 1 region, up from 65% last year, and 82% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 80% last year, demonstrating the extraordinary strength of our global platform.
Revenue from interconnection grew 17% year-over-year, and we added 5,500 cross connects this quarter, which takes us up to over 155,000 cross connects across Platform Equinix. Customers in our network, content and cloud verticals our strong drivers of interconnection growth, and we're also seeing growth in interconnection from the enterprise. 
Cross connects from enterprise companies to all other verticals has ramped to over 30% year-over-year growth. Also, our Internet exchange traffic grew over 65% year-over-year, and in response to the robust demand for high-bandwidth connectivity, we are now offering 100-gigabit port speeds to complement the 10-gigabit increments that customers have historically purchased and continued to deliver the industry's most complete interconnection portfolio. 
This quarter, we opened 5 new flagship data centers, boosting data center and interconnection capacity in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore and Toronto as well as a new Metro in Melbourne, Australia. We now have 105 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint, offering more than 11 million gross square feet of capacity. 
strong fill rates, particularly from cloud providers expanding in Tier 1 metros, we are moving forward with expansions in critical markets. A majority of our development pipeline for the year is focused on campus expansions and augmenting existing data centers, which helps drive operating scale and improves predictability of returns. The stability of our business model continues to deliver attractive growth on our new developments and our stabilized assets, which are tracking to over 33% yields on our gross PP&E investments.
We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including the addition of London-6 this quarter, and owned properties now generate 37% of recurring revenue and 39% of our NOI. Many of our owned facilities are in high-demand metros, including Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London and Silicon Valley, and we expect NOI contribution from these assets to continue to grow as we expand in these markets and selectively pursue asset purchases in other key markets. 
This quarter, we invested $38 million to acquire 34 acres of land next to our Silicon Valley campus, which provides important expansion opportunities for this highly interconnected metro. In Ashburn, with the final expansions of DC-10 and DC-11 underway, we expect to start developing Ashburn North, a 44-acre plot purchased in 2012 that we intend to build out over the next 7 years. Over time, we expect more of our organic growth to come from owned properties as we build on these core campuses.
For the newer REIT investors, business ecosystems inside our data centers are at the heart of our strategic operating model and is a significant differentiator for Equinix. Ecosystems are simply communities of customers who derive value from locating in the same data center to connect to each other to achieve greater application performance and simplified network architectures. 
Interconnection created as an ecosystem generate high returns for our size and increases in value to our customers. For example, some of our more mature campuses where ecosystems are especially vibrant are the most profitable and differentiated, and we typically build new assets adjacent to these sites to capitalize on this value while derisking our returns. 
Strong interconnection exist in each of our major metros with some sites including those in Singapore, Frankfurt, London, Chicago, New York, Ashburn and Silicon Valley having over 10,000 cross connects. About 94% of our colocation square footage is in a metro with at least 1,000 cross connects or more. 
Now let me shift to the quarterly highlights of our top ecosystems. Our high network density continues to create significant interconnection opportunities for a myriad of industries and is driving strong network to network demand as service providers as Platform Equinix to extend their networks and generate new revenue. Our new IBX in Melbourne is a testament to this opportunity with more than 17 global network providers already committed to deploying in this data center. 
We are also enabling network service providers to deliver new cloud services by leveraging both the Equinix Cloud Exchange as well as traditional fiber cross connects. Mobility remains a fast-growing subsegment in the network vertical with mobile providers, including Mobile, T-Mobile and Truphone joining this emerging ecosystem. 
For the content and digital media industry vertical, we continue to attract top content [indiscernible] that are expanding across multiple regions. Our advertising subsegment is thriving, propelled by the shift away from traditional advertising towards digital and mobile advertising placed by transacting on digital exchanges, resulting in a rich and fast-growing ecosystem. Content and digital media companies are also contributing to significantly -- traffic on exchanges as well as driving growth and interconnection.
Turning to our financial services vertical. We are expanding our electronic trading business across new geographies and asset classes. Wins include a leading Canadian foreign exchange broker that is an ecosystem anchor in our Toronto-2 data center, and one of the largest equities operators in the U.S. is expanding in London in addition to consolidating [indiscernible] at our Secaucus campus. 
Further, we continue to see progress as we diversify our financial services business to insurance, retail banking and digital payments sectors. We have won several anchors for the emerging electronic payments ecosystem, including a key win with the largest pan-European credit card payment processor. 
Turning to cloud and IT services. This vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by new wins in expansions with AWS, Cisco, Datapipe, Oracle and T Systems. We are excited about how the cloud opportunity is playing out, and we have another quarter of significant progress as cloud service providers choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our interconnection switching platform that enables companies to connect directly, securely and dynamically through multiple cloud and network providers continues to scale and now has over 120 participants and is live in 20 markets globally. 
Turning to the enterprise vertical. We are seeing strong momentum as enterprises move beyond the exploratory phases of cloud and are beginning to re-architect their IT infrastructure to capture the significant cost, flexibility and security benefits of hybrid cloud deployments. We are seeing strong response from both customers and channel partners to our Performance Hub offer, a solution that distributes and enterprises data center infrastructure across multiple locations to accelerate application delivery and enable efficient secure access to key network and cloud services. Over 130 customers have deployed the Equinix Performance Hub solution, and this quarter, we saw strong growth in existing deployments as well as critical new logo wins.
Notably, this quarter marked one of our largest channel deals to date as we were able to secure a key infrastructure deployment with one of the world's largest providers of athletic apparel, that highly successful joint sales engagement with Datapipe, one of our leading global partners. 
Other enterprise wins this quarter include BRB, a sporting-goods retailer, an automotive component manufacturer; [indiscernible] U.K., health care company; Red Lobster, an American restaurant chain; Ryder, a transportation and supply chain management providers; and BellNet, a supplier of services for paper and energy industries.
Expanding our global channel is a top strategic initiative for Equinix, and we are investing significant resources to ensure our partners are well equipped to deploy compelling IT and cloud solutions for their end customers via Platform Equinix. Along with technology partners AWS, Cisco, Google and Microsoft, other companies that have recently joined the channel partner program include Datalink and Global. 
So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,291493875,797963,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. the only thing better than a strong Q4 and a recurring revenue model is following it up with a strong Q1, and our Q1 results represent a great start to 2015. Our global interconnected platform continue",1888,"Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. the only thing better than a strong Q4 and a recurring revenue model is following it up with a strong Q1, and our Q1 results represent a great start to 2015. Our global interconnected platform continues to deliver strong gross and net bookings and this drives leverage across each of our regions. 
Our key operating metrics remained solid such as net cabinets billing, MRR per cabinet and the MRR churn rate. Our interconnection trends remain very positive [indiscernible] more impotently the value that they bring to the health of our ecosystems. Interconnection revenues now represent 17% of our global recurring revenues. That's 17% year-over-year increase strength across each of our regions. 
Also, our key operating margins continued to improve. Each of our gross profit, cash gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and operating profit experienced a nice step-up this quarter, the result of strong revenue pull-through and lower-than-planned costs. We remain pleased with our performance. Although consistent with our comments in the last earnings call, we do plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and other key initiatives through the end of this year. 
Given success of the first quarter, as Steve will discuss shortly, we're now able to increase our adjusted EBITDA guidance on net currency-neutral basis by $17 million for the year. 
One additional comment before I get to earnings slides. We're very pleased to have completed our first quarter operating and reporting as a REIT, and of course, this includes the issuance of our first quarterly recurring cash dividend. We continue to expect to receive our PLR in 2015 and look forward to sharing the news with you when received.
Now moving to the slides. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. We're now in our 13th year of consecutive quarterly revenue growth. Our revenue's overperformance was due to a number of factors, including favorable net pricing actions and higher-than-expected custom installation activities. 
Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $9.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rate last quarter and a $1.5 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. currency volatility across all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds put in place net cash flow hedges covering greater than 80% of the value risk related to our EMEA operating currencies. This provides for a smooth glide path into 2016.
cash SG&A expenses decreased to $145.3 million for the quarter, primarily due to lower-than-planned advertising and promotion expenses as well as the one-off sales commission expense incurred in Q4 due to the change in our internal policy. We expect our cash SG&A expenses on a quarterly basis to remain roughly flat for the rest of the year.
Total adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million, up above the top end of our guidance range and up 17% year-over-year. This was driven by stronger-than-anticipated gross margins, the result of lower-than-expected utility rates and favorable FX hedges in EMEA. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48%. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to our average rates used last quarter and a $3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global net income of $76.5 million or a diluted earnings per share of $1.34, a strong step-up from last quarter, which was impacted by the write-off of our deferred tax assets due to the REIT conversion and a loss and debt extinguishment related to our Q4 financings. 
Our Q1 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $232.8 million, largely due to lower cash interest and taxes and a reduction in our networking capital position. Our Q1 MRR churn was below our expectations of 1.9%. Although including ALOG, we will be reporting 2%. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to be at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% guidance range over the remainder of the year. 
One final note before I discuss the regional performance. Financial -- pardon me, financial metric sheet is now fully consolidated, including ALOG with 1 exception. We do not include ALOG revenues in our MRR per cabinet metric, given the level of managed services in the revenue line. 
Also, as part of the Equinix Customer One initiative, we've upgraded and automated our inventory tracking systems. Also, we've standardized the cabinet equipment definition, and as a result, we've updated our cabinets billing, our utilization and our MRR per cabinet metrics, including the comparable periods to incorporate this change. As you can see, this change [indiscernible] operating intact.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to start reviewing our original results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong revenues quarter [ph] the result of favorable net pricing action, lower-than-planned MRR churn and an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase in our nonrecurring revenues, largely the result of increased custom installation activity. 
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong cash gross margins, offset in part from the higher seasonal FICO charges. Americas interconnection revenues now represent 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 1,800 net cross connects. 
Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 in the quarter, and we added 85 exchange ports in Q1, which included the sale of our first 6 [ph] 100-gig ports. 
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 6. EMEA delivered another strong quarter, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses, although FX continued to impact our as-reported results. Revenues were up 5% quarter-over-quarter, and 19% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 13% over the prior quarter and 28% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 17% quarter-over-quarter decrease in SG&A, a result of a strong U.S. dollar and a $3 million hedge benefit. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 46%. Normalized for the FX benefit, adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 44%. We had a strong traction in our cloud vertical, including momentum from our support of large cloud providers like Azure and AWS. We had another solid quarter of cross connects, adding 11,500 [ph] net cross connects in the quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis and net cabinets billing increased by 900. 
Now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 7. In Asia Pacific, we had record gross and net bookings this quarter. Revenues were up 4% over the prior quarter and up 25% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum in cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter and 30% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 4% decrease in Q1 SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and lower-than-expected discretionary spending. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 50%. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, and cabinets billing increased by 900 over the prior quarter. We added a record 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. 
Now as we continue to scale our APAC business, we have 8 expansions currently underway across 6 metros, including new phases of newly opened IBXs in Melbourne and Singapore. Also, given the success in the Sydney market, we're now proceeding with the building of our Sydney-4 assets capture this opportunity. 
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash, and our net debt remains consistent with the prior quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to 2.9x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of stronger operating performance and higher-than-expected cash balance at the end of the quarter. A significant portion of this cash will be consumed throughout the remainder of the year, largely from the payment of our quarterly dividends and special distribution, funding of our capital expenditures and the payment of liabilities on our balance sheet. We continue to have a tremendous strategic and operational flexibility to built into our balance sheet and capital structure. This allows us to continue to plan for growth and meet the funding needs for our shareholder distributions.
Now switching to AFFO and dividend on Slide 9. For 2015, we now expect AFFO to be greater than $830 million or growing 15% on a constant currency basis, the benefit of a strong operating performance and a decrease in our planned net interest expense. Our AFFO payout ratio decreased slightly to 46%. 
Also as noted previously, we paid our first regular cash dividend and expect to announce our Q2 dividend shortly. It's important to note that the taxable income from the QRS part of the business ultimately drives the dividend payout requirements. As you may appreciate, there is a direct relation between AFFO and our REIT taxable income. As an example, AFFO represents a global consolidated metric solely relates to our QRS entities. We continue to expect this to be 100% of our QRS's taxable income. 
Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, CapEx was $150.1 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $22 million, lower than our guidance range, primarily due to timing of cash payments. As presented on expansion tracking slide, we currently have 19 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 18 are campus builds or incremental phase builds on over 15 markets. We continue to believe a capital expenditures across multiple regions and phases is the best way to invest in our growth. These 19 projects will increase our current inventory by 10%. We expect our recurring CapEx to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million.
Turning to Slide 11. The operating performance of our stabilized 76 [ph] global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than 1 year continue to perform well. Revenues were up 6% year-over-year, and we continue to enjoy a healthy yield and stabilized assets, reflecting the premium value that is placed on these assets. Currently, these projects generate a 33% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested and 84% utilized on a REIT-calibrated billable inventory capacity. 
Before handing the call back to Steve, I would like to remind you that we've appended our supplemental financial and operating [indiscernible] earnings presentation starting on Slide 16. There are a number of incremental disclosures, including details related to how we segment our business between expansion and stabilized assets over our owned and leased portfolio. Of note, you'll see that our cash gross profit grew 14% over the prior year. Our adjusted cash NOI increased 15% over the prior year to 61%, and our corporate cash SG&A as a percent of total revenues decreased to 9%. And finally, we provided you the key components to our NAV on Slide 30. 
So now I'll turn back the call to Steve."

Let me now cover our 2015 outlook on Slide 15. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $654 million to $658 million, which includes $6 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1",431,"Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2015 outlook on Slide 15. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $654 million to $658 million, which includes $6 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rates and normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. 
Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $144 million to $148 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $304 million and $308 million, which includes $5 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rate. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $220 million, which includes approximately $30 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to be greater than $2.635 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis. This guidance includes $25 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised revenues is a $30 million increase compared to our prior guidance. 
Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.23 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $7 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance range. Excluding this negative impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $17 million increase compared to prior guidance. 
We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $830 million, a 15% constant currency growth year-over-year, effectively a $26 million raise, adjusting for currencies. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $740 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. 
So in closing, our strong results this quarter reflect a continued strength and momentum in our business. The global reach of Platform Equinix, along with unparalleled networking cloud density and thriving business ecosystems, positions us to solve many challenges faced by today's CIOs. The strength and uniqueness of our global platform is translating into solid operating performance, and the importance of our reach is evidenced by the rapid growth of customers to put across multiple metros and regions. Our disciplined execution of our strategy continues to drive momentum as we strike a balance between revenue growth, margin expansion, yield and attractive returns on our invested capital.

And clearly, we're -- we showed a little bit of momentum when we issued our guidance the first part of this year, certainly when you adjusted for currency. And then coming out of the first quarter, we're able to moderate that up slightly as well. So very pleased with the direction of which this is going. I'd tell you though as you sort of step back Q2, in my comments, I said, look, SG&A you should expect to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. So as a result, what I think what you're going to get, as you sort of progress, through the year, absent some of the timing issues that we're going to see in Q2 is a bias towards an opportunity and through the latter part of fiscal year '15. And that positions us very well as we go to '16. My only comment would then be as we continue to look at where we need to make investments and to the extent we can create value and further the business opportunity we have in front of us, we'll continue to make those investments, so I don't want to precommit to where '16 will be but suffice it to say, the direction is very, very positive as we exit 2015."

I think, First and foremost, when you look at our guide for Q2 on a revenue basis, when you adjust for currencies, so take out the benefit of the hedge and [indiscernible] revenues in Q1 and you adjust for the forward exchange rate, you're looking at roughly a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase. And so we're happy with where we sit with Q2. As we look into Q3 and Q4, similar to what -- as we came out of last year, we're less comfortably in predicting the amount of nonrecurring activity that we have in the latter half of the year. And that's what we experienced this quarter. Part of the reason for the overperformance is we saw -- we did more nonrecurring activities than originally anticipated. And I'll tell you that we're holding that path forward [indiscernible] path true for the latter part of the year as well. That, coupled with the fact that there were some seasonality in our booking activity, there is a little bit of churn that we know is forthcoming. Again, I feel very comfortable with the 2% to 2.5% range and probably biased more towards again, the lower end of the range relative to where we have come from we will have slightly more elevated churn in the latter part of the year based on what we see. And then the last part is just timing of when we install. And there's a recognition as we roll out our global systems like anything, that, that can create some level of drag, and we're just being a little bit conservative right now until we actually role those out and start operating, if you will, with those new systems. Americas is May, Europe is going to be in the July time frame, so we're going to go through that implementation cycle."

Clearly, as you think about our stabilized assets, again those are assets that have been all open for more than 1 year. And [indiscernible] 1 year for us is January 1 -- starting January 1, 2014. Looking at that relative to the expansion activity. Our sense is when you think about expansion, because an expansion could be 2 to 3, in some cases, 4 more phases, you can appreciate the net -- sort of the drag, if you will, perhaps taking on that full obligation, whether it's a lease, whether it's a land and other related cost, until you get more to more fully utilized or not connected economic return that you're looking for relative to a stabilized assets so as a result, this is a path, if you will, that's very consistent with our expectation recognizing there's a relatively large portfolio of assets, there's 31 assets in the expansion bucket. They're going to be at all different levels of delivery, if you will. And so probably leaving with you, I think you're going to see that number move up towards the 33% as we continue to pass time and then fully utilize those assets. And the other thing I'll leave you with is the team in a very good job over the years, recognizing stabilized assets are only 85% -- 84% utilized. The team's done a very good job of optimizing the assets to not only do I continue to expect the expansion to move up quite hopefully, we also expect stabilized to move up until the right as well."

Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend, there's roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis, and we said annualize that, and that's $6.76 [ph] per share, roughly",507,"2 very good questions, David. Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend, there's roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis, and we said annualize that, and that's $6.76 [ph] per share, roughly a 3% yield where the stock is trading at that time. And so we're very, very comfortable with that. Recognizing this is a transitional year for us as a company, transition in the sense that we're being very mindful of the asset that should be inside the queue and assets that sit outside in the T primarily to limit the amount of taxes we pay and certainly the same time, meet the REIT requirements. So what I would like to leave you with at least for '15 is right now, make the assumption at least for the next quarter that we're going to hold things stable. As we look forward, as you think about the assets sitting outside of the Q about Canada, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong, which is the big 4, that's going to give us the flexibility to change, if you will, the dynamics and what that dividend will be in addition, I think [indiscernible] growth. It's fair to say that a lot of the assets, particularly Europe, which most of you have [indiscernible] that's going to continue to grow. And as we said on a currency-adjusted basis, it grew 19% [ph] this quarter over last -- same quarter last year and all of last year grew at 21% over the prior year. So we're very confident and comfortable that we think that there's going to be good, if you will, growth in the queue so that allows us to continue to manage, if you will, the dividend on a go-forward basis. As it relates to balance sheet, you're absolutely right. We sort of anticipated that this question might be forthcoming. Part of the reason I put in the disclosure that a good portion of the cash that sits on the balance sheet, the $1.1 billion, just what we see today, a good portion of that is going to get fully consumed. And that's effectively we consume all this, for all intents and purposes, that reflects 1 turn, if you will, of net leverage. And so from our perspective, if we consume that capital, which we -- or cash of which intend to, our leverage is going to get into a much more -- within the guidance range that we have shared with you. And then the last piece I would tell you is to the extent -- we all -- it's fair to say we always think of best use of our capital. And right now, given the success that we're seeing in the business, if anything, you're going to see more of a bias towards continued to invest in our future, which means investing more in the capital expenditure side of the equation unless about maybe some of the other alternatives we could use with the cash."

We have the new headcount so often new hires. Then we have a higher utility line coming in Q2 as well. As you know, typically from a seasonal perspective, our highest cost of utility comes in the second and the third quarter in the Americas region. So we're absorbing roughly another -- if my memory serves, it's another $68 million [ph] of utilities in the second quarter relative to what we will spend in Q1. And then there's -- we're continuing to progress with our integration of the ALOG investment, so we spend about $1 million in Q1 in ALOG integration, and so we expect to spend more in Q2 also with the rollout of our ECO initiative. All that to say there's some timing. And therefore, that's why you see despite that, we see some stepdowns cost that we had in Q1 will be replaced with cost, but I just talked about in Q2. And then we think that we can hold our SG&A relatively flat for the rest of the year. As it relates then to just of the net interest expense, my reference to the fact that there's a certain amount of interest that gets capitalized into our assets and that we roughly $12 million change from what we previously disclosed. And because of that, although you see an improving AFFO, the real value of the AFFO increase at this stage of the game improved operating performance. $10 million was really the capitalization. And that, of course, that has no meaningful -- even though AFFO payout ratio goes down, there's no shift that really took place because that capitalized interest gets treated differently for tax purposes.

And then the second thing is as customers do start to ask for more flexibility and what they want from you, whether it's in terms of what we wholesale space or bigger space or perhaps it different power requirements, is that going to require you to start be more flexible in how you build your facilities and could that over time change the cost on a per megawatt basis that you're investing when you build out a facility?"

We are seeing all those things at some level, although what I would argue is continued -- we've said over and over again, we're focused on getting the right applications, right customer",536,"I'll jump in any and you guys can add color. You're right, the right. We are seeing all those things at some level, although what I would argue is continued -- we've said over and over again, we're focused on getting the right applications, right customers with the right applications into the right assets. And that really centers around this sort of ecosystem-centric strategy. And so I think if we're disciplined in that strategy, I think that we see that the dynamics of some of the competitive things that you referenced have a much lesser or more marginal impact on our business. I think that you're right. Certainly, wholesalers, some of the wholesalers are indicating a desire to and offer smaller footprints and begin to dabble in the retail space. As I've said on a number of calls before, the requirements to operate a world-class at-scale retail business and the investments necessary to do that are substantial. And I think what we're finding is that customers who really need the application performance, the global reach, the mission-critical reliability for these retail type applications are typically choosing Equinix based on the superior value delivered. And so while I think there's probably some, as I've said, minor overlap between our businesses in terms of workloads that could be pursued by those types of players. If we're consistent and disciplined in our strategy, I think we're seeing relatively limited impact. You mentioned Open IX and broader desire for people to talk about and try to offer interconnection. I think that's also true. But I think the substance that we see in the market as compared to the hype and the PR, we see a big difference between those things. And I think we feel very confident that we have a -- our interconnection portfolio in terms of both offers and reach that really is delivering the value to customers. So again, we see very limited impact there. In fact, the momentum continues in our IX -- our Internet exchange offering. We've sold more ports in the last 4 quarters than we did in the last several years and really continuing to see incredible strength in that market. So customers are kind of voting with their wallets and so -- and then to the last question about is -- our need to and our desire to at least be able to, in a targeted way, pursue large footprint opportunities that we think are strategic control points. Does that modify the way we think about our facilities? I would say yes, to some degree, but that and a number of other factors have us constantly revisiting whether or not the design of our facilities and our ability to implement a flexible architecture and one where we can match capital spend as quickly and as closely to demand as possible, that's always an objective of the business. And so we definitely have resources, and in fact, have increased the number of resources we've spent looking at that opportunity. And we think we will continue to evolve the offer to be as just-in-time as possible and as flexible as possible to meet the range of requirements that our customers are asking for."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This marks our 49th quarter of consecutive revenue growth, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance range as demand for interconnection continues to drive strong performance in all 3 regions. 
As depicted on Slide 3 of our presentation, despite strong currency headwinds, revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year, delivering a 48% margin. AFFO grew 28% year-over-year to $221.8 million. 
We continue to experience strong momentum delivering solid gross and net bookings and healthy fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis, low churn and strong margins. I'm also extremely proud that we were added to both the S&P 500 and the FTSE NAREIT indices, reflecting our scale, REIT structure and the important role that we play in the technology infrastructure industry. We are also working closely with the other REIT indices as we begin our journey in this new category. 
This is our first quarter reporting as a REIT, and we are evolving our message to the market as we diversify our shareholder base. We believe that many of the characteristics our traditional investor base find attractive about Equinix will translate well into the REIT domain, including our unique portfolio of assets, solid stabilized asset growth and a long history of success with new development. 
We continue to roll out incremental financial data to enable our investors to track and analyze our business, including adding disclosures around NOI, NAV and owned assets. These new segments of revenue categorized by stabilized expansion and new and by owned versus leased highlight the diversity and strength of our offers. They also demonstrate how our ecosystems and interconnection translate into strong NOI, stable pricing and recurring and predictable bookings and returns. 
We now have over 6,300 customers around the globe, which includes 1,400 customers from our ALOG acquisition, which we now have integrated into our metrics. Today, 68% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed in more than 1 region, up from 65% last year, and 82% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 80% last year, demonstrating the extraordinary strength of our global platform.
Revenue from interconnection grew 17% year-over-year, and we added 5,500 cross connects this quarter, which takes us up to over 155,000 cross connects across Platform Equinix. Customers in our network, content and cloud verticals our strong drivers of interconnection growth, and we're also seeing growth in interconnection from the enterprise. 
Cross connects from enterprise companies to all other verticals has ramped to over 30% year-over-year growth. Also, our Internet exchange traffic grew over 65% year-over-year, and in response to the robust demand for high-bandwidth connectivity, we are now offering 100-gigabit port speeds to complement the 10-gigabit increments that customers have historically purchased and continued to deliver the industry's most complete interconnection portfolio. 
This quarter, we opened 5 new flagship data centers, boosting data center and interconnection capacity in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore and Toronto as well as in new Metro in Melbourne, Australia. We now have 105 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint, offering more than 11 million gross square feet of capacity. 
Having strong fill rates, particularly from cloud providers expanding in Tier 1 metros, we are moving forward with expansions in critical markets. A majority of our development pipeline for the year is focused on campus expansions and augmenting existing data centers, which helps drive operating scale and improves predictability of returns. The stability of our business model continues to deliver attractive growth on our new developments and our stabilized assets, which are tracking to over 33% yields on our gross PP&E investments.
We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including the addition of London 6 this quarter, and owned properties now generate 37% of recurring revenue and 39% of our NOI. Many of our owned facilities are in high-demand metros, including Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London and Silicon Valley, and we expect the NOI contribution from these assets to continue to grow as we expand in these markets and selectively pursue asset purchases in other key markets. 
This quarter, we invested $38 million to acquire 34 acres of land next to our Silicon Valley campus, which provides important expansion opportunities for this highly interconnected metro. In Ashburn, with the final expansions of DC10 and DC11 underway, we expect to start developing Ashburn North, a 44-acre plot purchased in 2012 that we intend to build out over the next 7 years. Over time, we expect more of our organic growth to come from owned properties as we build out these core campuses.
For the newer REIT investors, business ecosystems inside our data centers are at the heart of our strategic operating model and is a significant differentiator for Equinix. Ecosystems are simply communities of customers who derive value from locating in the same data center to connect to each other to achieve greater application performance and simplified network architectures. 
Interconnection created as an ecosystem, gross generate higher returns for our sites and increases in value to our customers. For example, some of our more mature campuses, where ecosystems are especially vibrant, are the most profitable and differentiated, and we typically build new assets adjacent to these sites to capitalize on this value while derisking our returns. 
Strong interconnection exist in each of our major metros with some sites, including those in Singapore, Frankfurt, London, Chicago, New York, Ashburn and Silicon Valley having over 10,000 cross connects. About 94% of our colocation square footage is in a metro with at least 1,000 cross connects or more. 
Now let me shift to the quarterly highlights of our top ecosystems. Our high network density continues to create  significant interconnection opportunities for a myriad of industries and is driving strong network-to-network cross connect demand as service providers use Platform Equinix to extend their networks and generate new revenue. Our new IBX in Melbourne is a testament to this opportunity with more than 17 global network providers already committed to deploying in this data center. 
We are also enabling network service providers to deliver new cloud services by leveraging both the Equinix Cloud Exchange as well as traditional fiber cross connects. Mobility remains a fast-growing subsegment in the network vertical with mobile providers, including Lycamobile, T-Mobile and Truphone joining this emerging ecosystem. 
For the content and digital media industry vertical, we continue to attract top content from Magnex that are expanding across multiple regions. Our advertising subsegment is thriving, propelled by the shift away from traditional advertising towards digital and mobile advertising placed by transacting on digital exchanges, resulting in a rich and fast-growing ecosystem. Content and digital media companies are also contributing to significantly -- to deterring traffic on exchanges as well as driving growth in interconnection.
Turning to our financial services vertical. We are expanding our electronic trading business across new geographies and asset classes. Wins include Oanda, a leading Canadian foreign exchange broker that is an ecosystem anchor in our Toronto 2 data center, and BATS, one of the largest equities operators in the U.S., is expanding in London in addition to consolidating its U.S. matching engines at our Secaucus campus. 
Further, we continue to see progress as we diversify our financial services business to insurance, retail banking and digital payments sectors. We have won several anchors for the emerging electronic payments ecosystem, including a key win with the largest pan-European credit card payment processor. 
Turning to cloud and IT services. This vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by new wins in expansions with AWS, Cisco, Datapipe, Oracle and T-Systems. We are excited about how the cloud opportunity is playing out, and we have another quarter of significant progress as cloud service providers choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our interconnection switching platform that enables companies to connect directly, securely and dynamically through multiple cloud and network providers continues to scale and now has over 120 participants and is live in 20 markets globally. 
Turning to the enterprise vertical. We are seeing strong momentum as enterprises move beyond the exploratory phases of cloud and are beginning to re-architect their IT infrastructure to capture the significant cost, flexibility and security benefits of hybrid cloud deployments. We are seeing strong response from both customers and channel partners to our Performance Hub offer, a solution that distributes and enterprises data center infrastructure across multiple locations to accelerate application delivery and enable efficient secure access to key network and cloud services. Over 130 customers have deployed the Equinix Performance Hub solution, and this quarter, we saw strong growth in existing deployments as well as critical new logo wins.
Notably, this quarter marked one of our largest channel deals to date as we were able to secure a key infrastructure deployment with one of the world's largest providers of athletic apparel, that resulted a highly successful joint sales engagement with Datapipe, one of our leading global partners. 
Other enterprise wins this quarter include BRB, a sporting-goods retailer; Pella, an automotive component manufacturer; Net Health U.K., a health care company; Red Lobster, an American restaurant chain; Ryder, a transportation and supply chain management provider; and Valmet, a supplier of services for paper and energy industries.
Expanding our global channel program is tough strategic initiative for Equinix, and we are investing significant resources to ensure our partners are well equipped to deploy compelling IT and cloud solutions for their end customers via Platform Equinix. Along with technology partners AWS, Cisco, Google and Microsoft, other companies that have recently joined the channel partner program include Avant, Datalink and Unitas Global. 
So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

Our global interconnecte",1925,"Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. Well, as they say, the only thing better than a strong Q4 and a recurring revenue model is following it up with a strong Q1, and our Q1 results represent a great start to 2015. Our global interconnected platform continues to deliver strong gross and net bookings, and this drives leverage across each of our regions. 
Our key operating metrics remained solid such as net cabinets billing, MRR per cabinet and the MRR churn rate. Our interconnection trends remained very positive, too, both normally, but more importantly, the value that they bring to the health of our ecosystems. Interconnection revenues now represent 17% of our global recurring revenues. That's 17% year-over-year increase of strength across each of our regions. 
Also, our key operating margins continued to improve. Each of our gross profit, cash gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and operating profit experienced a nice step-up this quarter. The result of strong revenue flow-through and lower-than-planned costs. We remain pleased with our performance. Although consistent with our comments in the last earnings call, we do plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and other key initiatives through the end of this year. Yet given the success of the first quarter, as Steve will discuss shortly, we're now able to increase our adjusted EBITDA guidance on a currency-neutral basis by $17 million for the year. 
One additional comment before I get into the earnings slides. We're very pleased to have completed our first quarter operating and reporting as a REIT, and of course, this includes the issuance of our first quarterly recurring cash dividend. We continue to expect to receive our favorable PLR in 2015 and look forward to sharing the news with you when received.
Now moving to the slides. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-to-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. We're now in our 13th year of consecutive quarterly revenue growth. Our revenue's overperformance was due to a number of factors, including favorable net pricing actions and higher-than-expected custom installation activities. 
Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $9.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rate last quarter and a $1.5 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Low currency volatility across all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds. We've put in place net cash flow hedges covering greater than 80% of the value risk related to our EMEA operating currencies. This provides for a smooth glide path into 2016.
Total cash SG&A expenses decreased to $145.3 million for the quarter, primarily due to lower-than-planned advertising and promotion expenses as well as the one-off sales commission expense incurred in Q4 due to the change in our internal policy. We expect our cash SG&A expenses on a quarterly basis to remain roughly flat for the rest of the year.
Total adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million, up above the top end of our guidance range and up 17% year-over-year. This was driven by stronger-than-anticipated cash gross margins, the result of lower-than-expected utility rates and favorable FX hedges in EMEA. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48%. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to our average rates used last quarter and a $3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global net income of $76.5 million or a diluted earnings per share of $1.34, a strong step-up from last quarter, which was impacted by the write-off of our deferred tax assets due to the REIT conversion and a loss and debt extinguishment related to our Q4 financings. 
Our Q1 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $232.8 million, largely due to lower cash interest and taxes, and a reduction in our net working capital position. Our Q1 MRR churn was below our expectations of 1.9%. Although including ALOG, we will be reporting 2%. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to be at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% guidance range over the remainder of the year.
One final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our nonfinancial -- pardon me, our nonfinancial metric sheet has now fully consolidated, including ALOG with 1 exception. We do not include ALOG revenues in our MRR per cabinet metric, given the level of managed services in the revenue line. 
Also, as part of the Equinix Customer One initiative, we've upgraded and automated our inventory tracking systems. Also, we've globally standardized the cabinet equivalent definition. And as a result, we've updated our cabinets billing, our utilization and our MRR per cabinet metrics, including the comparable periods to incorporate this change. As you can see, this change left our operating trends intact.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to start reviewing our regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong revenue this quarter. The result of favorable net pricing action, lower-than-planned MRR churn and an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase in their nonrecurring revenues, largely the result of increased custom installation activity. 
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong cash gross margins, offset in part from the higher seasonal FICO charges. Americas interconnection revenues now represent 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 1,800 net cross connects. 
Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 in the quarter, and we added 85 exchange ports in Q1, which included the sale of our first 6 100-gig ports. 
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 6. EMEA delivered another strong quarter, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses, although FX continued to impact our as-reported results. Revenues were up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 19% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 13% over the prior quarter and 28% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 17% quarter-over-quarter decrease in SG&A, a result of a strong U.S. dollar and a $3 million hedge benefit. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 46%. Although normalized for the FX benefit, adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 44%. We had a strong traction in our cloud vertical, including momentum from our support of large cloud providers like Azure and AWS. We had another solid quarter of cross connects, adding 1 -- 1,500 net cross connects in the quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis and net cabinets billing increased by 900. 
Now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 7. In Asia Pacific, we had record gross and net bookings this quarter. Revenues were up 4% over the prior quarter and up 25% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum in cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and a constant currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter and 30% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 4% decrease in Q1 SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and lower-than-expected discretionary spending. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 50%. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, and cabinets billing increased by 900 over the prior quarter. We added a record 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. 
Now as we continue to scale our APAC business, we have 8 expansions currently underway across 6 metros, including new phases of our newly opened IBXs in Melbourne and Singapore. Also, given the success in the Sydney market, we're now proceeding with the building of our Sydney 4 asset to capture this opportunity. 
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash, and our net debt remains consistent with the prior quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to 2.9x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of stronger operating performance and higher-than-expected cash balance at the end of the quarter. A significant portion of this cash will be consumed throughout the remainder of the year, largely from the payment of our quarterly dividends and special distribution, funding of our capital expenditures and the payment of liabilities on our balance sheet. We continue to have a tremendous strategic and operational flexibility built into our balance sheet and capital structure. This allows us to continue to plan for growth and meet the funding needs for our shareholder distributions.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. For 2015, we now expect AFFO to be greater than $830 million or growing 15% on a constant currency basis, the benefit of a strong operating performance and a decrease in our planned net interest expense. Our AFFO payout ratio decreased slightly to 46%. 
Also as noted previously, we paid our first regular cash dividend and expect to announce our Q2 dividend shortly. It's important to know that the taxable income from the QRS part of the business ultimately drives the dividend payout requirements. As you may appreciate, there isn't always a direct correlation between AFFO and a REIT taxable income. As an example, AFFO represents a global consolidated metric, whereas the REIT taxable income solely relates to our QRS entities. We continue to expect to distribute 100% of our QRS' taxable income. 
Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, CapEx was $150.1 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $22 million, lower than our guidance range, primarily due to timing of cash payments. As presented on expansion tracking slide, we currently have 19 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 18 are campus builds or incremental phase builds on over 15 markets. We continue to believe that spreading our capital expenditures across multiple regions and phases is the best way to invest in our growth. These 19 projects will increase our current inventory by 10%. We expect our recurring CapEx to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million.
Turning to Slide 11. The operating performance of our stabilized 76 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than 1 year continue to perform well. Revenues were up 6% year-over-year, and we continue to enjoy a healthy yield on the stabilized assets, reflecting the premium value that is placed on these assets. Currently, these projects generate a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, and are at 84% utilized on a REIT-calibrated billable inventory capacity. 
Before handing the call back to Steve, I would like to remind you that we've appended our supplemental financial and operating data deck in the earnings presentation starting on Slide 16. There are a number of incremental disclosures, including details related to how we segment our business between expansion and stabilized assets over our owned and leased portfolio. Of note, you'll see that our cash gross profit grew 14% over the prior year. Our adjusted cash NOI increased 15% over the prior year to 61%, and our corporate cash SG&A as a percent of total revenues decreased to 9%. And finally, we provided you with the key components to our NAV on Slide 30. 
So now I'll turn back the call to Steve."

For the second quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $654 million to $658 million, which includes $6 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rates and normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. 
Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $144 million to $148 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $304 million and $308 million, which includes $5 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rate. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $220 million, which includes approximately $30 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to be greater than $2.635 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis. This guidance includes $25 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised revenues is a $30 million increase compared to our prior guidance. 
Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.23 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $7 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $17 million increase compared to prior guidance. 
We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $830 million, a 15% constant currency growth year-over-year, effectively a $26 million raise, adjusting for currencies. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $740 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. 
So in closing, our strong results this quarter reflect a continued strength and momentum in our business. The global reach of Platform Equinix, along with unparalleled networking cloud density and thriving business ecosystems, positions us to solve the many challenges faced by today's CIOs. The strength and uniqueness of our global platform is translating into solid operating performance, and the importance of our reach is evidenced by the rapid growth of customers deployed across multiple metros and regions. Our disciplined execution of our strategy continues to drive momentum as we strike a balance between revenue growth, margin expansion, yield and attractive returns on our invested capital. 
So let me stop here and open it up for questions. So I'll turn it over to you, Lessie."

I mean, most fundamentally, we're very much committed as a company to driving towards our 50% EBITDA margin target or better.

And then coming out of the first quarter, we're able to moderate that up slightly as well. So we're very pleased with the direction of which this is going. I'd tell you, though, as you sort of step back, Q2, in my comments, I said, look, SG&A you should expect it to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. So as a result, what I think what you're going to get, as you sort of progress, through the year, absent some of the timing issues that we're going to see in Q2 is a bias towards an upward trend through the latter part of fiscal year '15. And that positions us very well as we go to '16. My only comment would be then as we continue to look and assess where we need to make investments, and to the extent that we can create value and further our -- the business opportunity we have in front of us, we'll continue to make those investments. So I don't want to pre-commit to where '16 will be. But suffice it to say, the direction is very, very positive as we exit 2015."

Let me take the first one, and then perhaps pass it to Steve or Charles for the second. I think, first and foremost, when you look at our guide for Q2 on a revenue basis, when you adjust for currency, so take out the benefit of the hedge, sitting in revenues in Q1 and you adjust for basically, the forward exchange rate, you're looking at roughly a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase. And so we're happy with where we sit with Q2. As we look into Q3 and Q4, similar to what -- as we came out of last year, we are less comfortably in predicting the amount of nonrecurring activity that we have in the latter half of the year. And that's what we experienced this quarter. Part of the reason for the overperformance is we saw -- we did more nonrecurring activities than originally anticipated. And I'd tell you that we hold that -- we are holding that path forward sort of that path through for the latter part of the year as well. That, coupled with the fact that there were some seasonality in just -- in our booking activity. So there is a little bit of churn that we know that's forthcoming. Again, I feel very comfortable with the 2% to 2.5% range and probably biased more towards again, the lower end of the range but relative to where we've come from, we'll have slightly more elevated churn in the latter part of the year based on what we see. And then the last part is just timing of when we install. And there's a recognition as we roll out our global systems like anything, that, that can create some level of drag, and we're just being a little bit conservative right now until we actually role those out and start operating, if you will, with those new systems. Americas is May, Europe is going to be in the July time frame. And so we're going to go through that implementation cycle."

So generally, from our perspective, I think there's a couple of things. Clearly, as we -- as you think about our stabilized assets, again those are assets that have been all phases have been opened for more than 1 year. And effective, that 1 year for us is January 1 -- starting January 1, 2014. Looking at that, relative to the expansion activity, our sense is when you think about expansion, because an expansion  could be 2 to 3, in some cases, 4 more phases, you can appreciate that the net -- sort of the drag, if you will, perhaps taking on that full obligation, whether it's a lease, whether it's the land and other related cost, until you get more to -- more fully utilized, you're not going to get the economic return that you're looking for relative to a stabilized asset. So as a result, this is a path, if you will, that's very consistent with our expectation, recognizing there's a relatively large portfolio of assets. There's 31 assets in the expansion bucket. They're going to be at all different levels of delivery, if you will. And so probably leaving it with you, I think you're going to see that number move up towards the 33% as we continue to pass time, and then fully utilize those assets. And the other thing I'll leave you with is the team have done a very good job over the years. Recognizing stabilized assets are only 85% -- 84% utilized, the team does a very good job of optimizing the assets. So not only do I continue to expect the expansion to move up, quite openly, we also expect the stabilized to move up into the right as well."

And then the second question on balance sheet. It was dips below the long-term leverage target. If you went back to the midpoint, we could buy back 5% of the stock. You've been very cautious about using the balance sheet as you kind of went into the REIT process because there were, obviously, reasons to kind of be cautious and keep dry powder.

Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend, there's roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis, and we said annualize that. It's $6.76 per share. So roughly, a 3%",519,"Two very good questions, David. Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend, there's roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis, and we said annualize that. It's $6.76 per share. So roughly, a 3% yield, where the stock was trading at that time. And so we're very, very comfortable with that. Recognizing this is a transitional year for us as a company, transition in the sense that we're being very mindful of the assets that should be inside the Q and those assets that sit outside in the T, primarily to limit the amount of taxes we pay and certainly, at the same time, meet the REIT requirements. So what I would like to leave you with at least for '15 is right now, make the assumption at least for the next quarter that we're going to hold things stable. As we look forward, as you think a little about the assets that sit outside of the Q, say, about Canada, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong, which are the big 4, that's going to give us the flexibility to change, if you will, the dynamics and what that dividend will be in addition, though, to affect the growth. It's fair to say that a lot of the assets, particularly Europe, which most of Europe sits inside the Q. That's going to continue to grow. And as we said on a currency-adjusted basis, it grew 19% this quarter over last -- same quarter last year and all of last year grew at 21% over the prior year. So we're very confident and comfortable that we think that there's going to be good, if you will, growth in the Q. So that allows us to continue to manage, if you will, the dividend on a go-forward basis. As it relates to balance sheet, you're absolutely right. We sort of anticipated that this question might be forthcoming. Part of the reason I put in the disclosure that a good portion of the cash that sits on the balance sheet, the $1.1 billion, just on what we see today, a good portion of that is going to get fully consumed. And that's effectively, if we consume all this, for all intents and purposes, that reflects 1 turn, if you will, of net leverage. And so from our perspective, if we consume that capital, which we -- or cash of which intend to, our leverage is going to get into a much more -- within the guidance range that we have shared with you. And then the last piece I would tell you is to the extent -- we always -- it's fair to say we always think of highest and best use of our capital. And right now, given the success that we're seeing in the business, if anything, you're going to see more of a bias towards continuing to invest in our future, which means investing more in the capital expenditure side of the equation and less about maybe some of the other alternatives we could use with the cash."

I think that's an area of comfort, Michael, that over a period of time, recognizing some of these assets, we're very selective in how we fill them up. And what I mean by that, if it's a network-dense asset and we don't have a lot of incremental capacity, we're willing to let that asset dip there for a period of time looking for the right customer, the right application to go into that asset.

So pretty strong pricing in the regions, primarily because of the focus that our sales and marketing teams have on targeting specific workloads and focusing our value propositions around that type of application workload. And as historically, as we've always mentioned, blended in with that, where appropriate, we're pursuing larger magnetic footprints that are helping the overall ecosystem value.

It's fair to say, guys, that we have our eyes on the same consolidation activity that you're all reading about in our industry. We're still focused, as I mentioned, last quarter on our inorganic strategy to extend our current leadership position around cloud and network density; secondly, around scaling our platform; and then third, around enhancing our interconnection position. So we're always evaluating options to accomplish those 3 objectives. We'll continue to do that. And if there was a transaction that might complement that strategy and create significant shareholder value, you should feel confident that we'll consider it. But in terms of our Europe business, we continue to be very pleased with what's going on over there. And our results off last quarter and certainly this quarter, as we mentioned in previous calls, our business in Europe grew 21% last year. And on a first quarter year-on-year basis grew 19% this first quarter. So our European business, because it's connected to a global platform, is growing faster than the broader EU market. And as you also heard, we have significant momentum on interconnection in Europe. So all in all, yes, we're watching the stuff. And our business in Europe, we're very happy with."

And so -- but then we also are really seeing good new logo capture and growth with existing new logos in a bit more the longer tail around cloud service providers in a variety of forms. And so I think it's both, and I think both are really critically important because I think that what we're saying is that those big magnets like an Azure or an AWS are often the catalyst for somebody to say, ""Yes, I need high-bandwidth secure connectivity into these cloud providers as I begin to move workloads into the cloud."" But then they -- as they evolve, their hybrid cloud, they really want access to a much broader range of cloud services as quickly and cost-effectively as possible and the ability to seamlessly and efficiently move workloads across various cloud providers. So both seeing good momentum and both critical to long-term health of the ecosystem."

Our lighthouse accounts are showing very strong sort of land-and-expand type performance with some of our key customers, starting with 2 to 3 locations and rapidly expanding in their performance hub implementations to 6, 10, even 20 sites. And so what I think we will see is an extremely favorable trend for us, which is average deal size for a new -- or average implementation size, perhaps trending somewhat down, although balanced in part by the fact that we're going to continue to selectively pursue strategic large footprint type activity, where it's really accretive to the strategy. But I think we will see average implementation sites trend down as we really gain some traction in the enterprise, both through our direct force and our channel. And -- but interestingly, I think that the -- we'll begin -- we'll be able to grow those customers over time. And so the average billing volume for a customer continue to be strong.

Just as we look to Q2, so not only do we have the merit increases that took effect in March. So we see the, if you will, the cost associated to that moving into Q2 and beyond. We have all of the new headcount so -- of the new hires. Then we have a higher utility line coming in Q2 as well. As you know, typically from a seasonal perspective, our highest cost of utility comes in the second and the third quarter in the Americas region. And so we're absorbing roughly another -- if my memory serves, it's another $68 million of utilities in the second quarter relative to what we were going to spend in Q1. And then there's -- we're continuing to progress with our integration of the ALOG investment. And so we've spend about $1 million in Q1 on ALOG integration, and so we expect to spend more in Q2 also with the rollout of our ECO initiative. All that to say is there's some timing. And therefore, that's why you see despite that, we see some stepdowns cost that we had in Q1 will be replaced with cost that I just talked about in Q2. And then we think that we can hold our SG&A relatively flat for the rest of the year. As it relates then to just the net interest expense, my reference to the fact that there's a certain amount of interest that gets capitalized into our assets, is roughly a $12 million change from what we previously disclosed. And because of that, although you see an improving AFFO, the real value of the AFFO increase at this stage of the game was the improved operating performance. $10 million was really the capitalization. And that, of course, that has no meaning -- even though our AFFO payout ratio goes down, there's no shift that really took place because that capitalized interest, it gets treated differently for tax purposes. So that's the primary reason for the interest stepdown."

It seems like there's a lot going on, whether it's -- I mean, the wholesale guys trying to offer more retail products. Everybody, I guess, to some degree, are trying to offer some form of interconnection, whether it's Open IX or their own exchanges. Increasing demand, it seems, like for co-location facilities in Tier 2 markets. Even metered power, to some degree, seeming to squeeze into the sub-500 kW type deals. I was wondering if you could just comment on what, if any, impact you're seeing from some of these trends that I just mentioned. And then the second thing is as customers do start to ask for more flexibility and what they want from you, whether it's in terms of what we'd refer to as wholesale space or bigger space or perhaps even different power requirements, is it going to require that you start to be more flexible in how you build your facilities and could that, over time, change the cost on a per megawatt basis that you're investing when you build out a facility?"

Steve is absolutely right. We're seeing all those things at some level. Although what I would argue is continued -- we've said over and over again, we're focused on getting the right applications, right customers with the right applications into the right assets. And that really centers around this sort of ecosystem-centric strategy. And so I think if we're disciplined in that strategy, I think that we see that the dynamics of some of the competitive things that you referenced have a much lesser or more marginal impact on our business. I think that you're right. Certainly, wholesalers, some of the wholesalers are indicating a desire to and offer smaller footprints and begin to dabble in the retail space. As I've said on a number of calls before, the requirements to operate a world-class at-scale retail business and the investments necessary to do that are substantial. And I think what we're finding is that customers who really need the application performance, the global reach, the mission-critical reliability for these retail type applications are typically choosing Equinix based on the superior value delivered. And so while I think there's probably some, as I've said, minor overlap between our businesses in terms of workloads that could be pursued by those types of players. If we're consistent and disciplined in our strategy, I think we're seeing relatively limited impact. You mentioned Open IX and broader desire for people to talk about and try to offer interconnection. I think that's also true but I think the substance that we see in the market as compared to the hype and the PR, we see a big difference between those things. And I think we feel very confident that we have a -- our interconnection portfolio in terms of both offers and reach that really is delivering the value to the customers. So again, we see very limited impact there. In fact, the momentum continues in our IX -- our Internet exchange offering. We've sold more ports in the last 4 quarters than we did in the last several years and really continuing to see incredible strength in that market. So customers are kind of voting with their wallets and so -- and then to the last question about is -- our need to and our desire to at least be able to, in a targeted way, pursue large footprint opportunities that we think are strategic control points. Does that modify the way we think about our facilities? I would say yes, to some degree, but that and a number of other factors have us constantly revisiting whether or not the design of our facilities and our ability to implement a flexible architecture and one where we can match capital spend as quickly and as closely to demand as possible, that's always an objective of the business. And so we definitely have resources, and in fact, have increased the number of resources that we've spent looking at that opportunity. And we think we will continue to evolve the offer to be as just-in-time as possible and as flexible as possible to meet the range of requirements that our customers are asking for."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This marks our 49th quarter of consecutive revenue growth, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges as demand for interconnection continues to drive strong performance in all 3 regions. 
As depicted on Slide 3 of our presentation, despite strong currency headwinds, revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year, delivering a 48% margin. AFFO grew 28% year-over-year to $221.8 million. 
We continued to experience strong momentum delivering solid gross and net bookings and healthy fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis, low churn and strong margins. I'm also extremely proud that we were added to both the S&P 500 and the FTSE NAREIT indices, reflecting our scale, REIT structure and the important role that we play in the technology infrastructure industry. We are also working closely with the other REIT indices as we begin our journey in this new category. 
This is our first quarter reporting as a REIT, and we are evolving our message to the market as we diversify our shareholder base. We believe that many of the characteristics our traditional investor base find attractive about Equinix will translate well into the REIT domain, including our unique portfolio of assets, solid stabilized asset growth and a long history of success with new development. 
We continue to roll out incremental financial data to enable our investors to track and analyze our business, including adding disclosures around NOI, NAV and owned assets. These new segments of revenue categorized by stabilized expansion and new and by owned versus leased highlight the diversity and strength of our offers. They also demonstrate how our ecosystems and interconnection translate into strong NOI, stable pricing and recurring and predictable bookings and returns. 
We now have over 6,300 customers around the globe, which includes 1,400 customers from our ALOG acquisition, which we now have integrated into our metrics. Today, 68% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed in more than 1 region, up from 65% last year, and 82% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 80% last year, demonstrating the extraordinary strength of our global platform.
Revenue from interconnection grew 17% year-over-year, and we added 5,500 cross connects this quarter, which takes us up to over 155,000 cross connects across Platform Equinix. Customers in our network, content and cloud verticals are strong drivers of interconnection growth, and we're also seeing growth in interconnection from the enterprise. 
Cross connects from enterprise companies to all other verticals has ramped to over 30% year-over-year growth. Also, our Internet exchange traffic grew over 65% year-over-year, and in response to the robust demand for high-bandwidth connectivity, we are now offering 100-gigabit port speeds to complement the 10-gigabit increments that customers have historically purchased and continued to deliver the industry's most complete interconnection portfolio. 
This quarter, we opened 5 new flagship data centers, boosting data center and interconnection capacity in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore and Toronto as well as in new Metro in Melbourne, Australia. We now have 105 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint, offering more than 11 million gross square feet of capacity. 
Having strong fill rates, particularly from cloud providers expanding in Tier 1 metros, we are moving forward with expansions in critical markets. The majority of our development pipeline for the year is focused on campus expansions and augmenting existing data centers, which helps drive operating scale and improves predictability of returns. The stability of our business model continues to deliver attractive growth on our new developments and our stabilized assets, which are tracking to over 33% yields on our gross PP&E investments.
We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including the addition of London 6 this quarter, and owned properties now generate 37% of our recurring revenue and 39% of our NOI. Many of our owned facilities are in high-demand metros, including Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London and Silicon Valley, and we expect the NOI contribution from these assets to continue to grow as we expand in these markets and selectively pursue asset purchases in other key markets. 
This quarter, we invested $38 million to acquire 34 acres of land next to our Silicon Valley campus, which provides important expansion opportunities for this highly interconnected metro. In Ashburn, with the final expansions of DC10 and DC11 underway, we expect to start developing Ashburn North, a 44-acre plot purchased in 2012 that we intend to build out over the next 7 years. Over time, we expect more of our organic growth to come from owned properties as we build out these core campuses.
For the newer REIT investors, business ecosystems inside our data centers are at the heart of our strategic operating model and is a significant differentiator for Equinix. Ecosystems are simply communities of customers who derive value from locating in the same data center to connect to each other to achieve greater application performance and simplified network architectures. 
Interconnection created as an ecosystem grows -- generates higher returns for our sites and increases in value to our customers. For example, some of our more mature campuses, where ecosystems are especially vibrant, are the most profitable and differentiated, and we typically build new assets adjacent to these sites to capitalize on this value while [ph] derisking our returns. 
Strong interconnection exist in each of our major metros with some sites, including those in Singapore, Frankfurt, London, Chicago, New York, Ashburn and Silicon Valley having over 10,000 cross connects. About 94% of our colocation square footage is in a metro with at least 1,000 cross connects or more. 
Now let me shift to the quarterly highlights of our top ecosystems. Our high network density continues to create  significant interconnection opportunities for a myriad of industries and is driving strong network-to-network cross connect demand as service providers use Platform Equinix to extend their networks and generate new revenue. Our new IBX in Melbourne is a testament to this opportunity with more than 17 global network providers already committed to deploying in this data center. 
We are also enabling network service providers to deliver new cloud services by leveraging both the Equinix Cloud Exchange as well as traditional fiber cross connects. Mobility remains a fast-growing subsegment in the network vertical with mobile providers, including Lycamobile, T-Mobile and Truphone joining this emerging ecosystem. 
For the content and digital media industry vertical, we continue to attract top content from Magnex that are expanding across multiple regions. Our advertising subsegment is thriving, propelled by the shift away from traditional advertising towards digital and mobile advertising placed by transacting on digital exchanges, resulting in a rich and fast-growing ecosystem. Content and digital media companies are also contributing to significantly, to the peering traffic on exchanges as well as driving growth in interconnection.
Turning to our financial services vertical. We are expanding our electronic trading business across new geographies and asset classes. Wins include Oanda, a leading Canadian foreign exchange broker that is an ecosystem anchor in our Toronto 2 data center, and BATS, one of the largest equities operators in the U.S., is expanding in London in addition to consolidating its U.S. matching engines inside our Secaucus campus. 
Further, we continue to see progress as we diversify our financial services business to insurance, retail banking and digital payments sectors. We have won several anchors for the emerging electronic payments ecosystem, including a key win with the largest pan-European credit card payment processor. 
Turning to cloud and IT services. This vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by new wins in expansions with AWS, Cisco, Datapipe, Oracle and T-Systems. We are excited about how the cloud opportunity is playing out, and we had another quarter of significant progress as cloud service providers choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our interconnection switching platform that enables companies to connect directly, securely and dynamically to multiple cloud and network providers continues to scale and now has over 120 participants and is live in 20 markets globally. 
Turning to the enterprise vertical. We are seeing strong momentum as enterprises move beyond the exploratory phases of cloud and are beginning to re-architect their IT infrastructure to capture the significant cost, flexibility and security benefits of hybrid cloud deployments. We are seeing strong response from both customers and channel partners to our Performance Hub offer, a solution that distributes an enterprises data center infrastructure across multiple locations to accelerate application delivery and enable efficient secure access to key network and cloud services. Over 130 customers have deployed the Equinix Performance Hub solution, and this quarter, we saw strong growth in existing deployments as well as critical new logo wins.
Notably, this quarter marked one of our largest channel deals to date as we were able to secure a key infrastructure deployment with one of the world's largest providers of athletic apparel, that resulted a highly successful joint sales engagement with Datapipe, one of our leading global partners. 
Other enterprise wins in this quarter include BRB, a sporting-goods retailer; Pella, an automotive component manufacturer; Net Health U.K., a health care company; Red Lobster, an American restaurant chain; Ryder, a transportation and supply chain management provider; and Valmet, a supplier of services for paper and energy industries.
Expanding our global channel program is a top strategic initiative for Equinix, and we are investing significant resources to ensure our partners are well equipped to deploying compelling IT and cloud solutions for their end customers via Platform Equinix. Along with technology partners AWS, Cisco, Google and Microsoft, other companies that have recently joined the channel partner program include Avant, Datalink and Unitas Global. 
So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone.

Our global interconnected",1930,"Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. Well, as they say, the only thing better than a strong Q4 in a recurring revenue model is following it up with a strong Q1, and our Q1 results represent a great start to 2015. Our global interconnected platform continues to deliver strong gross and net bookings, and this drives leverage across each of our regions. 
Our key operating metrics remain solid such as net cabinets billing, MRR per cabinet and the MRR churn rate. Our interconnection trends remained very positive, too, both nominally, but more importantly, the value that they bring to the health of our ecosystems. Interconnection revenues now represent 17% of our global recurring revenues. That's 17% year-over-year increase of strength across each of our regions. 
Also, our key operating margins continued to improve. Each of our gross profit, cash gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and operating profit experienced a nice step-up this quarter. The result of strong revenue flow-through and lower-than-planned costs. We remain pleased with our performance. Although consistent with our comments in the last earnings call, we do plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and other key initiatives through the end of this year. Yet given the success of the first quarter, as Steve will discuss shortly, we're now able to increase our adjusted EBITDA guidance on a currency-neutral basis by $17 million for the year. 
One additional comment before I get into the earnings slides. We're very pleased to have completed our first quarter operating and reporting as a REIT, and of course, this includes the issuance of our first quarterly recurring cash dividend. We continue to expect to receive our favorable PLR in 2015 and look forward to sharing the news with you when received.
Now moving to the slides. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-to-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. We're now in our 13th year of consecutive quarterly revenue growth. Our revenues overperformance was due to a number of factors, including favorable net pricing actions and higher-than-expected custom installation activities. 
Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $9.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rate last quarter and a $1.5 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Low currency volatility across all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds. We've put in place net cash flow hedges covering greater than 80% of the value at risk related to our EMEA operating currencies. This provides for a smooth glide path into 2016.
Total cash SG&A expenses decreased to $145.3 million for the quarter, primarily due to lower-than-planned advertising and promotion expenses as well as the one-off sales commission expense incurred in Q4 due to the change in our internal policy. We expect our cash SG&A expenses on a quarterly basis to remain roughly flat for the rest of the year.
Total adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million, up above the top end of our guidance range and up 17% year-over-year. This was driven by stronger-than-anticipated cash gross margins, the result of lower-than-expected utility rates and favorable FX hedges in EMEA. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48%. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to our average rates used last quarter and a $3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global net income was $76.5 million or a diluted earnings per share of $1.34, a strong step-up from last quarter, which was impacted by the write-off of our deferred tax assets due to the REIT conversion and a loss in debt extinguishment related to our Q4 financings. 
Our Q1 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $232.8 million, largely due to lower cash interest and taxes, and a reduction in our net working capital position. Our Q1 MRR churn was below our expectations at 1.9%. Although including ALOG, we will be reporting 2%. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to be at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% guidance range over the remainder of the year.
One final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our nonfinancial -- pardon me, our nonfinancial metric sheet is now fully consolidated, including ALOG with 1 exception. We do not include ALOG revenues in our MRR per cabinet metric, given the level of managed services in their revenue line. 
Also, as part of the Equinix Customer One initiative, we've upgraded and automated our inventory tracking systems. Also, we've globally standardized the cabinet equivalent definition. And as a result, we've updated our cabinets billing, our utilization and our MRR per cabinet metrics, including the comparable periods to incorporate this change. As you can see, this change left our operating trends intact.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to start reviewing our regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong revenue this quarter. The result of favorable net pricing action, lower-than-planned MRR churn and an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase in their nonrecurring revenues, largely the result of increased custom installation activity. 
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong cash gross margins, offset in part from the higher seasonal FICA charges. Americas interconnection revenues now represent 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 1,800 net cross connects. 
Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 in the quarter, and we added 85 exchange ports in Q1, which included the sale of our first 6 100-gig ports. 
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 6. EMEA delivered another strong quarter, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses, although FX continued to impact our as-reported results. Revenues were up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 19% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 13% over the prior quarter and 28% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 17% quarter-over-quarter decrease in SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and the $3 million hedge benefit. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 46%. Although normalized for the FX benefit, adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 44%. We had a strong traction in our cloud vertical, including momentum from our support of large cloud providers like Azure and AWS. We had another solid quarter of cross connects, adding 1 -- 1,500 net cross connects in the quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis and net cabinets billing increased by 900. 
Now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 7. In Asia Pacific, we had record gross and net bookings this quarter. Revenues were up 4% over the prior quarter and up 25% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum in cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and a constant currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter and 30% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 4% decrease in Q1 SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and lower-than-expected discretionary spending. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 50%. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, and cabinets billing increased by 900 over the prior quarter. We added a record 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. 
Now as we continue to scale our APAC business, we have 8 expansions currently underway across 6 metros, including new phases of our newly opened IBXs in Melbourne and Singapore. Also, given the success in the Sydney market, we're now proceeding with the building of our Sydney 4 asset to capture this opportunity. 
And now I'll look at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash, and our net debt remains consistent with the prior quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio would decrease slightly to 2.9x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of stronger operating performance and higher-than-expected cash balance at the end of the quarter. A significant portion of this cash will be consumed throughout the remainder of the year, largely from the payment of our quarterly dividends and special distribution, the funding of our capital expenditures and the payment of liabilities on our balance sheet. We continue to have a tremendous strategic and operational flexibility built into our balance sheet and capital structure. This allows us to continue to plan for growth and meet the funding needs for our shareholder distributions.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. For 2015, we now expect AFFO to be greater than $830 million or growing 15% on a constant currency basis, the benefit of a strong operating performance and a decrease in our planned net interest expense. Our AFFO payout ratio decreased slightly to 46%. 
Also as noted previously, we paid our first regular cash dividend and expect to announce our Q2 dividend shortly. It's important to note that the taxable income from the QRS part of the business ultimately drives the dividend payout requirements. As you may appreciate, there isn't always a direct correlation between AFFO and a REIT taxable income. As an example, AFFO represents a global consolidated metric, whereas the REIT taxable income solely relates to our QRS entities. We continue to expect to distribute 100% of our QRS' taxable income. 
Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, CapEx was $150.1 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $22 million, lower than our guidance range, primarily due to timing of cash payments. As presented on the expansion tracking slide, we currently have 19 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 18 are campus builds or incremental phase builds on over 15 markets. We continue to believe that spreading our capital expenditures across multiple regions and phases is the best way to invest in our growth. These 19 projects will increase our current inventory by 10%. We expect our recurring CapEx to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million.
Turning to Slide 11. The operating performance of our stabilized 76 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than 1 year continued to perform well. Revenues were up 6% year-over-year, and we continued to enjoy a healthy yield on the stabilized assets, reflecting the premium value that is placed on these assets. Currently, these projects generate a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, and are at 84% utilized on a REIT-calibrated billable inventory capacity. 
Before handing the call back to Steve, I would like to remind you that we've appended our supplemental financial and operating data deck to the earnings presentation starting on Slide 16. There are a number of incremental disclosures, including details related to how we segment our business between expansion and stabilized assets over our owned and leased portfolio. Of note, you'll see that our cash gross profit grew 14% over the prior year. Our adjusted cash NOI increased 15% over the prior year to 61%, and our corporate cash SG&A as a percent of total revenues decreased to 9%. And finally, we provided you with the key components to our NAV on Slide 30. 
So now I'll turn back the call to Steve."

Let me now cover our 2015 outlook on Slide 15.

Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2015 outlook on Slide 15. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $654 million to $658 million, which includes $6 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rates and normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. 
Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $144 million to $148 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $304 million and $308 million, which includes $5 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rates. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $220 million, which includes approximately $30 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to be greater than $2.635 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis. This guidance includes $25 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised revenues is a $30 million increase compared to our prior guidance. 
Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.23 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $7 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $17 million increase compared to prior guidance. 
We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $830 million, a 15% constant currency growth year-over-year, effectively a $26 million raise, adjusting for currencies. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $740 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. 
So in closing, our strong results this quarter reflect the continued strength and momentum in our business. The global reach of Platform Equinix, along with unparalleled networking cloud density and thriving business ecosystems, positions us to solve the many challenges faced by today's CIOs. The strength and uniqueness of our global platform is translating into solid operating performance, and the importance of our reach is evidenced by the rapid growth of customers deployed across multiple metros and regions. Our disciplined execution of our strategy continues to drive momentum as we strike a balance between revenue growth, margin expansion, yield and attractive returns on our invested capital. 
So let me stop here and open it up for questions. So I'll turn it over to you, Lessie."

And then coming out of the first quarter, we're able to moderate that up slightly as well. So we're very pleased with the direction of which this is going. I'd tell you, though, as you sort of step back, Q2, in my comments, I said, look, SG&A you should expect it to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. So as a result, what I think what you're going to get, as you sort of progress, through the year, absent some of the timing issues that we're going to see in Q2 is a bias towards an upward trend through the latter part of fiscal year '15. And that positions us very well as we go into '16. My only comment would then be as we continue to look and assess where we need to make investments, and to the extent that we can create value and further our -- the business opportunity we have in front of us, we'll continue to make those investments. So I don't want to pre-commit to where '16 will be. But suffice it to say, the direction is very, very positive as we exit 2015."

Let me take the first one, and then perhaps pass it to Steve or Charles for the second. I think, first and foremost, when you look at our guide for Q2 on a revenue basis, when you adjust for currency, so take out the benefit of the hedge that's sitting in revenues in Q1 and you adjust for, basically, the forward exchange rate, you're looking at roughly a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase. And so we're happy with where we sit with Q2. As we look into Q3 and Q4, similar to what -- as we came out of last year, we are less comfortably in predicting the amount of nonrecurring activity that we have in the latter half of the year. And that's what we experienced this quarter. Part of the reason for the overperformance is we sold -- we did more nonrecurring activities than originally anticipated. And I'd tell you that we hold that -- we are holding that path forward sort of that path true [ph] for the latter part of the year as well. That, coupled with the fact that there was some seasonality in just -- in our booking activity. So there is a little bit of churn that we know that's forthcoming. Again, I feel very comfortable with the 2% to 2.5% range and probably biased more towards again, the lower end of the range but relative to where we've come from, we'll have slightly more elevated churn in the latter part of the year based on what we see. And then the last part is just timing, timing of when we install. And there's a recognition as we roll out our global systems like anything, that, that can create some level of drag, and we're just being a little bit conservative right now until we actually role those out and start operating, if you will, with those new systems. Americas is May, Europe is going to be in the July time frame. And so we're going to go through that implementation cycle."

So generally, from our perspective, I think there's a couple of things. Clearly, as we -- as you think about our stabilized assets, again those are assets have been -- all phases have been opened for more than 1 year. And effective that 1 year",292,"Okay, okay. So generally, from our perspective, I think there's a couple of things. Clearly, as we -- as you think about our stabilized assets, again those are assets have been -- all phases have been opened for more than 1 year. And effective that 1 year for us is January 1 -- starting January 1, 2014. Looking at that, relative to the expansion activity, our sense is when you think about expansion, because an expansion could be 2 to 3, or in some cases, 4 more phases, you can appreciate that the net in terms of drag, if you will, perhaps taking on that full obligation, whether it's a lease, whether it's the land and other related costs, until you get more to -- more fully utilized, you're not going to get the economic return that you're looking for relative to a stabilized asset. So as a result, this is a path, if you will, that's very consistent with our expectation, recognizing there's a relatively large portfolio of assets. There's 31 assets in the expansion bucket. They're going to be at all different levels of delivery, if you will. And so probably leaving it with you, I think you're going to see that number move up and towards the 33% as we continue to pass time, and then fully utilize those assets. And the other thing I'll leave you with is the team has done a very good job over the years. Recognizing stabilized assets are only 85% -- 84% utilized, the team does a very good job of optimizing the assets. So not only do I continue to expect the expansion to move up, quite openly, we also expect the stabilized to move up and to the right as well."

And then the second question on the balance sheet. It was dips below the long-term leverage target. If you went back to the midpoint, we could buy back 5% of the stock. You've been very cautious about using the balance sheet as you kind of went into the REIT process because there were, obviously, reasons to kind of be cautious and keep dry powder.

Let me start with the dividend.

So roughly, a 3% yie",525,"Two very good questions, David. Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend, there's roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis, and we said annualize that at $6.76 per share. So roughly, a 3% yield, where the stock was trading at that time. And so we were very, very comfortable with that. Recognizing this is a transitional year for us as a company, transition in the sense that we're being very mindful of the assets that should be inside the Q and those assets that sit outside in the T, primarily to limit the amount of taxes we pay and certainly, and at the same time, meet the REIT requirements. So what I would like to leave you with at least for '15 is right now, make the assumption at least for next quarter that we're going to hold things stable. As we look forward, as you think a little about the assets that sit outside of the Q, so you've got Canada, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong, which are the big 4, that's going to give us the flexibility to change, if you will, the dynamics and what that dividend will be in addition, though, to affecting the growth. It's fair to say that a lot of the assets, particularly in Europe, which most of Europe sits inside the Q. That's going to continue to grow. And as we said on a currency-adjusted basis, it grew 19% this quarter over last -- same quarter last year and all of last year grew at 21% over the prior year. So we're very confident and comfortable that we think that there's going to be good, if you will, growth in the Q. So that allows us to continue to manage, if you will, the dividend on a go-forward basis. As it relates to the balance sheet, you're absolutely right. We sort of anticipated that this question might be forthcoming. Part of the reason I put in the disclosure that a good portion of the cash that sits on the balance sheet, the $1.1 billion, just on what we see today, a good portion of that is going to get fully consumed. And that's effectively, if we consume all this, for all intents and purposes, that reflects 1 turn, if you will, of net leverage. And so from our perspective, if we consume that capital, which we -- or cash of which intend to, our leverage is going to get into a much more -- will get within the guidance range that we have shared with you. And then the last piece I would tell you is to the extent -- we always -- it's fair to say we always think of highest and best use of our capital. And right now, given the success that we're seeing in the business, if anything, you're going to see more of a bias towards continuing to invest in our future, which means investing more in the capital expenditure side of the equation and less about maybe some of the other alternatives we could use with the cash."

I think that's an area of comfort, Michael, that over a period of time, recognizing some of these assets, we're very selective in how we fill them up. And what I mean by that, if it's a network-dense asset and we don't have a lot of incremental capacity, we're willing to let that asset sit there for a period of time looking for the right customer with the right application to go into that asset. And so once we get there, I think it's reasonable to assume you're 90%-plus utilized."

So pretty strong pricing in the regions, primarily because of the focus that our sales and marketing teams have on targeting specific workloads and focusing our value propositions around that type of application workload. And as historically, as we've always mentioned, blended in with that, where appropriate, we're pursuing larger magnetic footprints that are helping the overall ecosystem value.

But then they -- as they evolve, their hybrid cloud, they really want access to a much broader range of cloud services as quickly and cost-effectively as possible and the ability to seamlessly and efficiently move workloads across various cloud providers.

But I think we will see average implementation size trend down as we really gain some traction in the enterprise, both through our direct force and our channel. And -- but interestingly, I think that the -- we'll begin -- we'll be able to grow those customers over time. And so see the average billing volume for a customer continue to be strong.

Just as we look to Q2, so not only do we have the merit increases that took effect in March. So we see that, if you will, the cost associated to that moving into Q2 and beyond. We have all of the new headcount so -- of the new hires. Then we have a higher utility line coming in Q2 as well. As you know, typically from a seasonal perspective, our highest cost of utility comes in the second and the third quarter in the Americas region. And so we're absorbing roughly another -- if my memory serves, it's another $68 million of utilities in the second quarter relative to what we were going to spend in Q1. And then there's -- we're continuing to progress with our integration of the ALOG investment. And so we spent about $1 million in Q1 on the ALOG integration, and so we expect to spend more in Q2 also with the rollout of our ECO initiative. All that to say is there's some timing. And therefore, that's why you see despite that, we see some stepdowns of costs that we had in Q1 that will be replaced with costs that I just talked about in Q2. And then we think that we can hold our SG&A relatively flat for the rest of the year. As it relates then to just the net interest expense, my reference to the fact that there's a certain amount of interest that gets capitalized into our assets, and it was roughly a $12 million change from what we previously disclosed. And because of that, although you see an improving AFFO, the real value of the AFFO increase at this stage of the game was the improved operating performance. $10 million was really to capitalization. And that, of course, that has no meaning -- even though our AFFO payout ratio goes down, there was no shift that really took place because that capitalized interest, it gets treated differently for tax purposes. So that's the primary reason for the interest stepdown."

Steve is absolutely right. We're seeing all those things at some level. Although what I would argue is continued -- we've said over and over again, we're focused on getting the right applications, right customers with the right applications into the right assets. And that really centers around this sort of ecosystem-centric strategy. And so I think if we're disciplined in that strategy, I think that we see that the dynamics of some of the competitive things that you referenced have a much lesser or more marginal impact on our business. I think that you're right. Certainly, wholesalers -- some of the wholesalers are indicating a desire to and offer smaller footprints and begin to dabble in the retail space. As I've said on a number of calls before, the requirements to operate a world class at-scale retail business and the investments necessary to do that are substantial. And I think what we're finding is that customers who really need the application performance, the global reach, the mission-critical reliability for these retail type applications are typically choosing Equinix based on the superior value delivered. And so while I think there's probably some, as I've said, minor overlap between our businesses in terms of workloads that could be pursued by those types of players. If we're consistent and disciplined in our strategy, I think we're seeing relatively limited impact. You mentioned Open IX and a broader desire for people to talk about it and try to offer interconnection. I think that's also true, but I think the substance that we see in the market as compared to the hype and the PR, we see a big difference between those things. And I think we feel very confident that we have a -- the interconnection portfolio in terms of both offers and reach that really is delivering the value to customers. So again, we see very limited impact there. In fact, the momentum continues in our IX -- our Internet exchange offering. We've sold more ports in the last 4 quarters than we did in the last several years and really continuing to see incredible strength in that market. So customers are kind of voting with their wallets and so -- and then to the last question about is our need to and our desire to at least be able to, in a targeted way, pursue large footprint opportunities that we think are strategic control points. Does that modify the way we think about our facilities? I would say yes, to some degree, but that and a number of other factors have us constantly revisiting whether or not the design of our facilities and our ability to implement a flexible architecture and one where we can match capital spend as quickly and as closely to demand as possible, that's always an objective of the business. And so we definitely have resources, and in fact, have increased the number of resources that we've spent looking at that opportunity. And we think we will continue to evolve the offer to be as just-in-time as possible and as flexible as possible to meet the range of requirements that our customers are asking for."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This marks our 49th quarter of consecutive revenue growth, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges as demand for interconnection continues to drive strong performance in all 3 regions. 
As depicted on Slide 3 of our presentation, despite strong currency headwinds, revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year, delivering a 48% margin. AFFO grew 28% year-over-year to $221.8 million. 
We continued to experience strong momentum delivering solid gross and net bookings and healthy fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis, low churn and strong margins. I'm also extremely proud that we were added to both the S&P 500 and the FTSE NAREIT indices, reflecting our scale, REIT structure and the important role that we play in the technology infrastructure industry. We are also working closely with the other REIT indices as we begin our journey in this new category. 
This is our first quarter reporting as a REIT, and we are evolving our message to the market as we diversify our shareholder base. We believe that many of the characteristics our traditional investor base find attractive about Equinix will translate well into the REIT domain, including our unique portfolio of assets, solid stabilized asset growth and a long history of success with new development. 
We continue to roll out incremental financial data to enable our investors to track and analyze our business, including adding disclosures around NOI, NAV and owned assets. These new segments of revenue categorized by stabilized expansion and new and by owned versus leased highlight the diversity and strength of our offers. They also demonstrate how our ecosystems and interconnection translate into strong NOI, stable pricing and recurring and predictable bookings and returns. 
We now have over 6,300 customers around the globe, which includes 1,400 customers from our ALOG acquisition, which we now have integrated into our metrics. Today, 68% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed in more than 1 region, up from 65% last year, and 82% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 80% last year, demonstrating the extraordinary strength of our global platform.
Revenue from interconnection grew 17% year-over-year, and we added 5,500 cross connects this quarter, which takes us up to over 155,000 cross connects across Platform Equinix. Customers in our network, content and cloud verticals are strong drivers of interconnection growth, and we're also seeing growth in interconnection from the enterprise. 
Cross connects from enterprise companies to all other verticals has ramped to over 30% year-over-year growth. Also, our Internet exchange traffic grew over 65% year-over-year, and in response to the robust demand for high-bandwidth connectivity, we are now offering 100-gigabit port speeds to complement the 10-gigabit increments that customers have historically purchased and continued to deliver the industry's most complete interconnection portfolio. 
This quarter, we opened 5 new flagship data centers, boosting data center and interconnection capacity in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore and Toronto as well as in new Metro in Melbourne, Australia. We now have 105 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint, offering more than 11 million gross square feet of capacity. 
Having strong fill rates, particularly from cloud providers expanding in Tier 1 metros, we are moving forward with expansions in critical markets. The majority of our development pipeline for the year is focused on campus expansions and augmenting existing data centers, which helps drive operating scale and improves predictability of returns. The stability of our business model continues to deliver attractive growth on our new developments and our stabilized assets, which are tracking to over 33% yields on our gross PP&E investments.
We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including the addition of London 6 this quarter, and owned properties now generate 37% of our recurring revenue and 39% of our NOI. Many of our owned facilities are in high-demand metros, including Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London and Silicon Valley, and we expect the NOI contribution from these assets to continue to grow as we expand in these markets and selectively pursue asset purchases in other key markets. 
This quarter, we invested $38 million to acquire 34 acres of land next to our Silicon Valley campus, which provides important expansion opportunities for this highly interconnected metro. In Ashburn, with the final expansions of DC10 and DC11 underway, we expect to start developing Ashburn North, a 44-acre plot purchased in 2012 that we intend to build out over the next 7 years. Over time, we expect more of our organic growth to come from owned properties as we build out these core campuses.
For the newer REIT investors, business ecosystems inside our data centers are at the heart of our strategic operating model and is a significant differentiator for Equinix. Ecosystems are simply communities of customers who derive value from locating in the same data center to connect to each other to achieve greater application performance and simplified network architectures. 
Interconnection created as an ecosystem grows -- generates higher returns for our sites and increases in value to our customers. For example, some of our more mature campuses, where ecosystems are especially vibrant, are the most profitable and differentiated, and we typically build new assets adjacent to these sites to capitalize on this value while [ph] derisking our returns. 
Strong interconnection exist in each of our major metros with some sites, including those in Singapore, Frankfurt, London, Chicago, New York, Ashburn and Silicon Valley having over 10,000 cross connects. About 94% of our colocation square footage is in a metro with at least 1,000 cross connects or more. 
Now let me shift to the quarterly highlights of our top ecosystems. Our high network density continues to create significant interconnection opportunities for a myriad of industries and is driving strong network-to-network cross connect demand as service providers use Platform Equinix to extend their networks and generate new revenue. Our new IBX in Melbourne is a testament to this opportunity with more than 17 global network providers already committed to deploying in this data center. 
We are also enabling network service providers to deliver new cloud services by leveraging both the Equinix Cloud Exchange as well as traditional fiber cross connects. Mobility remains a fast-growing subsegment in the network vertical with mobile providers, including Lycamobile, T-Mobile and Truphone joining this emerging ecosystem. 
For the content and digital media industry vertical, we continue to attract top content from Magnex that are expanding across multiple regions. Our advertising subsegment is thriving, propelled by the shift away from traditional advertising towards digital and mobile advertising placed by transacting on digital exchanges, resulting in a rich and fast-growing ecosystem. Content and digital media companies are also contributing to significantly, to the peering traffic on exchanges as well as driving growth in interconnection.
Turning to our financial services vertical. We are expanding our electronic trading business across new geographies and asset classes. Wins include Oanda, a leading Canadian foreign exchange broker that is an ecosystem anchor in our Toronto 2 data center, and BATS, one of the largest equities operators in the U.S., is expanding in London in addition to consolidating its U.S. matching engines inside our Secaucus campus. 
Further, we continue to see progress as we diversify our financial services business to insurance, retail banking and digital payments sectors. We have won several anchors for the emerging electronic payments ecosystem, including a key win with the largest pan-European credit card payment processor. 
Turning to cloud and IT services. This vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by new wins in expansions with AWS, Cisco, Datapipe, Oracle and T-Systems. We are excited about how the cloud opportunity is playing out, and we had another quarter of significant progress as cloud service providers choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our interconnection switching platform that enables companies to connect directly, securely and dynamically to multiple cloud and network providers continues to scale and now has over 120 participants and is live in 20 markets globally. 
Turning to the enterprise vertical. We are seeing strong momentum as enterprises move beyond the exploratory phases of cloud and are beginning to re-architect their IT infrastructure to capture the significant cost, flexibility and security benefits of hybrid cloud deployments. We are seeing strong response from both customers and channel partners to our Performance Hub offer, a solution that distributes an enterprises data center infrastructure across multiple locations to accelerate application delivery and enable efficient secure access to key network and cloud services. Over 130 customers have deployed the Equinix Performance Hub solution, and this quarter, we saw strong growth in existing deployments as well as critical new logo wins.
Notably, this quarter marked one of our largest channel deals to date as we were able to secure a key infrastructure deployment with one of the world's largest providers of athletic apparel, that resulted a highly successful joint sales engagement with Datapipe, one of our leading global partners. 
Other enterprise wins in this quarter include BRB, a sporting-goods retailer; Pella, an automotive component manufacturer; Net Health U.K., a health care company; Red Lobster, an American restaurant chain; Ryder, a transportation and supply chain management provider; and Valmet, a supplier of services for paper and energy industries.
Expanding our global channel program is a top strategic initiative for Equinix, and we are investing significant resources to ensure our partners are well equipped to deploying compelling IT and cloud solutions for their end customers via Platform Equinix. Along with technology partners AWS, Cisco, Google and Microsoft, other companies that have recently joined the channel partner program include Avant, Datalink and Unitas Global. 
So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

Our global interconnected",1930,"Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. Well, as they say, the only thing better than a strong Q4 in a recurring revenue model is following it up with a strong Q1, and our Q1 results represent a great start to 2015. Our global interconnected platform continues to deliver strong gross and net bookings, and this drives leverage across each of our regions. 
Our key operating metrics remain solid such as net cabinets billing, MRR per cabinet and the MRR churn rate. Our interconnection trends remained very positive, too, both nominally, but more importantly, the value that they bring to the health of our ecosystems. Interconnection revenues now represent 17% of our global recurring revenues. That's 17% year-over-year increase of strength across each of our regions. 
Also, our key operating margins continued to improve. Each of our gross profit, cash gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and operating profit experienced a nice step-up this quarter. The result of strong revenue flow-through and lower-than-planned costs. We remain pleased with our performance. Although consistent with our comments in the last earnings call, we do plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and other key initiatives through the end of this year. Yet given the success of the first quarter, as Steve will discuss shortly, we're now able to increase our adjusted EBITDA guidance on a currency-neutral basis by $17 million for the year. 
One additional comment before I get into the earnings slides. We're very pleased to have completed our first quarter operating and reporting as a REIT, and of course, this includes the issuance of our first quarterly recurring cash dividend. We continue to expect to receive our favorable PLR in 2015 and look forward to sharing the news with you when received.
Now moving to the slides. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-to-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. We're now in our 13th year of consecutive quarterly revenue growth. Our revenues overperformance was due to a number of factors, including favorable net pricing actions and higher-than-expected custom installation activities. 
Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $9.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rate last quarter and a $1.5 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Low currency volatility across all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds. We've put in place net cash flow hedges covering greater than 80% of the value at risk related to our EMEA operating currencies. This provides for a smooth glide path into 2016.
Total cash SG&A expenses decreased to $145.3 million for the quarter, primarily due to lower-than-planned advertising and promotion expenses as well as the one-off sales commission expense incurred in Q4 due to the change in our internal policy. We expect our cash SG&A expenses on a quarterly basis to remain roughly flat for the rest of the year.
Total adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million, up above the top end of our guidance range and up 17% year-over-year. This was driven by stronger-than-anticipated cash gross margins, the result of lower-than-expected utility rates and favorable FX hedges in EMEA. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48%. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to our average rates used last quarter and a $3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global net income was $76.5 million or a diluted earnings per share of $1.34, a strong step-up from last quarter, which was impacted by the write-off of our deferred tax assets due to the REIT conversion and a loss in debt extinguishment related to our Q4 financings. 
Our Q1 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $232.8 million, largely due to lower cash interest and taxes, and a reduction in our net working capital position. Our Q1 MRR churn was below our expectations at 1.9%. Although including ALOG, we will be reporting 2%. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to be at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% guidance range over the remainder of the year.
One final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our nonfinancial -- pardon me, our nonfinancial metric sheet is now fully consolidated, including ALOG with 1 exception. We do not include ALOG revenues in our MRR per cabinet metric, given the level of managed services in their revenue line. 
Also, as part of the Equinix Customer One initiative, we've upgraded and automated our inventory tracking systems. Also, we've globally standardized the cabinet equivalent definition. And as a result, we've updated our cabinets billing, our utilization and our MRR per cabinet metrics, including the comparable periods to incorporate this change. As you can see, this change left our operating trends intact.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to start reviewing our regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong revenue this quarter. The result of favorable net pricing action, lower-than-planned MRR churn and an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase in their nonrecurring revenues, largely the result of increased custom installation activity. 
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong cash gross margins, offset in part from the higher seasonal FICA charges. Americas interconnection revenues now represent 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 1,800 net cross connects. 
Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 in the quarter, and we added 85 exchange ports in Q1, which included the sale of our first 6 100-gig ports. 
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 6. EMEA delivered another strong quarter, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses, although FX continued to impact our as-reported results. Revenues were up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 19% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 13% over the prior quarter and 28% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 17% quarter-over-quarter decrease in SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and the $3 million hedge benefit. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 46%. Although normalized for the FX benefit, adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 44%. We had a strong traction in our cloud vertical, including momentum from our support of large cloud providers like Azure and AWS. We had another solid quarter of cross connects, adding 1 -- 1,500 net cross connects in the quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis and net cabinets billing increased by 900. 
Now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 7. In Asia Pacific, we had record gross and net bookings this quarter. Revenues were up 4% over the prior quarter and up 25% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum in cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and a constant currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter and 30% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 4% decrease in Q1 SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and lower-than-expected discretionary spending. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 50%. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, and cabinets billing increased by 900 over the prior quarter. We added a record 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. 
Now as we continue to scale our APAC business, we have 8 expansions currently underway across 6 metros, including new phases of our newly opened IBXs in Melbourne and Singapore. Also, given the success in the Sydney market, we're now proceeding with the building of our Sydney 4 asset to capture this opportunity. 
And now I'll look at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash, and our net debt remains consistent with the prior quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio would decrease slightly to 2.9x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of stronger operating performance and higher-than-expected cash balance at the end of the quarter. A significant portion of this cash will be consumed throughout the remainder of the year, largely from the payment of our quarterly dividends and special distribution, the funding of our capital expenditures and the payment of liabilities on our balance sheet. We continue to have a tremendous strategic and operational flexibility built into our balance sheet and capital structure. This allows us to continue to plan for growth and meet the funding needs for our shareholder distributions.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. For 2015, we now expect AFFO to be greater than $830 million or growing 15% on a constant currency basis, the benefit of a strong operating performance and a decrease in our planned net interest expense. Our AFFO payout ratio decreased slightly to 46%. 
Also as noted previously, we paid our first regular cash dividend and expect to announce our Q2 dividend shortly. It's important to note that the taxable income from the QRS part of the business ultimately drives the dividend payout requirements. As you may appreciate, there isn't always a direct correlation between AFFO and a REIT taxable income. As an example, AFFO represents a global consolidated metric, whereas the REIT taxable income solely relates to our QRS entities. We continue to expect to distribute 100% of our QRS' taxable income. 
Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, CapEx was $150.1 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $22 million, lower than our guidance range, primarily due to timing of cash payments. As presented on the expansion tracking slide, we currently have 19 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 18 are campus builds or incremental phase builds on over 15 markets. We continue to believe that spreading our capital expenditures across multiple regions and phases is the best way to invest in our growth. These 19 projects will increase our current inventory by 10%. We expect our recurring CapEx to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million.
Turning to Slide 11. The operating performance of our stabilized 76 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than 1 year continued to perform well. Revenues were up 6% year-over-year, and we continued to enjoy a healthy yield on the stabilized assets, reflecting the premium value that is placed on these assets. Currently, these projects generate a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, and are at 84% utilized on a REIT-calibrated billable inventory capacity. 
Before handing the call back to Steve, I would like to remind you that we've appended our supplemental financial and operating data deck to the earnings presentation starting on Slide 16. There are a number of incremental disclosures, including details related to how we segment our business between expansion and stabilized assets over our owned and leased portfolio. Of note, you'll see that our cash gross profit grew 14% over the prior year. Our adjusted cash NOI increased 15% over the prior year to 61%, and our corporate cash SG&A as a percent of total revenues decreased to 9%. And finally, we provided you with the key components to our NAV on Slide 30. 
So now I'll turn back the call to Steve."

This guidance includes $25 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised revenues is a $30 million increase compared to our prior guidance.

This guidance includes $7 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $17 million increase compared to prior guidance. 
We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $830 million, a 15% constant currency growth year-over-year, effectively a $26 million raise, adjusting for currencies. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $740 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. 
So in closing, our strong results this quarter reflect the continued strength and momentum in our business. The global reach of Platform Equinix, along with unparalleled networking cloud density and thriving business ecosystems, positions us to solve the many challenges faced by today's CIOs. The strength and uniqueness of our global platform is translating into solid operating performance, and the importance of our reach is evidenced by the rapid growth of customers deployed across multiple metros and regions. Our disciplined execution of our strategy continues to drive momentum as we strike a balance between revenue growth, margin expansion, yield and attractive returns on our invested capital. 
So let me stop here and open it up for questions. So I'll turn it over to you, Lessie."

I mean, most fundamentally, we're very much committed as a company to driving towards our 50% EBITDA margin target or better.

And then coming out of the first quarter, we're able to moderate that up slightly as well. So we're very pleased with the direction of which this is going. I'd tell you, though, as you sort of step back, Q2, in my comments, I said, look, SG&A you should expect it to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. So as a result, what I think what you're going to get, as you sort of progress, through the year, absent some of the timing issues that we're going to see in Q2 is a bias towards an upward trend through the latter part of fiscal year '15. And that positions us very well as we go into '16. My only comment would then be as we continue to look and assess where we need to make investments, and to the extent that we can create value and further our -- the business opportunity we have in front of us, we'll continue to make those investments. So I don't want to pre-commit to where '16 will be. But suffice it to say, the direction is very, very positive as we exit 2015."

Let me take the first one, and then perhaps pass it to Steve or Charles for the second. I think, first and foremost, when you look at our guide for Q2 on a revenue basis, when you adjust for currency, so take out the benefit of the hedge that's sitting in revenues in Q1 and you adjust for, basically, the forward exchange rate, you're looking at roughly a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase. And so we're happy with where we sit with Q2. As we look into Q3 and Q4, similar to what -- as we came out of last year, we are less comfortably in predicting the amount of nonrecurring activity that we have in the latter half of the year. And that's what we experienced this quarter. Part of the reason for the overperformance is we sold -- we did more nonrecurring activities than originally anticipated. And I'd tell you that we hold that -- we are holding that path forward sort of that path true [ph] for the latter part of the year as well. That, coupled with the fact that there was some seasonality in just -- in our booking activity. So there is a little bit of churn that we know that's forthcoming. Again, I feel very comfortable with the 2% to 2.5% range and probably biased more towards again, the lower end of the range but relative to where we've come from, we'll have slightly more elevated churn in the latter part of the year based on what we see. And then the last part is just timing, timing of when we install. And there's a recognition as we roll out our global systems like anything, that, that can create some level of drag, and we're just being a little bit conservative right now until we actually role those out and start operating, if you will, with those new systems. Americas is May, Europe is going to be in the July time frame. And so we're going to go through that implementation cycle."

So generally, from our perspective, I think there's a couple of things. Clearly, as we -- as you think about our stabilized assets, again those are assets have been -- all phases have been opened for more than 1 year. And effective that 1 year for us is January 1 -- starting January 1, 2014. Looking at that, relative to the expansion activity, our sense is when you think about expansion because an expansion could be 2 to 3, or in some cases, 4 more phases, you can appreciate that the net in terms of drag, if you will, perhaps taking on that full obligation, whether it's a lease, whether it's the land and other related costs, until you get more to -- more fully utilized, you're not going to get the economic return that you're looking for relative to a stabilized asset. So as a result, this is a path, if you will, that's very consistent with our expectation, recognizing there's a relatively large portfolio of assets. There's 31 assets in the expansion bucket. They're going to be at all different levels of delivery, if you will. And so probably leaving it with you, I think you're going to see that number move up and towards the 33% as we continue to pass time, and then fully utilize those assets. And the other thing I'll leave you with is the team has done a very good job over the years. Recognizing stabilized assets are only 85% -- 84% utilized, the team does a very good job of optimizing the assets. So not only do I continue to expect the expansion to move up, quite openly, we also expect the stabilized to move up and to the right as well."

Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend, there's roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis, and we said annualize that at $6.76 per share. So roughly, a 3% yie",525,"Two very good questions, David. Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend, there's roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis, and we said annualize that at $6.76 per share. So roughly, a 3% yield, where the stock was trading at that time. And so we were very, very comfortable with that. Recognizing this is a transitional year for us as a company, transition in the sense that we're being very mindful of the assets that should be inside the Q and those assets that sit outside in the T, primarily to limit the amount of taxes we pay and certainly, and at the same time, meet the REIT requirements. So what I would like to leave you with at least for '15 is right now, make the assumption at least for next quarter that we're going to hold things stable. As we look forward, as you think a little about the assets that sit outside of the Q, so you've got Canada, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong, which are the big 4, that's going to give us the flexibility to change, if you will, the dynamics and what that dividend will be in addition, though, to affecting the growth. It's fair to say that a lot of the assets, particularly in Europe, which most of Europe sits inside the Q. That's going to continue to grow. And as we said on a currency-adjusted basis, it grew 19% this quarter over last -- same quarter last year and all of last year grew at 21% over the prior year. So we're very confident and comfortable that we think that there's going to be good, if you will, growth in the Q. So that allows us to continue to manage, if you will, the dividend on a go-forward basis. As it relates to the balance sheet, you're absolutely right. We sort of anticipated that this question might be forthcoming. Part of the reason I put in the disclosure that a good portion of the cash that sits on the balance sheet, the $1.1 billion, just on what we see today, a good portion of that is going to get fully consumed. And that's effectively, if we consume all this, for all intents and purposes, that reflects 1 turn, if you will, of net leverage. And so from our perspective, if we consume that capital, which we -- or cash of which intend to, our leverage is going to get into a much more -- will get within the guidance range that we have shared with you. And then the last piece I would tell you is to the extent -- we always -- it's fair to say we always think of highest and best use of our capital. And right now, given the success that we're seeing in the business, if anything, you're going to see more of a bias towards continuing to invest in our future, which means investing more in the capital expenditure side of the equation and less about maybe some of the other alternatives we could use with the cash."

So pretty strong pricing in the regions, primarily because of the focus that our sales and marketing teams have on targeting specific workloads and focusing our value propositions around that type of application workload.

It's fair to say, guys, that we have our eyes on the same consolidation activity that you're all reading about in our industry. We're still focused, as I mentioned, last quarter on our inorganic strategy to extend our current leadership position around cloud and network density; secondly, around scaling our platform; and then third, around enhancing our interconnection position. So we're always evaluating options to accomplish those 3 objectives. We'll continue to do that. And if there was a transaction that might complement that strategy and create significant shareholder value, you should feel confident that we'll consider it. But in terms of our Europe business, we're continuing to be very pleased with what's going on over there. And our results off last quarter and certainly this quarter, as we mentioned in previous calls, our business in Europe grew 21% last year. And on a first quarter year-on-year basis grew 19% in this first quarter. So our European business because it's connected to a global platform, is growing faster than the broader EU market. And as you also heard, we have significant momentum on interconnection in Europe. So all in all, yes, we're watching this stuff. And our business in Europe, we're very happy with."

And so -- but then we also are really seeing good new logo capture and growth with existing new logos in a bit more the longer tail around cloud service providers in a variety of forms. And so I think it's both, and I think both are really critically important because I think that what we're seeing is that those big magnets like an Azure or an AWS are often the catalyst for somebody to say, ""Yes, I need high-bandwidth secure connectivity into these cloud providers as I begin to move workloads into the cloud."" But then they -- as they evolve, their hybrid cloud, they really want access to a much broader range of cloud services as quickly and cost-effectively as possible and the ability to seamlessly and efficiently move workloads across various cloud providers. So both seeing good momentum and both critical to the long-term health of the ecosystem."

Our lighthouse accounts are showing very strong sort of land-and-expand type performance with some of our key customers, starting with 2 to 3 locations and rapidly expanding in their performance hub implementations to 6, 10, even 20 sites. And so what I think we will see is an extremely favorable trend for us, which is average deal size for a new -- or average implementation size, perhaps trending somewhat down, although balanced in part by the fact that we're going to continue to selectively pursue strategic large footprint type activity, where it's really accretive to the strategy. But I think we will see average implementation size trend down as we really gain some traction in the enterprise, both through our direct force and our channel. And -- but interestingly, I think that the -- we'll begin -- we'll be able to grow those customers over time. And so see the average billing volume for a customer continue to be strong. So I do think we will see that trend. I think it's a very favorable trend for our -- potentially for our yield over time. But I think it's still very early days."

Just as we look to Q2, so not only do we have the merit increases that took effect in March. So we see that, if you will, the cost associated to that moving into Q2 and beyond. We have all of the new headcount so -- of the new hires. Then we have a higher utility line coming in Q2 as well. As you know, typically from a seasonal perspective, our highest cost of utility comes in the second and the third quarter in the Americas region. And so we're absorbing roughly another -- if my memory serves, it's another $68 million of utilities in the second quarter relative to what we were going to spend in Q1. And then there's -- we're continuing to progress with our integration of the ALOG investment. And so we spent about $1 million in Q1 on the ALOG integration, and so we expect to spend more in Q2 also with the rollout of our ECO initiative. All that to say is there's some timing. And therefore, that's why you see despite that, we see some stepdowns of costs that we had in Q1 that will be replaced with costs that I just talked about in Q2. And then we think that we can hold our SG&A relatively flat for the rest of the year. As it relates then to just the net interest expense, my reference to the fact that there's a certain amount of interest that gets capitalized into our assets, and it was roughly a $12 million change from what we previously disclosed. And because of that, although you see an improving AFFO, the real value of the AFFO increase at this stage of the game was the improved operating performance. $10 million was really to capitalization. And that, of course, that has no meaning -- even though our AFFO payout ratio goes down, there was no shift that really took place because that capitalized interest, it gets treated differently for tax purposes. So that's the primary reason for the interest stepdown."

It seems like there's just a lot going on, whether it's some of the wholesale guys trying to offer more retail products. Everybody, I guess, to some degree, trying to offer some form of interconnection, whether it's with Open IX or their own exchanges. Increasing demand, it seems, like for co-location facilities in Tier 2 markets. Even metered power, to some degree, seeming to squeeze into the sub-500 kW type deals. I was wondering if you could just comment on what, if any, impact you're seeing from some of these trends that I just mentioned. And then the second thing is as customers do start to ask for more flexibility in what they want from you, whether it's in terms of what we'd refer to as wholesale space or bigger space or perhaps even different power requirements, is it going to require that you start to be more flexible in how you build your facilities and could that, over time, change the cost on a per megawatt basis that you're investing when you build out a facility?"

Steve is absolutely right. We're seeing all those things at some level. Although what I would argue is continued -- we've said over and over again, we're focused on getting the right applications, right customers with the right applications into the right assets. And that really centers around this sort of ecosystem-centric strategy. And so I think if we're disciplined in that strategy, I think that we see that the dynamics of some of the competitive things that you referenced have a much lesser or more marginal impact on our business. I think that you're right. Certainly, wholesalers -- some of the wholesalers are indicating a desire to and offer smaller footprints and begin to dabble in the retail space. As I've said on a number of calls before, the requirements to operate a world class at-scale retail business and the investments necessary to do that are substantial. And I think what we're finding is that customers who really need the application performance, the global reach, the mission-critical reliability for these retail type applications are typically choosing Equinix based on the superior value delivered. And so while I think there's probably some, as I've said, minor overlap between our businesses in terms of workloads that could be pursued by those types of players. If we're consistent and disciplined in our strategy, I think we're seeing relatively limited impact. You mentioned Open IX and a broader desire for people to talk about it and try to offer interconnection. I think that's also true, but I think the substance that we see in the market as compared to the hype and the PR, we see a big difference between those things. And I think we feel very confident that we have a -- the interconnection portfolio in terms of both offers and reach that really is delivering the value to customers. So again, we see very limited impact there. In fact, the momentum continues in our IX -- our Internet exchange offering. We've sold more ports in the last 4 quarters than we did in the last several years and really continuing to see incredible strength in that market. So customers are kind of voting with their wallets and so -- and then to the last question about is our need to and our desire to at least be able to, in a targeted way, pursue large footprint opportunities that we think are strategic control points. Does that modify the way we think about our facilities? I would say yes, to some degree, but that and a number of other factors have us constantly revisiting whether or not the design of our facilities and our ability to implement a flexible architecture and one where we can match capital spend as quickly and as closely to demand as possible, that's always an objective of the business. And so we definitely have resources, and in fact, have increased the number of resources that we've spent looking at that opportunity. And we think we will continue to evolve the offer to be as just-in-time as possible and as flexible as possible to meet the range of requirements that our customers are asking for."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This marks our 50th quarter of consecutive revenue growth. We delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges while global demand for interconnected data centers drove record net bookings and our second best gross bookings. 
This momentum reflects our strategic position in the digital economy and the value of our global platform and addressing customer needs. Additionally, we are extremely well positioned to capture a sizable share of enterprise demand driven by a variety of factors, including the rapid adoption of hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice. 
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $665.6 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million for the quarter, up 2% over the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year, delivering a 47% margin. FFO grew 18% year-over-year to $221.4 million. 
The benefits of operational discipline and a strategic approach to meeting customer demand continued to manifest in stable pricing, firm yields and one of the lowest churn quarters on record. We now have 6,300 customers around the globe, including more than 100 of the Fortune 500. Over 4,000 Equinix employees support our operations, product development and the execution of our go-to-market strategy to offer the only global interconnection platform and the largest retail data center footprint worldwide. 
With over 161,000 cross connects, vibrant use of our Internet and Cloud Exchange offers, we sit at the crossroads of the Internet for customers located inside Equinix to innovate and accelerate their businesses. Interconnection is 17% of our recurring revenue, making it a $400 million annual business. 
The scope, scale, reach and diversity of our platform remain without parallel. We are continuing to invest in systems, processes and people to ensure consistent service delivery on a global basis and manage the complexities associated with a massively scaled retail business, rapidly approaching 20,000 customer deployments and generating over 0.5 million customer interactions each quarter.
We are now live across all regions with Equinix Customer One, our initiative to streamline our call to cash process and standardize our products and services worldwide. This is a major milestone in our drive for global consistency and a critical capability to scale ourselves sales engine and provide a high-quality experience for customers. 
Importance of global selling is reflected in the business we are winning. Today, over 50% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions, and over 80% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, showcasing how customers leverage Platform Equinix to support their businesses.
Turning to the Telecity acquisition. We continue to expect this compelling combination to deliver solid value to shareholders of both companies. Telecity announced solid quarterly results this morning, which were consistent with our expectations. Regarding the regulatory status of the deal, Equinix has received approval of our request to work through the EU commission to secure clearance for the acquisition, an efficient process that we use a single regulatory authority to evaluate this transaction. In anticipation of the expected close in the first half of 2016, we have multiple teams working together to map out an integration plan to determine the optimal organizational structures.
We continue to believe the deal offers the opportunity to increase networking cloud density to better serve customers and will enhance our existing European portfolio. As it relates to the broader M&A landscape, we have our eye on the consolidation activity happening in our industry and will continue be both proactive and highly selective in the pursuit of opportunities that we believe complement our strategy and create significant shareholder value.
Interconnection is a critical source of sustaining value for Equinix, and we continue to invest here in order to maintain market leadership and execute on our highly differentiated strategy, which is centered on creating and curating digital ecosystems.  
Revenue from interconnection grew 15% year-over-year, and we added over 6,100 cross connects this quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter delivering at this level. Connection to cloud providers from buyers across all vertical markets is a strong driver of interconnection. And we also see growth in productivity among content and network companies as the exponential growth in data drives the need for more peering. Our digital exchanges experienced a sizable increase in both traffic and ports, with a step-up of 158 ports added on our Internet exchange.
Fiber and ecosystems for multiple customers are interconnected within a data center generate attractive returns. Our portfolio of stabilized assets continues to grow at 4% and is tracking to over 32% yields on our gross PP&E investments. Majority of our development pipeline is allocated to current campus expansions to meet demands of existing customers and achieve operational scale that maximizes returns while mitigating risk. 
Now let me shift to cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical industries. Inside our data centers, networks, cloud, IT service companies and enterprises, our interconnecting to offer businesses improve service delivery and performance by putting systems, applications and data closer to end users. 
In the network vertical, we delivered solid growth this quarter with network expansions across all regions to support traffic growth and deliver new cloud services. Network-to-cloud cross connects doubled year-over-year as providers deploy new routes to connect traffic and services. There are a variety of catalysts generating growth in the network segment, including mobile computing, which is changing how service providers and enterprises interact. 
Equinix is benefiting from the proliferation of mobile applications and content, with increased demand driving new interconnection activity. Mobile operators and major content companies are using Equinix data centers to peer mobile content, aggregate networks, facilitate mobile payments and deploy roaming exchanges.
In the content and digital media vertical, both was driven by global expansions from players, including a global French technology company specializing in performance marketing; and Tencent, a Chinese media and entertainment and Internet firm. We're also seeing an emerging opportunity to support media and entertainment companies that are moving workloads to the cloud, leveraging Equinix and the cloud services inside our facilities to collaborate on production and editing.
Turning to the financial services vertical. We see continued diversification in this segment with a series of lighthouse wins in insurance, electronic payments and asset management. New customers this quarter include AIA, a top Asian insurance firm; a top 10 foreign exchange that is deploying Performance Hub as well as its matching in our Secaucus campus and a top 5 global asset management firm that is deploying across Asia. 
Turning now to cloud and IT services. We are experiencing continued momentum across cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter as major cloud players such as AWS, Datapipe, Oracle and ServiceNow continue to expand. Last quarter, we were a major part of both Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference and a Google Cloud Platform Global Roadshow, where developers and partners were educated on how to leverage our industry-leading Cloud Exchange capabilities. 
Software-based provisioning and control capabilities offered by the Equinix Cloud Exchange are a critical innovation in allowing customers to dynamically create and manage private, secured virtual connections and multiple cloud services over a single port. We continue to see momentum on the Exchange, which is live in 21 markets globally and has over 180 customers provisioned. In the second quarter, the solution was awarded the Most Innovative Carrier Cloud service by Light Reading, a powerful recognition of our progress and our commitment to delivering steady innovation.
To date, our effort to build cloud density inside Equinix has primarily been focused on private connectivity, particularly for leading Infrastructure-as-a-Service platforms [indiscernible] Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud platform. As customers expand the use -- their use of hybrid cloud, we are responding to offer cloud connectivity options to significantly improve the end user experience for a wide range of Software-as-a-Service applications. 
Software-as-a-Service is the largest segment in the cloud market and is experiencing rapid adoption among enterprises. We have expanded our relationship with Microsoft, and later this year, we'll begin offering direct access to Microsoft Office 365, making new ground with secure private connectivity, one of the most widely used enterprise SaaS applications. 
We are building features and functionality on the Cloud Exchange to support this application and paves the way for additional SaaS providers to deliver similar services. We also continue to expand the diversity of service providers leveraging the Cloud Exchange to deliver services to their customers. This quarter, we announced an agreement with Aliyun, Alibaba's cloud computing arm, to provide dedicated and secure direct access to Aliyun's full suite of cloud services. 
Turning now to the enterprise vertical. The enterprise vertical delivered record bookings. And we are seeing traction in penetrating this vertical as customers seek to re-architect IT, people, locations, clouds and data. We added a record number of new customers, including multiple Fortune 50 firms and secured Performance Hub wins with CareStream, a health care medical device company; and Harmon, a premium audio equipment maker. 
Our Performance Hub solution is now the primary entry point for enterprise clients. Over 190 customers have deployed Performance Hub to optimize network architectures, distribute applications closer to end users, enable critical Big Data use cases and provide efficient, secure private access to cloud services.
By deploying these solutions, customers are reducing operating expenses and improving application performance as well as end user experience. For example, a global engineering and construction customer that deployed a Performance Hub solution at Equinix, increased bandwidth per employee by 2.5x, reduced their operating expenses by 25% and improved application latency by 38%, which is critical for global workforce collaboration. 
A Fortune 50 industrial conglomerate customer that migrated to a hybrid cloud architecture at Equinix achieved a 30% cost reduction in cloud connectivity per application and over $8 million in annual operating savings.
Turning to our go-to-market strategy. We are expanding our routes to market to our global channel program, which now has over 200 partners, including referral partners, agents, resellers and cloud and technology partners who are all implementing sell-through and sell-with models. The initial focus is on building the framework programs and tools necessary to allow partners to effectively embed Equinix as a foundation for their enterprise solutions, particularly with our resellers who today are driving the majority of channel bookings. 
For example, TelefÃ³nica, a leading global telecommunications provider and an Equinix-certified reseller, is helping a key mobile company move to a cloud-based business model. This customer required a large infrastructure enabler to help with their transition to cloud, and Equinix delivered a compelling global solution through TelefÃ³nica. 
As we continue to see broad adoption of the hybrid cloud, we expect an increasing proportion of new growth to come through the channel. So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover some of the details and results for the quarter."

I'm pleased to have this opportunity yet again to provide you an update on our quarterly performance.

I'm pleased to have this opportunity yet again to provide you an update on our quarterly performance. Q2 was another very strong quarter with all 3 regions delivering better-than-expected results. 
On a normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions delivered very healthy year-over-year revenue growth at 23% and 26%, respectively, while our larger Americas region produced another double-digit growth quarter of 10% over the same quarter last year.
Our key operating and performance metrics continue to reflect this trends of the value proposition we deliver to our customers. We added 3,800 net billable cabinets in the quarter, our highest level of cabinet installs ever. This is effectively selling an entire capacity of 2 large data centers in one single quarter. 
Our MRR per cabinet on an FX-neutral basis was up slightly to $2,015 per cabinet or a 1.2% quarter-over-quarter improvement, largely due to increased interconnection activity. Over the past 3 quarters, the business has shown signs of accelerated growth. Given our success over the first half of the year, particularly the strength of the gross and net bookings, we're meaningfully raising our guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. 
Updated revenue guidance now implies a normalized and constant currency growth rate of over 15% compared to the prior year, eclipsing last year's growth rate of 14%. Also, we're very pleased to have completed the first 6 months of the year operating and reporting as a REIT, including paying our first 2 quarterly dividends and announcing our third dividend earlier today. 
We also received a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in May, which for all intents and purposes, matches the specifics of our desired REIT structure. The PLR ruled favorably on how we classify our revenues and assets. Basically, interconnection revenues are qualified REIT income and our data centers are qualified readable assets. 
Now moving to the slides. So as depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $665.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our revenue's overperformance was due to many factors, including strong bookings activity, higher-than-expected custom sales order activity, net positive pricing actions and lower-than-planned churn. 
Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $5.2 million negative currency headwind when compared to the average FX rates of last quarter. Although currencies remain volatile throughout this quarter across all of our operating currencies, there was no meaningful FX impact when compared to our guidance rates, as the EMEA net cash flow hedges continue to offset a good portion of the negative impact attributed to our stronger U.S. dollar. 
Our global cash gross profit increased 2% over the prior quarter, although our cash gross margin decreased slightly due to higher seasonal utility rates. Global cash SG&A expenses increased $149.6 million due to increased sales compensation expense, given the strong booking activity and lower-than-planned capitalized IT costs, given the rollout in all 3 regions of our Equinix Customer One initiative. 
Global adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 3% over the prior quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong revenue flow-through. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $3.3 million currency impact when compared to the average rate used last quarter and a $1.4 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. 
Global AFFO was $221.4 million or up 26% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our Q2 AFFO includes approximately $1.3 million in commitment fees related to the Telecity bridge loan. Global net income was $59.5 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.03, including the acquisition cost of $9.9 million. 
Now over the next few quarters, we expect our net income to fluctuate due to acquisition and financing costs related to Telecity acquisition. Also we'll start to hedge our pound sterling net investment exposure for the acquisition. As a heads-up, when we mark-to-market the hedges, whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow into the income statement on the other income and expense line and therefore may cause our go-forward as-reported GAAP earnings to fluctuate. 
Global MRR churn for Q2 was better than expected at 1.8%, our fourth quarter in a row at this lower level. As previously stated, MRR churn is inherently lumpy based on the timing of customer decisions. And therefore, as we look forward, we expect our quarterly MRR churn for each of the last 2 quarters of the year to range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to occur in Q2.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. Americas region had a strong bookings quarter, lower-than-planned MRR churn and improving -- improved pricing metrics. On a normalized and constant currency basis, the Americas revenues was up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-over-year. 
Adjusted EBITDA was flat over the prior quarter, largely due to higher seasonal utility costs over the summer season and up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represent 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 2,600 cross connects and 102 exchange ports in the quarter. 
Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,100 in the quarter. For new builds, we're proceeding with our Dallas-7 project. This build strengthens our value proposition in the Dallas market while taking advantage of our interconnection density in our other Dallas IBXs. 
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 6. EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings. We continue to see strength in our Dutch and U.K. businesses as cloud service providers continue to deploy across these markets. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenues were up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 23% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 7% over the prior quarter and 31% for the same quarter last year. 
We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,300 net cross connects. EMEA interconnection revenues now represent 8% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis to $1,472 per cabinet and net cabinets billing increased by 1,500 [ph] 
Over the quarter, we opened additional phases in our key data centers in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris and intend to proceed with the next phase of our Frankfurt-4 IBX to support underlying demand in this robust and improving market for us. 
And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 7. Asia Pacific remains our fastest growing region with revenues up 7% over the prior quarter and up 26% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum across all of our verticals. 
Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 10% over the prior quarter and 33% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up over 50%, with strong improvement coming from our Japanese business. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter despite a number of large cloud-based deployments installed over the quarter. Net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 over the prior quarter, and we added a healthy 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues.
For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong this quarter and had 7 expansions, and we have 7 expansions currently underway across 6 metros as we continue to scale our business across this region. 
Now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 8. At the end of the quarter, we added $436 million of unrestricted cash and investments, a large decrease over the prior quarter principally due to the funds we escrowed for the Telecity acquisition and the increasing capital expenditures. 
Our net debt leverage ratio increased to 3.4x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of reduced cash levels and an increase in capital lease obligations. As we look forward, we expect our pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA to temporarily creep above our stated target of 3x to 4x to 4.5x due to the Telecity acquisition. Although given the cash flow attributes of our model, we should return to our targeted range over a reasonably short period of time. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. In 2015, we're raising our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $850 million and $860 million, an effective dollar increase of $25 million over prior guidance or a 19% increase year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance. 
Our AFFO guidance now includes approximately $6.8 million in costs related to the bridge loan. Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO payout ratio equates to 45%. 
As we look beyond 2015, our REIT transitional year, we continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for the steadily growing cash dividend, as well as moving more assets from the taxable REIT structure to the qualified REIT structure. 
Now looking at capital expenditures, refer to Slide 10, please. For the quarter, capital expenditures are $221.3 million, including recurring CapEx of $27 million. Given our strong and above-expected performance year-to-date, we're closely assessing our inventory and fill rates across our Tier 1 markets. It is our expectation that our capital expenditures will now remain at the Q2 levels for the remainder of the year. And therefore, we're raising our nonrecurring or expansion CapEx for the full year to now range between $685 million to $735 million. Recurring CapEx is expected to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million.
As presented on expansion tracking slide, we currently have 15 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 14 are campus builds or incremental phase builds. We're currently building across 11 metros worldwide, focusing on investments where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate attractive returns, prioritizing those markets that support our key ecosystem objectives.
And finally, turning to Slide 11. Operating performance of our stabilized 67 global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than 1 year deliver steady as-reported revenue growth of 4%, a decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Currently, these projects generate a 32% cash-on-cash return on gross PP&E invested premium valued mature campuses deliver particularly where ecosystems are especially vibrant. I'll turn the call back to Steve now."

Let me now shift gears and cover the 2015 outlook on Slide 15. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $681 million and $685 million, a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q2 2015. 
Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $150 million to $154 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $313 million and $317 million, which includes a $1 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q2 2015. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $222 million and $242 million, which includes approximately $32 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to range between $2.685 billion and $2.695 billion, a 15% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates. 
Revised revenues are a $55 million increase compared to our prior guidance. Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $595 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.25 billion and $1.26 billion or a 46.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $2 million of positive foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 18%. 
Excluding this positive currency impact, revised adjusted EBITDA is a $23 million increase compared to prior guidance. We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $850 million and $860 million or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $800 million and $850 million, which includes $150 million of recurring capital expenditures. 
So in closing, we delivered a strong first half and are delighted to see momentum across all our industry verticals and geographies as customers continue to select Platform Equinix as the key enabler of IT transformation. We are pleased with our team's disciplined execution and the strength of our ecosystems is translating into solid revenue growth, firm pricing and expanding margins, all of which combined to give us the financial firepower to continue to invest in our global service delivery model, develop innovative solutions. Our operating performance reflects the significant role we plan to rapidly evolving digital economy, and we will continue to focus on creating sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether that's more geographic or contract-specific. Second, I think the commentary, Keith, around the churn around 2% to 2.5% is a bit higher than we would normally expect. If you could address if there's some specific expectations that you have for that or is that kind of a general conservative estimate. And then my last question, maybe Steve, strategically, I think we understand kind of what Equinix is trying to do, become really kind of create these platforms, connect businesses to the cloud and be that glue. I think it's harder to see quantitatively in the business in terms of whether it's working and how it's contributing to revenue growth. If you could kind of put some meat on the bones quantitatively around watching this strategy unfold would be super helpful."

First and foremost, as it relates to net positive pricing actions, we as a company, we continue to monitor how we perform as we renew our contracts with our customers. And clearly, there are times there are negative pricing actions, and of course, there's positive pricing actions. Over the last few quarters, the message that we've been delivering is globally, we're seeing net positive pricing actions, which means the price increases are outweighing the overall price decreases. And so it's a global phenomenon. You can see it across the price points. The MRR per cab, our yields across all 3 regions. Second question that I'll take is on churn. We -- when we looked at the year, certainly, we're very, very pleased with how we performed in Q1 at 2%. We were delighted with what we saw in Q2, 1.8%. But we really were trying to guide for the total year at somewhere between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, and we set the bias is likely to the lower end. With our overperformance in Q2, we recognize that some of that is timing-based, and therefore, we're going to forecast it in Q3. Equally, there's a churn that's going to take place in Europe that we are fully aware of and had planned for where our customer had taken down a sizable piece of space in one of our important data centers, and it was going to get relocated this year, and this is something that was planned for from the outset. And so we are going to absorb that churn in our Q3 and therefore Q4 results. And so that -- there's nothing fundamental going on -- wrong with the business and nothing fundamentally causing us concern around the churn area. In fact, it's the exact opposite so we see great momentum. But recognizing the churn is lumpy and sometimes based on how customers decide to notify us when the churn sometimes causes it to get a little bit more allocated to one specific quarter or period. But nothing to be concerned about."

First of all in the quarter, this quarter, almost a little over 30% of our bookings this quarter came from cloud and IT services, and almost 17% of the bookings came from the enterprise vertical. So in terms of creating this cloud environment to attract enterprises, that is unfolding as we expected. And some of the steps that I out to you, you've heard that we've had good success with both enterprises and in the cloud vertical. The other industry verticals continue to sell underpinned growth, so we've got solid growth across content digital media, financial services and the network suppliers, all -- actually also pursuing cloud with their end customers. So we're seeing the same trends as we think about the cloud, how it's affecting everybody. So we had record net bookings this quarter. You've heard me talk about key wins with the Fortune 50 so we're getting use cases and success stories built with big profile companies in several of the industry segments that make up the enterprise. We're starting to crack into the Fortune 500 as I mentioned. We've got Performance Hub wins being deployed across multiple industry verticals. So the overall strategy becoming enabler of this transformation to the cloud computing paradigm shift is working. The indirect channel are starting to show up for us. We are seeing these enterprises take advantage of the hybrid cloud at Equinix -- or actually, our acquisition that Charles and his team over with this company called Nimbo, we're starting to see the professional service take place to help companies bridge and find the hybrid cloud. So there's good progress across lots of fronts here, lots of new logos. Charles, I don't know if there's anything you'd add to that."

And I think that includes, as Steve said, enterprise bookings over-indexing relative to the revenue proportion so that is a growing area. Enterprise and cloud combined actually combining for the majority of our new logo capture, and so we're having success on both the supply side with cloud ecosystem and now increasingly on the demand side. Good traction in the channel with getting additional reach into the enterprise and again, seeing overall very solid results in interconnection, including what we track, which is interconnection between sub segments, meaning for example, enterprise to cloud, cloud to network, et cetera, with really cloud being a primary driver point there. So the underlying metrics are definitely indicating some good solid momentum."

So Mike, as nonrecurring activity, we saw a slightly elevated activity this quarter, roughly up $5 million over what we saw in the prior quarter. And so again, recognize when we had our guidance, we knew what -- we knew how we thought we were going to perform and so it was generally most of that embedded in our forward guidance. We certainly are more elevated than we originally anticipated at the beginning part of the year. And if you'll recall when we talked again 2 quarters ago or off the Q4 earnings call, at that time, we're saying that we're roughly $5 million below on a quarterly basis. And so all that being said, a lot of the growth that you're seeing in the revenue line is attributed a little part to the nonrecurring activity. So that's up again probably $15 million [ph] higher than we thought. The rest is coming from the fact that we're booking more, we're booking faster in the quarter. We're getting the price points. And we didn't experience the churn that we anticipated. And that's being the real driver of our success is more coming from the MRR, less coming from the NRR. As it relates to the question on FX, as I said in my prepared remarks, there were -- our net exposure on the revenue line relative to Q1 actively was a benefit of $5.2 million [ph] -- sorry, it was a negative -- it was a headwind of $5.2 million [ph] on the revenue, $3.3 million [ph] on EBITDA line. When you look at the net hedge impact quarter-over-quarter, it's basically a negative $700,000 on the revenue line and basically a negative $400,000 on the EBITDA line. Again, that's taking the hedge that we had in place in Q1 or the benefit of the hedge we had in Q1 and then offsetting it with the benefit the hedge we had in Q2."

And as a team, I would tell you that we continue to be very thoughtful about where we focus and how we create shareholder value and how we continue to expand our global leadership position. So we're going to remain, as I mentioned in my comments, very proactive and -- but highly selective on where we focus our attention. We were obviously well aware of the Telx transaction that was taking place. I won't make really any comments about that other than to tell you that our interests remain the same. We're going to try to scale this platform globally. We're going to try to deepen our interconnection and network density as we look at the M&A activity, and we're going to continue to try to capture the cloud and enterprise marketplace that we talk so much about. So we'll continue to -- we compete with both those entities around the edges, as you know. We'll continue to compete on the basis of our own merits and the value creation that we deliver to our customers, so I think we feel good about platform we have in place. I would tell you that our belief internally is that the platform that we have around the globe is very difficult to replicate. The degree of difficulty to replicate globally at scale level consistent with the service delivery that we deliver around the world with the services that we have is extremely high. So we feel confident that we're well positioned to continue to compete even with this combination."

And in the case of Telx, they -- in order for us to prosecute our interconnection business, in some instances, we are using them to provide some of the services in terms of the interconnection going through certain meet-me rooms. And because of the momentum in our business, we're actually contributing to their interconnection because of that momentum and so made that continue. We certainly like that. And -- but in terms of the competitive threat of that and what the combination looks like, again I'd go back to Steve's comments, which is our customers are really continuing to respond to our value proposition, looking for global access to rich network connectivity, which we believe we can provide in a best industry basis, diverse, secure, high-performance private connectivity to cloud service providers around the world, which we also provide and then consistent scalable operations that can respond to their rapidly changing requirements, something that we've invested a boatload of money in.

So we haven't typically broken out the specific percentage of indirect channel bookings. But I will say that it is on the rise. And in particular, our reseller community with whom we are engaging in sort of sell-with motions, the market is still somewhat immature. I mean, that's the reality. The enterprise market are still looking for solutions to their adoption of hybrid cloud. And that means they typically engage with us and with partners to deliver a more complete solution, and we're seeing really good success with our key resale partners. So that's where the real momentum is in our channel efforts. As it relates to the direct side, about 220 quota-bearing heads worldwide. We will look to probably increase that on the margin where we're seeing success in certain markets. And that is true in all 3 regions. So in fact, I am just recently reviewed with each of our regional president their plans as it relates to that in sales headcount in response to market conditions. And all of them, in a quite disciplined fashion, are looking to do that where we believe we have sort of latent demand that we can capture in the market. So that won't be a huge number, but we think that given the momentum we have in the market now we would continue to have, but we're at 220 and I would expect another perhaps 20 or 30 heads, to come in over the next several quarters based on continued momentum."

So if I give you a bridge of the operational performance, if I look at AFFO and give you a bridge of the operational performance, we're improving and yes, this will continue throughout the remaining part of the year. But offsetting that are 2 things: number one, and the biggest thing is really interest expense. And part of that interest expense is attached to basically the $7 million for the commitment fee that we're paying on the bridge fee for the Telecity acquisition. But part of it is when we actually -- when we put in more capital leases we take it from operating to capital, we have some impact there. When we take large projects like we had, we had the Big Five [ph] projects in Q1 that went live and that was, as you'll recall, Singapore-3, Melbourne-1, Toronto-2 and New York-6 and London-6. Interest that was otherwise capitalized in those transactions now also moves into, if you will, the operating line and that affects AFFO. But principally speaking, we continue to see continued momentum our ability to drive up the EBITDA. And generally speaking, AFFO will translate with that over a period of time. But there's some anomalies that are taking place over the latter half of the year primarily because of our construction activity and the acquisition."

And then thirdly, can we do something that will accelerate our capture of cloud and enterprises to connect to the cloud. So most of our activity puts -- we put most of the deal flow through those 3 lenses. And if you go back and look at our 10 or 11 acquisitions, we can point to some combination of those 3 things. We are -- I would tell you most of the activity is outside of North America. Latin America, as I've mentioned to you guys this in the past is of interest to continue to expand the platform beyond Brazil when and if the opportunities exist. In Asia, we're continuing to look at going deeper into China. We're working very hard in that market to try to expand beyond our footprint in Shanghai, and that's of high importance to us. India will remain on the radar scale and for us but into finding the right partner and the right timing has proved challenging. But across other parts of Asia, there are opportunities. And then in Europe, I think the Telecity activity is going to consume us, as you might imagine, and put us in 6, 7 new markets and strengthen our footprint in the existing markets. So it's kind of where our focus is today. And I think some day, you're going to see us show up probably to start in South Africa as we head to that part of the world, and there'll be opportunities there that might broaden our reach in that part of the world.

Yes, I think obviously, we're encouraged and delighted with the acceleration in the business and sort of achieving that 15% growth rate is something we feel very good about. We do think that, that reflects a combination of factors that include us continuing to gain share. But obviously, when you think about TAM, it's always a matter of how you're defining it. And I think what we would say is that the TAM for the portion of the market, we believe, is particularly relevant to us where our value proposition is strongest is indeed accelerating. And we think that's accelerating due to the fact that enterprises are, in fact, adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of chores. And so we -- as we look at offers like network or our Performance Hub solutions, the Cloud Exchange being able to really enable and empower companies to do these hybrid cloud kind of architectures and implement them, inclusive of the professional services required to get them there, we believe that market is indeed -- the total addressable market there is indeed accelerating, but we also think we're capturing additional shares. So it's probably a combination of those things. I would say that when we said that the macro market was sort of low -- high single, low double digits, I think that we are seeing, I think, above that in terms of targeted markets around this enterprise IT transformation and cloud adoption. But we also, I think, are getting more than our fair share of that. So I think we've -- we continue to overperform relative to the market and expect that, that will continue in the future."

So as Colby, as you know, something that we responded to an evolving market demand in terms of people looking to implement multitiered architectures. And as they -- that continues to be a phenomenon that we see. As you know, we have continued to have a very strong discipline around right customer, right application and the right assets. And frankly, it's that discipline that's driving the pricing behavior that Keith talked about earlier and driving the churn dynamics that we're seeing, which is improvements in both of those areas. But as it relates to business suites, we've seen some success in that. It's really in a small number of markets. We've really implemented a product like that essentially in Ashburn and in New York. And even in those markets, we're evolving it based on our updated understanding of the customers' requirements. And so what we're finding is that we're now implementing a more complete hybrid cloud solution that often looks like a Performance Hub implementation, which is a smaller implementation, more network-dense, more rich in connectivity to other clouds but often paired with a slightly larger implementation that maybe in an adjacent site or in a different metro that allows them to put certain applications there, that allow them to really fully implement hybrid cloud. And so we're evolving in a bit. We continue to build out sites that we think can support that sort of multitiered architecture. You will see upcoming announcements from us relative to how our product set is evolving to meet that demand.

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This marks our 50th quarter of consecutive revenue growth. We delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges",1824,"Okay. Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This marks our 50th quarter of consecutive revenue growth. We delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges while global demand for interconnected data centers drove record net bookings and our second best gross bookings.
This momentum reflects our strategic position in the digital economy and the value of our global platform in addressing customer needs. Additionally, we are extremely well positioned to capture a sizable share of enterprise demand driven by a variety of factors, including the rapid adoption of hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice.
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $665.6 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million for the quarter, up 2% over the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year, delivering a 47% margin. AFFO grew 18% year-over-year to $221.4 million.
The benefits of operational discipline and our strategic approach to meeting customer demand continue to manifest in stable pricing, firm yields and one of the lowest churn quarters on record. We now have 6,300 customers around the globe, including more than 100 of the Fortune 500. Over 4,000 Equinix employees support our operations, product development and the execution of our go-to-market strategy to offer the only global interconnection platform and the largest retail data center footprint worldwide.
With over 161,000 cross connects and vibrant use of our Internet and Cloud Exchange offers, we sit at the crossroads of the Internet where customers locate inside Equinix to innovate and accelerate their businesses. Interconnection is 17% of our recurring revenue, making it a $400 million annual business.
The scope, scale, reach and diversity of our platform remain without parallel. We are continuing to invest in systems, processes and people to ensure consistent service delivery on a global basis and manage the complexities associated with a massively scaled retail business rapidly approaching 20,000 customer deployments and generating over 0.5 million customer interactions each quarter.
We are now live across all regions with Equinix Customer One, our initiative to streamline our quote-to-cash process and standardize our products and services worldwide. This is a major milestone in our drive for global consistency and a critical capability to scale sales engine and provide a high-quality experience for customers.
The importance of global selling is reflected in the business we are winning. Today, over 50% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions, and over 80% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, showcasing how customers leverage Platform Equinix to support their businesses.
Turning to the Telecity acquisition. We continue to expect this compelling combination to deliver solid value to shareholders of both companies. Telecity announced solid quarterly results this morning, which were consistent with our expectations. Regarding the regulatory status of the deal, Equinix has received approval of our request to work through the EU Commission to secure clearance for the acquisition, an efficient process that we use a single regulatory authority to evaluate this transaction. In anticipation of the expected close in the first half of 2016, we have multiple teams working together to map out an integration plan and determine the optimal organizational structures.
We continue to believe the deal offers the opportunity to increase networking cloud density to better serve customers and will enhance our existing European portfolio. As it relates to the broader M&A landscape, we have our eye on the consolidation activity happening in our industry and will continue be both proactive and highly selective in pursuit of opportunities that we believe complement our strategy and create significant shareholder value.
Interconnection is a critical source of sustaining value for Equinix, and we continue to invest here in order to maintain market leadership and execute on our highly differentiated strategy, which is centered on creating and curating digital ecosystems.
Revenue from interconnection grew 15% year-over-year, and we added over 6,100 cross connects this quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter delivering at this level. Connection to cloud providers from buyers across all vertical markets is a strong driver of interconnection. And we also see growth in connectivity among content and network companies as the exponential growth in data drives the need for more peering. Our digital exchanges experienced a sizable increase in both traffic and ports, with a step-up of 158 ports added on our Internet exchange.
Vibrant ecosystems where multiple customers are interconnected within a data center generate attractive returns. Our portfolio of stabilized assets continues to grow at 4% and is tracking to over 32% yields on our gross PP&E investments. The majority of our development pipeline is allocated to current campus expansions to meet demands of existing customers and achieve operational scale that maximizes returns while mitigating risk.
Now let me shift to cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical industries. Inside our data centers, networks, clouds, IT service companies and enterprises are interconnecting to offer businesses improved service delivery and performance by putting systems, applications and data closer to end users.
In the network vertical, we delivered solid growth this quarter with network expansions across all regions to support traffic growth and deliver new cloud services. Network-to-cloud cross connects doubled year-over-year as providers deploy new routes to connect traffic and services. There are a variety of catalysts generating growth in the network segment, including mobile computing, which is changing how service providers and enterprises interact.
Equinix is benefiting from the proliferation of mobile applications and content, with increased demand driving new interconnection activity. Mobile operators and major content companies are using Equinix data centers to peer mobile content, aggregate networks, facilitate mobile payments and deploy roaming exchanges.
In the content and digital media vertical, growth was driven by global expansions from players, including Criteo, a global French technology company specializing in performance marketing; and Tencent, a Chinese media and entertainment and Internet firm. We are also seeing an emerging opportunity to support media and entertainment companies that are moving workloads to the cloud, leveraging Equinix and the cloud services inside our facilities to collaborate on production and editing.
Turning to the financial services vertical. We see continued diversification in this segment with a series of lighthouse wins in insurance, electronic payments and asset management. New customers this quarter include AIA, a top Asian insurance firm; Currenex, a top 10 foreign exchange that is deploying Performance Hub as well as its matching engine in our Secaucus campus; and a top 5 global asset management firm that is deploying across Asia.
Turning now to cloud and IT services. We are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter as major cloud players such as AWS, Datapipe, Oracle and ServiceNow continue to expand. Last quarter, we were a major part of both Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference and a Google Cloud Platform Global Roadshow, where developers and partners were educated on how to leverage our industry-leading Cloud Exchange capabilities.
Software-based provisioning and control capabilities offered by the Equinix Cloud Exchange are a critical innovation in allowing customers to dynamically create and manage private, secured virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port. We continue to see momentum on the Exchange, which is live in 21 markets globally and has over 180 customers provisioned. In the second quarter, this solution was awarded the Most Innovative Carrier Cloud Service by Light Reading, a powerful recognition of our progress and our commitment to delivering steady innovation.
To date, our effort to build cloud density inside Equinix has primarily been focused on private connectivity, particularly for leading Infrastructure-as-a-Service platforms, including AWS, Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud Platform. As customers expand the use -- their use of hybrid cloud, we are responding to offer cloud connectivity options that significantly improve the end-user experience for a wide range of software and service applications -- Software-as-a-Service applications.
Software-as-a-Service is the largest segment in the cloud market and is experiencing rapid adoption among enterprises. We have expanded our relationship with Microsoft, and later this year, we'll begin offering direct access to Microsoft Office 365, breaking new ground with secure private connectivity for one of the most widely used enterprise SaaS applications.
We are building features and functionality on the Cloud Exchange to support this application which paves the way for additional SaaS providers to deliver similar services. We also continue to expand the diversity of service providers leveraging the Cloud Exchange to deliver services to their customers. This quarter, we announced an agreement with Aliyun, Alibaba's cloud computing arm, to provide dedicated and secure direct access to Aliyun's full suite of cloud services.
Turning now to the enterprise vertical. The enterprise vertical delivered record bookings. And we are seeing traction in penetrating this vertical as customers seek to re-architect IT to connect people, locations, clouds and data. We added a record number of new customers, including multiple Fortune 50 firms and secured Performance Hub wins with Carestream, a health care medical device company; and Harman, a premium audio equipment maker.
Our Performance Hub solution is now the primary entry point for enterprise clients. Over 190 customers have deployed Performance Hub to optimize network architectures, distribute applications closer to end users, enable critical Big Data use cases and provide efficient, secure private access to cloud services.
By deploying these solutions, customers are reducing operating expenses and improving application performance as well as end-user experience. For example, a global engineering and construction customer that deployed a Performance Hub solution at Equinix increased bandwidth per employee by 2.5x. They reduced their operating expenses by 25% and improved application latency by 38%, which is critical for global workforce collaboration.
A Fortune 50 industrial conglomerate customer that migrated to a hybrid cloud architecture at Equinix achieved a 30% cost reduction in cloud connectivity per application and over $8 million in annual operating savings.
Turning to our go-to-market strategy. We are expanding our routes to market through our global channel program, which now has over 200 partners, including referral partners, agents, resellers and cloud and technology partners who are all implementing sell-through and sell-with models. The initial focus is on building the framework, programs and tools necessary to allow partners to effectively embed Equinix as a foundation for their enterprise solutions, particularly with our resellers who today are driving the majority of channel bookings.
For example, TelefÃ³nica, a leading global telecommunications provider and an Equinix-certified reseller, is helping a key mobile company move to a cloud-based business model. This customer required a large infrastructure enabler to help with their transition to cloud, and Equinix delivered a compelling global solution sold through TelefÃ³nica.
So as we continue to see broad adoption of the hybrid cloud, we expect an increasing proportion of new growth to come through the channel. So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover some of the details and results for the quarter."

Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'm pleased to have this opportunity yet again to provide you an update on our quarterly performance. Q2 was another very strong quarter with all 3 regions delivering better-than-expected r",1808,"Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'm pleased to have this opportunity yet again to provide you an update on our quarterly performance. Q2 was another very strong quarter with all 3 regions delivering better-than-expected results.
On a normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions delivered very healthy year-over-year revenue growth at 23% and 26%, respectively, while our larger Americas region produced another double-digit growth quarter of 10% over the same quarter last year.
Our key operating and performance metrics continue to reflect the strength of the value proposition we deliver to our customers. We added 3,800 net billable cabinets in the quarter, our highest level of cabinet installs ever. This is effectively selling the entire capacity of 2 large data centers in one single quarter.
Our MRR per cabinet on an FX-neutral basis was up slightly to $2,015 per cabinet or a 1.2% quarter-over-quarter improvement, largely due to increased interconnection activity. Over the past 3 quarters, the business has shown signs of accelerated growth. Given our success over the first half of the year, particularly the strength of the gross and net bookings, we're meaningfully raising our guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
Our updated revenue guidance now implies a normalized and constant currency growth rate of over 15% compared to the prior year, eclipsing last year's growth rate of 14%. Also, we're very pleased to have completed the first 6 months of the year operating and reporting as a REIT, including paying our first 2 quarterly dividends and announcing our third dividend earlier today.
We also received a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in May, which for all intents and purposes, matches the specifics of our desired REIT structure. The PLR ruled favorably on how we classify our revenues and assets. Basically, interconnection revenues are qualified REIT income and our data centers are qualified REIT-able assets.
Now moving to the slides. So as depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $665.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our revenue's overperformance was due to many factors, including strong bookings activity, higher-than-expected custom sales order activity, net positive pricing actions and lower-than-planned churn.
Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $5.2 million negative currency headwind when compared to the average FX rates of last quarter. Although currencies remain volatile throughout this quarter across all of our operating currencies, there was no meaningful FX impact when compared to our guidance rates, as the EMEA net cash flow hedges continue to offset a good portion of the negative impact attributed to our stronger U.S. dollar.
Our global cash gross profit increased 2% over the prior quarter, although our cash gross margin decreased slightly due to higher seasonal utility rates. Global cash SG&A expenses increased to $149.6 million due to increased sales compensation expense given the strong booking activity and lower-than-planned capitalized IT cost given the rollout in all 3 regions of our Equinix Customer One initiative.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 3% over the prior quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong revenue flow-through. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $3.3 million currency impact when compared to the average rate used last quarter and a $1.4 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $221.4 million or up 26% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our Q2 AFFO includes approximately $1.3 million in commitment fees related to the Telecity bridge loan. Global net income was $59.5 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.03, including the acquisition cost of $9.9 million.
Now over the next few quarters, we expect our net income to fluctuate due to acquisition and financing costs related to the Telecity acquisition. Also, we've started to hedge out our pound sterling net investment exposure for the acquisition. As a heads-up, when we mark-to-market the hedges, whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow into the income statement on the other income and expense line and therefore, may cause our go-forward as-reported GAAP earnings to fluctuate.
Global MRR churn for Q2 was better than expected at 1.8%, our fourth quarter in a row at this lower level. As previously stated, MRR churn is inherently lumpy based on the timing of customer decisions. And therefore, as we look forward, we expect our quarterly MRR churn for each of the last 2 quarters of the year to range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to occur in Q2.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong bookings quarter, lower-than-planned MRR churn and improving -- and improved pricing metrics. On a normalized and constant currency basis, the Americas revenues was up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-over-year.
Americas Adjusted EBITDA was flat over the prior quarter, largely due to higher seasonal utility costs over the summer season and up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 2,600 cross connects and 102 exchange ports in the quarter.
Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,100 in the quarter. For new builds, we're proceeding with our Dallas 7 project. This build strengthens our value proposition in the Dallas market while taking advantage of our interconnection density in our other Dallas IBXs.
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 6. EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings. We continue to see strength in our Dutch and U.K. businesses as cloud service providers continue to deploy across these markets. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenues were up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 23% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 7% over the prior quarter and 31% over the same quarter last year.
We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,300 net cross connects. EMEA interconnection revenues now represent 8% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis to $1,472 per cabinet and net cabinets billing increased by 1,500.
Over the quarter, we opened additional phases in our key data centers in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris and intend to proceed with the next phase of our Frankfurt 4 IBX to support underlying demand in this robust and improving market for us.
And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 7. Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing region with revenues up 7% over the prior quarter and up 26% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum across all of our verticals.
Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 10% over the prior quarter and 33% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up over 50%, with strong improvement coming from our Japanese business. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter despite a number of large cloud-based deployments installed over the quarter. Net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 over the prior quarter, and we added a healthy 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remain at 12% of the region's recurring revenues.
For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong this quarter and had 7 expansions, and we have 7 expansions currently underway across 6 metros as we continue to scale our business across this region.
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 8. At the end of the quarter, we added $436 million of unrestricted cash and investments, a large decrease over the prior quarter principally due to the funds we escrowed for the Telecity acquisition and the increasing capital expenditures.
Our net debt leverage ratio increased to 3.4x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of reduced cash levels and an increase in capital lease obligations. As we look forward, we expect our pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA to temporarily creep above our stated target of 3 to 4x to 4.5x due to the Telecity acquisition. Although given the cash flow attributes of our model, we should return to our targeted range over a reasonably short period of time.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. For 2015, we're raising our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $850 million and $860 million, an effective dollar increase of $25 million over prior guidance or a 19% increase year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance.
Our AFFO guidance now includes approximately $6.8 million in costs related to the bridge loan. Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO payout ratio equates to 45%.
As we look beyond 2015, our REIT transitional year, we continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for the steadily growing cash dividend as well as moving more assets from the taxable REIT structure to the qualified REIT structure.
Now looking at capital expenditures, refer to Slide 10, please. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $221.3 million, including a recurring CapEx of $27 million. Given our strong and above-expected performance year-to-date, we are closely assessing our inventory and fill rates across our Tier 1 markets. It is our expectation that our capital expenditures will now remain at the Q2 levels for the remainder of the year. And therefore, we're raising our nonrecurring or expansion CapEx for the full year to now range between $685 million to $735 million. Recurring CapEx is expected to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million.
As presented on the expansion tracking slide, we currently have 15 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 14 are campus builds or incremental phase builds. We're currently building across 11 metros worldwide, focusing on investments where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate attractive returns, prioritizing those markets that support our key ecosystem objectives.
And finally, turning to Slide 11. The operating performance of our stabilized 67 global IBX and expansion projects that had been open for more than 1 year delivered steady as-reported revenue growth of 4%, a decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Currently, these projects generate a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the premium value that these mature campuses deliver, particularly where our ecosystems are especially vibrant.
I'll turn the call back to Steve now."

Let me now shift gears and cover the 2015 outlook on Slide 15. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $681 million and $685 million, a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q2 2015.
Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $150 million to $154 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $313 million and $317 million, which includes a $1 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q2 2015.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $222 million and $242 million, which includes approximately $32 million of recurring capital expenditures.
For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to range between $2.685 billion and $2.695 billion, a 15% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates.
The revised revenues are a $55 million increase compared to our prior guidance. Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $595 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.25 billion and $1.26 billion or a 46.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $2 million of positive foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 18%.
Excluding this positive currency impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $23 million increase compared to prior guidance. We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $850 million and $860 million or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $800 million and $850 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures.
So in closing, we delivered a strong first half and are delighted to see momentum across all our industry verticals and geographies as customers continue to select Platform Equinix as the key enabler of IT transformation. We are pleased with our team's disciplined execution and the strength of our ecosystems is translating into solid revenue growth, firm pricing and expanding margins, all of which combine to give us the financial firepower to continue to invest in our global service delivery model and develop innovative solutions. Our operating performance reflects the significant role we play in a rapidly evolving digital economy, and we will continue to focus on creating sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether that's more geographic or contract-specific. Second, I think the commentary, Keith, around the churn around 2% to 2.5% is a bit higher than we would normally expect. If you could address if there's some specific expectations that you have for that or is that just kind of a general conservative estimate. And then my last question, maybe Steve, strategically, I think we understand kind of what Equinix is trying to do -- become, really kind of create these platforms, connect businesses to the cloud and be that glue. I think it's harder to see quantitatively in the business in terms of whether it's working and how it's contributing to revenue growth. If you could kind of put some meat on the bones quantitatively around watching this strategy unfold would be super helpful."
28202,306412608,842224,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Good questions, David.

First and foremost, as it relates to net positive pricing actions, we as a company, we continue to monitor how we perform as we renew our contracts with our customers. And clearly, there are times there are negative pricing actions, and of course, there's positive pricing actions. Over the last few quarters, the message that we've been delivering is globally, we're seeing net positive pricing actions, which means the price increases are outweighing, if you will, the price decreases. And so it's a global phenomenon. You can see it across effectively the price points, the MRR per cab, our yields across all 3 regions. Second question that I'll take is on churn. We -- when we looked in the year, certainly, we're very, very pleased with how we performed in Q1 at 2%. We were delighted with what we saw in Q2, 1.8%. But we really were trying to guide for the total year of somewhere between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, and we said the bias is likely to the lower end. With our overperformance in Q2, we recognize that some of that is timing-based, and therefore, we are going to forecast it in -- we're forecasting it in Q3. Equally, there's a churn that is going to take place in Europe that we are fully aware of and had planned for where our customer had taken down a sizable piece of space in one of our important data centers, and it was going to get relocated this year. And this is -- it was something that was planned for from the outset. And so we are going to absorb that churn in our Q3 and therefore, Q4 results. And so that -- there's nothing fundamental going wrong with the business and nothing fundamentally causing us concern around the churn area. In fact, it's the exact opposite. We see great momentum. But recognizing that churn is -- it is lumpy and it's sometimes based on how customers decide to notify us of when they churn sometimes causes it to get a little bit more allocated to one specific quarter or period, but nothing to be concerned about."

First of all, in the quarter, this quarter, almost -- a little over 30% of our bookings this quarter came from cloud and IT services, and almost 17% of the bookings came from the enterprise vertical. So in terms of creating this cloud environment to attract enterprises, that is unfolding as we expected. And some of the stats that I spouted out to you, you heard that we've had good success with both enterprises and in the cloud vertical. The other industry verticals continue to still underpin good growth. So we've got solid growth across content and digital media, financial services and the network suppliers, all -- actually also pursuing cloud with their end customers. So that we're seeing the same trends as we think about the cloud, how it's affecting everybody. So we had record net bookings this quarter. You heard me talk about key wins with the Fortune 50. So we're getting use cases and success stories built with big profile companies in several of the industry segments that make up the enterprise. We're starting to crack into the Fortune 500, as I mentioned. We've got Performance Hub wins being deployed across multiple industry verticals. So the overall strategy to become the enabler of this transformation to the cloud computing paradigm shift is working. The indirect channel is starting to show up for us. We are seeing these enterprises take advantage of the hybrid cloud at Equinix or actually our acquisition that Charles and his team are presiding with this company called Nimbo. We're starting to see the professional service traction take place to help companies bridge and find the hybrid cloud. So there's good progress across lots of fronts here, lots of new logos. Charles, I don't know if there's anything you'd add to that."

And I think that includes, as Steve said, enterprise bookings over-indexing relative to the revenue proportion. So that is a growing area. Enterprise and cloud combined actually combining for the majority of our new logo capture. And so we're having success on both the supply side with cloud ecosystem and now increasingly on the demand side. Good traction in the channel with getting the additional reach into the enterprise. And again, seeing overall very solid results in interconnection, including what we track, which is interconnection between subsegments, meaning, for example, enterprise to cloud, cloud to network, et cetera, with really cloud being a primary driver point there. So the underlying metrics are definitely indicating some good solid momentum."

It was roughly up $5 million over what we saw in the prior quarter. And so -- again, recognize when we had our guidance, we knew what -- we knew how we felt we're going to perform and so it was generally most of that was embedded in our forward guidance, but we certainly are more elevated than we originally anticipated at the beginning part of the year. And if you recall when we talked, again, 2 quarters ago or off the Q4 earnings call, at that time, we were saying that we're roughly $5 million below on a quarterly basis. And so all else -- all that being said, a lot of the growth that you are seeing and the raise in the revenue line, it's attributed a little part to the nonrecurring activity. So that's up again probably $15 million higher than we thought. The rest is coming from the fact that we're booking more. We're booking faster in the quarter. We're getting the price points. And we didn't experience the churn that we anticipated. And that's being the real driver of our success is more coming from the MRR, less coming from the NRR. As it relates to the question on FX, as I said in my prepared remarks, there were -- our net exposure on the revenue line relative to Q1 activity was a benefit of $5.2 million -- sorry, it was a negative -- it was a headwind of $5.2 million on the revenue line and $3.3 million on the EBITDA line. When we look at the net hedge impact quarter-over-quarter, it's basically a negative $700,000 on the revenue line and basically a negative $400,000 on the EBITDA line. Again, that is taking the hedge that we had in place in Q1 or the benefit of the hedge we had in Q1 and then offsetting it by the benefit in the hedge we had in Q2."

The enterprise market are still looking for solutions to their adoption of hybrid cloud. And that means they typically engage with us and with partners to deliver a more complete solution, and we're seeing really good success with our key resale partners. So that's where the real momentum is in our channel efforts. As it relates to the direct side, about 220 quota-bearing heads worldwide. We will look to probably increase that on the margin where we're seeing success in certain markets. And that is true in all 3 regions. So in fact, I am -- just recently reviewed with each of our regional presidents their plans as it relates to adding sales headcount in response to market conditions. And all of them, in a quite disciplined fashion, are looking to do that where we believe we have sort of latent demand that we can capture in the market. So that won't be a huge number, but we think that given the momentum we have in the market now, we would continue to add.

So if I give you a bridge of the operational performance -- if I look at AFFO and give you a bridge of the operational performance, you'll see that we're improving and yet, this will continue throughout the remaining part of the year. But offsetting that are 2 things: number one, and the biggest thing is really interest expense. And part of that interest expense is attached to basically the $7 million for the commitment fee that we're paying on the bridge fee for the Telecity acquisition. But part of it is when we actually -- when we put in more capital leases and we take it from operating to capital, we have some impact there. When we take large projects like we had. We had the big 5 projects in Q1 that went live and that was, as you'll recall, Singapore 3, Melbourne 1, Toronto 2 and New York 6 and London 6. Interest that was otherwise capitalized in those transactions now also moves into, if you will, the operating line and that affects AFFO. But principally speaking, we continue to see continued momentum in our ability to drive up the EBITDA. And generally speaking, AFFO will translate with that over a period of time, but there's some anomalies that are taking place over the latter half of the year primarily because of our construction activity and the acquisition."

But on the M&A color, as I mentioned to the previous question earlier here, I think from David, our focus on M&A activity is active. We have an active game board. We have 3 heavy filters that we tend to put any regional input through which is, can it scale the platform? Can we enhance our interconnection and network density, secondly. And then thirdly, can we do something that will accelerate our capture of cloud and enterprises to come in to connect to the cloud. So most of our activity puts -- we put most of the deal flow through those 3 lenses. And if you go back and look at our 10 or 11 acquisitions, we can point to some combination of those 3 things. We are -- I would tell you most of the activity is outside of North America. Latin America, as I've mentioned to you guys in the past, is of interest to continue to expand the platform beyond Brazil when and if the opportunities exist. In Asia, we're continuing to look at going deeper into China. We're working very hard in that market to try to expand beyond our footprint in Shanghai, and that's of high importance to us. India will remain on the radar scale for us, but India finding the right partner and the right timing has proved challenging. But across other parts of Asia, there are opportunities. And then in Europe, I think the Telecity activity is going to consume us, as you might imagine, and will put us in 6, 7 new markets and strengthen our footprint in the existing markets. So that's kind of where our focus is today.

And so we -- as we look at offers like network or around Performance Hub solution, the Cloud Exchange being able to really enable and empower companies to do these hybrid cloud kind of architectures and implement them, inclusive of the professional services required to get them there, we believe that market is indeed -- the total addressable market there is indeed accelerating, but we also think we're capturing additional shares. So it's probably a combination of those things. I would say that when we said that the macro market was sort of low -- high single, low double digits, I think that we are seeing, I think, above that in terms of targeted markets around this enterprise IT transformation and cloud adoption. But we also, I think, are getting more than our fair share of that. So I think we continue to overperform relative to the market and expect that, that will continue in the future."

So Colby, as you know, business suite is something that we responded to an evolving market demand in terms of people looking to implement multitiered architectures. And as they -- that continues to be a phenomenon that we see. As you know, we have continued to have a very strong discipline around right customer, right application and the right asset. And frankly, it's that discipline that's driving the pricing behavior that Keith talked about earlier and driving the churn dynamics that we're seeing, which is improvements to both of those areas. But as it relates to business suites, we've seen some success in that. It's really in a small number of markets. We've really implemented a product like that essentially in Ashburn and in New York. And even in those markets, we're evolving it based on our updated understanding of the customers' requirements. And so what we're finding is, is that we're now implementing a more complete hybrid cloud solution that often looks like a Performance Hub implementation, which is a smaller implementation, more network dense, more rich in connectivity to other clouds, but often paired with a slightly larger implementation that maybe in an adjacent site or in a different metro that allows them to put certain applications there, that allow them to really fully implement hybrid cloud. And so we're evolving in a bit. We continue to build out sites that we think can support that sort of multitiered architecture. You will see upcoming announcements from us relative to how our product set is evolving to meet that demand. And we feel very good about what we're doing to really support the complete need of the enterprise customer."

So that's one aspect of it. The second aspect, of course, we do -- we've been very, very successful in Singapore with our cloud deployment. And because of that, it comes in size and when it comes in size, it generally comes at a different price point. And so that also is a little bit dilutive to the overall message. And then, of course, currency is equally causing some fluctuation. So overall there, we're pleased with what we see in Asia Pacific. We're not surprised by the price points we're at.

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This marks our 50th quarter of consecutive revenue growth.

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This marks our 50th quarter of consecutive revenue growth. We delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges while global demand for interconnected data centers drove record net bookings and our second best gross bookings.
This momentum reflects our strategic position in the digital economy and the value of our global platform in addressing customer needs. Additionally, we are extremely well positioned to capture a sizable share of enterprise demand driven by a variety of factors, including the rapid adoption of hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice.
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $665.6 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million for the quarter, up 2% over the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year, delivering a 47% margin. AFFO grew 18% year-over-year to $221.4 million.
The benefits of operational discipline and a strategic approach to meeting customer demand continue to manifest in stable pricing, firm yields and one of the lowest churn quarters on record. We now have 6,300 customers around the globe, including more than 100 of the Fortune 500. Over 4,000 Equinix employees support our operations, product development and the execution of our go-to-market strategy to offer the only global interconnection platform and the largest retail data center footprint worldwide.
With over 161,000 cross connects and vibrant use of our Internet and Cloud Exchange offers, we sit at the crossroads of the Internet where customers locate inside Equinix to innovate and accelerate their businesses. Interconnection is 17% of our recurring revenue, making it a $400 million annual business.
The scope, scale, reach and diversity of our platform remain without parallel. We are continuing to invest in systems, processes and people to ensure consistent service delivery on a global basis and manage the complexities associated with a massively scaled retail business rapidly approaching 20,000 customer deployments and generating over 0.5 million customer interactions each quarter.
We are now live across all regions with Equinix Customer One, our initiative to streamline our quote-to-cash process and standardize our products and services worldwide. This is a major milestone in our drive for global consistency and a critical capability to scale sales engine and provide a high-quality experience for customers.
The importance of global selling is reflected in the business we are winning. Today, over 50% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions, and over 80% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, showcasing how customers leverage Platform Equinix to support their businesses.
Turning to the Telecity acquisition. We continue to expect this compelling combination to deliver solid value to shareholders of both companies. Telecity announced solid quarterly results this morning, which were consistent with our expectations. Regarding the regulatory status of the deal, Equinix has received approval of our request to work through the EU Commission to secure clearance for the acquisition, an efficient process that we use a single regulatory authority to evaluate this transaction. In anticipation of the expected close in the first half of 2016, we have multiple teams working together to map out an integration plan and determine the optimal organizational structures.
We continue to believe the deal offers the opportunity to increase networking cloud density to better serve customers and will enhance our existing European portfolio. As it relates to the broader M&A landscape, we have our eye on the consolidation activity happening in our industry and will continue be both proactive and highly selective in pursuit of opportunities that we believe complement our strategy and create significant shareholder value.
Interconnection is a critical source of sustaining value for Equinix, and we continue to invest here in order to maintain market leadership and execute on our highly differentiated strategy, which is centered on creating and curating digital ecosystems.
Revenue from interconnection grew 15% year-over-year, and we added over 6,100 cross connects this quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter delivering at this level. Connection to cloud providers from buyers across all vertical markets is a strong driver of interconnection. And we also see growth in connectivity among content and network companies as the exponential growth in data drives the need for more peering. Our digital exchanges experienced a sizable increase in both traffic and ports, with a step-up of 158 ports added on our Internet exchange.
Vibrant ecosystems where multiple customers are interconnected within a data center generate attractive returns. Our portfolio of stabilized assets continues to grow at 4% and is tracking to over 32% yields on our gross PP&E investments. The majority of our development pipeline is allocated to current campus expansions to meet demands of existing customers and achieve operational scale that maximizes returns while mitigating risk.
Now let me shift to cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical industries. Inside our data centers, networks, clouds, IT service companies and enterprises are interconnecting to offer businesses improved service delivery and performance by putting systems, applications and data closer to end users.
In the network vertical, we delivered solid growth this quarter with network expansions across all regions to support traffic growth and deliver new cloud services. Network-to-cloud cross connects doubled year-over-year as providers deployed new routes to connect traffic and services. There are a variety of catalysts generating growth in the network segment, including mobile computing, which is changing how service providers and enterprises interact.
Equinix is benefiting from the proliferation of mobile applications and content, with increased demand driving new interconnection activity. Mobile operators and major content companies are using Equinix data centers to peer mobile content, aggregate networks, facilitate mobile payments and deploy roaming exchanges.
In the content and digital media vertical, growth was driven by global expansions from players, including Criteo, a global French technology company specializing in performance marketing; and Tencent, a Chinese media and entertainment and Internet firm. We are also seeing an emerging opportunity to support media and entertainment companies that are moving workloads to the cloud, leveraging Equinix and the cloud services inside our facilities to collaborate on production and editing.
Turning to the financial services vertical. We see continued diversification in this segment with a series of lighthouse wins in insurance, electronic payments and asset management. New customers this quarter include AIA, a top Asian insurance firm; Currenex, a top 10 foreign exchange that is deploying Performance Hub as well as its matching engine in our Secaucus campus; and a top 5 global asset management firm that is deploying across Asia.
Turning now to cloud and IT services. We are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter as major cloud players such as AWS, Datapipe, Oracle and ServiceNow continue to expand. Last quarter, we were a major part of both Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference and a Google Cloud Platform Global Roadshow, where developers and partners were educated on how to leverage our industry-leading Cloud Exchange capabilities.
Software-based provisioning and control capabilities offered by the Equinix Cloud Exchange are a critical innovation in allowing customers to dynamically create and manage private, secured virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port. We continue to see momentum on the Exchange, which is live in 21 markets globally and has over 180 customers provisioned. In the second quarter, this solution was awarded the Most Innovative Carrier Cloud Service by Light Reading, a powerful recognition of our progress and our commitment to delivering steady innovation.
To date, our effort to build cloud density inside Equinix has primarily been focused on private connectivity, particularly for leading Infrastructure-as-a-Service platforms, including AWS, Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud Platform. As customers expand the use -- their use of hybrid cloud, we are responding to offer cloud connectivity options that significantly improve the end-user experience for a wide range of software and service applications -- Software-as-a-Service applications.
Software-as-a-Service is the largest segment in the cloud market and is experiencing rapid adoption among enterprises. We have expanded our relationship with Microsoft, and later this year, we'll begin offering direct access to Microsoft Office 365, breaking new ground with secure private connectivity for one of the most widely used enterprise SaaS applications.
We are building features and functionality on the Cloud Exchange to support this application which paves the way for additional SaaS providers to deliver similar services. We also continue to expand the diversity of service providers leveraging the Cloud Exchange to deliver services to their customers. This quarter, we announced an agreement with Aliyun, Alibaba's cloud computing arm, to provide dedicated and secure direct access to Aliyun's full suite of cloud services.
Turning now to the enterprise vertical. The enterprise vertical delivered record bookings. And we are seeing traction in penetrating this vertical as customers seek to re-architect IT to connect people, locations, clouds and data. We added a record number of new customers, including multiple Fortune 50 firms and secured Performance Hub wins with Carestream, a health care medical device company; and Harman, a premium audio equipment maker.
Our Performance Hub solution is now the primary entry point for enterprise clients. Over 190 customers have deployed Performance Hub to optimize network architectures, distribute applications closer to end users, enable critical Big Data use cases and provide efficient, secure private access to cloud services.
By deploying these solutions, customers are reducing operating expenses and improving application performance as well as end-user experience. For example, a global engineering and construction customer that deployed a Performance Hub solution at Equinix increased bandwidth per employee by 2.5x. They reduced their operating expenses by 25% and improved application latency by 38%, which is critical for global workforce collaboration.
A Fortune 50 industrial conglomerate customer that migrated to a hybrid cloud architecture at Equinix achieved a 30% cost reduction in cloud connectivity per application and over $8 million in annual operating savings.
Turning to our go-to-market strategy. We are expanding our routes to market through our global channel program, which now has over 200 partners, including referral partners, agents, resellers and cloud and technology partners who are all implementing sell-through and sell-with models. The initial focus is on building the framework, programs and tools necessary to allow partners to effectively embed Equinix as a foundation for their enterprise solutions, particularly with our resellers who today are driving the majority of channel bookings.
For example, TelefÃ³nica, a leading global telecommunications provider and an Equinix-certified reseller, is helping a key mobile company move to a cloud-based business model. This customer required a large infrastructure enabler to help with their transition to cloud, and Equinix delivered a compelling global solution sold through TelefÃ³nica.
So as we continue to see broad adoption of the hybrid cloud, we expect an increasing proportion of new growth to come through the channel. So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover some of the details and results for the quarter."

I'm pleased to have this opportunity yet again to provide you an update on our quarterly performance. Q2 was another very strong quarter with all 3 regions delivering better-than-expected results.
On a normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions delivered very healthy year-over-year revenue growth at 23% and 26%, respectively, while our larger Americas region produced another double-digit growth quarter of 10% over the same quarter last year.
Our key operating and performance metrics continue to reflect the strength of the value proposition we deliver to our customers. We added 3,800 net billable cabinets in the quarter, our highest level of cabinet installs ever. This is effectively selling the entire capacity of 2 large data centers in one single quarter.
Our MRR per cabinet on an FX-neutral basis was up slightly to $2,015 per cabinet or a 1.2% quarter-over-quarter improvement, largely due to increased interconnection activity. Over the past 3 quarters, the business has shown signs of accelerated growth. Given our success over the first half of the year, particularly the strength of the gross and net bookings, we're meaningfully raising our guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
Our updated revenue guidance now implies a normalized and constant currency growth rate of over 15% compared to the prior year, eclipsing last year's growth rate of 14%. Also, we're very pleased to have completed the first 6 months of the year operating and reporting as a REIT, including paying our first 2 quarterly dividends and announcing our third dividend earlier today.
We also received a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in May, which for all intents and purposes, matches the specifics of our desired REIT structure. The PLR ruled favorably on how we classify our revenues and assets. Basically, interconnection revenues are qualified REIT income and our data centers are qualified REIT-able assets.
Now moving to the slides. So as depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $665.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our revenue's overperformance was due to many factors, including strong bookings activity, higher-than-expected custom sales order activity, net positive pricing actions and lower-than-planned churn.
Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $5.2 million negative currency headwind when compared to the average FX rates of last quarter. Although currencies remain volatile throughout this quarter across all of our operating currencies, there was no meaningful FX impact when compared to our guidance rates, as the EMEA net cash flow hedges continue to offset a good portion of the negative impact attributed to our stronger U.S. dollar.
Our global cash gross profit increased 2% over the prior quarter, although our cash gross margin decreased slightly due to higher seasonal utility rates. Global cash SG&A expenses increased to $149.6 million due to increased sales compensation expense given the strong booking activity and lower-than-planned capitalized IT cost given the rollout in all 3 regions of our Equinix Customer One initiative.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 3% over the prior quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong revenue flow-through. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $3.3 million currency impact when compared to the average rate used last quarter and a $1.4 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $221.4 million or up 26% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our Q2 AFFO includes approximately $1.3 million in commitment fees related to the Telecity bridge loan. Global net income was $59.5 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.03, including the acquisition cost of $9.9 million.
Now over the next few quarters, we expect our net income to fluctuate due to acquisition and financing costs related to the Telecity acquisition. Also, we'll start to hedge out our pound sterling net investment exposure for the acquisition. As a heads-up, when we mark-to-market the hedges, whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow into the income statement on the other income and expense line and therefore, may cause our go-forward as-reported GAAP earnings to fluctuate.
Global MRR churn for Q2 was better than expected at 1.8%, our fourth quarter in a row at this lower level. As previously stated, MRR churn is inherently lumpy based on the timing of customer decisions. And therefore, as we look forward, we expect our quarterly MRR churn for each of the last 2 quarters of the year to range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to occur in Q2.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong bookings quarter, lower-than-planned MRR churn and improving -- and improved pricing metrics. On a normalized and constant currency basis, the Americas revenues was up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-over-year.
Americas Adjusted EBITDA was flat over the prior quarter, largely due to higher seasonal utility costs over the summer season and up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 2,600 cross connects and 102 exchange ports in the quarter.
Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,100 in the quarter. For new builds, we're proceeding with our Dallas 7 project. This build strengthens our value proposition in the Dallas market while taking advantage of our interconnection density in our other Dallas IBXs.
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 6. EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings. We continue to see strength in our Dutch and U.K. businesses as cloud service providers continue to deploy across these markets. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenues were up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 23% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 7% over the prior quarter and 31% over the same quarter last year.
We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,300 net cross connects. EMEA interconnection revenues now represent 8% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis to $1,472 per cabinet and net cabinets billing increased by 1,500.
Over the quarter, we opened additional phases in our key data centers in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris and intend to proceed with the next phase of our Frankfurt 4 IBX to support underlying demand in this robust and improving market for us.
And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 7. Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing region with revenues up 7% over the prior quarter and up 26% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum across all of our verticals.
Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 10% over the prior quarter and 33% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up over 50%, with strong improvement coming from our Japanese business. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter despite a number of large cloud-based deployments installed over the quarter. Net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 over the prior quarter, and we added a healthy 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remain at 12% of the region's recurring revenues.
For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong this quarter and had 7 expansions, and we have 7 expansions currently underway across 6 metros as we continue to scale our business across this region.
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 8. At the end of the quarter, we added $436 million of unrestricted cash and investments, a large decrease over the prior quarter principally due to the funds we escrowed for the Telecity acquisition and the increasing capital expenditures.
Our net debt leverage ratio increased to 3.4x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of reduced cash levels and an increase in capital lease obligations. As we look forward, we expect our pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA to temporarily creep above our stated target of 3 to 4x to 4.5x due to the Telecity acquisition. Although given the cash flow attributes of our model, we should return to our targeted range over a reasonably short period of time.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. For 2015, we're raising our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $850 million and $860 million, an effective dollar increase of $25 million over prior guidance or a 19% increase year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance.
Our AFFO guidance now includes approximately $6.8 million in costs related to the bridge loan. Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO payout ratio equates to 45%.
As we look beyond 2015, our REIT transitional year, we continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for the steadily growing cash dividend as well as moving more assets from the taxable REIT structure to the qualified REIT structure.
Now looking at capital expenditures, refer to Slide 10, please. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $221.3 million, including a recurring CapEx of $27 million. Given our strong and above-expected performance year-to-date, we are closely assessing our inventory and fill rates across our Tier 1 markets. It is our expectation that our capital expenditures will now remain at the Q2 levels for the remainder of the year. And therefore, we're raising our nonrecurring or expansion CapEx for the full year to now range between $685 million to $735 million. Recurring CapEx is expected to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million.
As presented on the expansion tracking slide, we currently have 15 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 14 are campus builds or incremental phase builds. We're currently building across 11 metros worldwide, focusing on investments where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate attractive returns, prioritizing those markets that support our key ecosystem objectives.
And finally, turning to Slide 11. The operating performance of our stabilized 67 global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than 1 year delivered steady as-reported revenue growth of 4%, a decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Currently, these projects generate a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the premium value that these mature campuses deliver, particularly where our ecosystems are especially vibrant.
I'll turn the call back to Steve now."

Let me now shift gears and cover the 2015 outlook on Slide 15. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $681 million and $685 million, a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q2 2015.
Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $150 million to $154 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $313 million and $317 million, which includes a $1 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q2 2015.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $222 million and $242 million, which includes approximately $32 million of recurring capital expenditures.
For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to range between $2.685 billion and $2.695 billion, a 15% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates.
The revised revenues are a $55 million increase compared to our prior guidance. Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $595 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.25 billion and $1.26 billion or a 46.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $2 million of positive foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 18%.
Excluding this positive currency impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $23 million increase compared to prior guidance. We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $850 million and $860 million or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $800 million and $850 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures.
So in closing, we delivered a strong first half and are delighted to see momentum across all our industry verticals and geographies as customers continue to select Platform Equinix as the key enabler of IT transformation. We are pleased with our team's disciplined execution and the strength of our ecosystems is translating into solid revenue growth, firm pricing and expanding margins, all of which combine to give us the financial firepower to continue to invest in our global service delivery model and develop innovative solutions. Our operating performance reflects the significant role we play in a rapidly evolving digital economy, and we will continue to focus on creating sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.
So let me stop here and open it up for questions, so I'll turn it back over to you, Kay."

Just first, Keith, I think you talked a little bit about North America or maybe this was global on pricing, net positive pricing activity. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether that's more geographic or contract-specific. 
Second, I think the commentary, Keith, around the churn around 2% to 2.5% is a bit higher than we would normally expect. If you could address if there's some specific expectations that you have for that or is that just kind of a general conservative estimate. 
And then my last question, maybe Steve, strategically, I think we understand kind of what Equinix is trying to do -- become, really kind of create these platforms, connect businesses to the cloud and be that glue. I think it's harder to see quantitatively in the business in terms of whether it's working and how it's contributing to revenue growth. If you could kind of put some meat on the bones quantitatively around watching this strategy unfold would be super helpful."

First and foremost, as it relates to net positive pricing actions, we as a company, we continue to monitor how we perform as we renew our contracts with our customers. And clearly, there are times there are negative pricing actions, and of course, there's positive pricing actions. Over the last few quarters, the message that we've been delivering is globally, we're seeing net positive pricing actions, which means the price increases are outweighing, if you will, the price decreases. And so it's a global phenomenon. You can see it across effectively the price points, the MRR per cab, our yields across all 3 regions. 
Second question that I'll take is on churn. We -- when we looked in the year, certainly, we're very, very pleased with how we performed in Q1 at 2%. We were delighted with what we saw in Q2, 1.8%. But we really were trying to guide for the total year of somewhere between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, and we said the bias is likely to the lower end. With our overperformance in Q2, we recognize that some of that is timing-based, and therefore, we are going to forecast it in -- we're forecasting it in Q3. Equally, there's a churn that is going to take place in Europe that we are fully aware of and had planned for where our customer had taken down a sizable piece of space in one of our important data centers, and it was going to get relocated this year. And this is -- it was something that was planned for from the outset. And so we are going to absorb that churn in our Q3 and therefore, Q4 results. And so that -- there's nothing fundamental going wrong with the business and nothing fundamentally causing us concern around the churn area. In fact, it's the exact opposite. We see great momentum. But recognizing that churn is -- it is lumpy and it's sometimes based on how customers decide to notify us of when they churn sometimes causes it to get a little bit more allocated to one specific quarter or period, but nothing to be concerned about."

First of all, in the quarter, this quarter, almost -- a little over 30% of our bookings this quarter came from cloud and IT services, and almost 17% of the bookings came from the enterprise vertical. So in terms of creating this cloud environment to attract enterprises, that is unfolding as we expected. And some of the stats that I spouted out to you, you heard that we've had good success with both enterprises and in the cloud vertical. The other industry verticals continue to still underpin good growth. So we've got solid growth across content and digital media, financial services and the network suppliers, all -- actually also pursuing cloud with their end customers. So that we're seeing the same trends as we think about the cloud, how it's affecting everybody. So we had record net bookings this quarter. You heard me talk about key wins with the Fortune 50. So we're getting use cases and success stories built with big profile companies in several of the industry segments that make up the enterprise. We're starting to crack into the Fortune 500, as I mentioned. We've got Performance Hub wins being deployed across multiple industry verticals. So the overall strategy to become the enabler of this transformation to the cloud computing paradigm shift is working. The indirect channel is starting to show up for us. We are seeing these enterprises take advantage of the hybrid cloud at Equinix or actually our acquisition that Charles and his team oversighted with this company called Nimbo. We're starting to see the professional service traction take place to help companies bridge and find the hybrid cloud. So there's good progress across lots of fronts here, lots of new logos. Charles, I don't know if there's anything you'd add to that."

But I think as we dig down into the operating metrics that we're tracking on a week-to-week, month-to-month basis, I think we're definitely seeing the momentum in the numbers that we feel sort of more intuitively. And I think that includes, as Steve said, enterprise bookings over-indexing relative to the revenue proportion. So that is a growing area. Enterprise and cloud combined actually combining for the majority of our new logo capture. And so we're having success on both the supply side with cloud ecosystem and now increasingly on the demand side. Good traction in the channel with getting the additional reach into the enterprise. And again, seeing overall very solid results in interconnection, including what we track, which is interconnection between subsegments, meaning, for example, enterprise to cloud, cloud to network, et cetera, with really cloud being a primary driver point there. So the underlying metrics are definitely indicating some good solid momentum."

It was roughly up $5 million over what we saw in the prior quarter. And so -- again, recognize when we had our guidance, we knew what -- we knew how we felt we're going to perform and so it was generally -- most of that was embedded in our forward guidance, but we certainly are more elevated than we originally anticipated at the beginning part of the year. And if you recall when we talked, again, 2 quarters ago or off the Q4 earnings call, at that time, we were saying that we're roughly $5 million below on a quarterly basis. And so all else -- all that being said, a lot of the growth that you are seeing and the raise in the revenue line, it's attributed a little part to the nonrecurring activity. So that's up again probably $15 million higher than we thought. The rest is coming from the fact that we're booking more. We're booking faster in the quarter. We're getting the price points. And we didn't experience the churn that we anticipated. And that's being the real driver of our success is more coming from the MRR, less coming from the NRR. 
As it relates to the question on FX, as I said in my prepared remarks, there were -- our net exposure on the revenue line relative to Q1 activity was a benefit of $5.2 million -- sorry, it was a negative -- it was a headwind of $5.2 million on the revenue line and $3.3 million on the EBITDA line. When we look at the net hedge impact quarter-over-quarter, it's basically a negative $700,000 on the revenue line and basically a negative $400,000 on the EBITDA line. Again, that is taking the hedge that we had in place in Q1 or the benefit of the hedge we had in Q1 and then offsetting it by the benefit in the hedge we had in Q2."

And in particular, our reseller community with whom we are engaging in sort of sell-with motions that the market is still somewhat immature. I mean, that's the reality. The enterprise market are still looking for solutions to their adoption of hybrid cloud. And that means they typically engage with us and with partners to deliver a more complete solution, and we're seeing really good success with our key resale partners. So that's where the real momentum is in our channel efforts. As it relates to the direct side, about 220 quota-bearing heads worldwide. We will look to probably increase that on the margin where we're seeing success in certain markets. And that is true in all 3 regions. So in fact, I am -- just recently reviewed with each of our regional presidents their plans as it relates to adding sales headcount in response to market conditions. And all of them, in a quite disciplined fashion, are looking to do that where we believe we have sort of latent demand that we can capture in the market. So that won't be a huge number, but we think that given the momentum we have in the market now, we would continue to add. But we're at 220, and I would expect another -- maybe perhaps 20 or 30 heads to come in over the next several quarters based on continued momentum."

So on the AFFO side, you guys have done about $440 million, a little north of that, through the first half of the year. And the guide for the full year implies, obviously, a deceleration in the back part of the year. And just looking at sort of where your EBITDA guidance is, it shows sort of steady progression as we go through the course of the year. So I'd just like to get a sense as to what's happening from the EBITDA down to the AFFO line from a translation perspective that wouldn't have sort of the same similar growth pattern. And then I'll come back for a second."

So if I give you a bridge of the operational performance -- if I look at AFFO and give you a bridge of the operational performance, you'll see that we're improving and yes, this will continue throughout the remaining part of the year. But offsetting that are 2 things: number one, and the biggest thing is really interest expense. And part of that interest expense is attached to basically the $7 million for the commitment fee that we're paying on the bridge fee for the Telecity acquisition. But part of it is when we actually -- when we put in more capital leases and we take it from operating to capital, we have some impact there. When we take large projects like we had. We had the big 5 projects in Q1 that went live and that was, as you'll recall, Singapore 3, Melbourne 1, Toronto 2 and New York 6 and London 6. Interest that was otherwise capitalized in those transactions now also moves into, if you will, the operating line and that affects AFFO. 
But principally speaking, we continue to see continued momentum in our ability to drive up the EBITDA. And generally speaking, AFFO will translate with that over a period of time, but there's some anomalies that are taking place over the latter half of the year primarily because of our construction activity and the acquisition."

But on the M&A color, as I mentioned to the previous question earlier here, I think from David, our focus on M&A activity is active. We have an active game board. We have 3 heavy filters that we tend to put any regional input through which is, can it scale the platform? Can we enhance our interconnection and network density, secondly. And then thirdly, can we do something that will accelerate our capture of cloud and enterprises to come in to connect to the cloud. So most of our activity puts -- we put most of the deal flow through those 3 lenses. And if you go back and look at our 10 or 11 acquisitions, we can point to some combination of those 3 things. 
We are -- I would tell you most of the activity is outside of North America. Latin America, as I've mentioned to you guys in the past, is of interest to continue to expand the platform beyond Brazil when and if the opportunities exist. In Asia, we're continuing to look at going deeper into China. We're working very hard in that market to try to expand beyond our footprint in Shanghai, and that's of high importance to us. India will remain on the radar scale for us, but India finding the right partner and the right timing has proved challenging. But across other parts of Asia, there are opportunities. And then in Europe, I think the Telecity activity is going to consume us, as you might imagine, and -- but put us in 6, 7 new markets and strengthen our footprint in the existing markets. So that's kind of where our focus is today. And I think someday, you're going to see us show up in -- probably to start in South Africa as we head to that part of the world, and there'll be opportunities there that might broaden our reach in that part of the world.

We do think that, that reflects a combination of factors that include us continuing to gain share. But obviously, when you think about TAM, it's always a matter of how you're defining it. And I think what we would say is that the TAM for the portion of the market, we believe, is particularly relevant to us where our value proposition is strongest is indeed accelerating. And we think that's accelerating due to the fact that enterprises are, in fact, adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. And so we -- as we look at offers like network -- or our Performance Hub solution, the Cloud Exchange being able to really enable and empower companies to do these hybrid cloud kind of architectures and implement them, inclusive of the professional services required to get them there, we believe that market is indeed -- the total addressable market there is indeed accelerating, but we also think we're capturing additional share. So it's probably a combination of those things. I would say that when we said that the macro market was sort of low -- high single, low double digits, I think that we are seeing, I think, above that in terms of targeted markets around this enterprise IT transformation and cloud adoption. But we also, I think, are getting more than our fair share of that. So I think we continue to overperform relative to the market and expect that, that will continue in the future."

So Colby, as you know, business suite is something that we responded to an evolving market demand in terms of people looking to implement multitiered architectures. And as they -- that continues to be a phenomenon that we see. As you know, we have continued to have a very strong discipline around right customer, right application and the right asset. And frankly, it's that discipline that's driving the pricing behavior that Keith talked about earlier and driving the churn dynamics that we're seeing, which is improvement to both of those areas. 
But as it relates to business suites, we've seen some success in that. It's really in a small number of markets. We've really implemented a product like that essentially in Ashburn and in New York. And even in those markets, we're evolving it based on our updated understanding of the customers' requirements. And so what we're finding is, is that we're now implementing a more complete hybrid cloud solution that often looks like a Performance Hub implementation, which is a smaller implementation, more network dense, more rich in connectivity to other clouds, but often paired with a slightly larger implementation that maybe in an adjacent site or in a different metro that allows them to put certain applications there, that allow them to really fully implement hybrid cloud. And so we're evolving it a bit. We continue to build out sites that we think can support that sort of multitiered architecture. You will see upcoming announcements from us relative to how our product set is evolving to meet that demand. And we feel very good about what we're doing to really support the complete need of the enterprise customer."

The second aspect, of course, we do -- we've been very, very successful in Singapore with our cloud deployment. And because of that, it comes in size and when it comes in size, it generally comes at a different price point. And so that also is a little bit dilutive to the overall message.

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter as the power of our global platform as well as the depth and breadth of our digital ecosystems are translating into sustainable growth, including record net bookings, stable yields and healthy interconnection activity. 
Our bookings momentum in cloud and enterprise reflects our position as a key enabler of IT transformation. Cloud service providers are choosing Platform Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally, and enterprises are increasingly turning to us as a partner in adopting hybrid and multi-cloud as part of their next-generation IT architectures. 
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior quarter and up 20% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, delivering a 47% margin. 
AFFO grew 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to $210.4 million. With 169,000 cross connects and 4 terabits per second of traffic on our Internet exchanges, which are growing at 33% year-over-year, Equinix is benefiting from the strong secular trends and momentum as businesses are becoming increasingly interconnected. 
A recent industry survey of over 1,000 CIOs and other IT leaders globally showed the number of enterprises deploying direct interconnections is poised to more than double to over 80% by 2017. Enterprises that have already moved to interconnected solutions reported significant value creation from enhanced application performance and cost savings. 
Clouds continue to be the fastest-growing interconnection destination at Equinix, although strong growth was delivered from all ecosystems. We added a record 7,000 cross connects this quarter, and revenue from interconnection grew 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, meaningfully outpacing overall revenue growth as we mature our ecosystems and penetrate new markets.
Our digital exchanges saw another quarter of record traffic and provision capacity growth, including the addition of 172 ports on our Internet exchanges. This includes 24 100-gig ports, doubling the provision capacity added in any previous quarter and an important reflection of the confidence our customers have in our Internet exchanges and our role in connecting network traffic. We expect continued traffic growth as this 100-gig capacity is absorbed into peering architectures.
Internationally, we are augmenting strong organic growth with our planned acquisitions of Bit-isle and Telecity to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems across Europe and Asia. 
Turning to Slide 4. As announced in September, we are acquiring Bit-isle, a colocation leader in Japan for approximately $280 million. Japan is one of the world's largest colocation markets, and for several years, Equinix has been evaluating how to accelerate our leadership in this market. With this acquisition, Equinix will become the fourth largest data center operator in Japan. Bit-isle's facilities are adjacent to our carrier-dense sites in Tokyo and Osaka, giving us customer-ready capacity as well as the opportunity to scale Platform Equinix in this increasingly constrained but important global market.
Bit-isle also complements our cloud and network service provider customer base with a strong Japanese enterprise and systems integrator customer set, including some of Japan's largest companies. With Bit-isle, Equinix also adds strong local expertise to help drive success in Japan. And we look forward to completing this transaction in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the Telecity acquisition. We are excited about this compelling and unique opportunity to expand our presence in key markets in Europe, delivering significant value to our global interconnection platform. Regarding regulatory status, we are seeking approval from the European Commission, and we have had ongoing dialogue over the past several weeks to review the transaction. 
Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer to the commission with proposed commitments which are now being market tested. We expect to hear a response by November 13 and are of the view that this transaction should be cleared during its Phase 1 review based on those commitments. Our pre-close workstreams are progressing well and we remain on track for a first half 2016 close.
In addition to our acquisitions, the Equinix global platform continues to grow organically as customers leverage our broad geographic reach to deploy applications that serve their employees, partners and customers across the world. Today, 54% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions, and over 83% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, a reflection of our differentiated global reach. 
We continue to invest in international markets to meet growing global demand and seed critical business ecosystems that will deliver incremental growth and value. We're currently building across 12 metros worldwide, focusing our investments where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate very attractive returns. 
Globally, we have 13 announced expansion projects underway, of which 12 are campus builds or incremental phase builds, which helps mitigate risk while driving returns. We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including purchasing the land for our new build in SÃ£o Paulo. Owned properties now generate 38% of recurring revenue and 39% of NOI. And over 93% of NOI is generated by owned or leased properties where lease expirations extend to 2029 or beyond.
Shifting gears, let me address our continued investment in green technology. We believe that it is our responsibility to power the digital economy in an environmentally sustainable way, both to serve the needs of our customers and to protect the communities in which we operate. This quarter, we signed a power purchase agreement for solar power with SunEdison. This purchase of 105 megawatts ensures the generation of renewable power equaling 100% of the energy for Equinix's California data centers. This agreement will increase our use of green energy sources from 30% to 43% of our data center footprint and represents significant progress towards our stated long-term goal of using 100% clean or renewable energy.
Now let me cover the quarterly highlights from our industry verticals. Network operators continue to expand their infrastructure as they implement 100-gig platforms and augment their networks to deliver new services for mobile, content delivery, video streaming and cloud-based services. The resurgence of subsea cable projects is also creating opportunity for Equinix, helping service providers accelerate returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXs. 
Equinix is working with AquaComms, who is deploying one of the first transatlantic subsea cables in more than a decade, to meet increased bandwidth needs for global businesses. Our New York and London data centers will serve as the carrier-neutral low-latency network access points to this cable system. 
In addition, our West Coast data centers will anchor the new transpacific subsea cable system named Faster. This new cable route will be one of the longest high-capacity routes in the world and will be backhauled into 4 of our data centers in Silicon Valley, Seattle and Los Angeles. 
In the content and digital media vertical, we continue to see consumer content companies architect their delivery infrastructure via Platform Equinix to respond to cost and performance imperatives driven by the demands of today's mobile users. Growth was driven by global expansions from players including Baidu, a Chinese web services company; and Criteo, a French company specializing in performance marketing, as well as new wins with 3 of the largest consumer application providers in music, social networking and accommodations. Advertising and e-commerce subsegments continue to be our strongest growth performers in this space.
Turning to the financial services vertical. We see continued diversification in our financial services business, with additional wins from Australian Securities Exchange Operations, a global financial market exchange as well as wins with a leading global insurance syndicate and one of the largest banks in the world. We also had lighthouse wins in digital payments, and we see encouraging signs of ecosystem formation in this area.
Turning to cloud and IT services. We are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter as major cloud and IT players such as AWS, Cisco, Dimension Data and EMC continued to expand, and our relationship with Rackspace extended to include their participation on the Equinix Cloud Exchange. 
With over 240 customers provisioned, we continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange, our cloud interconnection solutions that allow customers to dynamically create and manage private secured virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port, simplifying cloud migrations and enabling workload mobility from cloud to cloud.
We are pleased to announce we are also collaborating with Oracle to enable high-performance global direct access to Oracle's full suite of cloud services across 6 markets. This will allow customers to easily create connections to Oracle's cloud-based business applications while reducing the application latency often associated with traditional cloud access. As one of the largest cloud providers, the addition of Oracle Cloud to the Equinix Cloud Exchange strengthens our ability to deliver unrivaled choice to our customers.
In October, Equinix worked closely with Microsoft to launch a private Azure ExpressRoute connection to Office 365 through the Equinix Cloud Exchange. Office 365 is one of the most requested applications by enterprises, and leveraging ExpressRoute via Cloud Exchange dramatically improves the performance and security of Office 365. We are now offering this solution across all 16 metros where ExpressRoute is available on Cloud Exchange and have seen very strong interest.
Turning to the enterprise vertical. The enterprise vertical delivered record bookings, and we are seeing continued traction in penetrating this massive addressable market. Notably, as of the third quarter, enterprises became our largest source of new customer adds with traction in transportation, manufacturing, logistics and health care. Over 250 customers have now deployed our Performance Hub solution to optimize network architectures and drive application performance by securely and efficiently connecting to network and cloud services.
Turning to Slide 5. Our enterprise go-to-market strategies based on 4 use cases for people, cloud, locations and data that allow us to effectively solve enterprise pain points by making a transition to an interconnection-oriented architecture. Whether it's deploying applications to distributed users or leveraging data-intensive analytics, enterprises are facing challenges around security, networking costs and performance that we are helping them solve. 
For example, a global media and software customer worked with Equinix to solve inefficient and insecure access to multiple cloud providers. By deploying a distributed hub infrastructure inside of Equinix and connecting privately to multiple clouds, this customer benefited from a 25% reduction in latency and a 50% reduction in OpEx per application.
Our global reach as well as networking cloud density represent powerful and difficult-to-replicate advantages in servicing the demand for multi-cloud. But translating these advantages into customer acquisition and market share capture requires a continued evolution of our product and go-to-market capabilities. We have made significant progress in 2015 with our Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange offers and will continue to expand our portfolio of high-impact, channel-ready offers to help enterprises satisfy their hybrid cloud aspirations.
On the go-to-market front, we continue to drive productivity improvements in our direct selling teams and are investing in parallel in our channel and partner program to dramatically expand market reach and enable the delivery of more complete solutions to meet key customer requirements. We are pleased with the progress of our channel initiatives and continue to see partner bookings grow as a percentage of our overall sales.
So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to go through the results for the quarter."
28202,312868873,884540,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. We had another great quarter, and the value of our platform as reflected in the health of our key operating metrics, continues to rise.

We had another great quarter, and the value of our platform as reflected in the health of our key operating metrics, continues to rise. We had once again strong growth in net bookings, and our MRR churn remains at the lower end of our guidance range. 
Consistent with the last 4 quarters, we had positive net pricing actions, and we recorded the highest increase in net cabinets billing in our history, adding 4,700 incremental billing cabinets in Q3, more than we double the average quarterly rate in 2014. Our MRR per cabinet on an FX-neutral basis remained firm. We're delighted with the interconnection activity in the quarter, and we added significant new cross connects and exchange ports. Interconnection revenues as a percent of our recurring revenues continue to tick up across each of our regions.
So based on the strength of our growth in net bookings activity, as well as the continued momentum across our business, we are once again raising our guidance expectations despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar for each of revenues, EBITDA and AFFO for Q4 and 2015. And as we finish the year on this strong note, this clearly positions us for a solid start to 2016.
Our updated revenue guidance now implies a normalized and constant currency growth rate of over 16% compared to prior year, the highest annual growth we've seen since 2012. 
Now moving to some comments on the acquisitions. We continue to progress with both our Telecity and Bit-isle transactions. The Bit-isle share tender period closed this past Monday, and we're happy to note that 97% of the Bit-isle's shares were tendered. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of Bit-isle by the end of the year. 
The Bit-isle transaction will officially close in early November, and we'll report their results in our consolidated financials from that point forward. Please note we have not included Bit-isle in our guidance, and accordingly, we'll update you on the financial results on our next earnings call. As stated previously, we expect Bit-isle to create significant value for our shareholders and to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share upon close. 
Also, we're continuing our journey as a REIT, and in August, Equinix was added to the MSCI US REIT Index as the largest data center REIT. We remain pleased with the diversification of our shareholder base as many REIT investors joined our traditional technology investor base. Given the changing investor mix, we'll work to clearly message our story to both these investor groups. 
So now moving to the slides. As depicted on Slide 6, global Q3 revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our revenues overperformance was due to strong bookings activity and net positive pricing actions. 
Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $4 million negative currency headwind when compared to either the average FX rates of last quarter or our prior FX guidance rates. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, our updated 2015 guidance now includes incremental FX headwinds of $13 million on the revenue line and $4 million related to adjusted EBITDA when compared to our prior FX guidance rates. 
Therefore, our current 2015 revenue guidance now absorbs $138 million currency headwind while EBITDA is negatively impacted by $56 million when compared to the average rates used in 2014. As we look to 2016, we continue to believe the U.S. dollar will remain strong and create some level of headwind when compared to the average rates in 2015 in addition to the averaging down of our current hedge positions. We'll update you on the estimated impact of FX on the next earnings call.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 3% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong revenue flow-through. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. 
Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to the average FX rates from last quarter and a $500,000 positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. 
Global AFFO was $210.4 million. Excluding the $11.6 million FX loss related to a net investment hedge for the Telecity acquisition and $4 million of incremental financing costs related to both the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 2% over the prior quarter. 
As a reminder, we've hedged the majority of our pound sterling net investment exposure related to the Telecity acquisition. When we mark-to-market these hedges, whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow through net income on the other income and expense line, and therefore affect AFFO and other reported metrics until we close the deal. As we look forward, we'll keep -- we'll continue to keep you updated on the impact of this hedge position and how it affects our AFFO metric.
Global net income was $41.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.71, including acquisition costs of $13.4 million and the $11.6 million FX loss in the Telecity acquisition-related hedge. 
And finally moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q3 was 2%, our fifth quarter in a row at this lower level. For Q4, we expect the quarterly MRR churn to be at the high end of our range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to incur in Q3. 
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong bookings quarter, lower-than-planned MRR churn and favorable pricing. On a normalized and constant currency basis, the Americas revenues were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 13% year-over-year. 
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 2% over the prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 3,500 net cross connects and 78 exchange ports in the quarter. 
Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,500 in the quarter. Also, we're proceeding with the new build in SÃ£o Paulo, the financial capital and the main data center market in Brazil. This will be our third IBX in the SÃ£o Paulo market and our fifth IBX in the Brazilian market. Equinix purchased the land for SÃ£o Paulo-3, consistent with our desire to own more of our IBXs as we expand the business. 
We also broke ground on our Ashburn North campus, undeveloped land that we will also -- pardon me, that we also own next to our current Ashburn campus, which is the largest Internet exchange point in North America. Equinix currently has 10 IBXs in Ashburn in the surrounding area. This new campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years, will effectively double the capacity we have in this market. 
Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 8. EMEA delivered another strong quarter, with record bookings, with particular strength in the French and Dutch markets. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year. 
We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,800 net cross connects. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was flat on a constant currency basis, and net cabinets billing increased by 1,800. Given the strong performance in our key markets, we plan to move forward with additional expansion phases in both Amsterdam and London. This includes the next phase of London-6, the new build in our Slough campus that only opened earlier this year. 
And now looking at Asia Pacific, refer to Slide 9, please. Asia Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers continued to deploy into this region. Revenues were up 6% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was -- on a normalized and constant currency basis, was up 6% over the prior quarter and 37% over the same quarter last year. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52%, with strong flow-through from the revenue line. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was down slightly quarter-over-quarter, which included a large number of billable cabinets being installed. Net cabinets billing increased by 1,400 over the prior quarter, and we added a healthy 1,700 net cross connects. 
Interconnection revenues stepped up to 13% of the region's recurring revenues. For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong and Singapore this quarter and currently have 5 expansion projects underway across 4 countries. 
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investment decreased this quarter to $340 million, largely due to our continued investment in CapEx and the payment of our third quarter cash dividend. Our net debt leverage ratio currently at 3.4x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. 
As we look forward, we continue to actively review our capital structure and financing needs, largely due to the planned acquisition of Telecity and the soon to close Bit-isle transaction. But as well as we continue to assess the level of investment as we expand our platform to support the trajectory of our business.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 11. For 2015, we're raising our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $866 million and $870 million, an effective dollar increase of $29 million over our prior guidance or a 24% year-over-year increase on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
Our AFFO guidance, as mentioned previously, includes the impact of the Telecity net investment hedge in Q3, but know, our updated AFFO guidance does not make any assumption for Q4 relating to the net investment hedge for Telecity. 
Also today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.64 a share -- sorry, pardon me, $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO payout ratio remains at 45%. Our previously announced 2015 special distribution of $627 million will also be paid in the fourth quarter in a combination of up to 20% in cash and at least 80% in stock. Do note by the virtue of the special distribution being paid before the Q4 quarterly cash dividend record date, we're effectively increasing our quarterly dividend by 3% as the 1.7 million incremental shares from the distribution will have already been issued to our shareholders.
Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $216 million, including a recurring CapEx of $26 million. Given our rapid fill rates and overperformance year-to-date, we are closely assessing our inventory and expect to continue to invest to support our platform. We're narrowing our 2015 CapEx guidance to the top end of our prior range of $830 million to $850 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. The operating performance of our stabilized 67 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than 1 year delivered steady as-reported growth of 6%, an increase over the prior quarter and more closely aligned with our expectations. Utilization of these assets increased to 86%, up 2% over the prior quarter as we filled additional capacity in these stabilized assets, with particular high absorption in London, Munich and Silicon Valley markets. At the end of Q3, our stabilized projects generated a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the economic value these stabilized campuses deliver. So with that, let me turn it back to Steve."

Note that the following guidance does not include the Bit-isle transaction that is expected to close in Q4. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $701 million and $705 million, a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter, which includes $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. 
Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $153 million to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $328 million and $332 million, which includes a $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $242 million and $262 million, which includes approximately $34 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to range between $2.696 billion and $2.7 billion, a 16% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes $13 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. The revised revenues are a $21 million increase compared to our prior guidance.
Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $601 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.267 billion and $1.271 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $4 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. Excluding this currency impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is an $18 million increase compared to prior guidance.
We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $866 million and $870 million or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 24%. As noted by Keith, this guidance does not include the impact from the Telecity transaction hedging for Q4, although this will continue to impact our as-reported AFFO results. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $830 million and $850 million, which includes $110 million of recurring capital expenditures. 
In closing, we are expanding our market leadership and driving disciplined execution of our differentiated strategy. We believe that the strength of our digital ecosystems and the global breadth of our interconnection platform create a powerful flywheel to fuel our business and drive IT transformation. Our role as an enabler of the hybrid and multi-cloud represents a powerful near-term catalyst for enterprise penetration, and we will continue to invest in this significant opportunity. We are working to accelerate our alignment and agility as an organization and look forward to updating the market as we progress with these initiatives. So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. So back over to you, Bob."

Could you elaborate a little bit on what they are and if they affect the economics of the transaction in any material way? And then I guess second, Keith, just on the hedge for the European market. Obviously, it was a decision that you took at the beginning of this year. It's paid off to be relatively aggressive hedging your EU currency blocks. Are you planning to continue in 2016 a fairly aggressive static hedge? Or are you going to be a little bit more dynamic in how you think about currencies and where you think incremental moves are going to go and how aggressive are you planning on being with respect to the hedges in the European market?"

First and foremost, the piece that's affecting the AFFO, which was not in our prior guidance and again it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, that relates to us hedging out our net investment exposure for the acquisition of the Telecity assets. And so as you can appreciate, that will continue to fluctuate until we close. So if you will, the net -- the loss that we experienced this quarter, the offsetting impact sits inside -- will sit inside purchase accounting when we actually close the transaction. If I was to actually -- if I was actually to use the same exchange rates, if I use the spot exchange rate today for effectively the transaction, that $11.6 million sort of loss would turn into a gain if it was this quarter. So it gives you a sense of the volatility for this almost $1 billion [ph] hedge. As it relates to our ongoing monetary hedges and our balance sheet hedges and as well as the embedded derivatives that we do, as a company, we're still going to continue to hedge where we can somewhat aggressively. And why we want to do that, we think there will continue to be strength in the U.S. dollar. But as you recall, we hedge out now any from 6 to 8 quarters and then, of course, smoothing out the impact of how the currencies are going to move. In this case, clearly be a net beneficiary of our hedging through fiscal year despite where currencies have gone net beneficiary of hedging. And so we want to continue to use that where appropriate. There's some markets that we will not hedge, as we've said, it's just too darn expensive. Brazil's that one example. And again, the majority of our hedges. Anytime you think of a European hedge, it's already going through our results, and you think about it's going through our result part of is going to proper hedge accounting. When we go to Asia, all of that stuff we report basically, we report as sort of gains and losses in the P&L below the line. So we'll try and be really transparent over the next little while on our hedging positions. We're certainly going to be very clear as we move to close our planned transactions, not only because of the influence that new currencies will have or the increasing currencies will have exposed to as it relates to yen, sterling and euro. But most of that will take place as or when we close the transactions for Telecity and Bit-isle."

When we started out the year, as you'll recall, we said that we could do greater than. And clearly, so when you look at our internal plan relative to what we performed, we thought we could do a bit better than the guidance that we delivered because it's greater than. That all said, as we progress through the year, there's a number of things that worked very much in our benefit. Number one, we're booking a little bit more on the gross line than we originally anticipated so that's net positive. Second piece is churn is not as great as we anticipated, and you've seen that in each of our actuals relative to our quarterly guidance, so we get the benefit of churn. Three, our net pricing actions are positive. And again as I said, we've had steady quarterly flow of net pricing actions, and that does wonders for the revenue line. Four, we've done more than we originally anticipated on the nonrecurring line, and this quarter -- sorry, pardon me, Q3 as we guide for, for Q4, we're going to do roughly $40 million on the nonrecurring line. So it gives you a sense that, that was a lot higher than we originally anticipated probably to the tune of $30-odd million. And then the fifth thing I'll tell you is the sales leadership has done a real good job of better managing the booking and billing activity through the quarter. So as we measure ourselves and we call them banana charts, those banana charts look more like a straight line where we're getting a more steady flow of revenue throughout the quarter instead of being back ended. And between those 5 things have all added. So bottom line, I'll just tell you, there's not any one thing from a financial perspective. defer to Steve and Charles who want to talk about verticals and the like."

Whether it's bookings or of a, let me give you a recurring revenue kind of picture of Q3 of 2015. Our cloud revenue, recurring revenue is approaching 28% of total revenue in the company. So you can obviously see there's growth in the cloud and IT services segment. The other big mover has been enterprise. We've gone from high single digit of our recurring revenue now to approaching 12% of our revenue in the enterprise vertical. We're still getting good growth in the other core verticals, but the big movers is really been around the core story that we've had last several quarters is the cloud and enterprise activity that we see around our cloud exchange and around the uptake on those 2 verticals."

One, I think regionally, we've had strength across all 3 markets, obviously with Europe and Asia, in particular, growing faster but really very strong growth in the Americas, given the overall size of the business. As Steve said, there are strong bookings across the board also. As I think I mentioned in the last call, cloud and enterprise, in particular, overindexing meaningfully in bookings, meaning that as comparing our percentage of bookings coming from those segments to the percentage of the installed base, those are really growing faster. But that's not a -- that overindexing isn't caused by weakness in the others. It's really caused by strength in that particular ecosystem taking shape. And then the other thing I guess I'd point to, as you can see, interconnection, we just said, is a 21% grower on a constant currency basis compared to 15% or 16% overall. And so again, interconnection is also overindexing significantly, which obviously has a materially positive impact to the business. And if you look at -- unpack that a bit further and peel the onion back, it's really strong across our ecosystems. So what I would say is in network, for example, we're actually seeing good strength on a net cross connect basis, driven in part by really some of the grooming activity that occurred over kind of the last couple of years subsiding, and now actually networking -- network providers and carriers really looking to add to their service portfolio in a variety of ways, which is increasing their appetite for interconnection. And now also cloud is our fastest-growing sort of end destination for interconnection, which I think is further evidence to that ecosystem is really starting to take shape. And just the secular trends are just extraordinary. If you look at the momentum in our Internet exchange in terms of the port volumes and the -- and how those translate into traffic growth, it just continues to say that mobile big data and analytics, social media, et cetera and how people are really architecting to deliver greater levels of application performance in a hybrid multi-cloud world really all adding across all the verticals. So I don't think there is any particular segment that has underperformed. I think there are some that are evolving. How people use us in the content and digital media sector has changed. One of the things, and it's been several years now, where some of those larger players moved to these multitiered architectures, which has really been a net benefit for us, has opened up capacity that we resold at higher rates. And really, they are using us more for content delivery, privacy, the end type implementations, hubbing applications and interactivity -- interaction between the cloud and the content and digital media world, particularly in the advertising segment. So really strong performance across the board."

So with the enterprises, the primary draw with us right now, Jonathan, is most people in this phone no large IS cloud providers. It's AWS, Microsoft with Azure and the work we are doing with Office 365, Google, IBM, SoftLayer. And then there's a variety of other providers, SaaS and other infrastructure providers. But as you all know, the primary uptake today is many of those enterprises are connecting to the larger IS providers because that's where -- we're making that really easy for them to do and it's highly secure, and it's helping performance of applications, it's helping latency and all the things we've been talking about for years. It is the draw. The sales teams are setting a hook as you've heard us talk about with our network -- with our Performance Hub offering. We very quickly transitioned into how we can connect them to the Cloud Exchange to see the cloud providers on the other side. And then most of the use cases and success stories that we're building are around everything we have described in our prepared remarks. I mean, we have lots of use cases now. We're approaching 110 Fortune 500 companies now that are in the house. So we're seeing great traction now with enterprises and their stories resonating. And so the 2 primary offerings that we've built the story around the last several quarters, the Performance Hub, which helps network optimization and application performance and then obviously connecting to the Cloud Exchange to see the clouds is the primary driver. Nimbo, it's still early days. Charles can provide a little color on that. But it is starting to work, where companies need to have a plan to find the multi-cloud or figure out how to take advantage of the hybrid cloud, they are coming to us. We are connecting those dots internally. We're helping them build of those architectural plans and helping them build their transition plans so that's starting to happen. Pull through will start to happen for colo as it matures. And generally, the ecosystem, as Charles just described, is a major draw here. And as we're getting deeper into the enterprises, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing a big uptake in the interconnected requirements for enterprises across multiple industry verticals.

We are clearly prosecuting the market from the top-down, meaning sort of targeting the top of the enterprise pyramid and probably more sophisticated enterprise buyers. We -- Nimbo is having an impact. The interesting thing is I would say that there's virtually nobody a the top of that enterprise pyramid that we're engaged with that is not already using or considering to use either AWS or Azure or Google cloud as a fundamental part of their hybrid cloud architecture. And our Nimbo team is very well positioned to help them through how to migrate applications into a hybrid cloud environment. Our solution architects, which we have now expanded significantly over the last couple of years, this quarter was actually the largest -- we track the percentage of deals that they impact in our bookings, and this is the largest quarter ever in terms of percentage of deals impacted and directly touched by that group. So definitely having an impact. Still early innings, I think, in the overall evolution. At least my experience in terms of how enterprise technology markets proceed, I think we're very much seeing the sort of early stage of lighthouse wins, which then begins to translate to the mid-market taking hold particularly through channels, which also is proceeding well. So continue to be excited about that but Page 5 is, I think, a great place to look in terms of what's really attracting these customers."

We are definitely expanding the overall scope of the partner program. What I will say is that what we are doing is starting to focus our efforts more on what we believe the really high-impact partners are. There's a set of particularly sort of capable resellers that bring a very complete solution in the cloud space to customers who are looking to use us as again as a hybrid cloud, sort of multi-cloud hub. And we're having a real success in terms of working with those partners to penetrate large enterprise customers. But we are selectively looking to expand that reseller base. Probably not a lot of focus on -- I think we've got a pretty good set of referral and agent type partners that were working with and to those continue to be a solid source of lead generation for us. Their focus really is on the real value-added resellers and on our partnerships are evolving partnerships with the technology, the platform players. So we've had some nice success in the market with both AWS and Microsoft in terms of cell that type of motion with them. And that's something I think will put -- continue to put a lot of energy and in fact, we're just -- we're increasing our field force now to really accelerate the investment in that.

In addition, there are some one-off utility benefits of roughly $1 million in Singapore and Hong Kong that we were able to achieve this quarter. But more fundamental to your question, Mike, is that look, the Asia Pacific region is roughly 13% of its revenues in the form of interconnection. The Americas is roughly 22%. It would not surprise me to see the Asian market continue to move its margins up into the right as it continues to fill its assets, but I don't think you'll get to the same level of the Americas, which is roughly 62% today excluding the corporate overhead cost. And so we see it moving up towards, I think the mid-50s over an extended period of time just like I would see Europe moving up a little bit to roughly the 50% mark. And then, of course, in the Americas is at the highest level. So as an organization, I think increasing -- sorry, filling up our capacity, looking to bed across curve and run the organization more efficiently, I think it bodes well for our overall target of continue to scale and a margin into the business."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter as the power of our global platform as well as the depth and breadth of our digital ecosystems are translating into sustainable growth, including record net bookings, stable yields and healthy interconnection activity.
Our bookings momentum in cloud and enterprise reflects our position as a key enabler of IT transformation. Cloud service providers are choosing Platform Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally, and enterprises are increasingly turning to us as a partner in adopting hybrid and multi-cloud as part of their next-generation IT architectures.
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior quarter and up 20% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, delivering a 47% margin.
AFFO grew 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to $210.4 million. With 169,000 cross connects and 4 terabits per second of traffic on our Internet exchanges, which are growing at 33% year-over-year, Equinix is benefiting from the strong secular trends and momentum as businesses are becoming increasingly interconnected.
A recent industry survey of over 1,000 CIOs and other IT leaders globally showed the number of enterprises deploying direct interconnections is poised to more than double to over 80% by 2017. Enterprises that have already moved to interconnected solutions reported significant value creation from enhanced application performance and cost savings. Clouds continue to be the fastest-growing interconnection destination at Equinix, although strong growth was delivered from all ecosystems. We added a record 7,000 cross connects this quarter, and revenue from interconnection grew 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, meaningfully outpacing overall revenue growth as we mature our ecosystems and penetrate new markets.
Our digital exchanges saw another quarter of record traffic and provision capacity growth, including the addition of 172 ports on our Internet exchanges. This includes 24 100 Gb ports, doubling the provision capacity added in any previous quarter and an important reflection of the confidence our customers have in our Internet exchanges and our role in connecting network traffic. We expect continued traffic growth as this 100 Gb capacity is absorbed into peering architectures.
Internationally, we are augmenting strong organic growth with our planned acquisitions of Bit-isle and Telecity to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems across Europe and Asia.
Turning to Slide 4. As announced in September, we are acquiring Bit-isle, a colocation leader in Japan, for approximately $280 million. Japan is one of the world's largest colocation markets and for several years, Equinix has been evaluating how to accelerate our leadership in this market. With this acquisition, Equinix will become the fourth largest data center operator in Japan. Bit-isle's facilities are adjacent to our carrier-dense sites in Tokyo and Osaka, giving us customer-ready capacity as well as the opportunity to scale Platform Equinix in this increasingly constrained but important global market.
Bit-isle also complements our cloud and network service provider customer base with a strong Japanese enterprise and systems integrator customer set, including some of Japan's largest companies. With Bit-isle, Equinix also adds strong local expertise to help drive success in Japan, and we look forward to completing this transaction in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the Telecity acquisition. We are excited about this compelling and unique opportunity to expand our presence in key markets in Europe, delivering significant value to our global interconnection platform. Regarding regulatory status, we are seeking approval from the European Commission, and we have had ongoing dialogue over the past several weeks to review the transaction. Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer to the commission with proposed commitments, which are now being market tested. We expect to hear a response by November 13 and are of the view that this transaction should be cleared during its Phase 1 review based on those commitments. Our pre-close workstreams are progressing well, and we remain on track for a first half 2016 close.
In addition to our acquisitions, the Equinix global platform continues to grow organically as customers leverage our broad geographic reach to deploy applications that serve their employees, partners and customers across the world. Today, 54% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 83% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, a reflection of our differentiated global reach.
We continue to invest in international markets to meet growing global demand and seed critical business ecosystems that will deliver incremental growth and value. We're currently building across 12 metros worldwide, focusing our investments where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate very attractive returns. Globally, we have 13 announced expansion projects underway, of which 12 are campus builds or incremental phase builds which helps mitigate risk while driving returns.
We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including purchasing the land for our new build in SÃ£o Paulo. Owned properties now generate 38% of recurring revenue and 39% of NOI, and over 93% of NOI is generated by owned or leased properties where lease expirations extend to 2029 or beyond.
Shifting gears, let me address our continued investment in green technology. We believe that it is our responsibility to power the digital economy in an environmentally sustainable way both to serve the needs of our customers and to protect the communities in which we operate. This quarter, we signed a power purchase agreement for solar power with SunEdison. This purchase of 105 megawatts ensures the generation of renewable power equaling 100% of the energy for Equinix's California data centers. This agreement will increase our use of green energy sources from 30% to 43% of our data center footprint and represents significant progress towards our stated long-term goal of using 100% clean or renewable energy.
Now let me cover the quarterly highlights from our industry verticals. Network operators continue to expand their infrastructure as they implement 100 Gb platforms and augment their networks to deliver new services for mobile, content delivery, video streaming and cloud-based services. A resurgence of subsea cable projects is also creating opportunity for Equinix, helping service providers accelerate returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXs. Equinix is working with AquaComms, who is deploying one of the first transatlantic subsea cables in more than a decade, to meet increased bandwidth needs for global businesses. Our New York and London data centers will serve as the carrier-neutral, low-latency network access points to this cable system.
In addition, our West Coast data centers will anchor the new transpacific subsea cable system named FASTER. This new cable route will be one of the longest high-capacity routes in the world and will be backhauled into 4 of our data centers in Silicon Valley, Seattle and Los Angeles.
In the content and digital media vertical, we continue to see consumer content companies architect their delivery infrastructure via Platform Equinix to respond to cost and performance imperatives driven by the demands of today's mobile users. Growth was driven by global expansions from players including Baidu, a Chinese web services company; and Criteo, a French company specializing in performance marketing; as well as new wins with 3 of the largest consumer application providers in music, social networking and accommodations. Advertising and e-commerce subsegments continue to be our strongest growth performers in this space.
Turning to the financial services vertical. We see continued diversification in our financial services business with additional wins from Australian Securities Exchange operations, a global financial market exchange, as well as wins with a leading global insurance syndicate and one of the largest banks in the world. We also had lighthouse wins in digital payments, and we see encouraging signs of ecosystem formation in this area.
Turning to cloud and IT services. We are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter as major cloud and IT players, such as AWS, Cisco, Dimension Data and EMC, continued to expand and our relationship with Rackspace extended to include their participation on the Equinix Cloud Exchange. With over 240 customers provisioned, we continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange, our cloud interconnection solution that allows customers to dynamically create and manage private, secured virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port, simplifying cloud migrations and enabling workload mobility from cloud to cloud.
We are pleased to announce we are also collaborating with Oracle to enable high-performance global direct access to Oracle's full suite of cloud services across 6 markets. This will allow customers to easily create connections to Oracle's cloud-based business applications while reducing the application latency often associated with traditional cloud access. As one of the largest cloud providers, the addition of Oracle Cloud to the Equinix Cloud Exchange strengthens our ability to deliver unrivaled choice to our customers.
In October, Equinix worked closely with Microsoft to launch a private Azure ExpressRoute connection to Office 365 through the Equinix Cloud Exchange. Office 365 is one of the most requested applications by enterprises, and leveraging ExpressRoute via Cloud Exchange dramatically improves the performance and security of Office 365. We're now offering this solution across all 16 metros where ExpressRoute is available on Cloud Exchange and have seen very strong interest.
Turning to the enterprise vertical. The enterprise vertical delivered record bookings, and we are seeing continued traction in penetrating this massive addressable market. Notably, as of the third quarter, enterprises became our largest source of new customer adds with traction in transportation, manufacturing, logistics and health care. Over 250 customers have now deployed our Performance Hub solution to optimize network architectures and drive application performance by securely and efficiently connecting to network and cloud services.
Turning to Slide 5. Our enterprise go-to-market strategy is based on 4 use cases for people, cloud, locations and data that allow us to effectively solve enterprise pain points by making a transition to an interconnection-oriented architecture. Whether it's deploying applications to distributed users or leveraging data-intensive analytics, enterprises are facing challenges around security, networking costs and performance that we are helping them solve.
For example, a global media and software customer worked with Equinix to solve inefficient and insecure access to multiple cloud providers. By deploying a distributed hub infrastructure inside of Equinix and connecting privately to multiple clouds, this customer benefited from a 25% reduction in latency and a 50% reduction in OpEx per application.
Our global reach as well as networking cloud density represent powerful and difficult-to-replicate advantages in servicing the demand for multi-cloud. But translating these advantages into customer acquisition and market share capture requires a continued evolution of our product and go-to-market capabilities. We have made significant progress in 2015 with our Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange offers, and we'll continue to expand our portfolio of high-impact, channel-ready offers to help enterprises satisfy their hybrid cloud aspirations.
On the go-to-market front, we continue to drive productivity improvements in our direct selling teams and are investing in parallel in our channel and partner program to dramatically expand market reach and enable the delivery of more complete solutions to meet key customer requirements. We are pleased with the progress of our channel initiatives and continue to see partner bookings grow as a percentage of our overall sales.
So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to go through the results for the quarter."
28202,312868873,884778,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. We had another great quarter, and the value of our platform, as reflected in the health of our key operating metrics, continues to rise. We had once again strong gross and net bookings, and our",1958,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. We had another great quarter, and the value of our platform, as reflected in the health of our key operating metrics, continues to rise. We had once again strong gross and net bookings, and our MRR churn remains at the lower end of our guidance range.
Consistent with the last 4 quarters, we had positive net pricing actions, and we recorded the highest increase in net cabinets billing in our history, adding 4,700 incremental billing cabinets in Q3, more than double the average quarterly rate in 2014. Our MRR per cabinet on an FX-neutral basis remained firm. We're delighted with the interconnection activity in the quarter, and we added significant new cross connects and exchange ports. Interconnection revenues as a percent of our recurring revenues continue to tick up across each of our regions.
So based on the strength of our gross and net bookings activity as well as the continued momentum across our business, we are once again raising our guidance expectations despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar for each of revenues, EBITDA and AFFO for Q4 and 2015. And as we finish the year on this strong note, this clearly positions us for a solid start to 2016. Our updated revenue guidance now implies a normalized and constant currency growth rate of over 16% compared to prior year, the highest annual growth we've seen since 2012.
Now moving to some comments on the acquisitions. We continue to progress with both our Telecity and Bit-isle transactions. The Bit-isle share tender period closed this past Monday, and we're happy to note that 97% of the Bit-isle shares were tendered. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of Bit-isle by the end of the year.
The Bit-isle transaction will officially close in early November, and we'll report their results in our consolidated financials from that point forward. Please note, we have not included Bit-isle in our guidance and accordingly, we'll update you on the financial results on our next earnings call. As stated previously, we expect Bit-isle to create significant value for our shareholders and to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share upon close.
Also, we're continuing our journey as a REIT and in August, Equinix was added to the MSCI US REIT Index as the largest data center REIT. We remain pleased with the diversification of our shareholder base as many REIT investors joined our traditional technology investor base. Given the changing investor mix, we'll work to clearly message our story to both these investor groups.
So now moving to the slides. As depicted on Slide 6, global Q3 revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our revenue's overperformance was due to strong bookings activity and net positive pricing actions. Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $4 million negative currency headwind when compared to either the average FX rates of last quarter or our prior FX guidance rates. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, our updated 2015 guidance now includes incremental FX headwinds of $13 million on the revenue line and the $4 million related to adjusted EBITDA when compared to our prior FX guidance rates.
Therefore, our current 2015 revenue guidance now absorbs $138 million currency headwind while EBITDA is negatively impacted by $56 million when compared to the average rates used in 2014. As we look to 2016, we continue to believe the U.S. dollar will remain strong and create some level of headwind when compared to the average rates in 2015 in addition to the averaging down of our current hedge positions. We'll update you on the estimated impact of FX on the next earnings call.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 3% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis largely due to strong revenue flow-through. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to the average FX rates from last quarter and a $500,000 positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $210.4 million. Excluding the $11.6 million FX loss related to net investment hedged for the Telecity acquisition and $4 million of incremental financing costs related to both the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 2% over the prior quarter. 
As a reminder, we've hedged the majority of our pound sterling net investment exposure related to the Telecity acquisition. When we mark-to-market these hedges whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow through net income on the other income and expense line and therefore affect AFFO and other reported metrics until we close the deal. As we look forward, we'll keep -- we'll continue to keep you updated on the impact of this hedge position and how it affects our AFFO metric. Global net income was $41.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.71 including acquisition costs of $13.4 million and the $11.6 million FX loss from the Telecity acquisition-related hedge.
And finally, moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q3 was 2%, our fifth quarter in a row at this lower level. For Q4, we expect the quarterly MRR churn to be at the high end of our range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to incur in Q3.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong bookings quarter, lower-than-planned MRR churn and favorable pricing. On a normalized and constant currency basis, the Americas revenues were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 13% year-over-year.
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 2% over the prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 3,500 net cross connects and 78 exchange ports in the quarter. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,500 in the quarter.
Also, we're proceeding with the new build in SÃ£o Paulo, the financial capital and the main data center market in Brazil. This will be our third IBX in the SÃ£o Paulo market and our fifth IBX in the Brazilian market. Equinix purchased the land for SÃ£o Paulo 3, consistent with our desire to own more of our IBXs as we expand the business.
We also broke ground on our Ashburn North campus, undeveloped land that we will also -- pardon me, that we also own next to our current Ashburn campus, which is the largest Internet exchange point in North America. Equinix currently has 10 IBXs in Ashburn and the surrounding area. This new campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years, will effectively double the capacity we have in this market.
Now looking at EMEA. Please turn to Slide 8. EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings with particular strength in the French and Dutch markets. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year.
We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,800 net cross connects. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was flat on a constant currency basis, and net cabinets billing increased by 1,800. Given the strong performance in our key markets, we plan to move forward with additional expansion phases in both Amsterdam and London. This includes the next phase of London 6, the new build in our Slough campus that only opened earlier this year.
And now looking at Asia Pacific, refer to Slide 9, please. Asia Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers continued to deploy into this region. Revenues were up 6% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was -- on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter and 37% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52% with strong flow-through from the revenue line.
MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was down slightly quarter-over-quarter, which included a large number of billable cabinets being installed. Net cabinets billing increased by 1,400 over the prior quarter, and we added a healthy 1,700 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues stepped up to 13% of the region's recurring revenues. For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong and Singapore this quarter and currently have 5 expansion projects underway across 4 countries.
And now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investment decreased this quarter to $340 million, largely due to our continued investment in CapEx and the payment of our third quarter cash dividend. Our net debt leverage ratio currently at 3.4x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. As we look forward, we continue to actively review our capital structure and financing needs largely due to the planned acquisition of Telecity and the soon-to-close Bit-isle transaction, but as well as we continue to assess the level of investment as we expand our platform to support the trajectory of our business.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 11. For 2015, we're raising our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $866 million and $870 million, an effective dollar increase of $29 million over our prior guidance or a 24% year-over-year increase on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our AFFO guidance, as mentioned previously, includes the impact of the Telecity net investment hedge in Q3. But note, our updated AFFO guidance does not make any assumption for Q4 relating to the net investment hedge for Telecity.
Also, today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.64 a share -- sorry, pardon me, $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO payout ratio remains at 45%. Our previously announced 2015 special distribution of $627 million will also be paid in the fourth quarter in a combination of up to 20% in cash and at least 80% in stock. Do note, by the virtue of the special distribution being paid before the Q4 quarterly cash dividend record date, we're effectively increasing our quarterly dividend by 3% as the 1.7 million incremental shares from the distribution will have already been issued to our shareholders.
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $216 million including a recurring CapEx of $26 million. Given our rapid fill rates and overperformance year-to-date, we're closely assessing our inventory and expect to continue to invest to support our platform. We're narrowing our 2015 CapEx guidance to the top end of our prior range of $830 million to $850 million.
Turning to Slide 13. The operating performance of our stabilized 67 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than 1 year delivered steady as-reported growth of 6%, an increase over the prior quarter and more closely aligned with our expectations. Utilization of these assets increased to 86%, up 2% over the prior quarter as we filled additional capacity in these stabilized assets with particular high absorption in London, Munich and Silicon Valley markets. At the end of Q3, our stabilized projects generated a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the economic value these stabilized campuses deliver.
So with that, let me turn it back to Steve."

For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $701 million and $705 million, a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter, which includes $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $153 million to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $328 million and $332 million, which includes a $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $242 million and $262 million, which includes approximately $34 million of recurring capital expenditures.
For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to range between $2.696 billion and $2.7 billion, a 16% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes $13 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. The revised revenues are a $21 million increase compared to our prior guidance.
Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $601 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.267 billion and $1.271 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $4 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. Excluding this currency impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is an $18 million increase compared to prior guidance.
We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $866 million and $870 million or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 24%. As noted by Keith, this guidance does not include the impact from the Telecity transaction hedging for Q4, although this will continue to impact our as-reported AFFO results. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $830 million and $850 million, which includes $110 million of recurring capital expenditures.
In closing, we are expanding our market leadership and driving disciplined execution of our differentiated strategy. We believe that the strength of our digital ecosystems and the global breadth of our interconnection platform create a powerful flywheel to fuel our business and drive IT transformation. Our role as an enabler of the hybrid and multi-cloud represents a powerful near-term catalyst for enterprise penetration, and we will continue to invest in this significant opportunity. We are working to accelerate our alignment and agility as an organization and look forward to updating the market as we progress with these initiatives.
So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. So back over to you, Bob."

Could you elaborate a little bit on what they are and if they affect the economics of the transaction in any material way? And then I guess second, Keith, just on the hedge for the European market. Obviously, it was a decision that you took at the beginning of this year. It's paid off to be relatively aggressive, hedging your EU currency blocks. Are you planning to continue in 2016 a fairly aggressive static hedge? Or are you going to be a little bit more dynamic in how you think about currencies and where you think the incremental moves are going to go? And how aggressive are you planning on being with respect to the hedges in the European market?"

Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer of proposed commitments as noted in our recent 8-K.

First and foremost, the piece that's affecting the AFFO, which was not in our prior guidance and again it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, that relates to us hedging out our net investment exposure for the acquisition of the Telecity asset. And so as you can appreciate, that will continue to fluctuate until we close. So if you will, the net -- the loss that we experienced this quarter, the offsetting impact sits inside -- will sit inside purchase accounting when we actually close the transaction. If I was to actually to use the same exchange rates or if I use the spot exchange rate today for effectively the transaction, that $11.6 million sort of loss would turn into a gain if it was this quarter. So it gives you a sense of the volatility for this almost $1 billion hedge. As it relates to our ongoing monetary hedges and our balance sheet hedges and as well as the embedded derivatives that we do, as a company, we're still going to continue to hedge where we can somewhat aggressively. And why we want to do that, we think there will continue to be strength in the U.S. dollar. But as you recall, we hedge out now anywhere from 6 to 8 quarters, we [indiscernible] and of course, it's effectively smoothing out the impact of how the currencies are going to move. In this case, it would be clearly a net beneficiary of our hedging through fiscal year, despite where currencies have gone, would be a net beneficiary of hedging. And so we want to continue to use that where appropriate. There's some markets that we will not hedge, as we've said. It's just too darn expensive. Brazil's that one example. And again, the majority of our hedges, any time you think of a European hedge, it's already going through our results and you think about -- it's going through our result, pardon me, is going through [indiscernible] proper hedge accounting. When we go to Asia, all of that stuff we report basically, we report as sort of gains and losses in the P&L below the line. So we'll try and be really transparent over the next little while on our hedging positions. We're certainly going to be very clear as we move to close our planned transactions, not only because of the influence that new currencies will have or the increasing currencies will have exposed to as it relates to yen, sterling and euro. But most of that will take place as or when we close the transactions for Telecity and Bit-isle."

When we started out the year, as you'll recall, we said that we could do greater than. And clearly, so when you look at our internal plan relative to what we performed, we thought we could do a bit better than the guidance that we delivered because it's a greater than. That all said, as we progressed through the year, there's a number of things that worked very much in our benefit. Number one, we're booking a little bit more on the gross line than we originally anticipated. So that's a net positive. Second piece is churn is not as great as we anticipated, and you've seen that in each of our actuals relative to our quarterly guide. So we get the benefit of churn. Three, our net pricing actions are positive and again, as I said, we've had steady quarterly flow of net pricing actions and that's -- that does wonders for the revenue line. Four, we've done more than we originally anticipated on the nonrecurring line and this quarter -- sorry, pardon me, Q3 as we guide for, for Q4, we're going to do roughly $40 million on the nonrecurring line. So it gives you a sense that, that was a lot higher than we originally anticipated to the -- it's probably to the tune of $30-odd million. And then the fifth thing I'll tell you is the sales leadership has done a real good job of better managing the booking and billing activity through the quarter. So as we measure ourselves and we call them banana charts, those banana charts look more like a straight line where we're getting a more steady flow of revenue throughout the quarter instead of it all being back ended. And between those 5 things have all added, so bottom line, I'll just tell you, there's not any one thing from a financial perspective. But I'll defer to Steve and Charles who want to talk about the verticals and the like."

So you can obviously see there's growth in the cloud and IT services segment. The other big mover has been enterprise. We've gone from high single digit of our recurring revenue now to approaching 12% of our revenue in the enterprise vertical. We're still getting good growth in the other core verticals, but the big movers is really been around the core story that we've had last several quarters is the cloud and enterprise activity that we see around our cloud exchange and around the uptake on in those 2 verticals."

One, I think regionally, we've had strength across all 3 markets, obviously with Europe and Asia, in particular, growing faster, but really very strong growth in the Americas given the overall size of the business. As Steve said, there are strong bookings across the board also. As I think I mentioned in the last call, cloud and enterprise, in particular, are overindexing meaningfully in bookings. Meaning that comparing our percentage of bookings coming from those segments to the percentage of the installed base, those are really growing faster. But that's not -- that overindexing isn't caused by weakness in the others. It's really caused by strength in that particular ecosystem taking shape. And then the other thing I guess I'd point to, as you can see, interconnection we just said is a 21% grower on a constant currency basis compared to 15% or 16% overall. And so again, interconnection is also overindexing significantly, which obviously has a materially positive impact to the business. And if you look and you unpack that a bit further and peel the onion back, it's really strong across our ecosystems. So what I would say is in network, for example, we're actually seeing good strength on a net cross connect basis driven in part by really some of the grooming activity that occurred over kind of the last couple of years subsiding and now actually networking -- network providers and carriers really looking to add to their service portfolio in a variety of ways, which is increasing their appetite for interconnection. And now, also cloud is our fastest-growing sort of end destination for interconnection, which I think is further evidence that, that ecosystem is really starting to take shape and that the secular trends are just extraordinary. If you look at the momentum in our Internet exchange in terms of the port volumes and the -- and how those translate into traffic growth, it just continues to say that mobile, big data and analytics, social media, et cetera, and how people are really architecting to deliver greater levels of application performance in a hybrid multi-cloud world really all adding across all the verticals. So I don't think there is any particular segment that has underperformed. I think there are some that are evolving. How people use us in the content and digital media sector has changed. One of the things, and it's been several years now, where some of those larger players moved to these multitiered architectures, which has really been a net benefit for us, has opened up capacity that we resold at higher rates. And really they are using us more for content delivery, privacy, end-type implementations, hubbing applications and interactive -- interaction between the cloud and the content and digital media world particularly in the advertising segment. So really strong performance across the board."

Why don't I start out here and then you guys can kind of add around the edges. So with the enterprises, the primary draw with us right now, Jonathan, is as most people in this phone know are with the large IS cloud providers. It's AWS, Microsoft with Azure and the work we're doing with Office 365, Google, IBM SoftLayer. And then there's a variety of other providers, SaaS and other infrastructure providers. But as you all know, the primary uptake today is many of those enterprises are connecting to the larger IS providers because that's where -- we're making that really easy for them to do, and it's highly secured and it's helping performance of applications. It's helping latency and all the things we've been talking about for years. It is the draw. The sales teams are setting a hook, as you've heard us talk about, with our network -- with our Performance Hub offering. We very quickly transitioned into how we can connect them to the Cloud Exchange to see the cloud providers on the other side. And then most of the use cases and success stories that we're building are around everything we've described in our prepared remarks. I mean, we have lots of use cases now. We're approaching 110 Fortune 500 companies now that are in the house. So we're seeing great traction now with enterprises, and the story is resonating. And so the 2 primary offerings that we've built the story around the last several quarters, the Performance Hub, which helps network optimization and application performance, and then obviously connecting to the Cloud Exchange to see the clouds is the primary driver. Nimbo, it's still early days. Charles can provide a little color on that. But it is starting to work. Where companies need to have a plan to find the multi-cloud or figure out how to take advantage of the hybrid cloud, they are coming to us. We are connecting those dots internally. We're helping them build those architecture plans and helping them build their transition plans, so that's starting to happen. Pull-through will start to happen for colo as it matures. And generally, the ecosystem, as Charles just described, is a major draw here. And as we're getting deeper into the enterprises, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a big uptake in the interconnected requirements for enterprises across multiple industry verticals.

We are clearly prosecuting the market from the top-down, meaning sort of targeting the top of the enterprise pyramid and as I said, are probably more sophisticated enterprise buyers. We -- Nimbo is having an impact. The interesting thing is I would say that there's virtually nobody at the top of that enterprise pyramid that we're engaged with that is not already using or considering to use either AWS or Azure or Google Cloud as a fundamental part of their hybrid cloud architecture. And our Nimbo team is very well positioned to help them through how to migrate applications into a hybrid cloud environment. Our solution architects, which we have now expanded significantly over the last couple of years, this quarter was actually the largest -- we track the percentage of deals that they impact in our bookings, and this is the largest quarter ever in terms of percentage of deals impacted and directly touched by that group. So definitely having an impact. Still early innings, I think, in the overall evolution. But at least my experience in terms of how enterprise technology markets proceed, I think we're very much seeing the sort of early stage of lighthouse wins, which then begins to translate to the mid-market taking hold particularly through channel, which also is proceeding well. So continue to be excited about that. But Page 5 is, I think, a great place to look in terms of what's really attracting these customers."

There's a set of particularly sort of capable resellers that bring a very complete solution in the cloud space to customers who are looking to use us as, again, as a hybrid cloud sort of multi-cloud hub. And we're having real success in terms of working with those partners to penetrate large enterprise customers. But we are selectively looking to expand that reseller base. Probably not a lot of focus on -- I think we've got a pretty good set of referral and agent type partners that we're working with, and those continue to be a solid source of lead generation for us. But our focus really is on the real value-added resellers and on our partnerships are evolving, partnerships with the technology -- the platform players. So we've had some nice success in the market with both AWS and Microsoft in terms of cell whip type of motion with them.

And I believe the degree of difficulty to replicate a global ad [ph] scale platform that has the consistency of service delivery and full portfolio of services that we've built in 17 years is a pretty high bar to attack and huge investment in some fairly unfamiliar areas to get a global retail business up and running. So I think it's going to help in the Americas business for sure, but there's a lot of -- there's a lot between a wholesale and retail when you talk about what happens between the executive suite and the assets on the frontline that really matters. And I think there's a lot of work to be done there, and that's where Equinix spends a lot of time. Services, all the stuff you're hearing about today is really our sweet spot and the difference -- the core difference and I think between a retail and a wholesale model."

It's about what happens with the customer and it's about -- and competition is created with there's a company that can provide a reasonably comparable solution to a customer requirement. And in that regard, I've maintained and continue to maintain that the competitive overlap between our businesses and that of DLR even in a post-Telx world remains very small. So Digital is a good choice and a very credible provider for companies who have very large footprint requirements that are part of a multitiered architecture, and we've seen that dynamic play out for several years now. And if a customer needs good, reliable space and power in large chunks, competitive prices, then Digital is going to be an effective provider given their cost of capital and their reach. But if they're looking to architect their IT infrastructure to improve application performance, reduce network costs, enable hybrid multi-cloud, then they typically need a highly distributed environment and that requires global reach, broad and deep network cloud network and cloud density and a level of retail scale and delivery capability that we've invested hundreds of millions of dollars in over the years and have 4,000-plus employees delivering globally. So we feel very good about our ability to be effective with the customer in terms of meeting their needs, and that's a critical piece. So bottom line is we don't see a ton of competitive overlap between the businesses."

Part of the benefit we're seeing albeit it might just be -- it might be something that will not continue on an extended period of base -- or time period is that with the weakening of the Singapore dollar, we actually -- there's a number of contracts that we have in Singapore that are U.S. dollar-denominated. So with your cost in one currency and your revenue in another, that bodes very well when it's going in the right direction. We do hedge against that. But bottom line, we're getting some tailwind from that. In addition, there were some one-off utility benefits of roughly $1 million in Singapore and Hong Kong that we were able to achieve this quarter. But I think more fundamentally to your question, Mike, is look, the Asia Pacific region is running -- roughly 13% of its revenues are in the form of interconnection. The Americas is roughly 22%. It would not surprise me to see the Asian market continue to move its margins up into the right as it continues to fill its assets. But I don't think it'll get to the same level of the Americas, which is roughly 62% today excluding the corporate overhead cost. And so we see it moving up towards, I think, the mid-50s over an extended period of time, just like I would see Europe moving up a little bit to roughly the 50% mark and then of course, the Americas is at the highest level. So as an organization, I think increasing -- sorry, filling up our capacity, looking to bend our cost curve and run the organization more efficiently, I think it bodes well for our overall target of continue to scale and drive margin into the business."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter as the power of our global platform as well as the depth and breadth of our digital ecosystems are translating into sustainable growth, including record net bookings, stable yields and healthy interconnection activity.
Our bookings momentum in cloud and enterprise reflects our position as a key enabler of IT transformation. Cloud service providers are choosing Platform Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally, and enterprises are increasingly turning to us as a partner in adopting hybrid and multi-cloud as part of their next-generation IT architectures.
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior quarter and up 20% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, delivering a 47% margin.
AFFO grew 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to $210.4 million. With 169,000 cross connects and 4 terabits per second of traffic on our Internet exchanges, which are growing at 33% year-over-year, Equinix is benefiting from the strong secular trends and momentum as businesses are becoming increasingly interconnected.
A recent industry survey of over 1,000 CIOs and other IT leaders globally showed the number of enterprises deploying direct interconnections is poised to more than double to over 80% by 2017. Enterprises that have already moved to interconnected solutions reported significant value creation from enhanced application performance and cost savings. Clouds continue to be the fastest-growing interconnection destination at Equinix, although strong growth was delivered from all ecosystems. We added a record 7,000 cross connects this quarter, and revenue from interconnection grew 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, meaningfully outpacing overall revenue growth as we mature our ecosystems and penetrate new markets.
Our digital exchanges saw another quarter of record traffic and provision capacity growth, including the addition of 172 ports on our Internet exchanges. This includes 24 100 Gb ports, doubling the provision capacity added in any previous quarter and an important reflection of the confidence our customers have in our Internet exchanges and our role in connecting network traffic. We expect continued traffic growth as this 100 Gb capacity is absorbed into peering architectures.
Internationally, we are augmenting strong organic growth with our planned acquisitions of Bit-isle and Telecity to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems across Europe and Asia.
Turning to Slide 4. As announced in September, we are acquiring Bit-isle, a colocation leader in Japan, for approximately $280 million. Japan is one of the world's largest colocation markets and for several years, Equinix has been evaluating how to accelerate our leadership in this market. With this acquisition, Equinix will become the fourth largest data center operator in Japan. Bit-isle's facilities are adjacent to our carrier-dense sites in Tokyo and Osaka, giving us customer-ready capacity as well as the opportunity to scale Platform Equinix in this increasingly constrained but important global market.
Bit-isle also complements our cloud and network service provider customer base with a strong Japanese enterprise and systems integrator customer set, including some of Japan's largest companies. With Bit-isle, Equinix also adds strong local expertise to help drive success in Japan, and we look forward to completing this transaction in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the Telecity acquisition. We are excited about this compelling and unique opportunity to expand our presence in key markets in Europe, delivering significant value to our global interconnection platform. Regarding regulatory status, we are seeking approval from the European Commission, and we have had ongoing dialogue over the past several weeks to review the transaction. Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer to the commission with proposed commitments, which are now being market tested. We expect to hear a response by November 13 and are of the view that this transaction should be cleared during its Phase 1 review based on those commitments. Our pre-close workstreams are progressing well, and we remain on track for a first half 2016 close.
In addition to our acquisitions, the Equinix global platform continues to grow organically as customers leverage our broad geographic reach to deploy applications that serve their employees, partners and customers across the world. Today, 54% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 83% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, a reflection of our differentiated global reach.
We continue to invest in international markets to meet growing global demand and seed critical business ecosystems that will deliver incremental growth and value. We're currently building across 12 metros worldwide, focusing our investments where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate very attractive returns. Globally, we have 13 announced expansion projects underway, of which 12 are campus builds or incremental phase builds which helps mitigate risk while driving returns.
We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including purchasing the land for our new build in SÃ£o Paulo. Owned properties now generate 38% of recurring revenue and 39% of NOI, and over 93% of NOI is generated by owned or leased properties where lease expirations extend to 2029 or beyond.
Shifting gears, let me address our continued investment in green technology. We believe that it is our responsibility to power the digital economy in an environmentally sustainable way both to serve the needs of our customers and to protect the communities in which we operate. This quarter, we signed a power purchase agreement for solar power with SunEdison. This purchase of 105 megawatts ensures the generation of renewable power equaling 100% of the energy for Equinix's California data centers. This agreement will increase our use of green energy sources from 30% to 43% of our data center footprint and represents significant progress towards our stated long-term goal of using 100% clean or renewable energy.
Now let me cover the quarterly highlights from our industry verticals. Network operators continue to expand their infrastructure as they implement 100 Gb platforms and augment their networks to deliver new services for mobile, content delivery, video streaming and cloud-based services. A resurgence of subsea cable projects is also creating opportunity for Equinix, helping service providers accelerate returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXs. Equinix is working with AquaComms, who is deploying one of the first transatlantic subsea cables in more than a decade, to meet increased bandwidth needs for global businesses. Our New York and London data centers will serve as the carrier-neutral, low-latency network access points to this cable system.
In addition, our West Coast data centers will anchor the new transpacific subsea cable system named FASTER. This new cable route will be one of the longest high-capacity routes in the world and will be backhauled into 4 of our data centers in Silicon Valley, Seattle and Los Angeles.
In the content and digital media vertical, we continue to see consumer content companies architect their delivery infrastructure via Platform Equinix to respond to cost and performance imperatives driven by the demands of today's mobile users. Growth was driven by global expansions from players including Baidu, a Chinese web services company; and Criteo, a French company specializing in performance marketing; as well as new wins with 3 of the largest consumer application providers in music, social networking and accommodations. Advertising and e-commerce subsegments continue to be our strongest growth performers in this space.
Turning to the financial services vertical. We see continued diversification in our financial services business with additional wins from Australian Securities Exchange operations, a global financial market exchange, as well as wins with a leading global insurance syndicate and one of the largest banks in the world. We also had lighthouse wins in digital payments, and we see encouraging signs of ecosystem formation in this area.
Turning to cloud and IT services. We are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter as major cloud and IT players, such as AWS, Cisco, Dimension Data and EMC, continued to expand and our relationship with Rackspace extended to include their participation on the Equinix Cloud Exchange. With over 240 customers provisioned, we continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange, our cloud interconnection solution that allows customers to dynamically create and manage private, secured virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port, simplifying cloud migrations and enabling workload mobility from cloud to cloud.
We are pleased to announce we are also collaborating with Oracle to enable high-performance global direct access to Oracle's full suite of cloud services across 6 markets. This will allow customers to easily create connections to Oracle's cloud-based business applications while reducing the application latency often associated with traditional cloud access. As one of the largest cloud providers, the addition of Oracle Cloud to the Equinix Cloud Exchange strengthens our ability to deliver unrivaled choice to our customers.
In October, Equinix worked closely with Microsoft to launch a private Azure ExpressRoute connection to Office 365 through the Equinix Cloud Exchange. Office 365 is one of the most requested applications by enterprises, and leveraging ExpressRoute via Cloud Exchange dramatically improves the performance and security of Office 365. We're now offering this solution across all 16 metros where ExpressRoute is available on Cloud Exchange and have seen very strong interest.
Turning to the enterprise vertical. The enterprise vertical delivered record bookings, and we are seeing continued traction in penetrating this massive addressable market. Notably, as of the third quarter, enterprises became our largest source of new customer adds with traction in transportation, manufacturing, logistics and health care. Over 250 customers have now deployed our Performance Hub solution to optimize network architectures and drive application performance by securely and efficiently connecting to network and cloud services.
Turning to Slide 5. Our enterprise go-to-market strategy is based on 4 use cases for people, cloud, locations and data that allow us to effectively solve enterprise pain points by making a transition to an interconnection-oriented architecture. Whether it's deploying applications to distributed users or leveraging data-intensive analytics, enterprises are facing challenges around security, networking costs and performance that we are helping them solve.
For example, a global media and software customer worked with Equinix to solve inefficient and insecure access to multiple cloud providers. By deploying a distributed hub infrastructure inside of Equinix and connecting privately to multiple clouds, this customer benefited from a 25% reduction in latency and a 50% reduction in OpEx per application.
Our global reach as well as networking cloud density represent powerful and difficult-to-replicate advantages in servicing the demand for multi-cloud. But translating these advantages into customer acquisition and market share capture requires a continued evolution of our product and go-to-market capabilities. We have made significant progress in 2015 with our Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange offers, and we'll continue to expand our portfolio of high-impact, channel-ready offers to help enterprises satisfy their hybrid cloud aspirations.
On the go-to-market front, we continue to drive productivity improvements in our direct selling teams and are investing in parallel in our channel and partner program to dramatically expand market reach and enable the delivery of more complete solutions to meet key customer requirements. We are pleased with the progress of our channel initiatives and continue to see partner bookings grow as a percentage of our overall sales.
So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to go through the results for the quarter."
28202,312868873,884849,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. We had another great quarter, and the value of our platform, as reflected in the health of our key operating metrics, continues to rise.

We had another great quarter, and the value of our platform, as reflected in the health of our key operating metrics, continues to rise. We had once again strong gross and net bookings, and our MRR churn remains at the lower end of our guidance range.
Consistent with the last 4 quarters, we had positive net pricing actions, and we recorded the highest increase in net cabinets billing in our history, adding 4,700 incremental billing cabinets in Q3, more than double the average quarterly rate in 2014. Our MRR per cabinet on an FX-neutral basis remained firm. We're delighted with the interconnection activity in the quarter, and we added significant new cross connects and exchange ports. Interconnection revenues as a percent of our recurring revenues continue to tick up across each of our regions.
So based on the strength of our gross and net bookings activity as well as the continued momentum across our business, we are once again raising our guidance expectations despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar for each of revenues, EBITDA and AFFO for Q4 and 2015. And as we finish the year on this strong note, this clearly positions us for a solid start to 2016. Our updated revenue guidance now implies a normalized and constant currency growth rate of over 16% compared to prior year, the highest annual growth we've seen since 2012.
Now moving to some comments on the acquisitions. We continue to progress with both our Telecity and Bit-isle transactions. The Bit-isle share tender period closed this past Monday, and we're happy to note that 97% of the Bit-isle shares were tendered. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of Bit-isle by the end of the year.
The Bit-isle transaction will officially close in early November, and we'll report their results in our consolidated financials from that point forward. Please note, we have not included Bit-isle in our guidance and accordingly, we'll update you on the financial results on our next earnings call. As stated previously, we expect Bit-isle to create significant value for our shareholders and to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share upon close.
Also, we're continuing our journey as a REIT and in August, Equinix was added to the MSCI US REIT Index as the largest data center REIT. We remain pleased with the diversification of our shareholder base as many REIT investors joined our traditional technology investor base. Given the changing investor mix, we'll work to clearly message our story to both these investor groups.
So now moving to the slides. As depicted on Slide 6, global Q3 revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our revenue's overperformance was due to strong bookings activity and net positive pricing actions. Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $4 million negative currency headwind when compared to either the average FX rates of last quarter or our prior FX guidance rates. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, our updated 2015 guidance now includes incremental FX headwinds of $13 million on the revenue line and the $4 million related to adjusted EBITDA when compared to our prior FX guidance rates.
Therefore, our current 2015 revenue guidance now absorbs $138 million currency headwind while EBITDA is negatively impacted by $56 million when compared to the average rates used in 2014. As we look to 2016, we continue to believe the U.S. dollar will remain strong and create some level of headwind when compared to the average rates in 2015 in addition to the averaging down of our current hedge positions. We'll update you on the estimated impact of FX on the next earnings call.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 3% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis largely due to strong revenue flow-through. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to the average FX rates from last quarter and a $500,000 positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $210.4 million. Excluding the $11.6 million FX loss related to net investment hedged for the Telecity acquisition and $4 million of incremental financing costs related to both the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 2% over the prior quarter. 
As a reminder, we've hedged the majority of our pound sterling net investment exposure related to the Telecity acquisition. When we mark-to-market these hedges whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow through net income on the other income and expense line and therefore affect AFFO and other reported metrics until we close the deal. As we look forward, we'll keep -- we'll continue to keep you updated on the impact of this hedge position and how it affects our AFFO metric. Global net income was $41.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.71 including acquisition costs of $13.4 million and the $11.6 million FX loss from the Telecity acquisition-related hedge.
And finally, moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q3 was 2%, our fifth quarter in a row at this lower level. For Q4, we expect the quarterly MRR churn to be at the high end of our range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to incur in Q3.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong bookings quarter, lower-than-planned MRR churn and favorable pricing. On a normalized and constant currency basis, the Americas revenues were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 13% year-over-year.
Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 2% over the prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 3,500 net cross connects and 78 exchange ports in the quarter. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,500 in the quarter.
Also, we're proceeding with the new build in SÃ£o Paulo, the financial capital and the main data center market in Brazil. This will be our third IBX in the SÃ£o Paulo market and our fifth IBX in the Brazilian market. Equinix purchased the land for SÃ£o Paulo 3, consistent with our desire to own more of our IBXs as we expand the business.
We also broke ground on our Ashburn North campus, undeveloped land that we will also -- pardon me, that we also own next to our current Ashburn campus, which is the largest Internet exchange point in North America. Equinix currently has 10 IBXs in Ashburn and the surrounding area. This new campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years, will effectively double the capacity we have in this market.
Now looking at EMEA. Please turn to Slide 8. EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings with particular strength in the French and Dutch markets. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year.
We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,800 net cross connects. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was flat on a constant currency basis, and net cabinets billing increased by 1,800. Given the strong performance in our key markets, we plan to move forward with additional expansion phases in both Amsterdam and London. This includes the next phase of London 6, the new build in our Slough campus that only opened earlier this year.
And now looking at Asia Pacific, refer to Slide 9, please. Asia Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers continued to deploy into this region. Revenues were up 6% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was -- on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter and 37% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52% with strong flow-through from the revenue line.
MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was down slightly quarter-over-quarter, which included a large number of billable cabinets being installed. Net cabinets billing increased by 1,400 over the prior quarter, and we added a healthy 1,700 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues stepped up to 13% of the region's recurring revenues. For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong and Singapore this quarter and currently have 5 expansion projects underway across 4 countries.
And now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investment decreased this quarter to $340 million, largely due to our continued investment in CapEx and the payment of our third quarter cash dividend. Our net debt leverage ratio currently at 3.4x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. As we look forward, we continue to actively review our capital structure and financing needs largely due to the planned acquisition of Telecity and the soon-to-close Bit-isle transaction, but as well as we continue to assess the level of investment as we expand our platform to support the trajectory of our business.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 11. For 2015, we're raising our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $866 million and $870 million, an effective dollar increase of $29 million over our prior guidance or a 24% year-over-year increase on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our AFFO guidance, as mentioned previously, includes the impact of the Telecity net investment hedge in Q3. But note, our updated AFFO guidance does not make any assumption for Q4 relating to the net investment hedge for Telecity.
Also, today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.64 a share -- sorry, pardon me, $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO payout ratio remains at 45%. Our previously announced 2015 special distribution of $627 million will also be paid in the fourth quarter in a combination of up to 20% in cash and at least 80% in stock. Do note, by the virtue of the special distribution being paid before the Q4 quarterly cash dividend record date, we're effectively increasing our quarterly dividend by 3% as the 1.7 million incremental shares from the distribution will have already been issued to our shareholders.
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $216 million including a recurring CapEx of $26 million. Given our rapid fill rates and overperformance year-to-date, we're closely assessing our inventory and expect to continue to invest to support our platform. We're narrowing our 2015 CapEx guidance to the top end of our prior range of $830 million to $850 million.
Turning to Slide 13. The operating performance of our stabilized 67 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than 1 year delivered steady as-reported growth of 6%, an increase over the prior quarter and more closely aligned with our expectations. Utilization of these assets increased to 86%, up 2% over the prior quarter as we filled additional capacity in these stabilized assets with particular high absorption in London, Munich and Silicon Valley markets. At the end of Q3, our stabilized projects generated a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the economic value these stabilized campuses deliver.
So with that, let me turn it back to Steve."

Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2015 outlook on Slides 14 to 17. Note that the following guidance does not include the Bit-isle transaction that is expected to close in Q4.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $701 million and $705 million, a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter, which includes $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $153 million to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $328 million and $332 million, which includes a $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $242 million and $262 million, which includes approximately $34 million of recurring capital expenditures.
For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to range between $2.696 billion and $2.7 billion, a 16% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes $13 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. The revised revenues are a $21 million increase compared to our prior guidance.
Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $601 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.267 billion and $1.271 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $4 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. Excluding this currency impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is an $18 million increase compared to prior guidance.
We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $866 million and $870 million or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 24%. As noted by Keith, this guidance does not include the impact from the Telecity transaction hedging for Q4, although this will continue to impact our as-reported AFFO results. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $830 million and $850 million, which includes $110 million of recurring capital expenditures.
In closing, we are expanding our market leadership and driving disciplined execution of our differentiated strategy. We believe that the strength of our digital ecosystems and the global breadth of our interconnection platform create a powerful flywheel to fuel our business and drive IT transformation. Our role as an enabler of the hybrid and multi-cloud represents a powerful near-term catalyst for enterprise penetration, and we will continue to invest in this significant opportunity. We are working to accelerate our alignment and agility as an organization and look forward to updating the market as we progress with these initiatives.

Could you elaborate a little bit on what they are and if they affect the economics of the transaction in any material way? And then I guess second, Keith, just on the hedge for the European market. Obviously, it was a decision that you took at the beginning of this year. It's paid off to be relatively aggressive, hedging your EU currency blocks. Are you planning to continue in 2016 a fairly aggressive static hedge? Or are you going to be a little bit more dynamic in how you think about currencies and where you think the incremental moves are going to go? And how aggressive are you planning on being with respect to the hedges in the European market?"

So number one, we are moving forth with the EU Commission in targeting a regulatory clearance in Phase 1. We've had, as you would expect, ongoing dialogue with the commission over the past several weeks and have had very good interaction. Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer of proposed commitments as noted in our recent 8-K. So for a variety of reasons, we cannot comment much further on the nature of those commitments, but we remain optimistic about a Phase 1 clearance of this transaction and a first half '16 close that is in line with our previous guidance. And we do expect a response from the commission by November 13 and then we'll update you accordingly after that point."

First and foremost, the piece that's affecting the AFFO, which was not in our prior guidance and again it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, that relates to us hedging out our net investment exposure for the acquisition of the Telecity asset. And so as you can appreciate, that will continue to fluctuate until we close. So if you will, the net -- the loss that we experienced this quarter, the offsetting impact sits inside -- will sit inside purchase accounting when we actually close the transaction. If I was to actually to use the same exchange rates or if I use the spot exchange rate today for effectively the transaction, that $11.6 million sort of loss would turn into a gain if it was this quarter. So it gives you a sense of the volatility for this almost $1 billion hedge. As it relates to our ongoing monetary hedges and our balance sheet hedges and as well as the embedded derivatives that we do, as a company, we're still going to continue to hedge where we can somewhat aggressively. And why we want to do that, we think there will continue to be strength in the U.S. dollar. But as you recall, we hedge out now anywhere from 6 to 8 quarters, we feather them in, and of course, it's effectively smoothing out the impact of how the currencies are going to move. In this case, it would be clearly a net beneficiary of our hedging through fiscal year, despite where currencies have gone, would be a net beneficiary of hedging. And so we want to continue to use that where appropriate. There's some markets that we will not hedge, as we've said. It's just too darn expensive. Brazil's that one example. And again, the majority of our hedges, any time you think of a European hedge, it's already going through our results and you think about -- it's going through our result, pardon me, is going through [indiscernible] proper hedge accounting. When we go to Asia, all of that stuff we report basically, we report as sort of gains and losses in the P&L below the line. So we'll try and be really transparent over the next little while on our hedging positions. We're certainly going to be very clear as we move to close our planned transactions, not only because of the influence that new currencies will have or the increasing currencies will have exposed to as it relates to yen, sterling and euro. But most of that will take place as or when we close the transactions for Telecity and Bit-isle."

When we started out the year, as you'll recall, we said that we could do greater than. And clearly, so when you look at our internal plan relative to what we performed, we thought we could do a bit better than the guidance that we delivered because it's a greater than. That all said, as we progressed through the year, there's a number of things that worked very much in our benefit. Number one, we're booking a little bit more on the gross line than we originally anticipated. So that's a net positive. Second piece is churn is not as great as we anticipated, and you've seen that in each of our actuals relative to our quarterly guide. So we get the benefit of churn. Three, our net pricing actions are positive and again, as I said, we've had steady quarterly flow of net pricing actions and that's -- that does wonders for the revenue line. Four, we've done more than we originally anticipated on the nonrecurring line and this quarter -- sorry, pardon me, Q3 as we guide forward, for Q4, we're going to do roughly $40 million on the nonrecurring line. So it gives you a sense that, that was a lot higher than we originally anticipated to the -- it's probably to the tune of $30-odd million. And then the fifth thing I'll tell you is the sales leadership has done a real good job of better managing the booking and billing activity through the quarter. So as we measure ourselves and we call them banana charts, those banana charts look more like a straight line where we're getting a more steady flow of revenue throughout the quarter instead of it all being back ended. And between those 5 things have all added -- so bottom line, I'll just tell you, there's not any one thing from a financial perspective. But I'll defer to Steve and Charles who want to talk about the verticals and the like."

So you can obviously see there's growth in the cloud and IT services segment. The other big mover has been enterprise. We've gone from high single digit of our recurring revenue now to approaching 12% of our revenue in the enterprise vertical. We're still getting good growth in the other core verticals, but the big movers is really been around the core story that we've had last several quarters is the cloud and enterprise activity that we see around our cloud exchange and around the uptake on in those 2 verticals."

One, I think regionally, we've had strength across all 3 markets, obviously with Europe and Asia, in particular, growing faster, but really very strong growth in the Americas given the overall size of the business. As Steve said, there are strong bookings across the board also. As I think I mentioned in the last call, cloud and enterprise, in particular, are overindexing meaningfully in bookings. Meaning that comparing our percentage of bookings coming from those segments to the percentage of the installed base, those are really growing faster. But that's not -- that overindexing isn't caused by weakness in the others. It's really caused by strength in that particular ecosystem taking shape. And then the other thing I guess I'd point to, as you can see, interconnection we just said is a 21% grower on a constant currency basis compared to 15% or 16% overall. And so again, interconnection is also overindexing significantly, which obviously has a materially positive impact to the business. And if you look and you unpack that a bit further and peel the onion back, it's really strong across our ecosystems. So what I would say is in network, for example, we're actually seeing good strength on a net cross connect basis driven in part by really some of the grooming activity that occurred over kind of the last couple of years subsiding and now actually networking -- network providers and carriers really looking to add to their service portfolio in a variety of ways, which is increasing their appetite for interconnection. And now, also cloud is our fastest-growing sort of end destination for interconnection, which I think is further evidence that, that ecosystem is really starting to take shape and that the secular trends are just extraordinary. If you look at the momentum in our Internet exchange in terms of the port volumes and the -- and how those translate into traffic growth, it just continues to say that mobile, big data and analytics, social media, et cetera, and how people are really architecting to deliver greater levels of application performance in a hybrid multi-cloud world really all adding across all the verticals. So I don't think there is any particular segment that has underperformed. I think there are some that are evolving. How people use us in the content and digital media sector has changed. One of the things, and it's been several years now, where some of those larger players moved to these multitiered architectures, which has really been a net benefit for us, has opened up capacity that we resold at higher rates. And really they are using us more for content delivery, privacy, end-type implementations, hubbing applications and interactive -- interaction between the cloud and the content and digital media world particularly in the advertising segment. So really strong performance across the board."

So with the enterprises, the primary draw with us right now, Jonathan, is as most people in this phone know are with the large IS cloud providers. It's AWS, Microsoft with Azure and the work we're doing with Office 365, Google, IBM SoftLayer. And then there's a variety of other providers, SaaS and other infrastructure providers. But as you all know, the primary uptake today is many of those enterprises are connecting to the larger IS providers because that's where -- we're making that really easy for them to do, and it's highly secured and it's helping performance of applications. It's helping latency and all the things we've been talking about for years. It is the draw. The sales teams are setting a hook, as you've heard us talk about, with our network -- with our Performance Hub offering. We very quickly transitioned into how we can connect them to the Cloud Exchange to see the cloud providers on the other side. And then most of the use cases and success stories that we're building are around everything we've described in our prepared remarks. I mean, we have lots of use cases now. We're approaching 110 Fortune 500 companies now that are in the house. So we're seeing great traction now with enterprises, and the story is resonating. And so the 2 primary offerings that we've built the story around the last several quarters, the Performance Hub, which helps network optimization and application performance, and then obviously connecting to the Cloud Exchange to see the clouds is the primary driver. Nimbo, it's still early days. Charles can provide a little color on that. But it is starting to work. Where companies need to have a plan to find the multi-cloud or figure out how to take advantage of the hybrid cloud, they are coming to us. We are connecting those dots internally. We're helping them build those architecture plans and helping them build their transition plans, so that's starting to happen. Pull-through will start to happen for colo as it matures. And generally, the ecosystem, as Charles just described, is a major draw here. And as we're getting deeper into the enterprises, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a big uptake in the interconnected requirements for enterprises across multiple industry verticals.

One, I'd point you to Slide 5 in the deck around those 4 use cases that we're really starting to see take hold and importantly, the bottom of that page, which talks about the sort of quantifiable proof points of how customers, enterprise customers in particular, are creating value by using Platform Equinix to implement a hybrid cloud and multi-cloud kind of strategy. It is definitely a longer and more complex sales cycle. We are clearly prosecuting the market from the top-down, meaning sort of targeting the top of the enterprise pyramid and a set of probably more sophisticated enterprise buyers. We -- Nimbo is having an impact. The interesting thing is I would say that there's virtually nobody at the top of that enterprise pyramid that we're engaged with that is not already using or considering to use either AWS or Azure or Google Cloud as a fundamental part of their hybrid cloud architecture. And our Nimbo team is very well positioned to help them through how to migrate applications into a hybrid cloud environment. Our solution architects, which we have now expanded significantly over the last couple of years, this quarter was actually the largest -- we track the percentage of deals that they impact in our bookings, and this is the largest quarter ever in terms of percentage of deals impacted and directly touched by that group. So definitely having an impact. Still early innings, I think, in the overall evolution. But at least my experience in terms of how enterprise technology markets proceed, I think we're very much seeing the sort of early stage of lighthouse wins, which then begins to translate to the mid-market taking hold particularly through channel, which also is proceeding well. So continue to be excited about that. But Page 5 is, I think, a great place to look in terms of what's really attracting these customers."

And because we have, I think, increased the level of discipline around what installations we're taking in to the facilities, and as we say, right applications -- right customer, right applications, right assets, what we're seeing is the churn is mitigating. And also, the sort of price pressure upon renewal when you're talking about high-value implementations is substantially sort of mitigated. And so as a result, what we were seeing, which is potentially that flipped on its head is really now seeing that the price actions -- the price increases really giving us a net benefit versus any kind of pressure on renewals. So -- and I think that's -- that reflects also in the churn line."

And then the second question is just around the indirect channel and you talked about an increasing portion of the bookings coming from agents and resellers and so forth. And I wondered, are you still at the point where you're establishing that network of partners and broadening this? Or are you focusing more on depth within your existing set of indirect partners?"

We are definitely expanding the overall scope of the partner program. But I will say is that what we are doing is starting to focus our efforts more on what we believe the really high-impact partners are. There's a set of particularly sort of capable resellers that bring a very complete solution in the cloud space to customers who are looking to use us as, again, as a hybrid cloud sort of multi-cloud hub. And we're having real success in terms of working with those partners to penetrate large enterprise customers. But we are selectively looking to expand that reseller base. Probably not a lot of focus on -- I think we've got a pretty good set of referral and agent type partners that we're working with, and those continue to be a solid source of lead generation for us. But our focus really is on the real value-added resellers and on our partnerships, our evolving partnerships with the technology -- the platform players. So we've had some nice success in the market with both AWS and Microsoft in terms of cell whip type of motion with them. And that's something I think we'll put -- continue to put a lot of energy and in fact, we're just -- we're increasing our field force now to really accelerate the investment in that and we think there's a lot of upside in that. So continuing to grow, but probably more focused on generating more volume from our productive partners at this stage rather than a focus on more partners."

The 67 stabilized assets, it's broken down and again, it's on page -- if you look at Page 27, 28 and 29 of the deck that we shared with you, we break down where the assets are. I don't actually have the specifics on a region basis on the revenue growth, but let me just give you some broad color. As I said, I mean, when you look at the Americas, it's growing roughly 10%. You've got Europe growing roughly 22% year-over-year, and then you've got Asia growing 26% year-over-year. You can see where the stabilized assets are and where we're investing. I think it's something that we'll have to -- as we think about the question, we'll have to probably respond offline to that specific request. But as Charles alluded to, let me just give you some color in the sense that as we commented on, we're filling up our capacity in a very meaningful way. As we said, 4,700 cabinets sold this quarter. Our utilization levels are moving up. We can see it across our inventory base. We're looking at our expansion activities. So suffice it to say, we're seeing good growth across the organization, across all 3 regions, and so I'm very excited about where we are.

And I believe the degree of difficulty to replicate a global at scale platform that has the consistency of service delivery and full portfolio of services that we've built in 17 years is a pretty high bar to attack and huge investment in some fairly unfamiliar areas to get a global retail business up and running. So I think it's going to help in the Americas business for sure, but there's a lot of -- there's a lot between a wholesale and retail when you talk about what happens between the executive suite and the assets on the frontline that really matters. And I think there's a lot of work to be done there, and that's where Equinix spends a lot of time.

But in the end, competition isn't about what we're saying on investor calls or analyst days or anything else. It's about what happens with the customer and it's about -- and competition is created with there's a company that can provide a reasonably comparable solution to a customer requirement. And in that regard, I've maintained and continue to maintain that the competitive overlap between our businesses and that of DLR even in a post-Telx world remains very small. So Digital is a good choice and a very credible provider for companies who have very large footprint requirements that are part of a multitiered architecture, and we've seen that dynamic play out for several years now. And if a customer needs good, reliable space and power in large chunks, competitive prices, then Digital is going to be an effective provider given their cost of capital and their reach. But if they're looking to architect their IT infrastructure to improve application performance, reduce network costs, enable hybrid multi-cloud, then they typically need a highly distributed environment and that requires global reach, broad and deep network cloud network and cloud density and a level of retail scale and delivery capability that we've invested hundreds of millions of dollars in over the years and have 4,000-plus employees delivering globally. So we feel very good about our ability to be effective with the customer in terms of meeting their needs, and that's a critical piece.

Part of the benefit we're seeing albeit it might just be -- it might be something that will not continue on an extended period of base -- or time period is that with the weakening of the Singapore dollar, we actually -- there's a number of contracts that we have in Singapore that are U.S. dollar-denominated. So with your cost in one currency and your revenue in another, that bodes very well when it's going in the right direction. We do hedge against that. But bottom line, we're getting some tailwind from that. In addition, there were some one-off utility benefits of roughly $1 million in Singapore and Hong Kong that we were able to achieve this quarter. But I think more fundamentally to your question, Mike, is look, the Asia Pacific region is running -- roughly 13% of its revenues are in the form of interconnection. The Americas is roughly 22%. It would not surprise me to see the Asian market continue to move its margins up into the right as it continues to fill its assets. But I don't think it'll get to the same level of the Americas, which is roughly 62% today excluding the corporate overhead cost. And so we see it moving up towards, I think, the mid-50s over an extended period of time, just like I would see Europe moving up a little bit to roughly the 50% mark and then of course, the Americas is at the highest level. So as an organization, I think increasing -- sorry, filling up our capacity, looking to band our cost curve and run the organization more efficiently, I think it bodes well for our overall target of continue to scale and drive margin into the business."
