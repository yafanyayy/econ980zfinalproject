We delivered $5.66 in earnings per share, about $1 per share more than our initial guidance. In fact, it's been a great couple of years. It's the second year in a row we delivered record financial results as we grew earnings per share 45%, which comes on top of 49% growth that we delivered in 2013. In just the last 2 years, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, reinstituted the dividend, raised it by 50%, and then raised it another 33%. We acquired and successfully integrated Maidenform, and we closed the acquisition of DBApparel, an incredible set of achievements, especially considering we are accomplished all of this in a very challenging consumer environment. And looking back over the past 2 years, 2 things have become crystal-clear: First, we have a very powerful and resilient business model that has been able to generate significant returns for our shareholders in any environment, especially when it is leveraged through acquisitions; and second, this feels like it's only the beginning. As we continue to generate cash and pursue our acquisition strategy, we believe we can continue to deliver solid double-digit earnings growth for many years to come. 
Our acquisition strategy is working extremely well. Maidenform has been integrated and is now generating substantial synergies. Looking at DBA, things are progressing as planned. DBA's results in the quarter were right in line with our expectations, and we have made significant progress in our integration plan. We expect to begin consulting with councils in Europe in the next 30 to 60 days, after which we will be in a position to share the details with you and begin our work on integrating DBA into our operations. 
The more we learn about their business and their people, the more confident we are in our ability to achieve our expected synergies and to ultimately deliver EUR 100 million in operating profit. 
Looking to 2015. We believe it is shaping up to be another record year. Even after doubling EPS in just 2 years, our guidance represents another year of double-digit growth, driven by the continued efficiency gains of our supply chain, the benefits from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, synergies for Maidenform and contributions from DBA. 
Our 2015 growth rates would've been even greater had they not been dampened $230 million in sales, $44 million in operating profit and $0.37 in EPS by 2 events outside our control: The rapid strengthening of the dollar; and the unexpected bankruptcy of Target Canada.  Our guidance assumes 90% of the Target Canada businesses unrecoverable in 2015 and the euro is at 1.10. As we have done in the past when faced with headwinds that are outside our control, we fully incorporate them into our guidance, which allows us to focus on the things we can control, executing our plan and, as always, driving for upside all through the year. 
So in closing, we've had a great couple of years, and we believe this is only the beginning. Our entire organization remains focused on executing our long-term strategy and that comes from having great people who can rise to the occasion in any environment. This, along with the strength of our business model, gives me confidence in delivering another year of double-digit earnings growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."
4212820,282678244,751612,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rich. We accomplished a lot in 2014.

We expanded our operating margins 140 basis points led by efficiency gains within our company-owned supply chain. We delivered synergies from Maidenform that were more than double our original expectations. We invested an incremental $8 million in media to further strengthen our brands, and we expanded the distribution of our new innovation platforms, which in turn drove another 30 basis points of market share gains in men's underwear, a testament to our ability to drive productivity for our retail partners as we are already twice the size of the #2 competitor and 5x larger than the #3 player, with sales primarily in Department stores. 
Our strong performance reinforces one simple message: We have the right set of strategy and our entire organization is executing extremely well. 
Touching briefly on the quarter. The consumer environment remain choppy, but the overall trend was positive as sales through in November and December was stronger than October. Innerwear sales were flat over the last year as our Basics business was able to offset the softness in bras and hosiery, while our well operating profit increased 18% driven by supply chain efficiencies and synergies from Maidenform. 
In Activewear, we grew both sales and operating profit 10% with growth coming in all categories. And in our International segment, sales grew over last year due to the addition of DBA while the 260 basis point increase in operating margins came from higher sales volumes and benefits from our regionalization strategy. 
Turning to 2015. We feel great about our outlook for another year of double-digit earnings growth as we had a significant amount of visibility into the year. Our Innovate-to-Elevate platforms continue to work very well, which is driving additional space gains in men's underwear in both the mass and the mid-tier channels, as well as in bras in the mass channels. We continue to gain space in Champion and the sporting goods in mid-tier channels which is more than offsetting the challenges in mass, and we continue to internalize Maidenform's production, which should drive cost of goods synergies throughout the year. 
On the cost side, we have great line of sight into our key input cost, including cotton which is locked through the third quarter. With respect to the currency transaction impact on our cost of goods, once we saw the euro begin to decline, we fully hedged our dollar to euro exposure for the entire year. So now we are able to focus on executing our plan and driving for upside all through the year. 
To sum up, our business continues to perform extremely well, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015. We have great visibility into the year, and despite sudden headwinds, we believe we are very well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Not only was 2014 a great year, in fact, it was the continuation of 5 great year in a row. Since 2009, which includes the recession, a period of hyper inflation in cotton, and a choppy consumer environment, our compound annual growth rate",879,"Thanks, Gerald. Not only was 2014 a great year, in fact, it was the continuation of 5 great year in a row. Since 2009, which includes the recession, a period of hyper inflation in cotton, and a choppy consumer environment, our compound annual growth rate is 7% on sales, 18% on operating profit and 29% on EPS. Our ability to absorb a variety of headwinds and still generate strong returns underscores one simple fact: Our business model is well tested and it has been able to deliver returns for shareholders in any environment. And we're just beginning. With higher levels of sustainable cash flow and a continued focus on deploying our cash, we believe we are well positioned to deliver outsized returns for our shareholders for many years to come. 
Now let me give you some color on our strong fourth quarter results. Sales in the quarter increased 19% in constant currency with DBA contributing approximately 16 points of growth. Gross profit margin improved 340 basis points, with 37.9%, with DBA contributing approximately 180 basis points of the increase and the remainder was driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. 
SG&A cost from the quarter increased 210 basis points to 24.8% increase. DBA added 260 basis points to our SG&A rate, which is partially offset by Maidenform synergies and our ongoing cost control programs. Operating profit in the quarter increased 31% to [ph] $48 million driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain, the addition of DBA and synergies from Maidenform. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 13.2% with the 210 basis point improvement in our business, more than offsetting the expected 80 basis points dilution from DBA. 
Interest and other expense of $31 million and a tax rate of just over 12% resulted in EPS for the quarter of $1.46, a 49% increase over last year. 
Switching briefly to the full year. Sales in a constant-currency basis increased roughly 16% with the majority of the growth coming from the acquisitions of Maidenform and DBA. Operating profit increased 28% or $167 million, with roughly 60% of the increase coming from improvements in our base business. For the year, our operating margin increased 140 basis points to 14.3% with the 170 basis point improvement in our base business more than offsetting the expected 30 basis point dilution from DBA. And full year EPS increased 45% over last year to $5.66. For the year, we generated $508 million in cash flow from operations. We used approximately $64 million for capital expenditures, $62 million for pension contributions and returned $120 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Turning to guidance for 2015. We expect full year sales to be $5,775,000,000 to $5,825,000,000, operating profit to be $835 million to $855 billion. Interest and other related expense of $90 million to $95 million, and the full year tax rate to be approximately 13%. 
Similar to last year, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the first half of the year, and evenly [ph] split between the first and second half of 2014 is a good proxy for 2015. 
This results and an EPS range of $6.30 to $6.50 or $1.58 to $1.63 on a split-adjusted basis, which represents another year of double-digit growth. We expect cash flow from operations to be $550 million to $600 million, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million, while annual dividend payments are expected to be approximately $160 million. 
Inherent in our guidance are the following assumptions on DBA which are based on a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1 10. For the full year, we expect DBA to contribute approximately EUR 630 million in sales or about $700 million, and approximately EUR 30 million in operating profit or roughly $33 million, which is being weighed down by EUR 14 million from the currency transaction impact to cost of goods.  This implies about 140 basis points of margin dilution from DBA for the year. We expect DBA to continue to have a significant impact on our reported gross margin and SG&A rate until we anniversary the acquisition. 
Another important factor about the DBA acquisition is the fluctuations in the euro but actually no impact on our expected IRR for the acquisition because we bought the business with euros, we financed it with euros, and we're paying down the debt using DBA's euro-based cash flow. 
So in closing, we have great momentum in our business, which we expect to continue into 2015, and we have good visibility into the year, space games are set, pricing is set, we have a line of sight into our key input costs, our euro based cost are locked and we have limited earnings downside from the euro. For example, if the year were to go to parity today, it will take roughly $65 million out of sales but only about $3 million out of operating profit compared to our guidance. So even after doubling earnings in just 2 years, and entering into 2015 with roughly $0.37 and EPS headwinds from currency and Target Canada, we believe we are very well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to T.C."

We delivered $5.66 in earnings per share, about $1 per share more than our initial guidance. In fact, it's been a great couple of years. It's the second year in a row we delivered record financial results as we grew earnings per share of 45%, which comes on top of 49% growth that we delivered in 2013. In just the last 2 years, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. We instituted the dividend, raised it by 50% and then raised it another 33%. We acquired and successfully integrated Maidenform, and we closed the acquisition of DBApparel. An incredible set of achievements, especially considering we accomplished all of this in a very challenging consumer environment. And looking back over the past 2 years, 2 things have become crystal clear: first, we have a very powerful and resilient business model that has been able to generate significant returns for our shareholders in any environment, especially when it is leveraged through acquisitions; and second, this feels like it's only the beginning. As we continue to generate cash and pursue our acquisition strategy, we believe we can continue to deliver solid double-digit earnings growth for many years to come. 
Our acquisition strategy is working extremely well. Maidenform has been integrated and is now generating substantial synergies. Looking at DBA, things are progressing as planned. DBA's results in the quarter were right in line with our expectations, and we have made significant progress on our integration plan. We expect to begin consulting with works councils in Europe in the next 30 to 60 days. After which, we will be in a position to share the details with you and begin our work on integrating DBA into our operations. The more we learn about their business and their people, the more confident we are in our ability to achieve our expected synergies and to ultimately deliver EUR 100 million in operating profit. 
Looking to 2015. We believe it is shaping up to be another record year. Even after doubling EPS in just 2 years, our guidance represents another year of double-digit growth, driven by the continued efficiency gains of our supply chain, the benefits from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, synergies for Maidenform and contributions from DBA. 
Our 2015 growth rates would've been even greater had they not been dampened $230 million in sales, $44 million in operating profit and $0.37 in EPS by 2 events outside our control: the rapid strengthening of the dollar and the unexpected bankruptcy of Target Canada. Our guidance assumes 90% of the Target Canada businesses unrecoverable in 2015, and the euro is at $1.10. 
As we have done in the past when faced with headwinds that are outside our control, we fully incorporate them into our guidance, which allows us to focus on the things we can control, executing our plan and, as always, driving for upside all through the year. 
So in closing, we have had a great couple of years, and we believe this is only the beginning. Our entire organization remains focused on executing our long-term strategy and that comes from having great people who can rise to the occasion in any environment. This, along with the strength of our business model, gives me confidence in delivering another year of double-digit earnings growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."
4212820,282678244,751844,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rich. We accomplished a lot in 2014.

We expanded our operating margins 140 basis points led by efficiency gains within our company-owned supply chain. We delivered synergies from Maidenform that were more than double our original expectations. We invested an incremental $8 million in media to further strengthen our brands, and we expanded the distribution of our new innovation platforms, which in turn drove another 30 basis points of market share gains in men's underwear, a testament to our ability to drive productivity for our retail partners as we are already twice the size of the #2 competitor and 5x larger than the #3 player, with sales primarily in Department stores. 
Our strong performance reinforces one simple message: we have the right set of strategy, and our entire organization is executing extremely well. 
Touching briefly on the quarter. The consumer environment remain choppy, but the overall trend was positive as sell-through in November and December was stronger than October. Innerwear sales were flat over the last year as our Basics business was able to offset the softness in bras and hosiery, while our operating profit increased 18% driven by supply chain efficiencies and synergies from Maidenform. In Activewear, we grew both sales and operating profit 10% with growth coming in all categories. And in our International segment, sales grew over last year due to the addition of DBA, while the 260 basis point increase in operating margins came from higher sales volumes and benefits from our regionalization strategy. 
Turning to 2015. We feel great about our outlook for another year of double-digit earnings growth as we have a significant amount of visibility into the year. 
Our Innovate-to-Elevate platforms continue to work very well, which is driving additional space gains in men's underwear in both the mass and the mid-tier channels as well as in bras in the mass channel. 
We continue to gain space in Champion and the sporting goods in mid-tier channels, which is more than offsetting the challenges in mass. And we continue to internalize Maidenform's production, which should drive cost of goods synergies throughout the year. 
On the cost side, we have great line of sight into our key input cost, including cotton which is locked through the third quarter. With respect to the currency transaction impact on our cost of goods, once we saw the euro begin to decline, we fully hedged our dollar to euro exposure for the entire year, so now we are able to focus on executing our plan and driving for upside all through the year. 
To sum up, our business continues to perform extremely well, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015. We have great visibility into the year, and despite sudden headwinds, we believe we are very well positioned to deliver another year of double-digits earnings growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Not only was 2014 a great year, in fact, it was the continuation of 5 great years in a row. Since 2009, which includes the recession, a period of hyper inflation in cotton and a choppy consumer environment, our compound annual growth rate is 7% on sales, 18% on operating profit and 29% on EPS. Our ability to absorb a variety of headwinds and still generate strong returns underscores one simple fact: our business model is well tested, and it has been able to deliver returns for shareholders in any environment, and we're just beginning. With higher levels of sustainable cash flow and a continued focus on deploying our cash, we believe we are well positioned to deliver outsized returns for our shareholders for many years to come. 
Now let me give you some color on our strong fourth quarter results. Sales in the quarter increased 19% in constant currency with DBA contributing approximately 16 points of growth. Gross profit margin improved 340 basis points to 37.9% with DBA contributing approximately 180 basis points of the increase, while the remainder was driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. 
SG&A cost from the quarter increased 210 basis points to 24.8%. DBA added 260 basis points to our SG&A rate, which was partially offset by Maidenform synergies and our ongoing cost control programs. 
Operating profit in the quarter increased 31% to $48 million driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain, the addition of DBA and synergies from Maidenform. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 13.2% with the 210 basis point improvement in our base business, more than offsetting the expected 80 basis point dilution from DBA. 
Interest and other expense of $31 million and a tax rate of just over 12% resulted in EPS for the quarter of $1.46, a 49% increase over last year. 
Switching briefly to the full year. Sales on a constant-currency basis increased roughly 16% with the majority of the growth coming from the acquisitions of Maidenform and DBA. Operating profit increased 28% or $167 million, with roughly 60% of the increase coming from improvements in our base business. For the year, our operating margin increased 140 basis points to 14.3% with the 170 basis point improvement in our base business more than offsetting the expected 30 basis point dilution from DBA, and full year EPS increased 45% over last year to $5.66. For the year, we generated $508 million in cash flow from operations. We used approximately $64 million for capital expenditures, $62 million for pension contributions and returned $120 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Turning to guidance for 2015. We expect full year sales to be $5,775,000,000 to $5,825,000,000. Operating profit to be $835 million to $855 billion. Interest and other related expense of $90 million to $95 million, and the full year tax rate to be approximately 13%. 
Similar to last year, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the first half of the year, and we believe the split between the first and second half of 2014 was a good proxy for 2015. 
This results in an EPS range of $6.30 to $6.50 or $1.58 to $1.63 on a split-adjusted basis, which represents another year of double-digit growth. We expect cash flow from operations to be $550 million to $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million, while annual dividend payments are expected to be approximately $160 million. 
Inherent in our guidance are the following assumptions on DBA, which are based on a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.10. For the full year, we expect DBA to contribute approximately EUR 630 million in sales or about $700 million, and approximately EUR 30 million in operating profit or roughly $33 million, which is being weighed down by EUR 14 million from the currency transaction impact to costs of goods. This implies about 140 basis points of margin dilution from DBA for the year. We expect DBA to continue to have a significant impact on our reported gross margin and SG&A rate until we anniversary the acquisition. 
Another important factor about the DBA acquisition is the fluctuations in the euro that have absolutely no impact on our expected IRR for the acquisition because we bought the business with euros, we financed it with euros and we're paying down the debt using DBA's euro-based cash flow. 
So in closing, we have great momentum in our business, which we expect to continue into 2015, and we have good visibility into the year. Space games are set. Pricing is set. We have a line of sight into our key input costs. Our euro-based costs are locked, and we have limited earnings downside from the euro. For example, if the year were to go to parity today, it would take roughly $65 million out of sales but only about $3 million out of operating profit compared to our guidance. So even after doubling earnings in just 2 years, and entering into 2015 with roughly $0.37, of EPS headwinds from currency and Target Canada, we believe we are very well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

In the long term, it's going to improve the shopability of the department, but it creates some headwind in shipments in the short term, and we'll feel a little bit of that headwind into first half of this year report."

We delivered $5.66 in earnings per share, about $1 per share more than our initial guidance. In fact, it's been a great couple of years. It's the second year in a row we delivered record financial results as we grew earnings per share of 45%, which comes on top of 49% growth that we delivered in 2013. In just the last 2 years, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. We instituted the dividend, raised it by 50% and then raised it another 33%. We acquired and successfully integrated Maidenform, and we closed the acquisition of DBApparel. An incredible set of achievements, especially considering we accomplished all of this in a very challenging consumer environment. And looking back over the past 2 years, 2 things have become crystal clear: first, we have a very powerful and resilient business model that has been able to generate significant returns for our shareholders in any environment, especially when it is leveraged through acquisitions; and second, this feels like it's only the beginning. As we continue to generate cash and pursue our acquisition strategy, we believe we can continue to deliver solid double-digit earnings growth for many years to come. 
Our acquisition strategy is working extremely well. Maidenform has been integrated and is now generating substantial synergies. Looking at DBA, things are progressing as planned. DBA's results in the quarter were right in line with our expectations, and we have made significant progress on our integration plan. We expect to begin consulting with works councils in Europe in the next 30 to 60 days, after which we will be in a position to share the details with you and begin our work on integrating DBA into our operations. The more we learn about their business and their people, the more confident we are in our ability to achieve our expected synergies and to ultimately deliver EUR 100 million in operating profit. 
Looking to 2015. We believe it is shaping up to be another record year. Even after doubling EPS in just 2 years, our guidance represents another year of double-digit growth, driven by the continued efficiency gains of our supply chain, the benefits from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, synergies for Maidenform and contributions from DBA. 
Our 2015 growth rates would've been even greater had they not been dampened $230 million in sales, $44 million in operating profit and $0.37 in EPS by 2 events outside our control: the rapid strengthening of the dollar and the unexpected bankruptcy of Target Canada. Our guidance assumes 90% of the Target Canada business is unrecoverable in 2015, and the euro is at $1.10. 
As we have done in the past when faced with headwinds that are outside our control, we fully incorporate them into our guidance, which allows us to focus on the things we can control, executing our plan and, as always, driving for upside all through the year. 
So in closing, we have had a great couple of years, and we believe this is only the beginning. Our entire organization remains focused on executing our long-term strategy and that comes from having great people who can rise to the occasion in any environment. This, along with the strength of our business model, gives me confidence in delivering another year of double-digit earnings growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."
4212820,282678244,752031,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rich. We accomplished a lot in 2014.

We expanded our operating margins 140 basis points led by efficiency gains within our company-owned supply chain. We delivered synergies from Maidenform that were more than double our original expectations. We invested an incremental $8 million in media to further strengthen our brands, and we expanded the distribution of our new innovation platforms, which in turn drove another 30 basis points of market share gains in men's underwear, a testament to our ability to drive productivity for our retail partners as we are already twice the size of the #2 competitor and 5x larger than the #3 player, with sales primarily in Department stores. 
Our strong performance reinforces one simple message: we have the right set of strategies, and our entire organization is executing extremely well. 
Touching briefly on the quarter. The consumer environment remain choppy, but the overall trend was positive as sell-through in November and December was stronger than October. Innerwear sales were flat over the last year as our Basics business was able to offset the softness in bras and hosiery, while our operating profit increased 18%, driven by supply chain efficiencies and synergies from Maidenform. In Activewear, we grew both sales and operating profit 10% with growth coming in all categories. And in our International segment, sales grew over last year due to the addition of DBA, while the 260 basis point increase in operating margins came from higher sales volumes and benefits from our regionalization strategy. 
Turning to 2015. We feel great about our outlook for another year of double-digit earnings growth as we have a significant amount of visibility into the year. 
Our Innovate-to-Elevate platforms continue to work very well, which is driving additional space gains in men's underwear in both the mass and the mid-tier channels as well as in bras in the mass channel. 
We continue to gain space in Champion and the sporting goods in mid-tier channels, which is more than offsetting the challenges in mass. And we continue to internalize Maidenform's production, which should drive cost of goods synergies throughout the year. 
On the cost side, we have great line of sight into our key input cost, including cotton which is locked through the third quarter. With respect to the currency transaction impact on our cost of goods, once we saw the euro begin to decline, we fully hedged our dollar to euro exposure for the entire year, so now we are able to focus on executing our plan and driving for upside all through the year. 
To sum up, our business continues to perform extremely well, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015. We have great visibility into the year, and despite sudden headwinds, we believe we are very well positioned to deliver another year of double-digits earnings growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Since 2009, which includes the recession, a period of hyper inflation in cotton and a choppy consumer environment, our compound annual growth rate",878,"Thanks, Gerald. Not only was 2014 a great year, in fact, it was the continuation of 5 great years in a row. Since 2009, which includes the recession, a period of hyper inflation in cotton and a choppy consumer environment, our compound annual growth rate is 7% on sales, 18% on operating profit and 29% on EPS. Our ability to absorb a variety of headwinds and still generate strong returns underscores one simple fact: our business model is well tested, and it has been able to deliver returns for shareholders in any environment, and we're just beginning. With higher levels of sustainable cash flow and a continued focus on deploying our cash, we believe we are well positioned to deliver outsized returns for our shareholders for many years to come. 
Now let me give you some color on our strong fourth quarter results. Sales in the quarter increased 19% in constant currency with DBA contributing approximately 16 points of growth. Gross profit margin improved 340 basis points to 37.9% with DBA contributing approximately 180 basis points of the increase, while the remainder was driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. 
SG&A cost from the quarter increased 210 basis points to 24.8%. DBA added 260 basis points to our SG&A rate, which was partially offset by Maidenform synergies and our ongoing cost control programs. 
Operating profit in the quarter increased 31% to $48 million, driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain, the addition of DBA and synergies from Maidenform. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 13.2% with the 210 basis point improvement in our base business, more than offsetting the expected 80 basis point dilution from DBA. 
Interest and other expense of $31 million and a tax rate of just over 12% resulted in EPS for the quarter of $1.46, a 49% increase over last year. 
Switching briefly to the full year. Sales on a constant-currency basis increased roughly 16% with the majority of the growth coming from the acquisitions of Maidenform and DBA. Operating profit increased 28% or $167 million, with roughly 60% of the increase coming from improvements in our base business. For the year, our operating margin increased 140 basis points to 14.3% with the 170 basis point improvement in our base business more than offsetting the expected 30 basis point dilution from DBA, and full year EPS increased 45% over last year to $5.66. For the year, we generated $508 million in cash flow from operations. We used approximately $64 million for capital expenditures, $62 million for pension contributions and returned $120 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Turning to guidance for 2015. We expect full year sales to be $5,775,000,000 to $5,825,000,000. Operating profit to be $835 million to $855 billion. Interest and other related expense of $90 million to $95 million, and the full year tax rate to be approximately 13%. 
Similar to last year, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the first half of the year, and we believe the split between the first and second half of 2014 was a good proxy for 2015. 
This results in an EPS range of $6.30 to $6.50 or $1.58 to $1.63 on a split-adjusted basis, which represents another year of double-digit growth. We expect cash flow from operations to be $550 million to $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million, while annual dividend payments are expected to be approximately $160 million. 
Inherent in our guidance are the following assumptions on DBA, which are based on a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.10. For the full year, we expect DBA to contribute approximately EUR 630 million in sales or about $700 million, and approximately EUR 30 million in operating profit or roughly $33 million, which is being weighed down by EUR 14 million from the currency transaction impact to costs of goods. This implies about 140 basis points of margin dilution from DBA for the year. We expect DBA to continue to have a significant impact on our reported gross margin and SG&A rate until we anniversary the acquisition. 
Another important factor about the DBA acquisition is the fluctuations in the euro that have absolutely no impact on our expected IRR for the acquisition because we bought the business with euros, we financed it with euros and we're paying down the debt using DBA's euro-based cash flow. 
So in closing, we have great momentum in our business, which we expect to continue into 2015, and we have good visibility into the year. Space gains [ph] are set. Pricing is set. We have a line of sight into our key input costs. Our euro-based costs are locked, and we have limited earnings downside from the euro. For example, if the year were to go to parity today, it would take roughly $65 million out of sales but only about $3 million out of operating profit compared to our guidance. So even after doubling earnings in just 2 years, and entering into 2015 with roughly $0.37, of EPS headwinds from currency and Target Canada, we believe we are very well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth.

The consumers will tell us it's a very difficult category to shop, and we're now focusing our intimates businesses around our 4 core businesses: Bali, Playtex, Hanes and Maidenform. And as we do that, we're consolidating some of our smaller brands into the best styles of those smaller brands into our larger brands and that's creating some reduction of inventories at retail. For example, our Barely There line, we're taking the best of those styles and folding it into Maidenform.

Our business model continues to deliver significant returns for our shareholders as contributions from our acquisition strategy and margin improvements in our base business drove 16% growth in earnings per share in the first quarter, and that was on top of last year's 50% increase. Our acquisition strategy is working extremely well, and this is a great quarter to see how all facets of the strategy are delivering significant growth. For example, Gear for Sports, which has been part of our core operations for several years, contribute double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the quarter. Maidenform, which was fully integrated only last year, delivered additional synergies and contribute nicely to the first quarter's profit growth. As we continue to internalize their production and launch our ComfortFlex Fit platform under the Maidenform brand later this year, we are on track to more than double their operating profit to $80 million by the end of 2016. DBApparel in just its second full quarter as part of HanesBrands, was also a strong contributor to results. We started the works council process last week, and we expect to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2015 and continuing into 2017 and beyond. Ultimately, allowing us to reach our goal of EUR 100 million of operating profit. And only 7 months after we added DBA, we closed our latest acquisition, Knights Apparel. This is a great acquisition making us the leading supplier of license collegian apparel in both the mass and college bookstore channels. As we leverage the scale of our supply chain, the graphic art capabilities of our Gear for Sports business and our expertise in the mass channel, we believe we can double our operating profit to more than $40 million within the next 2 to 3 years. Integration planning has already begun, and we believe a large portion of the integration actions can be completed by the end of this year with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016. 
Now that we have several acquisitions under our belt, investors are able to see how our acquisition strategy can deliver multiyear returns to our shareholders. And with just these expected synergy contributions, we believe we have great earnings momentum. 
So in summary, we are off to a great start in 2015 with our first quarter results coming right in line with our overall plan. We feel good about the trends in our business, and we have great visibility for the remainder of the year. This, along with the addition of Knights Apparel, gives us confidence this early in the year to increase our earnings guidance, which now assumes mid to high teens growth. Looking forward, we believe the ongoing margin drivers in our base business, combined with the current synergy road map for DBApparel and Knights Apparel, positions us for continued double-digit growth for the next several years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."
4212820,291450162,793448,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rich.

We were able to deliver another quarter of strong earnings growth by focusing on the things we can control and executing our long-term strategy. Our acquisitions are paying dividends. We are gaining share in our key categories. Our innovation platforms are driving additional space gains, and our operating margin continued to expand, up another 90 basis points over the last year, excluding DBA. 
Looking at the quarter, our innovation platforms continue to perform well helping drive sales growth in men's underwear and bras, while, overall, in our sales decrease over last year. The decrease was due to a short-term retail inventory reduction in Basics by a major account, which dropped their retail inventory to its lowest level in 5 years. This short-term reduction has already begun to reverse in the first 2 weeks of April. And a good thing about replenishment category is that these types of inventory imbalances don't have a lasting impact on the business. 
For our revenue increased for the first time in several quarters as we begun to anniversary the impact from our brand consolidation efforts and retail inventory normalized, particularly in the mid-tier channel. For the quarter, Innerwear's operating margins increased 310 basis points driven by Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and efficiency gains from our supply chain. 
Turning to activewear. Sales in the quarter increased slightly over last year as double-digit growth in Gear for Sports and increases in Hayes Activewear were somewhat offset by Champion. In the sporting goods, mid-tier in department store channels, Champion has a significant amount of space gains this year. With many new programs shipping on the second quarter, we believe Champion is positioned for strong full year growth. We are also encouraged by Champion's sell-through trends in the mass channel which showed improvement in the quarter. 
Switching to international. On a constant-currency basis, we saw strong double-digit sales and operating profit growth in Japan and Latin America while results in our ongoing Canada operations improved sequentially through the quarter. 
With respect to DBApparel, they performed well in the quarter contributing approximately $184 million in sales and better-than-expected profits driven by favorable supply chain variances and strong expense controls. Sales in key geographies of Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were in line with plan. And in France, sales growth was driven by the successful extension of the Dean mega brand beyond hosiery, underwear intimates and socks. 
Now let me take a step back and provide you with a broader sense of our business. The overall consumer environment remains choppy with good weeks followed by bad weeks. That said, the overall trends within our business remains strong. Sell-through, especially within our Innerwear Basics business, continued to outpace shipments and help drive market share gains in the quarter. Our innovation platforms are performing well. In fact, we are  positioned to more than double our space this year, and we continue to drive efficiency gains in our supply chain. 
Looking forward, we have great visibility into the remainder of the year as our space is set, our pricing is in place, the transaction impact from exchange rate has hedged and we have locked in most of our key input cost. 
So to sum up, the trends in our business remains strong. We have great visibility into the remainder of the year, and our acquisition strategy is delivering substantial benefits giving us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. I'll now turn the call over to Rick."
4212820,291450162,793448,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. We had another quarter of strong operating and financial results.

We had another quarter of strong operating and financial results. Contributions from our acquisition strategy, along with continued margin improvements in our base business, drove a 16% increase in our earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. 
Now let me give you some color on our record first quarter results. Sales in the quarter increased 15% in constant currency with DBA contributing approximately 17 points of growth. Our acquisition strategy continues to be a major contributor to operating profit. Double-digit growth in Gear for Sports, synergies for Maidenform as well as the addition of DBApparel help drive us a 16% increase in our operating profit for the quarter. 
Looking at margins, our gross profit margin improved 300 basis points to 38.1% with DBA contributing approximately 190 basis points of the increase, while the remainder was driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate. SG&A cost in the quarter increased 280 basis points to 27.1% with DBA accounting for roughly 270 basis points of the increase. This resulted in a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 90 basis point improvement in our base business more than offset the expected 70 basis points of dilution from the addition of DBA. And first and other expense of $27 million was roughly $5 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisition of DBA, while the tax rate of 16% was the same compared to last year. This resulted in our earnings per share of $0.22, a 16% increase over last year. 
Turning to guidance. With our Knights Apparel acquisition being completed so quickly, we're now able to increase our 2015 outlook. We're increasing our full year sales guidance to a range of $5.9 billion to $5.95 billion, which includes the addition of approximately $160 million from Knights Apparel, offset by a reduction of roughly $35 million from additional pressure in various exchange rates. We're increasing our operating profit guidance through to a range of $853 million to $873 million with the entire $18 million increase due to the addition of Knights Apparel. Remember, there's no impact to our operating profit guidance from our lower exchange rate assumptions as the FX transaction cost remain hedge and the FX translation impact is minimal. 
Interest and other related expense is now expected to be a range of $95 million to $100 million, an increase of $5 million due to the additional debt associated with the Knights acquisition. 
Our full year tax rate is expected to be approximately 13%, and similar to last year, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the first half of the year. We believe the split between the first and second half of 2014 continues to be a good proxy for 2015. We're increasing our EPS guidance by $0.03 to a range of $1.61 to $1.66, which represents strong mid- to high teens growth for 2015. We expect cash flow from operations to be $550 million to $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $80 million to $85 million. 
Looking long-term, we expect our CapEx should average around 1.75% of sales, which will allow our global supply chain to remain competitive, while also handling the increased capacity needs from our acquisition strategy. And over time, as we spend at this level, our CapEx should roughly equal our depreciation. 
With respect to DBA, our estimates of approximately EUR 630 million in sales and approximately EUR 30 million in operating profit are unchanged. This implies about 130 basis points of margin dilution from DBA for the year. We expect DBA to continue to have a significant impact on our reported gross margin and SG&A rate until we anniversary the acquisition in September. 
So in closing, we're off to a great start in 2015. And with our visibility for the remainder of the year, we believe we are well positioned to deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth.

Our share positions grew in the quarter, our POS is stronger than shipments, space is sound, and actually we're expanding space on a number of our innovations as we look forward to the balance of the year. So strong fundamentals. We do see fluctuations from time to time in our order patterns. And in the quarter, we saw it in one of our major retailers. And, in fact, those inventors did fall by almost 2 weeks of supply, which is really the lowest level we've seen in 5 years. What I can say is the great thing about our category is ultimately over time, orders and replenishment ultimately recover to the level of POS trends. And what we've already seen is we entered the period as, in fact, those orders are recovering and flowing nicely. So I don't see any fundamental shift there. It's really just an aberration of fluctuation in the order pattern."

At the end of the day, one of the reasons that we wanted to make sure our supply chain was balanced across hemispheres and we diversified both across countries was to be able to make sure we could take advantage of things that might emerge. For example, the transpacific partnership when, in fact, if it is actually approved in past by all the countries involved, it will give us a substantial advantage vis-à-vis those people who didn't pursue that strategy because we've been operating in places like Vietnam for close to 8 years, and by the time something like this would come to fruition, we'd have a good decade or more advantage on other people than deciding to go into those countries. So it's I think part of our strategy of balancing that supply chain globally and making sure we can take advantage of the things like this. Now that said, I do think that things in Washington and different governments around the world do move slowly. As you said, the Congress is moving forward to fast-track legislation, which would be the -- what we called, TPA, which gives the President the ability to go negotiate to deal with other countries and then bring it back for an up or down vote to Congress. So that's the first part of the process. If that does get passed sometime between now and Memorial Day, then the administration can go off and complete the negotiations with the 12 countries involved to try and put together the TPP, our transpacific partnership. Once that's actually finalized, that would then go to Congress for a vote. There's people that are optimistic the things that's could happen. And as early as December of '15, there's people who think that it could take until later '16 to actually get passed. It's Washington, things move slowly, we'll just keep an eye on it and see how it unfolds. Once it's passed, once all the countries actually will approve it, it would then be a phase-in approach over time, but as I said, we wanted to make sure we're positioned globally to take advantage of these things and we'll have a good leapfrog on everybody else because we've been operating in those countries, such as Vietnam, for such a long period of time. It's a great country, it's doing very well for us even without TPP. Low-cost, high-quality, we've got about 9,000 employees there, and it's expanding to about 12,000 over time. It's a great base for us to supply places like Europe, and we feel really good about it growing our supply chain."

There's nothing that says this was some big systemic push by retailer -- by this retailer to dramatically change their turns on an ongoing basis.

Our business model continues to deliver significant returns for our shareholders as contributions from our acquisition strategy and margin improvements in our base business drove 16% growth in earnings per share in the first quarter, and that was on top of last year's 50% increase. Our acquisition strategy is working extremely well, and this is a great quarter to see how all facets of this strategy are delivering significant growth. For example, Gear for Sports, which has been part of our core operations for several years, contributed double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the quarter. Maidenform, which was fully integrated only last year, delivered additional synergies and contributed nicely to the first quarter's profit growth. As we continue to internalize their production and launch our ComfortFlex Fit I2E platform under the Maidenform brand later this year, we are on track to more than double their operating profit to $80 million by the end of 2016.
DBApparel, in just its second full quarter as part of HanesBrands, was also a strong contributor to results. We started the works council process last week, and we expect to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continuing into 2017 and beyond, ultimately allowing us to reach our goal of EUR 100 million of operating profit. And only 7 months after we added DBA, we closed our latest acquisition, Knights Apparel. This is a great acquisition, making us the leading supplier of licensed collegian apparel in both the mass and college bookstore channels. As we leverage the scale of our supply chain, the graphic art capabilities of our Gear for Sports business and our expertise in the mass channel, we believe we can double their operating profit to more than $40 million within the next 2 to 3 years. Integration planning has already begun, and we believe a large portion of the integration actions can be completed by the end of this year with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016.
Now that we have several acquisitions under our belt, investors are able to see how our acquisition strategy can deliver multiyear returns to our shareholders. And with just these expected synergy contributions, we believe we have great earnings momentum.
So in summary, we are off to a great start in 2015 with our first quarter results coming right in line with our overall plan. We feel good about the trends in our business, and we have great visibility for the remainder of the year. This, along with the addition of Knights Apparel, gives us confidence this early in the year to increase our earnings guidance, which now assumes mid to high teens growth. Looking forward, we believe the ongoing margin drivers in our base business, combined with the current synergy road map for DBA and Knights Apparel, position us for continued double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We were able to deliver another quarter of strong earnings growth by focusing on the things we can control and executing our long-term strategy. Our acquisitions are paying dividends. We are gaining share in our key categories. Our innovation platforms are driving additional space gains, and our operating margin continued to expand, up another 90 basis points over last year, excluding DBA.
Looking at the quarter, our innovation platforms continued to perform well, helping drive sales growth in men's underwear and bras while overall, Innerwear sales decreased over last year. The decrease was due to a short-term retail inventory reduction in basics by a major account, which dropped their retail inventory to its lowest level in 5 years. This short-term reduction has already begun to reverse in the first 2 weeks of April. And the good thing about replenishment category is that these types of inventory imbalances don't have a lasting impact on the business.
Bra revenue increased for the first time in several quarters as we begin to anniversary the impact from our brand consolidation efforts and retail inventory normalized, particularly in the mid-tier channel. For the quarter, Innerwear's operating margins increased 310 basis points driven by Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and efficiency gains from our supply chain.
Turning to Activewear. Sales in the quarter increased slightly over last year as double-digit growth in Gear for Sports and increases in Hanes Activewear were somewhat offset by Champion. In the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels, Champion has a significant amount of space gains this year. With many new programs shipping in the second quarter, we believe Champion is positioned for strong full year growth. We were also encouraged by Champion's sell-through trends in the mass channel, which showed improvement in the quarter.
Switching to international. On a constant-currency basis, we saw strong double-digit sales and operating profit growth in Japan and Latin America, while results in our ongoing Canada operations improved sequentially through the quarter.
With respect to DBApparel, they performed well in the quarter, contributing approximately $184 million in sales and better-than-expected profits driven by favorable supply chain variances and strong expense controls. Sales in the key geographies of Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were in line with plan. And in France, sales growth was driven by the successful extension of the DIM mega brand beyond hosiery, underwear and intimates into socks.
Now let me take a step back and provide you with a broader sense of our business. The overall consumer environment remains choppy with good weeks followed by bad weeks. That said, the overall trends within our business remains strong. Sell-through, especially with our Innerwear basics business, continued to outpace shipments and helped drive market share gains in the quarter. Our innovation platforms are performing well. In fact, we are positioned to more than double our X-TEMP space this year, and we continue to drive efficiency gains in our supply chain. Looking forward, we have great visibility into the remainder of the year as our space is set, our pricing is in place, the transaction impact from exchange rates has hedged and we have locked in most of our key input costs.
So to sum up, the trends in our business remains strong. We have great visibility into the remainder of the year, and our acquisition strategy is delivering substantial benefits giving us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Our acquisition strategy continues to be a major contributor to operating profit. Double-digit growth in Gear for Sports, synergies for Maidenform as well as the addition of DBApparel helped drive a 16% increase in our operating profit for the quarter.
Looking at margins, our gross profit margin improved 300 basis points to 38.1% with DBA contributing approximately 190 basis points of the increase while the remainder was driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate. SG&A cost in the quarter increased 280 basis points to 27.1% with DBA accounting for roughly 270 basis points of the increase. This resulted in a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 90 basis point improvement in our base business more than offset the expected 70 basis points of dilution from the addition of DBA. Interest and other expense of $27 million was roughly $5 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisition of DBA, while the tax rate of 16% was the same compared to last year. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.22, a 16% increase over last year.
Turning to guidance. With our Knights Apparel acquisition being completed so quickly, we're now able to increase our 2015 outlook. We're increasing our full year sales guidance to a range of $5.9 billion to $5.95 billion, which includes the addition of approximately $160 million from Knights Apparel, offset by a reduction of roughly $35 million from additional pressure in various exchange rates. We're increasing our operating profit guidance to a range of $853 million to $873 million with the entire $18 million increase due to the addition of Knights Apparel. Remember, there's no impact to our operating profit guidance from our lower exchange rate assumptions as the FX transaction cost remain hedge and the FX translation impact is minimal. Interest and other related expense is now expected to be a range of $95 million to $100 million, an increase of $5 million due to the additional debt associated with the Knights acquisition.
Our full year tax rate is expected to be approximately 13% and similar to last year, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the first half of the year. We believe the split between the first and second half of 2014 continues to be a good proxy for 2015. We're increasing our EPS guidance by $0.03 to a range of $1.61 to $1.66, which represents strong mid- to high-teens growth for 2015. We expect cash flow from operations to be $550 million to $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $80 million to $85 million. Looking long-term, we expect our CapEx should average around 1.75% of sales, which will allow our global supply chain to remain competitive while also handling the increased capacity needs from our acquisition strategy. And over time, as we spend at this level, our CapEx should roughly equal our depreciation.
With respect to DBA, our estimates of approximately EUR 630 million in sales and approximately EUR 30 million in operating profit are unchanged. This implies about 130 basis points of margin dilution from DBA for the year. We expect DBA to continue to have a significant impact on our reported gross margin and SG&A rate until we anniversary the acquisition in September.
So in closing, we're off to a great start in 2015. And with our visibility for the remainder of the year, we believe we are well positioned to deliver mid- to high-teens EPS growth. Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe our business model is designed to deliver continued strong shareholder returns as the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, the momentum in our overall business and the returns from deploying future cash flows should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Space is sound, and actually we're expanding space around a number of our innovations as we look forward to the balance of the year. So strong fundamentals. We do see fluctuations from time to time in our order patterns, and in the quarter, we saw it in one of our major retailers. And in fact, those inventories did fall by almost 2 weeks of supply, which is really the lowest level we've seen in 5 years. What I can say is the great thing about our category is ultimately over time, orders and replenishment ultimately recover to the level of POS trends. And what we've already seen as we entered this April period is in fact, those orders are recovering and flowing nicely. So I don't see any fundamental shift there. It's really just an aberration or fluctuation in the order pattern."

One is sort of our overall strategic perspective, and then I'll give you a little bit of color around what we think may be going on in Washington. At the end of the day, one of the reasons that we wanted to make sure our supply chain was balance across hemispheres and we diversify both -- across countries was to be able to make sure we could take advantage of things that might emerge, for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership when in fact, if it is actually approved and passed by all the countries involved, it will give us a substantial advantage vis-à-vis those people who didn't pursue that strategy because we've been operating in places like Vietnam for close to 8 years. And by the time something like this would come to fruition, we'd have a good decade or more advantage on other people then deciding to go into those countries. So it's, I think, part of our strategy of balancing the supply chain globally and making sure we can take advantage of things like this. Now that said, I do think that things in Washington and different governments around the world do move slowly. As you said, the Congress is moving forward to fast-track legislation, which would be the -- what we call TPA, which gives the president the ability to go and negotiate the deal with the other countries and then bring it back for an up or down vote to Congress. So that's the first part of the process. If that does get passed sometime between now and Memorial Day, then the administration can go off and complete the negotiations with the 12 countries involved to try and put together the TPP, or Trans-Pacific Partnership. Once that's actually finalized, that would then go to Congress for a vote. There's people that are optimistic that things -- that, that could happen in as early as December of '15. There's people who think that it could take until later '16 to actually get passed. It's Washington. Things move slowly. We'll just keep an eye on it and see how it unfolds. Once it's passed, once all the countries actually would approve it, it would then be a phase-in approach over time. But as I said, we wanted to make sure we're positioned globally to take advantage of these things and we'll have a good leapfrog on everybody else because we've been operating in those countries, such as Vietnam, for such a long period of time. It's a great country. It's doing very well for us even without TPP, low cost, high quality. We've got about 9,000 employees there, and it's expanding to about 12,000 over time. It's a great base for us to supply places like Europe, and we feel really good about it rolling our supply chain."

Underneath that will be strong double-digit growth within the Champion business in department, specialty and mid-tier department stores. And really what we have here is we've gained a lot of space this year just as we did last year. Those space gains happen to be more skewed to the second quarter, whereas they were very strongly in the first quarter last year. In fact, last year, our sales were up in the Champion in department stores sports specialty business about 62% driven by a lot of placements in the first quarter. A lot of these are skewing as we get more space into the second quarter next year.

When we look at Europe, I think that certainly, we understood going in and we still know that they're struggling with some headwinds overall in the economy. We also know that Europe is a collection of countries rather than one place. And certainly, we see improvement in certain countries faster than others. In the south, for example, we're seeing nice positive trends in Spain or in Italy as we look at these economies. The great thing is DBA's business is very much like our Innerwear business here. It's a branded business. They have strong category -- or share positions within their categories and over time, the consumer tends to buy a consistent number of units and it has been that way through the good and bad periods of the economy. And so we think we've got a great platform on which to build the business, and as we execute our integration strategy, we got a great platform to build on."

Sometimes you've got different groups starting to manage things that are new, and actually we've had some system changes. A whole host of tactical reasons. There's nothing that says this was some big systemic push by retailer -- by this retailer to dramatically change their turns on an ongoing basis. I just chalk it up to the normal fluctuation and the normal down trend in this quarter that tended to overshoot what we've seen historically.

Our business model continues to deliver significant returns for our shareholders as contributions from our acquisition strategy and margin improvements in our base business drove 16% growth in earnings per share in the first quarter, and that was on top of last year's 50% increase. Our acquisition strategy is working extremely well, and this is a great quarter to see how all facets of this strategy are delivering significant growth. For example, Gear for Sports, which has been part of our core operations for several years, contributed double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the quarter. Maidenform, which was fully integrated only last year, delivered additional synergies and contributed nicely to the first quarter's profit growth. As we continue to internalize their production and launch our ComfortFlex Fit I2E platform under the Maidenform brand later this year, we are on track to more than double their operating profit to $80 million by the end of 2016.
DBApparel, in just its second full quarter as part of HanesBrands, was also a strong contributor to results. We started the works council process last week, and we expect to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continuing into 2017 and beyond, ultimately allowing us to reach our goal of EUR 100 million of operating profit. And only 7 months after we added DBA, we closed our latest acquisition, Knights Apparel. This is a great acquisition, making us the leading supplier of licensed collegian apparel in both the mass and college bookstore channels. As we leverage the scale of our supply chain, the graphic art capabilities of our Gear for Sports business and our expertise in the mass channel, we believe we can double their operating profit to more than $40 million within the next 2 to 3 years. Integration planning has already begun, and we believe a large portion of the integration actions can be completed by the end of this year with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016.
          Now that we have several acquisitions under our belt, investors are able to see how our acquisition strategy can deliver multiyear returns to our shareholders. And with just these expected synergy contributions, we believe we have great earnings momentum.
          So in summary, we are off to a great start in 2015 with our first quarter results coming right in line with our overall plan. We feel good about the trends in our business, and we have great visibility for the remainder of the year. This, along with the addition of Knights Apparel, gives us confidence this early in the year to increase our earnings guidance, which now assumes mid to high teens growth. Looking forward, we believe the ongoing margin drivers in our base business, combined with the current synergy road map for DBA and Knights Apparel, position us for continued double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We were able to deliver another quarter of strong earnings growth by focusing on the things we can control and executing our long-term strategy. Our acquisitions are paying dividends. We are gaining share in our key categories. Our innovation platforms are driving additional space gains, and our operating margin continued to expand, up another 90 basis points over last year, excluding DBA.
          Looking at the quarter, our innovation platforms continued to perform well, helping drive sales growth in men's underwear and bras while overall, Innerwear sales decreased over last year. The decrease was due to a short-term retail inventory reduction in basics by a major account, which dropped their retail inventory to its lowest level in 5 years. This short-term reduction has already begun to reverse in the first 2 weeks of April. And the good thing about replenishment categories is that these types of inventory imbalances don't have a lasting impact on the business.
          Bra revenue increased for the first time in several quarters as we began to anniversary the impact from our brand consolidation efforts and retail inventory normalized, particularly in the mid-tier channel. For the quarter, Innerwear's operating margins increased 310 basis points driven by Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and efficiency gains from our supply chain.
          Turning to Activewear. Sales in the quarter increased slightly over last year as double-digit growth in Gear for Sports and increases in Hanes Activewear were somewhat offset by Champion. In the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels, Champion has a significant amount of space gains this year. With many new programs shipping in the second quarter, we believe Champion is positioned for strong full year growth. We were also encouraged by Champion's sell-through trends in the mass channel, which showed improvement in the quarter.
          Switching to international. On a constant-currency basis, we saw strong double-digit sales and operating profit growth in Japan and Latin America, while results in our ongoing Canada operations improved sequentially through the quarter.
          With respect to DBApparel, they performed well in the quarter, contributing approximately $184 million in sales and better-than-expected profits driven by favorable supply chain variances and strong expense controls. Sales in the key geographies of Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were in line with plan. And in France, sales growth was driven by the successful extension of the DIM mega brand beyond hosiery, underwear and intimates into socks.
          Now let me take a step back and provide you with a broader sense of our business. The overall consumer environment remains choppy with good weeks followed by bad weeks. That said, the overall trends within our business remain strong. Sell-through, especially with our Innerwear basics business, continued to outpace shipments and helped drive market share gains in the quarter. Our innovation platforms are performing well. In fact, we are positioned to more than double our X-TEMP space this year, and we continued to drive efficiency gains in our supply chain. Looking forward, we have great visibility into the remainder of the year as our space is set, our pricing is in place, the transaction impact from exchange rates has hedged and we have locked in most of our key input costs.
          So to sum up, the trends in our business remains strong. We have great visibility into the remainder of the year, and our acquisition strategy is delivering substantial benefits giving us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

We had another quarter of strong operating and financial results.

We had another quarter of strong operating and financial results. Contributions from our acquisition strategy, along with continued margin improvements in our base business, drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
          Now let me give you some color on our record first quarter results. Sales in the quarter increased 15% in constant currency with DBA contributing approximately 17 points of growth. Our acquisition strategy continues to be a major contributor to operating profit. Double-digit growth in Gear for Sports, synergies from Maidenform as well as the addition of DBApparel helped drive a 16% increase in our operating profit for the quarter.
          Looking at margins, our gross profit margin improved 300 basis points to 38.1% with DBA contributing approximately 190 basis points of the increase while the remainder was driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate. SG&A costs in the quarter increased 280 basis points to 27.1% with DBA accounting for roughly 270 basis points of the increase. This resulted in a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 90 basis point improvement in our base business more than offset the expected 70 basis points of dilution from the addition of DBA. Interest and other expense of $27 million was roughly $5 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisition of DBA, while the tax rate of 16% was the same compared to last year. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.22, a 16% increase over last year.
          Turning to guidance. With our Knights Apparel acquisition being completed so quickly, we're now able to increase our 2015 outlook. We're increasing our full year sales guidance to a range of $5.9 billion to $5.95 billion, which includes the addition of approximately $160 million from Knights Apparel, offset by a reduction of roughly $35 million from additional pressure in various exchange rates. We're increasing our operating profit guidance to a range of $853 million to $873 million with the entire $18 million increase due to the addition of Knights Apparel. Remember, there's no impact to our operating profit guidance from our lower exchange rate assumptions as the FX transaction costs are mainly hedged and the FX translation impact is minimal. Interest and other related expense is now expected to be a range of $95 million to $100 million, an increase of $5 million due to the additional debt associated with the Knights acquisition.
          Our full year tax rate is expected to be approximately 13% and similar to last year, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the first half of the year. We believe the split between the first and second half of 2014 continues to be a good proxy for 2015. We're increasing our EPS guidance by $0.03 to a range of $1.61 to $1.66, which represents strong mid- to high-teens growth for 2015. We expect cash flow from operations to be $550 million to $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $80 million to $85 million. Looking long-term, we expect our CapEx should average around 1.75% of sales, which will allow our global supply chain to remain competitive while also handling the increased capacity needs from our acquisition strategy. And over time, as we spend at this level, our CapEx should roughly equal our depreciation.
          With respect to DBA, our estimates of approximately EUR 630 million in sales and approximately EUR 30 million in operating profit are unchanged. This implies about 130 basis points of margin dilution from DBA for the year. We expect DBA to continue to have a significant impact on our reported gross margin and SG&A rate until we anniversary the acquisition in September.
          So in closing, we're off to a great start in 2015. And with our visibility for the remainder of the year, we believe we are well positioned to deliver mid- to high-teens EPS growth. Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe our business model is designed to deliver continued strong shareholder returns as the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, the momentum in our overall business and the returns from deploying future cash flows should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Space is sound, and actually we're expanding space behind a number of our innovations as we look forward to the balance of the year. So strong fundamentals. We do see fluctuations from time to time in our order patterns, and in the quarter, we saw it in one of our major retailers. And in fact, those inventories did fall by almost 2 weeks of supply, which is really the lowest level we've seen in 5 years. What I can say is the great thing about our category is ultimately over time, orders and replenishment ultimately recover to the level of POS trends. And what we've already seen as we entered this April period is in fact, those orders are recovering and flowing nicely. So I don't see any fundamental shift there. It's really just an aberration or a fluctuation in the order pattern."

One is sort of our overall strategic perspective, and then I'll give you a little bit of color around what we think may be going on in Washington. At the end of the day, one of the reasons that we wanted to make sure our supply chain was balanced across hemispheres and we diversified both -- across countries was to be able to make sure we could take advantage of things that might emerge, for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership when in fact, if it is actually approved and passed by all the countries involved, it will give us a substantial advantage vis-à-vis those people that didn't pursue that strategy because we've been operating in places like Vietnam for close to 8 years. And by the time something like this would come to fruition, we'd have a good decade or more advantage on other people then deciding to go into those countries. So it's, I think, part of our strategy of balancing the supply chain globally and making sure we can take advantage of things like this. Now that said, I do think that things in Washington and different governments around the world do move slowly. As you said, the Congress is moving forward the fast-track legislation, which would be the -- what's called TPA, which gives the president the ability to go negotiate the deal with the other countries and then bring it back for an up or down vote to Congress. So that's the first part of the process. If that does get passed sometime between now and Memorial Day, then the administration can go off and complete the negotiations with the 12 countries involved to try and put together the TPP, or Trans-Pacific Partnership. Once that's actually finalized, that would then go to Congress for a vote. There's people that are optimistic that think that, that could happen in as early as December of '15. There's people that think that it could take them until later '16 to actually get passed. It's Washington. Things move slowly. We'll just keep an eye on it and see how it unfolds. Once it's passed, once all the countries actually would approve it, it would then be a phase-in approach over time. But as I said, we wanted to make sure we're positioned globally to take advantage of these things and we'll have a good leapfrog on everybody else because we'll have been operating in those countries, such as Vietnam, for such a long period of time. It's a great country. It's doing very well for us even without TPP, low cost, high quality. We've got about 9,000 employees there, and it's expanding to about 12,000 over time. It's a great base for us to supply places like Europe, and we feel really good about it rolling our supply chain."

Underneath that will be strong double-digit growth within the Champion business in department, specialty and mid-tier department stores. And really what we have here is we've gained a lot of space this year just as we did last year. Those space gains happen to be more skewed to the second quarter, whereas they were very strongly in the first quarter last year. In fact, last year, our sales were up in the Champion department stores, sports specialty business about 62% driven by a lot of placements in the first quarter. A lot of these are skewing as we get more space into the second quarter next year.

Our business model continues to deliver significant returns for our shareholders as contributions from our acquisition strategy and margin improvements in our base business drove 16% growth in earnings per share in the first quarter, and that was on top of last year's 50% increase. Our acquisition strategy is working extremely well, and this is a great quarter to see how all facets of this strategy are delivering significant growth. For example, Gear for Sports, which has been part of our core operations for several years, contributed double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the quarter. Maidenform, which was fully integrated only last year, delivered additional synergies and contributed nicely to the first quarter's profit growth. As we continue to internalize their production and launch our ComfortFlex Fit I2E platform under the Maidenform brand later this year, we are on track to more than double their operating profit to $80 million by the end of 2016.
DBApparel, in just its second full quarter as part of HanesBrands, was also a strong contributor to results. We started the works council process last week, and we expect to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continuing into 2017 and beyond, ultimately allowing us to reach our goal of EUR 100 million of operating profit. And only 7 months after we added DBA, we closed our latest acquisition, Knights Apparel. This is a great acquisition, making us the leading supplier of licensed collegian apparel in both the mass and college bookstore channels. As we leverage the scale of our supply chain, the graphic art capabilities of our Gear for Sports business and our expertise in the mass channel, we believe we can double their operating profit to more than $40 million within the next 2 to 3 years. Integration planning has already begun, and we believe a large portion of the integration actions can be completed by the end of this year with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016.
Now that we have several acquisitions under our belt, investors are able to see how our acquisition strategy can deliver multiyear returns to our shareholders. And with just these expected synergy contributions, we believe we have great earnings momentum.
So in summary, we are off to a great start in 2015 with our first quarter results coming right in line with our overall plan. We feel good about the trends in our business, and we have great visibility for the remainder of the year. This, along with the addition of Knights Apparel, gives us confidence this early in the year to increase our earnings guidance, which now assumes mid to high teens growth. Looking forward, we believe the ongoing margin drivers in our base business, combined with the current synergy road map for DBA and Knights Apparel, position us for continued double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We were able to deliver another quarter of strong earnings growth by focusing on the things we can control and executing our long-term strategy. Our acquisitions are paying dividends. We are gaining share in our key categories. Our innovation platforms are driving additional space gains, and our operating margin continued to expand, up another 90 basis points over last year, excluding DBA.
Looking at the quarter, our innovation platforms continued to perform well, helping drive sales growth in men's underwear and bras while overall, Innerwear sales decreased over last year. The decrease was due to a short-term retail inventory reduction in basics by a major account, which dropped their retail inventory to its lowest level in 5 years. This short-term reduction has already begun to reverse in the first 2 weeks of April. And the good thing about replenishment categories is that these types of inventory imbalances don't have a lasting impact on the business.
Bra revenue increased for the first time in several quarters as we began to anniversary the impact from our brand consolidation efforts and retail inventory normalized, particularly in the mid-tier channel. For the quarter, Innerwear's operating margins increased 310 basis points driven by Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and efficiency gains from our supply chain.
Turning to Activewear. Sales in the quarter increased slightly over last year as double-digit growth in Gear for Sports and increases in Hanes Activewear were somewhat offset by Champion. In the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels, Champion has a significant amount of space gains this year. With many new programs shipping in the second quarter, we believe Champion is positioned for strong full year growth. We were also encouraged by Champion's sell-through trends in the mass channel, which showed improvement in the quarter.
Switching to international. On a constant-currency basis, we saw strong double-digit sales and operating profit growth in Japan and Latin America, while results in our ongoing Canada operations improved sequentially through the quarter.
With respect to DBApparel, they performed well in the quarter, contributing approximately $184 million in sales and better-than-expected profits driven by favorable supply chain variances and strong expense controls. Sales in the key geographies of Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were in line with plan. And in France, sales growth was driven by the successful extension of the DIM mega brand beyond hosiery, underwear and intimates into socks.
Now let me take a step back and provide you with a broader sense of our business. The overall consumer environment remains choppy with good weeks followed by bad weeks. That said, the overall trends within our business remain strong. Sell-through, especially with our Innerwear basics business, continued to outpace shipments and helped drive market share gains in the quarter. Our innovation platforms are performing well. In fact, we are positioned to more than double our X-TEMP space this year, and we continued to drive efficiency gains in our supply chain. Looking forward, we have great visibility into the remainder of the year as our space is set, our pricing is in place, the transaction impact from exchange rates has hedged and we have locked in most of our key input costs.
So to sum up, the trends in our business remains strong. We have great visibility into the remainder of the year, and our acquisition strategy is delivering substantial benefits giving us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

We had another quarter of strong operating and financial results. Contributions from our acquisition strategy, along with continued margin improvements in our base business, drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
Now let me give you some color on our record first quarter results. Sales in the quarter increased 15% in constant currency with DBA contributing approximately 17 points of growth. Our acquisition strategy continues to be a major contributor to operating profit. Double-digit growth in Gear for Sports, synergies from Maidenform as well as the addition of DBApparel helped drive a 16% increase in our operating profit for the quarter.
Looking at margins, our gross profit margin improved 300 basis points to 38.1% with DBA contributing approximately 190 basis points of the increase while the remainder was driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate. SG&A costs in the quarter increased 280 basis points to 27.1% with DBA accounting for roughly 270 basis points of the increase. This resulted in a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 90 basis point improvement in our base business more than offset the expected 70 basis points of dilution from the addition of DBA. Interest and other expense of $27 million was roughly $5 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisition of DBA, while the tax rate of 16% was the same compared to last year. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.22, a 16% increase over last year.
Turning to guidance. With our Knights Apparel acquisition being completed so quickly, we're now able to increase our 2015 outlook. We're increasing our full year sales guidance to a range of $5.9 billion to $5.95 billion, which includes the addition of approximately $160 million from Knights Apparel, offset by a reduction of roughly $35 million from additional pressure in various exchange rates. We're increasing our operating profit guidance to a range of $853 million to $873 million with the entire $18 million increase due to the addition of Knights Apparel. Remember, there's no impact to our operating profit guidance from our lower exchange rate assumptions as the FX transaction costs are mainly hedged and the FX translation impact is minimal. Interest and other related expense is now expected to be a range of $95 million to $100 million, an increase of $5 million due to the additional debt associated with the Knights acquisition.
Our full year tax rate is expected to be approximately 13% and similar to last year, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the first half of the year. We believe the split between the first and second half of 2014 continues to be a good proxy for 2015. We're increasing our EPS guidance by $0.03 to a range of $1.61 to $1.66, which represents strong mid- to high-teens growth for 2015. We expect cash flow from operations to be $550 million to $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $80 million to $85 million. Looking long-term, we expect our CapEx should average around 1.75% of sales, which will allow our global supply chain to remain competitive while also handling the increased capacity needs from our acquisition strategy. And over time, as we spend at this level, our CapEx should roughly equal our depreciation.
With respect to DBA, our estimates of approximately EUR 630 million in sales and approximately EUR 30 million in operating profit are unchanged. This implies about 130 basis points of margin dilution from DBA for the year. We expect DBA to continue to have a significant impact on our reported gross margin and SG&A rate until we anniversary the acquisition in September.
So in closing, we're off to a great start in 2015. And with our visibility for the remainder of the year, we believe we are well positioned to deliver mid- to high-teens EPS growth. Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe our business model is designed to deliver continued strong shareholder returns as the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, the momentum in our overall business and the returns from deploying future cash flows should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Space is sound, and actually we're expanding space behind a number of our innovations as we look forward to the balance of the year. So strong fundamentals. We do see fluctuations from time to time in our order patterns, and in the quarter, we saw it in one of our major retailers. And in fact, those inventories did fall by almost 2 weeks of supply, which is really the lowest level we've seen in 5 years. What I can say is the great thing about our category is ultimately over time, orders and replenishment ultimately recover to the level of POS trends. And what we've already seen as we entered this April period is in fact, those orders are recovering and flowing nicely. So I don't see any fundamental shift there. It's really just an aberration or a fluctuation in the order pattern."

One is sort of our overall strategic perspective, and then I'll give you a little bit of color around what we think may be going on in Washington. At the end of the day, one of the reasons that we wanted to make sure our supply chain was balanced across hemispheres and we diversified both -- across countries was to be able to make sure we could take advantage of things that might emerge, for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership when in fact, if it is actually approved and passed by all the countries involved, it will give us a substantial advantage vis-à-vis those people that didn't pursue that strategy because we've been operating in places like Vietnam for close to 8 years. And by the time something like this would come to fruition, we'd have a good decade or more advantage on other people then deciding to go into those countries. So it's, I think, part of our strategy of balancing the supply chain globally and making sure we can take advantage of things like this. Now that said, I do think that things in Washington and different governments around the world do move slowly. As you said, the Congress is moving forward the fast-track legislation, which would be the -- what's called TPA, which gives the president the ability to go negotiate the deal with the other countries and then bring it back for an up or down vote to Congress. So that's the first part of the process. If that does get passed sometime between now and Memorial Day, then the administration can go off and complete the negotiations with the 12 countries involved to try and put together the TPP, or Trans-Pacific Partnership. Once that's actually finalized, that would then go to Congress for a vote. There's people that are optimistic that think that, that could happen in as early as December of '15. There's people that think that it could take them until later '16 to actually get passed. It's Washington. Things move slowly. We'll just keep an eye on it and see how it unfolds. Once it's passed, once all the countries actually would approve it, it would then be a phase-in approach over time. But as I said, we wanted to make sure we're positioned globally to take advantage of these things and we'll have a good leapfrog on everybody else because we'll have been operating in those countries, such as Vietnam, for such a long period of time. It's a great country. It's doing very well for us even without TPP, low cost, high quality. We've got about 9,000 employees there, and it's expanding to about 12,000 over time. It's a great base for us to supply places like Europe, and we feel really good about it rolling our supply chain."

Underneath that will be strong double-digit growth within the Champion business in department, specialty and mid-tier department stores. And really what we have here is we've gained a lot of space this year just as we did last year. Those space gains happen to be more skewed to the second quarter, whereas they were very strongly in the first quarter last year. In fact, last year, our sales were up in the Champion department stores, sports specialty business about 62% driven by a lot of placements in the first quarter. A lot of these are skewing as we get more space into the second quarter next year.

Let me answer a couple elements of that question. First of all, certainly when the euro declined in value, it had a transaction impact on all companies in Europe that were sourcing offshore as they sourced in U.S. dollars and had that transaction impact. As we noted in the last call, the euro fell off very quickly at the end of the year, and most of the pricing was set for '15. But certainly as we look towards '16, the best way to recover that transaction impact was through pricing. And certainly, we're in the early stages of developing those plans, and we will be executing price increases in Europe for 2016. Certainly, as we complete our integration and we work with the design teams together in Europe, we also intend to implement our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as well, and certainly that would help us optimize pricing as well."

HanesBrands delivered another quarter of strong results. Continued margin improvement in our base business, along with contributions from our acquisitions drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model. This marks another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, and with the performance of our base business, the remaining synergies from our acquisitions and the benefits from deploying future cash flows, we believe we have the right formula to deliver double-digit earnings growth for many years to come. 
The management team, and as an organization, we have a simple mission: To generate superior long-term returns for our shareholders. We've been able to accomplish this in 2 ways. The first is by executing the right long-term business strategies, which includes the best manufacturing and deploying our margin enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. And the second is by taking a disciplined return-centric approach to deploying our free cash flow. Our cash flow is a huge part of our value-creation formula, which is used to pay dividends, make acquisitions, as we have said before, at some point, to repurchase shares. Our dividend is in place and we expect over time for it to grow in line with our earnings. 
Over the last 24 months, we have completed 3 acquisitions for approximately $1.3 billion. Once we achieved full synergies, these are expected to annually contribute roughly $1.4 billion in sales, $230 million in operating profit and $0.48 in earnings per share. Acquisitions will clearly remain one of our core strategies going forward, given the breadth of our opportunities, our strong balance sheet and our proven integration processes. 
With respect to share repurchases, the common perception is this is an either or decision as it relates to acquisition. However, at our current capital structure, targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of between 2 to 3x, coupled with our cash generation ability, we firmly believe that we can easily do both acquisitions and repurchases simultaneously. We have no need to accumulate significant cash on our balance sheet to do acquisitions nor do we strive to become investment grade. Therefore, our intent is to always use our excess cash to create the best long-term returns for our shareholders by using a mixture of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. 
In summary, our overall business continues to track to our plan. We delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, and our visibility into the second half gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth for the full year. 
As we have shown over the past few years, our business model is designed to drive strong shareholder returns and we remain dedicated to continuing this trend. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

Continued execution of our core strategies combined to drive another quarter of strong performance. Our acquisition strategy contributed nicely to second quarter results as both DBApparel and Knights Apparel delivered operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and integration strategies continue to bear fruit. Constant currency revenue growth in our base business accelerated from first quarter levels, while base operating margins expanded another 180 basis points. 
Before getting into our business results, let me begin with a brief update on our 2 integrations. With respect to DBA, we've already begun to insource some of their third-party manufacturing. Earlier this month, we produced the first deemed boxer briefs in our Vietnam facility. In terms of the overall integration, we completed all but one of the required works council consultations, and we remain on track to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continue into 2017 and beyond, ultimately, allowing us to reach our goal of EUR 100 million of operating profit. 
Looking at Knights Apparel, we've completed our integration planning and have begun communicating to employees. We're on track to begin the integration actions by the end of this year, with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016. And we remain confident in our ability to double their operating profit to roughly $40 million within the next 2 to 3 years. 
Turning to our segments. Innerwear sales declined 1% in the quarter as mid-single-digit growth in Basics was offset by a decline in intimates. With respect to our Basics business, in the quarter, we saw growth across underwear, socks and panties driven by further share gains and strong performance from our innovation platforms. X-TEMP and ComfortBlend are now 15% of our Basics business, which is up from 13%. And with the doubling of our X-TEMP this year, we expect this share to continue to grow. Innerwear's operating profit increased 7% over last year, and its operating margin expanded 190 basis points driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from Maidenform and ongoing cost controls in SG&A. 
Switching to our activewear segment. Sales growth accelerated from first quarter levels driven by the acquisition of Knights Apparel as well as growth in our Champion and Gear for Sports businesses. As expected, Champion's sales in sporting-goods mid-tier and department store channels grew significantly in the quarter, up 42% over last year due to concentration of the new program shipments in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. In these channels, Champion's sales year-to-date are in line with our plan, and we remain on track for another year of solid double-digit growth. Activewear's operating margins improved 130 basis points in the quarter as product mix, supply chain efficiencies and tight SG&A controls more than offset the expected dilution from Knights Apparel. 
Turning to international. The year-over-year growth in the quarter was driven by our acquisition of DBA. Looking at our base international business, which excludes DBA and the Target Canada bankruptcy, sales in constant currency increased roughly [ph] 8% in the quarter. With respect to DBA, in spite of ongoing economic headwinds in Europe, the business performed well in the quarter with sales increasing in Spain and the U.K. We expanded our hosiery market share in Spain, France and Germany as well as our underwear market share in France. These results, combined with excellent cost controls and favorable supply chain performance, generated profits that were above plan for the quarter. 
So to sum up, overall, we are right where we expected to be at the stage of the year, and we feel great about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are confident in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years as our strategies are working, our brands are resonating with consumers and our integrations are progressing on schedule. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter.

Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter. The fact that we were able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth on top of last year's 43% increase is a testament to the power and sustainability of our business model. In the second quarter, constant currency sales increased 15% over last year as our base business increased 1% while acquisitions contributed approximately 14 points of growth. Operating profit increased 15% over last year driven by contributions from DBA and Knights Apparel, tight SG&A management, efficiency gains from our supply chains and synergies for Maidenform. 
Now let me give you some color on the strong margin performance in the quarter. Our gross profit margin improved 120 basis points to 39.1%. Acquisitions contributed roughly 60 basis points to the increase as structurally lower margins in Knights Apparel were more than offset by structurally higher margins in DBA. The remainder of the increase was driven predominantly by supply chain efficiencies in our base business. 
SG&A cost as a percentage of sales increased approximately 100 basis points to 21.6% driven by our acquisitions. The result was a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 180 basis points improvement in our base business more than offset the expected margin percentage of dilution from the addition of DBA and Knights Apparel. 
Looking at the rest of our results. Interest and other expense of $30 million was roughly $8 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisitions as well as the addition costs associated with our debt refinancing. Our tax rate was 13% in the quarter, and earnings per share was $0.50. Cash flow from operations was right on plan, and we ended the quarter with $315 million in cash on our balance sheet. 
Turning to guidance. I'll highlight some of the key pieces, but I'd also like to provide additional color as it relates to individual quarters. You'll find our full guidance details in our press release and the associated commentary in our updated FAQ document. We refined our full year sales guidance to approximately $5.9 billion with roughly $15 million to $20 million of the adjustment coming from further deterioration in key exchange rates. We slightly increased our operating profit guidance to a range of $855 million to $875 million. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $100 million, a full year tax rate of approximately 13% and an earnings per share range of $1.61 to $1.66. 
Looking into the second half of the year. We have a significant amount of visibility. Our space is set, our pricing and promotional programs are in place, and we've locked in our key input cost, including cotton. Based on our guidance, we're expecting second half operating profit to increase 10% to 14% over last year, which implies second half operating margins could increase roughly 20 to 60 basis points. However, due to certain timing shifts this year, we're expecting year-over-year operating profit growth for the individual quarters to be very uneven. We expect third quarter operating profit growth in the mid-single digits range while we expect fourth quarter growth to be in the high teens to low 20% range. The timing shift is due to a concentration of promotional spending in the third quarter this year, the timing around the realization of certain supply chain and integration savings as well as the benefit from lower cotton prices in the fourth quarter. 
So in closing, our overall performance this year is tracking right to our plan, and this, coupled with our visibility into the second half, gives us confidence we can deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth for the year. Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, with the momentum in our overall business and the returns from deploying future cash flows, should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

And our focus is to make sure we're using that cash to create great returns for you, our shareholders. We firmly believe that, that will be best done with a mixture of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. And we've been doing a lot of the first 2 acquisitions as well as instituting an increasing dividend over time, and it's probably now becoming time for share repurchases to become a definitive part of that mix. When you step back, I want to make sure that nobody hears this saying, we're doing this instead of acquisitions, that's really not the case. We can do both. In fact, when we look at our excess cash generation ability today and over the next 12 to 18 months, we could easily do $1.5 billions of acquisitions and buy back stock consistently over that period of time. You can actually model out over the next couple of years, and you can find us being able to do billions of dollars of acquisitions and being able to buy back shares. In terms of the near-term strategy. More likely than not, you'll see us begin to execute share buybacks in 2015, while we have an authorization in place, we don't have any definitive plans, and Rick and I need to do a little bit more analysis on how much we would do and how we might start that program. Therefore, none of this is built into any of our guidance. But more likely than not, you'll see us begin to buy back some shares in 2015. From an ongoing basis, what is excess cash flow? I think you asked me to quantify it. Now if you think of our cash flow from operations of about 550 this year, less CapEx that we've talked about, less the dividend, and you get to that $250 million to $300 million range on an ongoing basis, that could be a reasonable number. I'm not committing to that in any given year, but that's the way to frame it. The great thing is we generate a lot of cash, we've got multiple ways to create value for shareholders and we want to use all of those ways to create value for shareholders."

As Rich mentioned, the category in Basics in growing. We're up 1 share point in the overall Basics category in our underwear business is up 2 points. It really is driven by the things you touched on, our innovation, our strong brand position, we're gaining space and we're going back to school with strong offers as we went for a period. As we ended the first quarter, a major retailer had reduced their inventory, and at that point, we viewed it as temporary. As we've gone into the second quarter, we've learned that it is, in fact, more of a systemic change, and they intend to use their new replenishment system to manage their inventory more tightly going forward, to pursue inventory terms. And so we reflected that in our guidance going forward. But we feel really good about this business. This kind of adjustments aside, we're continuing to gain space, we're gaining more space in the second half of the year, our share positions are growing and our innovation's working. So we feel very good about the Basics business and its impact on Innerwear. As we look at intimates, as Rich touched on as well, we gained share as well in the core intimates business, but this category has accelerated and decline at a high single digit rate in the most recent 12-month period. So in addition, as we look at our business, in addition to the category weakness, our results in the quarter were impacted as we executed the last of our brand transition strategy in Department stores. We set about focusing on fewer bigger brands, our important brands in the channel and folding smaller brands like Barely There into those brands. So in the quarter, we manage down the last of our retail inventories and only a quarter in did we begin to pipe our new initiatives. As look forward to Q3 and Q4, we'll continue that piping of initiatives and expand space behind those. So there again, we feel really go about what we're doing in the category. And in spite of the category stuff might be doing, we're doing the things we can do, we're putting great innovation behind our brands and really putting something in place that the consumers will buy."

We talked about the overall category actually sleeping negative, and it's been like that now for a little bit of time. And as Gerald said, that's across all channels, specialty, Department stores, mass and everywhere. That's going to last forever at the end of the day usages in that category haven't changed so there's normal ebbs and flows. I really do think that when you get outside of specialty and you look in Department stores, mass and winter, on the big issues has been there's way too many brands and way too many little ideas and there's not big innovation that can help drive that category. And that's what we're working hard to change this year after going after our 4 strong brands with very distinct positioning, we can drive a big platform innovation behind those just like we have in the underwear and socks category with things like X-TEMP, and so on and so forth, and that's the thinking that can get that category to start turning around. We need to get in that position and then act like a leader, and we can actually help change the category trends."

And then at the end of day, this but given that may be company's apparel companies that have a kind of the supply chain and capabilities that we do now across multiple continent. So there's not a lot of the same kind of competitive dynamics that you might see in some other industries or some with some other properties and other people pursuing them.

We now are including know that we have greater visibility on Knights Apparel and the integration plan that we think we'll be going in there, we're better able to estimate what those charges might be, there's about half of it and other half comes from a decision in the second quarter to exit through the China commercial business, which is about a $20 million charge, almost all of it is non-cash.

HanesBrands delivered another quarter of strong results. Continued margin improvement in our base business, along with contributions from our acquisitions, drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model. This marks another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, and with the performance of our base business, the remaining synergies from our acquisitions and the benefits from deploying future cash flows, we believe we have the right formula to deliver double-digit earnings growth for many years to come.
As the management team and as an organization, we have a simple mission: to generate superior long-term returns for our shareholders. We've been able to accomplish this in 2 ways. The first is by executing the right long-term business strategies, which includes investing in our manufacturing and deploying our margin-enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. And the second is by taking a disciplined return-centric approach to deploying our free cash flow. Our cash flow is a huge part of our value-creation formula, which is used to pay dividends, make acquisitions, as we've said before, at some point, to repurchase shares. Our dividend is in place, and we expect, over time, for it to grow in line with our earnings.
Over the last 24 months, we have completed 3 acquisitions for approximately $1.3 billion. Once we achieve full synergies, these are expected to annually contribute roughly $1.4 billion in sales, $230 million in operating profit and $0.48 in earnings per share. Acquisitions will clearly remain one of our core strategies going forward, given the breadth of our opportunities, our strong balance sheet and our proven integration processes.
With respect to share repurchases, the common perception is this is an either/or decision as it relates to acquisitions. However, at our current capital structure, targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of between 2 to 3x, coupled with our cash generation ability, we firmly believe that we can easily do both acquisitions and repurchases simultaneously. We have no need to accumulate significant cash on our balance sheet to do acquisitions nor do we strive to become investment grade. Therefore, our intent is to always use our excess cash to create the best long-term returns for our shareholders by using a mixture of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.
In summary, our overall business continues to track to our plan. We delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and our visibility into the second half gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth for the full year.
As we have shown over the past few years, our business model is designed to drive strong shareholder returns, and we remain dedicated to continuing this trend.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

Continued execution of our core strategies combined to drive another quarter of strong performance. Our acquisition strategy contributed nicely to second quarter results, as both DBApparel and Knights Apparel delivered operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and integration strategies continued to bear fruit. Constant-currency revenue growth in our base business accelerated from first quarter levels, while base operating margins expanded another 180 basis points.
Before getting into our business results, let me begin with a brief update on our 2 integrations. With respect to DBA, we've already begun to insource some of their third-party manufacturing. Earlier this month, we produced the first DIM boxer briefs in our Vietnam facility. In terms of the overall integration, we've completed all but one of the required works council consultations, and we remain on track to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continue into 2017 and beyond, ultimately allowing us to reach our goal of EUR 100 million of operating profit.
Looking at Knights Apparel, we've completed our integration planning and have begun communicating to employees. We're on track to begin the integration actions by the end of this year, with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016. And we remain confident in our ability to double their operating profit to roughly $40 million within the next 2 to 3 years.
Turning to our segments. Innerwear sales declined 1% in the quarter as mid-single-digit growth in basics was offset by a decline in intimates. With respect to our basics business, in the quarter, we saw growth across underwear, socks and panties driven by further share gains and strong performance from our innovation platforms. X-TEMP and ComfortBlend are now 15% of our basics business, which is up from 13%. And with the doubling of our X-TEMP's base this year, we expect this share to continue to grow. Innerwear's operating profit increased 7% over last year, and its operating margin expanded 190 basis points, driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from Maidenform and ongoing cost controls in SG&A.
Switching to our Activewear segment. Sales growth accelerated from first quarter levels driven by the acquisition of Knights Apparel as well as growth in our Champion and Gear for Sports businesses. As expected, Champion's sales in sporting goods mid-tier and department store channels grew significantly in the quarter, up 42% over last year due to the concentration of new program shipments in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. In these channels, Champion's sales, year-to-date, are in line with our plan, and we remain on track for another year of solid double-digit growth. Activewear's operating margins improved 130 basis points in the quarter as product mix, supply chain efficiencies and tight SG&A controls more than offset the expected dilution from Knights Apparel.
Turning to international. The year-over-year growth in the quarter was driven by our acquisition of DBA. Looking at our base international business, which excludes DBA and the Target Canada bankruptcy, sales in constant currency increased roughly 8% in the quarter. With respect to DBA, in spite of ongoing economic headwinds in Europe, the business performed well in the quarter with sales increasing in Spain and the U.K. We expanded our hosiery market share in Spain, France and Germany as well as our underwear market share in France. These results, combined with excellent cost controls and favorable supply chain performance, generated profits that were above plan for the quarter.
So to sum up, overall, we are right where we expected to be at this stage of the year, and we feel great about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are confident in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years as our strategies are working, our brands are resonating with consumers and our integrations are progressing on schedule.
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter. The fact that we were able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth on top of last year's",677,"Thanks, Gerald. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter. The fact that we were able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth on top of last year's 43% increase is a testament to the power and sustainability of our business model. In the second quarter, constant currency sales increased 15% over last year as our base business increased 1% while acquisitions contributed approximately 14 points of growth. Operating profit increased 15% over last year, driven by contributions from DBA and Knights Apparel, tight SG&A management, efficiency gains in our supply chains and synergies from Maidenform.
Now let me give you some color on the strong margin performance in the quarter. Our gross profit margin improved 120 basis points to 39.1%. Acquisitions contributed roughly 60 basis points to the increase, as structurally lower margins in Knights Apparel were more than offset by structurally higher margins in DBA. The remainder of the increase was driven predominantly by supply chain efficiencies in our base business.
SG&A cost as a percentage of sales increased approximately 100 basis points to 21.6%, driven by our acquisitions. The result was a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 180 basis points improvement in our base business more than offset the expected margin percentage dilution from the addition of DBA and Knights Apparel.
Looking at the rest of our results. Interest and other expense of $30 million was roughly $8 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisitions as well as the additional costs associated with our debt refinancing. Our tax rate was 13% in the quarter, and earnings per share were $0.50. Cash flow from operations was right on plan, and we ended the quarter with $315 million in cash on our balance sheet.
Turning to guidance. I'll highlight some of the key pieces, but I'd also like to provide additional color as it relates to the individual quarters. You'll find our full guidance details in our press release and the associated commentary in our updated FAQ document.
We've refined our full year sales guidance to approximately $5.9 billion, with roughly $15 million to $20 million of the adjustment coming from further deterioration in key exchange rates. We slightly increased our operating profit guidance to a range of $855 million to $875 million. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $100 million, a full year tax rate of approximately 13% and an earnings per share range of $1.61 to $1.66.
Looking into the second half of the year. We have a significant amount of visibility. Our space is set, our pricing and promotional programs are in place and we've locked in our key input costs, including cotton. Based on our guidance, we're expecting second half operating profit to increase 10% to 14% over last year, which implies second half operating margins could increase roughly 20 to 60 basis points. However, due to certain timing shifts this year, we're expecting year-over-year operating profit growth for the individual quarters to be very uneven. We expect third quarter operating profit growth in the mid-single digits range, while we expect fourth quarter growth to be in the high teens to low 20% range. The timing shift is due to a concentration of promotional spending in the third quarter of this year, the timing around the realization of certain supply chain and integration savings as well as the benefit from lower cotton prices in the fourth quarter.
So in closing, our overall performance this year is tracking right to our plan, and this, coupled with our visibility into the second half, gives us confidence we can deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth for the year.
Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, the momentum in our overall business and the returns from deploying future cash flows, should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

One of the great things about our business is we generate a tremendous amount of cash on a consistent basis. It's a hallmark of the company. And our focus is to make sure we're using that cash to create great returns for you, our shareholders. We firmly believe that, that will be best done with a mixture of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. And we've been doing a lot of the first 2 acquisitions as well as instituting and increasing a dividend over time. And it's probably now becoming time for share repurchases to become a definitive part of that mix. When you step back, I want to make sure that nobody hears this saying, we're doing this instead of acquisitions, that's really not the case. We can do both. In fact, when we look at our excess cash-generation ability today and over the next 12 to 18 months, we could easily do $1.5 billions of acquisitions and buy back stock consistently over that period of time. You can actually model out over the next couple of years, and you can find us being able to do billions of dollars of acquisitions and being able to buy back shares. In terms of the near-term strategy. More likely than not, you'll see us begin to execute a share buybacks in 2015, while we have an authorization in place. We don't have any definitive plans, and Rick and I need to do a little bit more analysis on how much we would do and how we might start that program. Therefore, none of this is built into any of our guidance. But more likely than not, you'll see us begin to buy back some shares in 2015. From an ongoing basis, what is excess cash flow? I think you asked me to quantify it. If you think of our cash flow from operations of about $550 million this year, less CapEx that we've talked about, less the dividend, you can get to that $250 million to $300 million range on an ongoing basis, that could be a reasonable number. I'm not committing to that in any given year, but that's a way to frame it. The great thing is we generate a lot of cash, we got multiple ways to create value for shareholders, and we want to use all of those ways to create value for shareholders."

And overall, Matt, we had a positive trend in our Innerwear sales from Q1 to Q2, and driven by our basics business, which was up mid-single digits in the quarter. I feel real good about that. As Rich mentioned, the category in basics is growing. We're up 1 share point in the overall basics category, and our underwear business is up 2 points, and it really is driven by the things you touched on, our innovation, our strong brand position, we're gaining space and we went into back-to-school with very strong offers as we went in the important period. As we ended the first quarter, a major retailer had reduced their inventory, and at that point, we viewed it as temporary. As we've gone into the second quarter, we've learned that it is, in fact, more of a systemic change, and they intend to use their new replenishment systems to manage their inventory more tightly going forward to pursue inventory turns, and so we reflected that in our guidance going forward. But we feel really good about this business. Those kind of adjustments aside, we're continuing to gain space, we're gaining more space in the second half of the year, our share positions are growing and our innovations working. So we feel very good about the basics business and its impact on Innerwear. As we look at intimates, as Rich touched on as well, we gained share there as well in the core intimates business, but this category has accelerated its decline quite dramatically and declined at a high single-digit rate in the most recent 12-month period. So in addition, as we look at our business, in addition to the category weakness, our results in the quarter were impacted as we executed the last of our brand-transition strategy in department stores. We've said about focusing on fewer bigger brands, our important brands in the channel and folding smaller brands, like Barely There, into those brands. So in the quarter, we managed down the last of our retail inventories, and only at quarter end did we begin to pipe our new initiatives. As look forward to Q3 and Q4, we'll continue that piping of initiatives and expand space behind those. So there, again, we feel really go about what we're doing in the category. And in spite what the category itself might be doing, we're doing the things we can do. We're putting great innovation behind our brands and really putting something in place that the consumers will buy."

So when we ended last quarter, the retail inventories in basics, at one of those retailers we were talking about, was -- they were down about 3 or 4 weeks versus the prior year when we ended Q1. By the end of April, they were actually almost flat. I think they were down virtually flat. So it had come back strongly in April. By the time we ended the quarter, their retail inventories were down about 2 weeks versus where they were at last year at that same time. So we saw a little bit of a reversal in May and June. So that's all built into our numbers. So it's probably impacted our total shipment in basics, year-to-date, about $20 million. They, in May and June, communicated that they've had this new ordering system in place for a long period of time, and they feel they can now better optimize their turns, and so they're now talking it as a more structural change.

And that's what we're working hard to change this year, after going after our 4 strong brands.

So again, I think we're right on plan where we thought we'd be on synergies. When you look at the XA charges that we have been talking about. Let me take it from a couple different perspectives. One, for the full year, we went from $200 million to $240 million, had nothing to do with DBA. Our estimates on DBA, Maidenform, both are about the same. We now are including -- now that we have greater visibility on Knights Apparel and the integration plan that we think will be going in there, we're better able to estimate what those charges might be. That's about half of it and the other half came -- it comes from our decision in the second quarter to exit the China commercial business, which is about a $20 million charge, almost all of it was noncash. So that accounted for the $200 million to $240 million move that doesn't include the DBA or Maidenform."

It's low cost for a lot of products into U.S., even under the current structure. That's also a great option for places like into Europe and elsewhere in the world. So it's great no matter what happens with TPP. If TPP does, in fact, pass, it can actually add an added benefit by reducing or actually eliminating duties on some of our products. Those duties range from 6% to, at most, 17%. And so it will open it up a little bit. Those things will probably get phased-in over time, so it's not like it will be an immediate impact. But clearly, it will make Vietnam more competitive. And I'll be glad that we'll have almost a decade head start relative to a lot of our competition.

Continued margin improvement in our base business, along with contributions from our acquisitions, drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of ou",456,"Thank you, T.C. HanesBrands delivered another quarter of strong results. Continued margin improvement in our base business, along with contributions from our acquisitions, drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model. This marks another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, and with the performance of our base business, the remaining synergies from our acquisitions and the benefits from deploying future cash flows, we believe we have the right formula to deliver double-digit earnings growth for many years to come.
As the management team and as an organization, we have a simple mission: to generate superior long-term returns for our shareholders. We've been able to accomplish this in 2 ways. The first is by executing the right long-term business strategies, which includes investing in our manufacturing and deploying our margin-enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. And the second is by taking a disciplined return-centric approach to deploying our free cash flow. Our cash flow is a huge part of our value-creation formula, which is used to pay dividends, make acquisitions, as we've said before, at some point, to repurchase shares. Our dividend is in place, and we expect, over time, for it to grow in line with our earnings.
Over the last 24 months, we have completed 3 acquisitions for approximately $1.3 billion. Once we achieve full synergies, these are expected to annually contribute roughly $1.4 billion in sales, $230 million in operating profit and $0.48 in earnings per share. Acquisitions will clearly remain one of our core strategies going forward, given the breadth of our opportunities, our strong balance sheet and our proven integration processes.
With respect to share repurchases, the common perception is this is an either/or decision as it relates to acquisitions. However, at our current capital structure, targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of between 2 to 3x, coupled with our cash generation ability, we firmly believe that we can easily do both acquisitions and repurchases simultaneously. We have no need to accumulate significant cash on our balance sheet to do acquisitions nor do we strive to become investment grade. Therefore, our intent is to always use our excess cash to create the best long-term returns for our shareholders by using a mixture of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.
In summary, our overall business continues to track to our plan. We delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and our visibility into the second half gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth for the full year.
As we have shown over the past few years, our business model is designed to drive strong shareholder returns, and we remain dedicated to continuing this trend.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."
4212820,307414191,843797,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rich.

Continued execution of our core strategies combined to drive another quarter of strong performance. Our acquisition strategy contributed nicely to second quarter results, as both DBApparel and Knights Apparel delivered operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and integration strategies continued to bear fruit. Constant-currency revenue growth in our base business accelerated from first quarter levels, while base operating margins expanded another 180 basis points.
Before getting into our business results, let me begin with a brief update on our 2 integrations. With respect to DBA, we've already begun to insource some of their third-party manufacturing. Earlier this month, we produced the first DIM boxer briefs in our Vietnam facility. In terms of the overall integration, we've completed all but one of the required works council consultations, and we remain on track to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continue into 2017 and beyond, ultimately allowing us to reach our goal of EUR 100 million of operating profit.
Looking at Knights Apparel, we've completed our integration planning and have begun communicating to employees. We're on track to begin the integration actions by the end of this year, with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016. And we remain confident in our ability to double their operating profit to roughly $40 million within the next 2 to 3 years.
Turning to our segments. Innerwear sales declined 1% in the quarter as mid-single-digit growth of basics was offset by a decline in intimates. With respect to our basics business, in the quarter, we saw growth across underwear, socks and panties, driven by further share gains and strong performance from our innovation platforms. X-TEMP and ComfortBlend are now 15% of our basics business, which is up from 13%. And with the doubling of our X-TEMP's base this year, we expect this share to continue to grow. Innerwear's operating profit increased 7% over last year, and its operating margin expanded 190 basis points, driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from Maidenform and ongoing cost controls in SG&A.
Switching to our Activewear segment. Sales growth accelerated from first quarter levels driven by the acquisition of Knights Apparel as well as growth in our Champion and Gear for Sports businesses. As expected, Champion's sales in sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels grew significantly in the quarter, up 42% over last year due to the concentration of new program shipments in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. In these channels, Champion's sales, year-to-date, are in line with our plan, and we remain on track for another year of solid double-digit growth. Activewear's operating margins improved 130 basis points in the quarter as product mix, supply chain efficiencies and tight SG&A controls more than offset the expected dilution from Knights Apparel.
Turning to International. The year-over-year growth in the quarter was driven by our acquisition of DBA. Looking at our base International business, which excludes DBA and the Target Canada bankruptcy, sales in constant currency increased roughly 8% in the quarter. With respect to DBA, in spite of ongoing economic headwinds in Europe, the business performed well in the quarter with sales increasing in Spain and the U.K. We expanded our hosiery market share in Spain, France and Germany as well as our underwear market share in France. These results, combined with excellent cost controls and favorable supply chain performance, generated profits that were above plan for the quarter.
So to sum up, overall, we are right where we expected to be at this stage of the year, and we feel great about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are confident in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years as our strategies are working, our brands are resonating with consumers and our integrations are progressing on schedule.
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."
4212820,307414191,843797,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter. The fact that we were able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth on top of last year's",677,"Thanks, Gerald. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter. The fact that we were able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth on top of last year's 43% increase is a testament to the power and sustainability of our business model. In the second quarter, constant currency sales increased 15% over last year as our base business increased 1%, while acquisitions contributed approximately 14 points of growth. Operating profit increased 15% over last year, driven by contributions from DBA and Knights Apparel, tight SG&A management, efficiency gains in our supply chains and synergies from Maidenform.
Now let me give you some color on the strong margin performance in the quarter. Our gross profit margin improved 120 basis points to 39.1%. Acquisitions contributed roughly 60 basis points to the increase, as structurally lower margins in Knights Apparel were more than offset by structurally higher margins in DBA. The remainder of the increase was driven predominantly by supply chain efficiencies in our base business.
SG&A costs as a percentage of sales increased approximately 100 basis points to 21.6%, driven by our acquisitions. The result was a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 180 basis point improvement in our base business more than offset the expected margin percentage dilution from the addition of DBA and Knights Apparel.
Looking at the rest of our results. Interest and other expense of $30 million was roughly $8 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisitions as well as the additional costs associated with our debt refinancing. Our tax rate was 13% in the quarter, and earnings per share were $0.50. Cash flow from operations was right on plan, and we ended the quarter with $315 million in cash on our balance sheet.
Turning to guidance. I'll highlight some of the key pieces, but I'd also like to provide additional color as it relates to the individual quarters. You'll find our full guidance details in our press release and the associated commentary in our updated FAQ document.
We've refined our full year sales guidance to approximately $5.9 billion, with roughly $15 million to $20 million of the adjustment coming from further deterioration in key exchange rates. We slightly increased our operating profit guidance to a range of $855 million to $875 million. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $100 million, a full year tax rate of approximately 13% and an earnings per share range of $1.61 to $1.66.
Looking into the second half of the year. We have a significant amount of visibility. Our space is set, our pricing and promotional programs are in place and we've locked in our key input costs, including cotton. Based on our guidance, we're expecting second half operating profit to increase 10% to 14% over last year, which implies second half operating margins could increase roughly 20 to 60 basis points. However, due to certain timing shifts this year, we're expecting year-over-year operating profit growth for the individual quarters to be very uneven. We expect third quarter operating profit growth in the mid-single digits range, while we expect fourth quarter growth to be in the high teens to low 20% range. The timing shift is due to a concentration of promotional spending in the third quarter of this year, the timing around the realization of certain supply chain and integration savings as well as the benefit from lower cotton prices in the fourth quarter.
So in closing, our overall performance this year is tracking right to our plan, and this, coupled with our visibility into the second half, gives us confidence we can deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth for the year.
Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, the momentum in our overall business and the returns from deploying future cash flows, should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

One of the great things about our business is we generate a tremendous amount of cash on a consistent basis. It's a hallmark of the company. And our focus is to make sure we're using that cash to create great returns for you, our shareholders. We firmly believe that, that will be best done with a mixture of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. And we've been doing a lot of the first 2 acquisitions as well as instituting and increasing a dividend over time. And it's probably now becoming time for share repurchases to become a definitive part of that mix. When you step back, I want to make sure that nobody hears this as saying we're doing this instead of acquisitions. That's really not the case. We can do both. In fact, when we look at our excess cash-generation ability today and over the next 12 to 18 months, we could easily do $1.5 billion of acquisitions and buy back stock consistently over that period of time. You could actually model out over the next couple of years, and you can find us being able to do billions of dollars of acquisitions and being able to buy back shares. In terms of the near-term strategy. More likely than not, you'll see us begin to execute a share buyback in 2015. While we have an authorization in place, we don't have any definitive plans. And Rick and I need to do a little bit more analysis on how much we would do and how we might start that program. Therefore, none of this is built into any of our guidance. But more likely than not, you'll see us begin to buy back some shares in 2015. From an ongoing basis, what is excess cash flow? I think you asked me to quantify it. If you think of our cash flow from operations of about $550 million this year, less CapEx that we've talked about, less the dividends, you get to that $250 million to $300 million range on an ongoing basis, that could be a reasonable number. I'm not committing to that in any given year, but that's a way to frame it. The great thing is we generate a lot of cash, we've got multiple ways to create value for shareholders, and we want to use all of those ways to create value for shareholders."

And overall, Matt, we had a positive trend in our Innerwear sales from Q1 to Q2, and driven by our basics business, which was up mid-single digits in the quarter. I feel real good about that. As Rich mentioned, the category in basics is growing. We're up 1 share point in the overall basics category, and our underwear business is up 2 points, and it really is driven by the things you touched on, our innovation, our strong brand position. We're gaining space, and we went into back-to-school with very strong offers as we went into that important period. As we ended the first quarter, a major retailer had reduced their inventory, and at that point, we viewed it as temporary. As we've gone into the second quarter, we've learned that it is, in fact, more of a systemic change, and they intend to use their new replenishment systems to manage their inventory more tightly going forward to pursue inventory turns, and so we reflected that in our guidance going forward. But we feel really good about this business. Those kind of adjustments aside, we're continuing to gain space. We'll gain more space in the second half of the year. Our share positions are growing and our innovations working. So we feel very good about the basics business and its impact on Innerwear. As we look at intimates, as Rich touched on as well, we gained share there as well in the core intimates business, but this category has accelerated its decline quite dramatically and declined at a high single-digit rate in the most recent 12-month period. So in addition, as we look at our business, in addition to the category weakness, our results in the quarter were impacted as we executed the last of our brand-transition strategy in department stores. We set about focusing on fewer bigger brands, our important brands in the channel and folding smaller brands, like Barely There, into those brands. So in the quarter, we managed down the last of our retail inventories, and only at quarter end did we begin to pipe our new initiatives. As look forward to Q3 and Q4, we'll continue that piping of initiatives and expand space behind those. So there, again, we feel really go about what we're doing in the category. And in spite what the category itself might be doing, we're doing the things we can do. We're putting great innovation behind our brands and really putting something in place that the consumers will buy."

We talked about the overall category actually flipping negative, and it's been like that now for a little bit of time. And as Gerald said, that's across all channels: specialty, department stores, mass and everywhere. That's not going to last forever. At the end of the day, usages in that category haven't changed, so there's normal ebbs and flows. I really do think that when you get outside of specialty and you look in department stores, mass and mid-tier, one of the big issues has been there's way too many brands and way too many little ideas, and there's not big innovation that can help drive that category. And that's what we're working hard to change this year, after going after our 4 strong brands with very distinct positioning. We can drive big platform innovation behind those, just like we have in the underwear and the socks category with things like X-TEMP and so on and so forth. And that's the thinking that can get that category to start turning around. We need to get in that position and then act like a leader, and we can actually help change the category trends."

We now are including -- now that we have greater visibility on Knights Apparel and the integration plan that we think will be going in there, we're better able to estimate what those charges might be.

So we've got a strong head start on a lot of other companies in terms of being comfortable in operating at Vietnam. It's a great place to operate. It's low cost for a lot of products into the U.S., even under the current structure. And it's also a great option for places like into Europe and elsewhere in the world. So it's great no matter what happens with TPP. If TPP does, in fact, pass, it can actually add an added benefit by reducing or actually eliminating duties on some of our products. Those duties range from 6% to, at most, 17%. And so it will open it up a little bit. Those things will probably get phased-in over time, so it's not like it will be an immediate impact. But clearly, it will make Vietnam more competitive. And I'll be glad that we'll have almost a decade head start relative to a lot of our competition. So it puts us in a good competitive position from a long-term perspective."

HanesBrands delivered another quarter of strong results. Continued margin improvement in our base business, along with contributions from our acquisitions, drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model. This marks another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, and with the performance of our base business, the remaining synergies from our acquisitions and the benefits from deploying future cash flows, we believe we have the right formula to deliver double-digit earnings growth for many years to come.
As the management team and as an organization, we have a simple mission: to generate superior long-term returns for our shareholders. We've been able to accomplish this in 2 ways. The first is by executing the right long-term business strategies, which includes investing in our manufacturing and deploying our margin-enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. And the second is by taking a disciplined return-centric approach to deploying our free cash flow. Our cash flow is a huge part of our value-creation formula, which is used to pay dividends, make acquisitions, as we've said before, at some point, to repurchase shares. Our dividend is in place, and we expect, over time, for it to grow in line with our earnings.
Over the last 24 months, we have completed 3 acquisitions for approximately $1.3 billion. Once we achieve full synergies, these are expected to annually contribute roughly $1.4 billion in sales, $230 million in operating profit and $0.48 in earnings per share. Acquisitions will clearly remain one of our core strategies going forward, given the breadth of our opportunities, our strong balance sheet and our proven integration processes.
With respect to share repurchases, the common perception is this is an either/or decision as it relates to acquisitions. However, at our current capital structure, targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of between 2 to 3x, coupled with our cash generation ability, we firmly believe that we can easily do both acquisitions and repurchases simultaneously. We have no need to accumulate significant cash on our balance sheet to do acquisitions nor do we strive to become investment grade. Therefore, our intent is to always use our excess cash to create the best long-term returns for our shareholders by using a mixture of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.
In summary, our overall business continues to track to our plan. We delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and our visibility into the second half gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth for the full year.
As we have shown over the past few years, our business model is designed to drive strong shareholder returns, and we remain dedicated to continuing this trend.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

Continued execution of our core strategies combined to drive another quarter of strong performance. Our acquisition strategy contributed nicely to second quarter results, as both DBApparel and Knights Apparel delivered operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and integration strategies continued to bear fruit. Constant-currency revenue growth in our base business accelerated from first quarter levels, while base operating margins expanded another 180 basis points.
Before getting into our business results, let me begin with a brief update on our 2 integrations. With respect to DBA, we've already begun to insource some of their third-party manufacturing. Earlier this month, we produced the first DIM boxer briefs in our Vietnam facility. In terms of the overall integration, we've completed all but one of the required works council consultations, and we remain on track to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continue into 2017 and beyond, ultimately allowing us to reach our goal of EUR 100 million of operating profit.
Looking at Knights Apparel, we've completed our integration planning and have begun communicating to employees. We're on track to begin the integration actions by the end of this year, with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016. And we remain confident in our ability to double their operating profit to roughly $40 million within the next 2 to 3 years.
Turning to our segments. Innerwear sales declined 1% in the quarter as mid-single-digit growth of basics was offset by a decline in intimates. With respect to our basics business, in the quarter, we saw growth across underwear, socks and panties, driven by further share gains and strong performance from our innovation platforms. X-TEMP and ComfortBlend are now 15% of our basics business, which is up from 13%. And with the doubling of our X-TEMP's base this year, we expect this share to continue to grow. Innerwear's operating profit increased 7% over last year, and its operating margin expanded 190 basis points, driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from Maidenform and ongoing cost controls in SG&A.
Switching to our Activewear segment. Sales growth accelerated from first quarter levels driven by the acquisition of Knights Apparel as well as growth in our Champion and Gear for Sports businesses. As expected, Champion's sales in sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels grew significantly in the quarter, up 42% over last year due to the concentration of new program shipments in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. In these channels, Champion's sales, year-to-date, are in line with our plan, and we remain on track for another year of solid double-digit growth. Activewear's operating margins improved 130 basis points in the quarter as product mix, supply chain efficiencies and tight SG&A controls more than offset the expected dilution from Knights Apparel.
Turning to International. The year-over-year growth in the quarter was driven by our acquisition of DBA. Looking at our base International business, which excludes DBA and the Target Canada bankruptcy, sales in constant currency increased roughly 8% in the quarter. With respect to DBA, in spite of ongoing economic headwinds in Europe, the business performed well in the quarter with sales increasing in Spain and the U.K. We expanded our hosiery market share in Spain, France and Germany as well as our underwear market share in France. These results, combined with excellent cost controls and favorable supply chain performance, generated profits that were above plan for the quarter.
So to sum up, overall, we are right where we expected to be at this stage of the year, and we feel great about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are confident in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years as our strategies are working, our brands are resonating with consumers and our integrations are progressing on schedule.
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter. The fact that we were able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth on top of last year's",677,"Thanks, Gerald. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter. The fact that we were able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth on top of last year's 43% increase is a testament to the power and sustainability of our business model. In the second quarter, constant currency sales increased 15% over last year as our base business increased 1%, while acquisitions contributed approximately 14 points of growth. Operating profit increased 15% over last year, driven by contributions from DBA and Knights Apparel, tight SG&A management, efficiency gains in our supply chains and synergies from Maidenform.
Now let me give you some color on the strong margin performance in the quarter. Our gross profit margin improved 120 basis points to 39.1%. Acquisitions contributed roughly 60 basis points to the increase, as structurally lower margins in Knights Apparel were more than offset by structurally higher margins in DBA. The remainder of the increase was driven predominantly by supply chain efficiencies in our base business.
SG&A costs as a percentage of sales increased approximately 100 basis points to 21.6%, driven by our acquisitions. The result was a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 180 basis point improvement in our base business more than offset the expected margin percentage dilution from the addition of DBA and Knights Apparel.
Looking at the rest of our results. Interest and other expense of $30 million was roughly $8 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisitions as well as the additional costs associated with our debt refinancing. Our tax rate was 13% in the quarter, and earnings per share were $0.50. Cash flow from operations was right on plan, and we ended the quarter with $315 million in cash on our balance sheet.
Turning to guidance. I'll highlight some of the key pieces, but I'd also like to provide additional color as it relates to the individual quarters. You'll find our full guidance details in our press release and the associated commentary in our updated FAQ document.
We've refined our full year sales guidance to approximately $5.9 billion, with roughly $15 million to $20 million of the adjustment coming from further deterioration in key exchange rates. We slightly increased our operating profit guidance to a range of $855 million to $875 million. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $100 million, a full year tax rate of approximately 13% and an earnings per share range of $1.61 to $1.66.
Looking into the second half of the year. We have a significant amount of visibility. Our space is set, our pricing and promotional programs are in place and we've locked in our key input costs, including cotton. Based on our guidance, we're expecting second half operating profit to increase 10% to 14% over last year, which implies second half operating margins could increase roughly 20 to 60 basis points. However, due to certain timing shifts this year, we're expecting year-over-year operating profit growth for the individual quarters to be very uneven. We expect third quarter operating profit growth in the mid-single digits range, while we expect fourth quarter growth to be in the high teens to low 20% range. The timing shift is due to a concentration of promotional spending in the third quarter of this year, the timing around the realization of certain supply chain and integration savings as well as the benefit from lower cotton prices in the fourth quarter.
So in closing, our overall performance this year is tracking right to our plan, and this, coupled with our visibility into the second half, gives us confidence we can deliver mid- to high teens EPS growth for the year.
Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, the momentum in our overall business and the returns from deploying future cash flows, should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

One of the great things about our business is we generate a tremendous amount of cash on a consistent basis. It's a hallmark of the company. And our focus is to make sure we're using that cash to create great returns for you, our shareholders. We firmly believe that, that will be best done with a mixture of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. And we've been doing a lot of the first 2 acquisitions as well as instituting and increasing a dividend over time. And it's probably now becoming time for share repurchases to become a definitive part of that mix. When you step back, I want to make sure that nobody hears this as saying we're doing this instead of acquisitions. That's really not the case. We can do both. In fact, when we look at our excess cash-generation ability today and over the next 12 to 18 months, we could easily do $1.5 billion of acquisitions and buy back stock consistently over that period of time. You could actually model out over the next couple of years, and you can find us being able to do billions of dollars of acquisitions and being able to buy back shares. In terms of the near-term strategy. More likely than not, you'll see us begin to execute a share buyback in 2015. While we have an authorization in place, we don't have any definitive plans. And Rick and I need to do a little bit more analysis on how much we would do and how we might start that program. Therefore, none of this is built into any of our guidance. But more likely than not, you'll see us begin to buy back some shares in 2015. From an ongoing basis, what is excess cash flow? I think you asked me to quantify it. If you think of our cash flow from operations of about $550 million this year, less CapEx that we've talked about, less the dividends, you get to that $250 million to $300 million range on an ongoing basis, that could be a reasonable number. I'm not committing to that in any given year, but that's a way to frame it. The great thing is we generate a lot of cash, we've got multiple ways to create value for shareholders, and we want to use all of those ways to create value for shareholders."

And overall, Matt, we had a positive trend in our Innerwear sales from Q1 to Q2, and driven by our basics business, which was up mid-single digits in the quarter. I feel real good about that. As Rich mentioned, the category in basics is growing. We're up 1 share point in the overall basics category, and our underwear business is up 2 points, and it really is driven by the things you touched on, our innovation, our strong brand position. We're gaining space, and we went into back-to-school with very strong offers as we went into that important period. As we ended the first quarter, a major retailer had reduced their inventory, and at that point, we viewed it as temporary. As we've gone into the second quarter, we've learned that it is, in fact, more of a systemic change, and they intend to use their new replenishment systems to manage their inventory more tightly going forward to pursue inventory turns, and so we reflected that in our guidance going forward. But we feel really good about this business. Those kind of adjustments aside, we're continuing to gain space. We'll gain more space in the second half of the year. Our share positions are growing and our innovations working. So we feel very good about the basics business and its impact on Innerwear. As we look at intimates, as Rich touched on as well, we gained share there as well in the core intimates business, but this category has accelerated its decline quite dramatically and declined at a high single-digit rate in the most recent 12-month period. So in addition, as we look at our business, in addition to the category weakness, our results in the quarter were impacted as we executed the last of our brand-transition strategy in department stores. We set about focusing on fewer bigger brands, our important brands in the channel and folding smaller brands, like Barely There, into those brands. So in the quarter, we managed down the last of our retail inventories, and only at quarter end did we begin to pipe our new initiatives. As look forward to Q3 and Q4, we'll continue that piping of initiatives and expand space behind those. So there, again, we feel really go about what we're doing in the category. And in spite what the category itself might be doing, we're doing the things we can do. We're putting great innovation behind our brands and really putting something in place that the consumers will buy."

So when we ended last quarter, the retail inventories in basics, at one of those retailers we were talking about, was -- they were down about 3 or 4 weeks versus the prior year when we ended Q1. By the end of April, they were actually almost flat. I think they were down virtually flat. So it had come back strongly in April. By the time we ended the quarter, their retail inventories were down about 2 weeks versus where they were at last year at that same time. So we saw a little bit of a reversal in May and June. So that's all built into our numbers. So it's probably impacted our total shipment in basics, year-to-date, about $20 million. They, in May and June, communicated that they've had this new ordering system in place for a long period of time, and they feel they can now better optimize their turns, and so they're now talking about it as a more structural change. That was communicated to us. Gerald, I'll let you comment on it because you had some of the conversations with them.

And that's the thinking that can get that category to start turning around. We need to get in that position and then act like a leader, and we can actually help change the category trends."

At the end of the day, you hit it spot on, is that we're going to have greater synergies than anybody else and, therefore, we've got the capability of just creating a huge amount of value. And so for some of these deals, you may see private equity be interested, but then, when there's strategics around, they know that they're going to be a little bit sort of behind the 8 ball, if you will, trying to go after a property for that -- like that. And then at the end of the day, there's not even that many big companies, apparel companies, that have the kind of supply chain and capabilities that we do now across multiple continents. So there's not a lot of the same kind of competitive dynamics that you might see in some other industries or some -- with some other properties and other people pursuing them. We feel really good about our ability to integrate acquisitions, and we're going to continue focusing on them as a great way to create value."

Our estimates on DBA, Maidenform, both are about the same. We now are including -- now that we have greater visibility on Knights Apparel and the integration plan that we think will be going in there, we're better able to estimate what those charges might be. That's about half of it, and the other half came -- it comes from our decision in the second quarter to exit the China commercial business, which is about a $20 million charge, almost all of it was noncash.

It's low cost for a lot of products into the U.S., even under the current structure. And it's also a great option for places like into Europe and elsewhere in the world. So it's great no matter what happens with TPP. If TPP does, in fact, pass, it can actually add an added benefit by reducing or actually eliminating duties on some of our products. Those duties range from 6% to, at most, 17%. And so it will open it up a little bit. Those things will probably get phased-in over time, so it's not like it will be an immediate impact.

Earnings per share increased 16% driven by strong core revenue growth, continued market expansion and contributions from acquisitions. We bought back stock as we entered the next phase of our cash deployment strategy. And we took off our operating profit guidance for the third time this year due to continued margin strength with our business. 
Our strong third quarter performance is simply a continuation of what we have been doing all year, driving great results for our shareholders. 
We generated EPS growth of 16% in each of the first 3 quarters. And the midpoint of our guidance implies fourth quarter EPS growth of 25%, further demonstrating that we have the right set of strategies to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. 
Looking at our results, we delivered on everything in the quarter that we told you we would. Revenue growth was strong, even with the impact from anticipated retail inventory adjustments, our shipments rebounded in the quarter. 
Core revenue increased 3% in constant currency and is up nearly 1.5% year-to-date. Our Champion business continued its strong performance with 33% sales growth in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels. Our intimates business, which we said would churn in the quarter, increased 9% over last year. And even our basics business were sold the full impact of the inventory destocking delivered strong results with sales up slightly in the quarter. 
We also continued to see meaningful contributions from our acquisition strategy. Our Maidenform acquisition is still paying dividend with the additional synergies contributing to core margin expansion in the quarter while DBA and Knights Apparel continue to add nicely to earnings. 
Our cash deployment strategy entered a new phase in the quarter as we spent over $300 million buying back stock. The repurchases added about $0.01 to EPS in the quarter and are expected to about $0.01 to EPS in each of the 3 quarters. 
In terms of guidance. Based on the current momentum in our business, we are once again raising our operating profit and EPS outlook for the year. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we have increased our operating profit guidance $40 million and our EPS guidance $0.07. 
That's the great thing about our business model. We have a lot of ways to drive strong results in a wide variety of situations. 
In summary, we feel great about our business. We're on track to deliver 17% to 18% EPS growth for the year, once again demonstrating that our strategies to create long-term shareholder value are working extremely well.

And while it may sound like a broken record,  it sure is a great song. The strong third quarter results position us to the end of the year above the high end of our original EPS outlook. 
Our performance year-to-date underscores 2 core facets of our company. The first, our business model is well tested and it has been able to consistently deliver strong returns for our shareholders in an environment. And the second, we are aligned across our organization to execute on our long-term strategies. 
Let me start with an update on DBApparel and Knights Apparel. We are thrilled with how these acquisitions are unfolding. Beyond their sizable synergy benefits, these acquisitions also provide us with significant future growth opportunities. And with the strong management teams we gained through these acquisitions, we are confident DBA and Knights can create value for shareholders for many years. 
Looking at DBA, the business continues to perform well. Sales and profits were above plan for the quarter, and we continue to gain market share in key product categories within our core countries. We've already begun implementing some of our supply chain integration activities. These reps fell outside of the scope of the works council process, such as renegotiating vendor contracts, improving efficiency and quality, as well as supplementing expense control programs. 
In terms of the works council, I'm pleased to announce that we completed the final consultation in September. 
With the integration now in full swing, we expect the synergy benefits to ramp in 2016. Longer term, as we integrate their operations, we believe DBA provides us with a great platform for future acquisitions in Europe. 
Turning to Knights Apparel, their business continues to perform extremely well. Sales are tracking to our full year plan while operating profit is coming in slightly ahead of plan. 
As we began the integration process, we reinforced our view that the combination of Gear for Sports and Knights Apparel provides us significant long-term growth opportunity. 
The integration of these businesses will give us the infrastructure, the capability and the systems to deliver to a broad set of retail customers across the entire graphic apparel market. 
And our goal over time is to expand from the $3 billion license collegian apparel market to the broader $20 billion graphic apparel market. 
Switching to our segments. Innerwear sales increased 3% in the quarter, a strong result given the roughly $20 million retail inventory adjustment in basics. The real highlight was our intimates business, which increased 9% in the quarter, driven by our Hanes and Bali bras. With our brand consolidation strategy mainly behind us, you're able to see the full power of our new initiatives. We began advertising behind the ComfortFlex Fit platform in both Hanes and Bali during the quarter and the response were tremendous. 
Our Hanes Ultimate and Hanes Platinum collections, which is sold and mid-tier department stores are exceeding our initial expectations. 
Shifting to Activewear. We are driving increased Champion distribution as our brand strategy continues to resonate with both consumers and retailers. This was evident in our third quarter results as Champion sales in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels increased 33% over last year. 
Our Activewear business also continues to benefit from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as margins increased 230 basis points over last year to a record 18.8%. 
And turning to our core International business, which excludes DBA and the impact of a retailer exit from Canada, sales in constant currency increased 14% over last year. 
So to sum up, our business continues to perform extremely well. Our categories are healthy, our brands are strong and our strategies continued to deliver double-digit EPS growth. 
And we believe this is something you'll see for many years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

And reflecting back, I'm amazed with how much our business has evolved. 
Over this time, we've added approximately $1.4 billion of revenue in a more much more diversified manner. Our International business was roughly doubled and is now about 20% of our sales. Our largest customer accounts for about 20% of our revenue today, down from a peak of 28%. And we now have limited exposure to low-margin commodity product categories. 
Over that same timeframe, we've also significantly increased profitability as operating profit has nearly doubled while margins have increased approximately 500 basis points. And we strengthened our balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has decreased 4x to around 2.5x today, which is way to roughly 2x by the end of the year. And we've deployed over $2 billion in cash to create shareholder value through dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. 
Our strong performance over the past several years has been driven by a set of strategies that is designed to leverage our brand expertise. Our company owned supply-chain and our corporate culture is centered with continuous improvement. 
We had strategies to drive growth organically as well as strategies to drive growth by wisely investing our cash flow. 
And going forward, we're confident that these can continue to generate strong returns as they are both scalable and repeatable. 
Now let me take you through some of the highlights from the quarter as they relate to our strategies. 
Shipments rebounded in the quarter as we indicated we would. Even with the impact from the retail inventory adjustments, our core revenue increased 3% in constant currency and it was up nearly 1.5 year-to-date. This is a perfect example of our new remind investors not to overreact to any single quarter because while our business may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, over time, our shipments tend to equalize sell-through due to the replenishment nature of our categories. 
Core operating margins continue to expand of approximately 90 basis points over the last year, driven by additional Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and the continued leverage of our core SG&A. 
Turning to our cash deployment strategies. Acquisitions continue to add to our earnings growth. DBA and Knights Apparel generated roughly $29 million in operating profit in the quarter. We also begun repurchasing stock in the quarter, spending approximately $311 million to buy back roughly 10.7 million shares, which added just under $0.01 to third quarter EPS. 
Turning to guidance. We raised our operating profit guidance to a range of $880 million to $890 million from our prior range of $855 million to $875 million to reflect the strong margin performance in our business. 
We also raised our EPS guidance to a range of $1.66 to $1.68 from our previous range of $1.61 to $1.66 due to our increased profit guidance and contributions from share repurchases. 
We also expect interest and other expense to increase roughly $115 million, partially offset by slower slightly lower tax rate of approximately 12%. 
I should also mention that the IRS just completed a substantial 2-year audit, and the results of which validates the sustainability of our tax strategies and further reinforce the benefits of our company-owned global supply chain. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Our guidance implies a little over $1.5 billion of sales, which reflects about $20 million of seasonal programs that shift in Q3 rather than earlier than initially expected. 
When you adjust for last year's 53rd week, our guidance implies core revenue growth in constant currency of about 3% for both the fourth quarter and second half. 
Fourth quarter operating profit is estimated to be $231 million to $241 million, implying an operating margin range of roughly 15% to 16% for both the fourth quarter and the second half. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, this would represent about 130 basis point improvement over last year's second half margins. 
And fourth quarter EPS is estimated to be a range of $0.44 to $0.46, which includes about $0.01 from share repurchases. 
So in summary, our business strategies continued to deliver great results, and this is reflected in our increased guidance for the year. And we're now on pace to deliver 17% to 18% EPS growth this year. 
And as we look forward, our growth strategies position us to continue to drive solid double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

We had another great quarter. Earnings per share increased 16%, driven by strong core revenue growth, continued margin expansion and contributions from acquisitions. We bought back stock as we entered the next phase of our cash deployment strategy. And we took up our operating profit guidance for the third time this year due to the continued margin strength with our business. Our strong third quarter performance is simply a continuation of what we have been doing all year, driving great results for our shareholders. 
We generated EPS growth of 16% in each of the first 3 quarters. And the midpoint of our guidance implies fourth quarter EPS growth of 25%, further demonstrating that we have the right set of strategies to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. 
Looking at our results, we delivered on everything in the quarter that we told you we would. Revenue growth was strong, even with the impact from anticipated retail inventory adjustments, our shipments rebounded in the quarter. Core revenue increased 3% in constant currency and is up nearly 1.5% year-to-date. Our Champion business continued its strong performance with 33% sales growth in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels. Our intimates business, which we said would churn in the quarter, increased 9% over last year. And even our basics business, which sold the full impact of the inventory destocking, delivered strong results with sales up slightly in the quarter. 
We also continued to see meaningful contributions from our acquisition strategy. Our Maidenform acquisition is still paying dividends with the additional synergies contributing to core margin expansion in the quarter, while DBA and Knights Apparel continued to add nicely to earnings. 
Our cash deployment strategy entered a new phase in the quarter as we spent over $300 million buying back stock. The repurchases added about $0.01 to EPS in the quarter and are expected to about $0.01 to EPS in each of the next 3 quarters. 
In terms of guidance. Based on the current momentum in our business, we are once again raising our operating profit and EPS outlook for the year. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we have increased our operating profit guidance $40 million and our EPS guidance $0.07. That's the great thing about our business model. We have a lot of ways to drive strong results in a wide variety of situations. 
In summary, we feel great about our business. We're on track to deliver 17% to 18% EPS growth for the year, once again demonstrating that our strategies to create long-term shareholder value are working extremely well. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

You've heard us use that phrase many, many times over the past several years. And while it may sound like a broken record, it sure is a great song.

We delivered another quarter of great results. You've heard us use that phrase many, many times over the past several years. And while it may sound like a broken record, it sure is a great song. The strong third quarter results position us to the end of the year above the high end of our original EPS outlook. 
Our performance year-to-date underscores 2 core facets of our company. The first, our business model is well tested, and it has been able to consistently deliver strong returns for our shareholders in an environment. And the second, we are aligned across our organization to execute on our long-term strategies. 
Let me start with an update on DBApparel and Knights Apparel. We are thrilled with how these acquisitions are unfolding. Beyond their sizable synergy benefits, these acquisitions also provide us with significant future growth opportunities. And with the strong management teams we gained through these acquisitions, we are confident DBA and Knights can create value for shareholders for many years. 
Looking at DBA, the business continues to perform well. Sales and profits were above plan for the quarter as we continue to gain market share in key product categories within our core countries. We have already begun implementing some of our supply chain integration activities. These were actions that fell outside of the scope of the works council process, such as renegotiating vendor contracts, improving efficiency and quality as well as implementing expense control programs. In terms of the works council, I am pleased to announce that we completed the final consultation in September. 
With the integration now in full swing, we expect the synergy benefits to ramp in 2016. Longer term, as we integrate their operations, we believe DBA provides us with a great platform for future acquisitions in Europe. 
Turning to Knights Apparel, their business continues to perform extremely well. Sales are tracking to our full year plan while operating profit is coming in slightly ahead of plan. As we began the integration process, it reinforced our view that the combination of Gear for Sports and Knights Apparel provides us with significant long-term growth opportunities. The integration of these businesses will give us the infrastructure, the capability and the systems to deliver to a broad set of retail customers across the entire graphic apparel market. And our goal over time is to expand from the $3 billion licensed collegian apparel market to the broader $20 billion graphic apparel market. 
Switching to our segments. Innerwear sales increased 3% in the quarter, a strong result given the roughly $20 million retail inventory adjustment in basics. The real highlight was our intimates business, which increased 9% in the quarter, driven by our Hanes and Bali bras. With our brand consolidation strategy mainly behind us, we're able to see the full power of our new initiatives. We began advertising behind the ComfortFlex Fit platform in both Hanes and Bali during the quarter, and the response has been tremendous. Our Hanes Ultimate and Hanes Platinum collections, which are sold in mid-tier and department stores, are exceeding our initial expectations. 
Shifting to Activewear. We are driving increased Champion distribution as our brand strategy continues to resonate with both consumers and retailers. This was evident in our third quarter results as Champion sales in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels increased 33% over last year. Our Activewear business also continues to benefit from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as margins increased 230 basis points over last year to a record 18.8%. 
And turning to our core International business, which excludes DBA and the impact of a retailer exit from Canada, sales in constant currency increased 14% over last year. 
So to sum up, our business continues to perform extremely well. Our categories are healthy, our brands are strong and our strategies continue to deliver double-digit EPS growth. And we believe this is something you'll see for many years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."
4212820,314855915,884642,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald.It was 4 years ago this month that I was on my first HanesBrands earnings call as CFO.

It was 4 years ago this month that I was on my first HanesBrands earnings call as CFO. And reflecting back, I'm amazed with how much our business has evolved. Over this time, we've added approximately $1.4 billion of revenue in a more much more diversified manner. Our International business has roughly doubled and is now about 20% of our sales. Our largest customer accounts for about 20% of our revenue today, down from a peak of 28%. And we now have limited exposure to low-margin commodity product categories. 
Over that same timeframe, we've also significantly increased profitability as operating profit has nearly doubled, while margins have increased approximately 500 basis points. And we strengthened our balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has decreased 4x to around 2.5x today, and is on its way to roughly 2x by the end of the year. And we've deployed over $2 billion in cash to create shareholder value through dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. 
Our strong performance over the past several years has been driven by a set of strategies that are designed to leverage our brand expertise. Our company-owned supply-chain and the corporate culture is centered on continuous improvement. We have strategies to drive growth organically as well as strategies to drive growth by wisely investing our cash flow. And going forward, we're confident that these can continue to generate strong returns as they are both scalable and repeatable. 
Now let me take you through some of the highlights from the quarter as they relate to our strategies. Shipments rebounded in the quarter as we indicated they would. Even with the impact from the retail inventory adjustment, our core revenue increased 3% in constant currency and it was up nearly 1.5% year-to-date. This is a perfect example of why we remind investors not to overreact to any single quarter. Because while our business may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, over time, our shipments tend to equal our sell-through due to the replenishment nature of our categories. Core operating margins continue to expand, up approximately 90 basis points over the last year, driven by additional Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and the continued leverage of our core SG&A. 
Turning to our cash deployment strategies. Acquisitions continue to add to our earnings growth. DBA and Knights Apparel generated roughly $29 million in operating profit in the quarter. We also began repurchasing stock in the quarter, spending approximately $311 million to buy back roughly 10.7 million shares, which added just under $0.01 to third quarter EPS. 
Turning to guidance. We raised our operating profit guidance to a range of $880 million to $890 million from our prior range of $855 million to $875 million to reflect the strong margin performance in our business. We also raised our EPS guidance to a range of $1.66 to $1.68 from our previous range of $1.61 to $1.66 due to our increased profit guidance and contributions from share repurchases. We also expect interest and other expense to increase to roughly $115 million, partially offset by a slightly lower tax rate of approximately 12%. 
I should also mention that the IRS just completed a substantial 2-year audit. The results of which validate the sustainability of our tax strategies and further reinforce the benefits of our company-owned global supply chain. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Our guidance implies a little over $1.5 billion of sales, which reflects about $20 million of seasonal programs that shift in Q3 rather than earlier than initially expected. When you adjust for last year's 53rd week, our guidance implies core revenue growth in constant currency of about 3% for both the fourth quarter and the second half. Fourth quarter operating profit is estimated to be $231 million to $241 million, implying an operating margin range of roughly 15% to 16% for both the fourth quarter and the second half. At the midpoint of our guidance, this would represent about a 130-basis-point improvement over last year's second half margins. And fourth quarter EPS is estimated to be in a range of $0.44 to $0.46, which includes about $0.01 from share repurchases. 
So in summary, our business strategies continue to deliver great results, and this is reflected in our increased guidance for the year. And we're now on pace to deliver 17% to 18% EPS growth this year. And as we look forward, our growth strategies position us to continue to drive solid double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

We had another great quarter. Earnings per share increased 16%, driven by strong core revenue growth, continued margin expansion and contributions from acquisitions. We bought back stock as we entered the next phase of our cash deployment strategy. And we took up our operating profit guidance for the third time this year due to the continued margin strength within our business. Our strong third quarter performance is simply a continuation of what we have been doing all year: driving great results for our shareholders. 
We generated EPS growth of 16% in each of the first 3 quarters. And the midpoint of our guidance implies fourth quarter EPS growth of 25%, further demonstrating that we have the right set of strategies to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. 
Looking at our results, we delivered on everything in the quarter that we told you we would. Revenue growth was strong. Even with the impact from anticipated retail inventory adjustments, our shipments rebounded in the quarter. Core revenue increased 3% in constant currency and is up nearly 1.5% year-to-date. Our Champion business continued its strong performance with 33% sales growth in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels. Our intimates business, which we said would turn in the quarter, increased 9% over last year. And even our basics business, which saw the full impact of the inventory destocking, delivered strong results with sales up slightly in the quarter. 
We also continued to see meaningful contributions from our acquisition strategy. Our Maidenform acquisition is still paying dividends, with the additional synergies contributing to core margin expansion in the quarter, while DBA and Knights Apparel continued to add nicely to earnings. 
Our cash deployment strategy entered a new phase in the quarter as we spent over $300 million buying back stock. The repurchases added about $0.01 to EPS in the quarter and are expected to add about $0.01 to EPS in each of the next 3 quarters. 
In terms of guidance. Based on the current momentum in our business, we are once again raising our operating profit and EPS outlook for the year. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we have increased our operating profit guidance $40 million and our EPS guidance $0.07. That's the great thing about our business model. We have a lot of ways to drive strong results in a wide variety of situations. 
In summary, we feel great about our business. We're on track to deliver 17% to 18% EPS growth for the year, once again demonstrating that our strategies to create long-term shareholder value are working extremely well. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald."

We delivered another quarter of great results. You've heard us use that phrase many, many times over the past several years. And while it may sound like a broken record, it sure is a great song. The strong third quarter results position us to end the year above the high end of our original EPS outlook. 
Our performance year-to-date underscores 2 core facets of our company. The first, our business model is well tested, and it has been able to consistently deliver strong returns for our shareholders in any environment. And the second, we are aligned across our organization to execute on our long-term strategies. 
Let me start with an update on DBApparel and Knights Apparel. We are thrilled with how these acquisitions are unfolding. Beyond their sizable synergy benefits, these acquisitions also provide us with significant future growth opportunities. And with the strong management teams we gained through these acquisitions, we are confident DBA and Knights can create value for shareholders for many years. 
Looking at DBA, the business continues to perform well. Sales and profits were above plan for the quarter as we continue to gain market share in key product categories within our core countries. We have already begun implementing some of our supply chain integration activities. These were actions that fell outside of the scope of the works council process, such as renegotiating vendor contracts, improving efficiency and quality, as well as implementing expense control programs. In terms of the works council, I am pleased to announce that we completed the final consultation in September. 
With the integration now in full swing, we expect the synergy benefits to ramp in 2016. Longer term, as we integrate their operations, we believe DBA provides us with a great platform for future acquisitions in Europe. 
Turning to Knights Apparel, their business continues to perform extremely well. Sales are tracking to our full year plan, while operating profit is coming in slightly ahead of plan. As we began the integration process, it reinforced our view that the combination of Gear for Sports and Knights Apparel provides us with significant long-term growth opportunities. The integration of these businesses will give us the infrastructure, the capability and the systems to deliver to a broad set of retail customers across the entire graphic apparel market. And our goal over time is to expand from the $3 billion licensed collegian apparel market to the broader $20 billion graphic apparel market. 
Switching to our segments. Innerwear sales increased 3% in the quarter, a strong result given the roughly $20 million retail inventory adjustment in basics. The real highlight was our intimates business, which increased 9% in the quarter, driven by our Hanes and Bali bras. With our brand consolidation strategy mainly behind us, we're able to see the full power of our new initiatives. We began advertising behind the ComfortFlex Fit platform in both Hanes and Bali during the quarter, and the response has been tremendous. Our Hanes Ultimate and Hanes Platinum collections, which are sold in mid-tier and department stores, are exceeding our initial expectations. 
Shifting to Activewear. We are driving increased Champion distribution as our brand strategy continues to resonate with both consumers and retailers. This was evident in our third quarter results as Champion sales in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels increased 33% over last year. Our Activewear business also continues to benefit from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as margins increased 230 basis points over last year to a record 18.8%. 
And turning to our core International business, which excludes DBA and the impact of a retailer exit from Canada, sales in constant currency increased 14% over last year. 
So to sum up, our business continues to perform extremely well. Our categories are healthy, our brands are strong and our strategies continue to deliver double-digit EPS growth. And we believe this is something you'll see for many years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."
4212820,314855915,884709,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald.It was 4 years ago this month that I was on my first HanesBrands earnings call as CFO.

It was 4 years ago this month that I was on my first HanesBrands earnings call as CFO. And reflecting back, I'm amazed at how much our business has evolved. Over this time, we've added approximately $1.4 billion of revenue in a more much more diversified manner. Our International business has roughly doubled and is now about 20% of our sales. Our largest customer accounts for about 20% of our revenue today, down from a peak of 28%. And we now have limited exposure to low-margin commodity product categories. 
Over that same timeframe, we've also significantly increased profitability as operating profit has nearly doubled, while margins have increased approximately 500 basis points. And we strengthened our balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has decreased from 4x to around 2.5x today, and is on its way to roughly 2x by the end of the year. And we've deployed over $2 billion in cash to create shareholder value through dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. 
Our strong performance over the past several years has been driven by a set of strategies that are designed to leverage our brand expertise. Our company-owned supply chain and the corporate culture is centered on continuous improvement. We have strategies to drive growth organically as well as strategies to drive growth by wisely investing our cash flow. And going forward, we're confident that these can continue to generate strong returns as they are both scalable and repeatable. 
Now let me take you through some of the highlights from the quarter as they relate to our strategies. Shipments rebounded in the quarter, as we indicated they would. Even with the impact from the retail inventory adjustment, our core revenue increased 3% in constant currency and it was up nearly 1.5 points year-to-date. This is a perfect example of why we remind investors not to overreact to any single quarter. Because while our business may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, over time, our shipments tend to equal our sell-through due to the replenishment nature of our categories. Core operating margins continue to expand, up approximately 90 basis points over last year, driven by additional Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and the continued leverage of our core SG&A. 
Turning to our cash deployment strategies. Acquisitions continue to add to our earnings growth. DBA and Knights Apparel generated roughly $29 million in operating profit in the quarter. We also began repurchasing stock in the quarter, spending approximately $311 million to buy back roughly 10.7 million shares, which added just under $0.01 to third quarter EPS. 
Turning to guidance. We raised our operating profit guidance to a range of $880 million to $890 million from our prior range of $855 million to $875 million to reflect the strong margin performance in our business. We also raised our EPS guidance to a range of $1.66 to $1.68 from our previous range of $1.61 to $1.66 due to our increased profit guidance and contributions from share repurchases. We also expect interest and other expense to increase to roughly $115 million, partially offset by a slightly lower tax rate of approximately 12%. 
I should also mention that the IRS just completed a substantial 2-year audit, the results of which validate the sustainability of our tax strategies and further reinforce the benefits of our company-owned global supply chain. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Our guidance implies a little over $1.5 billion of sales, which reflects about $20 million of seasonal programs that shift in Q3 rather than -- earlier than initially expected. When you adjust for last year's 53rd week, our guidance implies core revenue growth in constant currency of about 3% for both the fourth quarter and the second half. Fourth quarter operating profit is estimated to be $231 million to $241 million, implying an operating margin range of roughly 15% to 16% for both the fourth quarter and the second half. At the midpoint of our guidance, this would represent about a 130 basis point improvement over last year's second half margins. And fourth quarter EPS is estimated to be in a range of $0.44 to $0.46, which includes about $0.01 from share repurchases. 
So in summary, our business strategies continue to deliver great results, and this is reflected in our increased guidance for the year. And we're now on pace to deliver 17% to 18% EPS growth this year. And as we look forward, our growth strategies position us to continue to drive solid double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.
