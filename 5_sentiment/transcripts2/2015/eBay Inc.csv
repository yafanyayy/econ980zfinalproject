Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 earnings call. In a year marked by unexpected events and distractions, our double-digit revenue growth, solid earnings growth and strong cash flow reflect the fundamental strength of our company",1277,"Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 earnings call. In a year marked by unexpected events and distractions, our double-digit revenue growth, solid earnings growth and strong cash flow reflect the fundamental strength of our company. We have some challenges, but overall our focus and operating discipline delivered solid company performance in a year that quite frankly, we're glad to see come to an end. .
Before I talk more about Q4, let me take a moment to provide some context as we head into 2015, an important year of transition for our company. With the planned separation of eBay and PayPal in 2015, we are moving forward with clarity and speed. We're taking aggressive, decisive actions to address both the opportunities we see and the challenges we face. At the same time, we're creating sharper strategic focus at eBay and PayPal, and we're implementing more competitive cost structures in each business. All of these actions are designed to set up eBay and PayPal to succeed.
We remain deeply committed to doing what's best for eBay and PayPal and to delivering sustainable value for shareholders. And we believe more strongly than ever that separation is the right path for our company.
Now let's take a look at the results for the quarter. We enabled $72 billion of commerce volume in the fourth quarter, up 21%. Mobile continues to be a major contributor. For Q4, mobile commerce volume was $17 billion, up 59% and note, mobile now represents 23% of enabled commerce volume. Overall, revenue was up 9% in Q4 and non-GAAP EPS was up 10%. eBay and PayPal both generated double-digit customer growth, with PayPal reaching nearly 162 million active registered accounts and eBay exceeding 155 million active buyers.
At PayPal, Dan Shulman joined in Q4 as President and CEO designee and we're excited to have him on our leadership team. Dan is quickly immersing himself in all aspects of PayPal's business and providing strong, focused leadership on 2015 priorities and on positioning PayPal for continued competitive success. PayPal had another strong quarter finishing a very strong year. Merchant Services TPV grew 36% on an FX-neutral basis in Q4 and revenue was up 18% on an FX-neutral basis.
Throughout the holiday season, PayPal drew strong consumer engagement, adding nearly 5 million active accounts and processing record payments volume. PayPal continues to deliver great product experiences that offer choice and flexibility for consumers and help merchants grow their business. For example, PayPal's One Touch has continued its international expansion effort. And for both consumers and merchants, PayPal extended its credit offerings, including adding installment payment options. And PayPal working capital launched in Australia and the U.K., offering merchants more convenient ways to invest in and grow their businesses.
In a rapidly changing global payments environment, we believe that PayPal is positioned to leverage its global footprint, digital payments leadership and unique competitive strengths.
Turning to eBay Marketplaces. Q4 was disappointing. Significant events in 2014 have disrupted our ecosystem and overwhelmed the progress we are making on a number of fronts, impacting our performance. We have experienced these ecosystem disruptions before and they simply take time to work through and correct.
Here's what happened and here's what we're doing about it. First, the password reset and SEO changes significantly impacted traffic, which did not recover in the second half as expected. eBay's loyal customers are back following the reset of our passwords, but our more occasional customers have not returned as quickly as expected in Q4. And the SEO changes significantly diminished eBay's presence in natural search results which impacted new user growth in the second half and had a cumulative effect on Q4 results.
Second, a stronger dollar impacted eBay's cross-border trade, depressing U.S. exports and affecting Q4 results for North America. In total, we simply underestimated the combined effect of these events on eBay's ecosystem. And these events occurred in a more competitive environment, where eCommerce and omnichannel players are upping their game.
But these are not excuses and this is not business as usual. In this environment, we need to sharpen our strategic focus and execute better. And Dennie and his team are doing just that. They are moving decisively and aggressively with clear priorities. First, improve traffic and conversion; second, deliver strong product experiences that engage our target customers; and third, manage our cost structure to help fund investments that reengage eBay buyers.
We're also sharpening our strategy with greater focus on the core consumer segment where we believe eBay can win. Savvy shoppers who love great value, unique selection, discovery and engagement. And we're redeploying resources to our top priorities and scaling back or stopping other initiatives.
That said, 2015 the will be another challenging year, and we expect eBay's performers the soften further before we see stabilization and improvement. We still have more work to do.
However, eBay continues to be a great business. In 2014, eBay enabled $83 billion in GMV and generated $3 billion in free cash flow. And even at low growth rates expected for 2014, '15, eBay can still deliver strong cash flows at healthy margins. Separation strongly supports eBay's need to focus on work and win, and to fully align its strategy, cost structure and capital allocation, and that's good for eBay's customers and for eBay shareholders.
Turning briefly to eBay Enterprise. Gross merchandise sales in Q4 were up 9% and revenue was up 9%. eBay Enterprise is a good business and Craig Hermann is bringing a sharper strategic focus to how eBay Enterprise can compete and win as a leading commerce partner to brands and retailers. We're taking a closer look at eBay Marketplaces and eBay Enterprise going forward, and it's clear that the 2 businesses have increasingly divergent opportunities. As a result, we've decided to explore strategic alternatives for eBay Enterprise, including a full or partial sale or IPO. Until this process is complete, we do not anticipate commenting further.
In summary, we are on the right strategic path, and we're acting decisively and aggressively as we position eBay and PayPal for success. We're sharpening our strategic focus and streamlining our cost structure and our portfolio, and we're creating operating agreements that preserve both synergies and strategic flexibility.
Regarding our cost structure. Our decision announced today to eliminate approximately 2,400 positions, or about 7% of our global workforce, was a difficult one. Eliminating jobs is never easy. But these decisions were necessary at eBay, PayPal and eBay Enterprise to simplify the organizations, reduce complexity, speed decision-making and create competitive cost structures.
Before closing, I want to update you on our progress toward creating 2 strong boards for eBay and PayPal. NBC Universal executive Bonnie Hammord [ph] joined our board earlier this month. And today, I'm please to announce the addition of seasoned Wall Street executives Perry Traquina and Frank Yeary. Bonnie, Terry and Frank will bring tremendous value and expertise to our current board.
In addition, we announced today an agreement with Carl Icahn, our largest active shareholder. This agreement reflects our alignment on separation and our shared belief in the benefits of avoiding distraction. As part of this agreement, Icahn Capital executive Jonathan Christodoro will be joining our board as our fourth new director. We look forward to welcoming Jonathan to the board.
Looking ahead, we are clear in what we need to do to deliver our 2015 plans and ensure a smooth separation process, and we'll continue to do what's best for our business, for our customers and for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Bob who will provide more details on the quarter, and then we'll take questions."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast.In the fourth quarter, we enabled $72 billion of commerce volume on behalf of our customers. Mobile commerce volume was $17 billion, up 59% f",2509,"Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast.
In the fourth quarter, we enabled $72 billion of commerce volume on behalf of our customers. Mobile commerce volume was $17 billion, up 59% from last year. Revenue was $4.9 billion, up 9%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90, up 10%. We generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, and we bought back $1.2 billion of stock.
In Q4, we generated net revenues of $4.9 billion, up 9%. Organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter. Braintree contributed approximately 1 point of growth, while currency negatively impacted growth by roughly 2 points.
We delivered revenue near the high-end of the guidance range despite the impact of the stronger dollar, which impacted revenues by approximately $30 million since our guidance in October.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90, up 10%. EPS growth was driven by 9% top line growth and lower share count, partially offset by lower operating margins.
Operating margins declined by 150 basis points due to the higher customer service and site ops cost and slightly higher operating expenses.
A little more color on operating expenses, which were 41% of revenue in the quarter, up 50 basis points. The biggest driver was sales and marketing, up 70 basis points. The incremental spend was to drive traffic at Marketplaces and to drive comprehension and usage by our customers at PayPal. We gained operating leverage on our G&A line which was down 110 basis points.
We generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter and CapEx was 8% of revenue.
We had excellent free cash flow for the full year 2014, ending with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $14.6 billion, including $4.5 billion in the U.S. During the year, we generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow. We lowered our cost of capital by repurchasing 88 million shares of stock and issuing $3.5 billion in debt at attractive rates. And we funded our PayPal Credit portfolio primarily using our offshore cash.
We have significant capacity to capitalize 2 independent companies, while providing them each with the financial flexibility to invest and grow.
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a great quarter and a strong close to an excellent year. For the first time, we achieved revenues of more than $2 billion in the quarter, reaching $2.2 billion, up 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong account growth and accelerating transaction growth, which was partially offset by a 3-point sequential deceleration on eBay growth. More than 50% of PayPal's revenues came from outside the U.S.
A few quick highlights on PayPal operating metrics. Total active accounts growth was 13%, with rising engagement per account. TPV, on an FX-neutral basis, grew 27%, with Merchant Services FX-neutral TPV increasing 36%.
Transaction margins remained well above the 60% level, while we continue to expand off of eBay, grow large merchant ubiquity and accelerate Braintree growth with merchants and consumers.
PayPal's segment margin declined 370 basis points to 22% due to increased investment in Braintree, product, brand, as well as cost from one-time regulatory matters.
Now let's turn to the Marketplaces business. Marketplaces delivered $2.3 billion in revenue, up 5%, on an FX-neutral basis, a challenging close to a tough year. FX-neutral transaction revenue grew 3%, while marketing services revenue grew 12%, helped by strong growth of our global classifieds business. StubHub continued to de-track from revenue due to lower take rate from the pricing changes earlier in the year.
EBay is a good business, but we have real challenges that we're working our way through. And as John mentioned, it's going to get worse before it gets better. A little more on what's going on. Since the fourth quarter of last year, our GMV has decelerated by 7 points globally and 11 points in the U.S., our largest and most competitive market. Our ecosystem has simply been disruptive. While volume through the first 5 months of the year was roughly stable, a series of factors have contributed to the second half decline, and we're wrestling with 3 fundamental challenges. First, traffic. Traffic growth has decelerated by 7 points in the year. The drivers include both the decline in new buyers at the top of the funnel due to the SEO changes and occasional buyers not returning to our side or buying less frequently.
Secondly, FX-neutral selling prices on the site have declined 4 points over last year. This is a bit of a catch 22 for us. As we've made it easier for sellers from around the world to surface their inventory to global buyers, selection has increased from lower-priced regions. In addition, mobile has become a greater percentage of our mix, which skews more towards emerging markets and a younger demographic who tend to buy lower-priced items.
And third, as John mentioned, cross-border trade. We have a large cross-border trade business in our U.S. business is a next -- is a net exporter. And the stronger the U.S. dollar -- and the stronger U.S. dollar slowed our cross-border flows.
The implication of these challenges has resulted in a deceleration in the 3-months active buyer growth to 5%, well below our 12-month active buyer growth of 11%. This is why things will get worse in the next half of 2015 before they get better in the second half of the year. That said, we're not standing still. We're taking decisive actions to focus the business in an effort to simplify and speed up decision-making, while creating incremental capacity to invest to improve both traffic and technology.
We're investing in marketing, improving product design and strengthening the SEO workflow to a more sustainable format. And we are prioritizing our resources towards our core shoppers in doubling down on areas of strength like our $2 billion eBay deals business.
So let me put the Marketplace performance into perspective. In what I would characterize as a very difficult year, eBay remains the 28th most valuable brand in the world. It has a great business model with low capital intensity which generated $3 billion in free cash flow in 2014. We have our hand on the issues and we're working through them as we enter 2015.
Now let's turn to eBay Enterprise. eBay Enterprise generated $1.9 billion in gross merchandise sales for its clients. GMS grew 9% driven by the addition of new logos and same-store sales growth of 12%. Revenue was $443 million, up 9%. Segment margins for eBay Enterprise came in at 15.5%, relatively flat from last year.
So before we turn to 2015, let me step back and give a brief summary of our full year 2014 performance. We enabled $255 billion of commerce volume for merchants and consumers globally, which accelerated 2 points to 24%. PayPal enabled $228 billion of TPV, up 27%; eBay enabled $83 billion of GMV, up 8%; and eBay Enterprise enabled $4.7 billion of GMS, up 13%.
Mobile commerce volume was $54 billion, up 66%; revenue grew 12%; and non-GAAP EPS grew 9%. And through this tough year, we managed to generate $4.4 billion in free cash flow. And we bought back $4.7 billion of stock and reduced our shares outstanding by roughly 5%. Not the worst performance, but a year we're glad to have behind us.
So with that, let me turn to our priorities for 2015. They're really twofold: First, execute on our business plans; and second, create the 2 world-class independent platforms. Let me talk to each. Executing our business plans. We are taking actions to streamline and simplify this cost structure in each of the businesses, and we are eliminating approximately 2,400 positions across the company, roughly 7% of the global workforce. And we're pursuing the sale or IPO of the eBay Enterprise so we are focused on our 2 core businesses. We are focusing our growth initiatives where we believe we have true competitive advantages and leveraging our large and growing customer bases. And during the year, we'll produce strong cash flow and opportunistically reduce our share count.
The second major work stream for us is positioning 2 great standalone companies. We believe the key criteria for success are an operating agreement that provides strategic flexibility while preserving synergies and minimizing dis-synergies; a capital structure that provides each business a flexibly that enables its investment priorities; and creating 2 world-class Boards of Directors.
Now let me turn to guidance specifically, and then I'll provide an update on where we are on the separation process. We are projecting 2015 revenues of $18.6 billion to $19.1 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of 7% to 10%. We expect FX to impact revenue by approximately $600 million or roughly 3 points of growth, as the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus the euro, pound and the Australian dollar by 12%, 8% and 10%, respectively. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $3.05 to $3.15, up 3% to 7% versus 2014, with our non-GAAP effective tax rate stable in the 19% to 20% range. And we expect to generate greater than $4 billion of free cash flow for the year with CapEx of 8% to 10% of revenues.
We have a lot of moving pieces in 2015, so I wanted to provide a bit more transparency on what is driving or detracting from our non-GAAP EPS expectations for the year. There our 5 key drivers. As we mentioned earlier, we are reducing our global workforce by roughly 7%. This will result in a GAAP charge of approximately $100 million in the first quarter, and generate savings in 2015 of more than $300 million across the company, but the savings will be reinvested to drive growth.
Second, we will add approximately $1 billion to the top line in 2015. This top line growth, coupled with strong margins across our businesses, will generate $0.30 per share of earnings.
Third, we repurchased $4.7 billion in shares of common stock in 2014. And our Board of Directors has approved an increase of our outstanding authorization by $2 billion, leaving $3 billion authorization remaining. We plan to offset dilution from our comp base programs and continue to opportunistically reduce our share count in 2015. This will add approximately $0.10 per share to EPS.
Fourth, the strong dollar will have a large negative impact from a translation perspective and will create a headwind for cross-border trade growth. Translation, net of hedges, will negatively impact EPS by $0.10 to $0.15 per share in the year.
And fifth, the dis-synergy costs associated with the separation will add approximately $200 million of ongoing cost in 2015, or approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
With that as context for eBay Inc.'s guidance and the drivers of EPS for 2014 to 2015, let me provide a little more context by business unit. For PayPal, we expect 15% to 18% growth on an FX-neutral basis. We have strong momentum in the core business. We are expanding credit both internationally and with small merchants, and we are extending our reach with Braintree. Slower on-eBay growth and lower monetization from Braintree and large merchants will partially offset the strong volume growth.
For PayPal, we are expecting segment margins of 24% to 25%, up 1 to 2 points versus 2014. We are expecting transaction margin compression due to lower take rate and higher operating expenses as we invest in growth priorities. This will be offset by strong operating leverage and the benefits from our Q1 headcount reduction and anticipated gains on PayPal's FX hedges.
For eBay, we expect FX-neutral revenue growth between 0 and 5%, with the first half growth slower than the second half as we look to rebuild our active buyer base. We expect segment margins of 37% to 39%, flat versus 2014. We are taking actions to streamline our cost structure in the first quarter, and we'll reinvest in product, sales and marketing while improving site security, stability and site speed. While growth is lower than we'd like, we'll be disciplined in our approach and the business will generate strong cash flows.
For eBay Enterprise, we expect FX-neutral revenue growth of 5% to 8% with segment margins of 5% to 10% greater than 2014. As John mentioned, this is a good business, but has increasingly divergent opportunities with eBay, and therefore, we are pursuing a sale or IPO.
As we move to become independent companies and fully allocate cost, we expect the business units segment margins to be impacted by 3 to 4 points from corporate overhead and approximately 1 point from the dis-synergies associated with the separation. From a tax rate perspective, we expect the standalone tax rate for PayPal to be lower than eBay Inc.'s tax rate and the eBay Marketplaces and eBay Enterprise to be higher than the eBay Inc. tax rate.
Next, I'd like to switch gears and give you an update on where we are related to separation. As I mentioned earlier, there are 3 primary work streams we are focused on to set up these 2 businesses to succeed.
First, the separation itself. Our guiding principle has been to move as swiftly as possible to set up each business is to be fully self-sufficient, and put in transitional service agreements where time, complexity and/or costs become an impediment. At this stage, we expect to incur approximately $200 million of ongoing costs which is in line with our expectations. The dis-synergy costs are associated with separating data centers, infrastructure and IT-related task as we migrate from of shared services-type environment to a path towards self-sufficiency. Additionally, there'll be facilities cost associated with separating shared facilities and G&A-related costs associated with creating 2 public companies.
The second major work stream has been capital structure. Our guiding principle here has been to ensure each business is well capitalized with financial flexibility to pursue their strategic priorities, whether if is the resources to fund growth or the flexibility to return cash to shareholders. We have a great balance sheet, and at this stage, we feel increasingly confident that we can achieve our objectives. Our intentions are to sufficiently capitalize eBay with net cash of approximately $2 billion with significant debt capacity and leave PayPal with approximately $5 billion of net cash. We believe we can accomplish this in a tax-efficient manner.
The third critical work stream relates to the operating agreement between the 2 companies. Our guiding principle here has been to provide each business with a strategic flexibility to maximize its independent potential, while maintaining the synergies that have been captured and created over the years. At this stage, we're making good progress, but at the same time we have lots to do.
Overall, from a separation standpoint, we are on track to file our initial Form 10 by the end of February, and we are increasingly confident in our ability to effect the separation in the second half of this year.
I know that was a lot of cover in a relatively short time, but now we'd be happy to answer any questions you have. Operator?"

As we project going forward, there will continue to be take rate on -- I'm sorry, pressure on PayPal's take rate, and it's going to be primarily because of our success with the growth of Braintree and the growth of PayPal ubiquity in large merchants.

And as I mentioned earlier, we talked a lot over the last several years about the lines between eCommerce, and mobile, and off-line blurring, taking a $1 trillion market and making it a $10 trillion market, and that's still the case. But marketplace in this competitive world is going to focus on the $4 trillion where our core consumers align with our competitive strengths. This is where we think we can win. And it's particular it's, in simplest terms, it's not the convenience consumer, it's the average -- I'm sorry, the avid shopper that person who loves great value, loves selection, loves shopping, that's majority of our current customer base. And that actually is 40% of the market, $4 trillion. And so Devon and team are more focused -- focusing on what specifically that consumer wants than ever before. So an example, that consumer wants great deals, so we're growing our deals business. We're growing $2 billion deals business and putting less emphasis on adding more full-priced inventory on the site. On delivery, our core consumer wants free delivery or they want to buy online and pick it up on store, so they don't pay for delivery and they get the shop. And we're spending less on same-day delivery, which is really something that's geared towards the convenience user. Similarly, on trust, our core consumer likes eBay buy our guarantee. That's what they like and there's other trends initiatives that have less value. So it's really a re-prioritization on the more specific focused things that are core consumer represent, and we want to grow our $80 billion marketplace into the $4 trillion opportunity."

And the reasons and rationale differ a little bit by business, where Devon, John highlighted, where Devon is more focused and therefore has aligned the cost structure to be more focused. I think as Dan sees the opportunities in PayPal and the need to accelerate the rate of renovation, he think there's opportunities to simplify the structure that it exists. So the reason it's a little bit differently business, in aggregate, that's roughly 7%. And at this stage, all I would say is a little bit higher on the marketplace side and a little bit lower on PayPal side."

We have the world's largest collection of unstructured data. And our listings, by the very nature of the marketplace, turn over every 7 to 14 days. And so it's always been a struggle for us to get that to work sustainably and effectively in Google's SEO. And we have the sort of repeated pattern where every a couple of years, there's a rule change that impacts our business. So Devon and team have set out to fix this the right way, which involves us, in essence, creating our own product catalog and creating it in a way so that it has more sustainable performance in SEO. And unfortunately, we can't do that overnight. We clawed our way back to where SEO traffic is more or less where it was before the event, but it's not yet driving growth and it's not yet driving the same new buyers. I'll remind you, SEO is a modest part of our traffic, but it is an important source of new buyers for us. And so the remaining work to be done in over the first 3 or 4 quarters of 2014 is building out that product catalog and getting so where SEO is generating traffic growth and back to generating the new buyers in a sustainable way."

However, we said operating margins would improve by 1 to 2 points. And while transaction margins are coming down and will be continued to invest quite a bit, a simplified our structure and quite a bit of G&A leverage will help contribute to the 1 to 2 points of margin growth. Your second question on card present rates. I'll just say, within our wallet or our funding mix, we're always looking for instruments that give consumers choice and that, all else equal, given that choice allows us to deliver a proposition for merchants that addresses one of their key criteria, which is, PayPal how can you help me lower my cost? So we are always looking for opportunities to add instruments and/or use our leverage and/or technology to lower processing costs within the wallet to offset pressures that come with a lower take rate, and we'll continue to do that in '15 and beyond."

One Touch, which is the way that we can have with One Touch consumers can pay with PayPal with One Touch on any Braintree or PayPal-enabled mobile app. v.zero, which is the Braintree next-generation platform which started out with third-party developers and small merchants and is now working its way. We're building our whole next-generation PayPal core platform on it. Installments credit, we've rolled on installments credit with Apple online in the U.K. and Germany and that will come to the U.S. That's a way to allow our merchants to give more choice to consumers. And allows the consumer to be able to buy an item, a high-priced or lower-priced item with great convenience. And then in both businesses, mobile continues to be a major source of innovation. PayPal's assumed mobile SDK. And a return to the market is in the midst of a very challenging year, to be clear, we got that. But mobile GMV was up 42% for the year. Mobile GMV and eBay's mobile GMV was $28 billion. And you saw the iPad app that we launched right before Christmas. That is the freshest, I think, most innovative mobile experience that eBay has built in years. And it's geared importantly to infrequent users or new users. If you check it out, it's fresh. If you've never used eBay before, you can come in, and it's engaging and intuitive. And so throughout the challenges the marketplace has right now and all the operational execution they're focused on, where Marketplaces is still focused on innovation like its mobile experience, like live auctions and other things.

I mean in effect, or to make it simple -- our PayPal international business is a dollar-functional currency, which allows us to put in place economics hedges for projected revenue. We don't have that luxury for the eBay business, it's not dollar functional. Therefore, putting in economic hedges would subject us and you to quite a bit of volatility because we would not get the appropriate accounting treatment.

He keeps saying give committees are phenomenal, our brand. And the opportunity to expand and expand that brand across consumers and across merchants is significant. So what he's bringing is a greater focus. I would say one of the challenges PayPal's always had is there's too many opportunities, and there's greater focus in the 2015 plan, which -- that I've seen in the last several years, focus on product, extending Braintree, extending One Touch, extending Venmo. Secondly, on expanding things like our credit offering, which increase our relevance, both on merchants and to consumers. And then marketing. PayPal really did marketing for the first time in 2014, and we had pretty clear positive return on investment. It was one of the the contributors to those very high growth rates. Dan brings a lot of consumer marketing experience and the 2015 plan continues and have even more marketing. So the 2015 plan, which in many ways, a continuation of the current with a more sharp focus is got his footprint on it and the handprints on it. And he's simplifying the organization to accelerated innovation. So you'll get a chance to hear from him in the second quarter.

So on the merchant side, geographic, more international sized, more large and type increasing service versus just product. On the consumer side, just from the nature of the growth in mobile, you see that the increased frequency as PayPal's user is increasing the technology savvy and has embraced mobile and product coupled with that dynamic customer base has allowed the PayPal consumer to be more technology savvy.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 earnings call. In a year marked by unexpected events and distractions, our double-digit revenue growth, solid earnings growth and strong cash flow reflect the fundamental strength of our company. We have some challenges, but overall, our focus and operating discipline delivered solid company performance in a year that, quite frankly, we're glad to see come to an end.
Before I talk more about Q4, let me take a moment to provide some context as we head into 2015, an important year of transition for our company. With the planned separation of eBay and PayPal in 2015, we are moving forward with clarity and speed. We're taking aggressive, decisive actions to address both the opportunities we see and the challenges we face. At the same time, we're creating sharper strategic focus at eBay and PayPal, and we're implementing more competitive cost structures in each business. All of these actions are designed to set up eBay and PayPal to succeed. We remain deeply committed to doing what's best for eBay and PayPal and to delivering sustainable value for shareholders. And we believe more strongly than ever that separation is the right path for our company.
Now let's take a look at the results for the quarter. We enabled $72 billion of commerce volume in the fourth quarter, up 21%. Mobile continues to be a major contributor. For Q4, mobile commerce volume was $17 billion, up 59%. And note, mobile now represents 23% of enabled commerce volume. Overall, revenue was up 9% in Q4 and non-GAAP EPS was up 10%. eBay and PayPal both generated double-digit customer growth, with PayPal reaching nearly 162 million active registered accounts and eBay exceeding 155 million active buyers.
At PayPal, Dan Shulman joined in Q4 as President and CEO designee, and we're excited to have him on our leadership team. Dan is quickly immersing himself in all aspects of PayPal's business and providing strong, focused leadership on 2015 priorities and on positioning PayPal for continued competitive success. PayPal had another strong quarter, finishing a very strong year. Merchant Services TPV grew 36% on an FX-neutral basis in Q4 and revenue was up 18% on an FX-neutral basis.
Throughout the holiday season, PayPal drove strong consumer engagement, adding nearly 5 million active accounts and processing record payments volume. PayPal continues to deliver great product experiences that offer choice and flexibility for consumers and help merchants grow their business. For example, PayPal's One Touch has continued its international expansion effort. And for both consumers and merchants, PayPal extended its credit offerings, including adding installment payment options, and PayPal Working Capital launched in Australia and the U.K., offering merchants more convenient ways to invest in and grow their businesses. In a rapidly changing global payments environment, we believe that PayPal is positioned to leverage its global footprint, digital payments leadership and unique competitive strengths.
Turning to eBay Marketplaces. Q4 was disappointing. Significant events in 2014 have disrupted our ecosystem and overwhelmed the progress we were making on a number of fronts, impacting our performance. We have experienced these ecosystem disruptions before, and they simply take time to work through and correct.
Here's what happened and here's what we're doing about it. First, the password reset and SEO changes significantly impacted traffic, which did not recover in the second half as expected. eBay's loyal customers are back following the reset of our passwords, but our more occasional customers have not returned as quickly as expected in Q4. And the SEO changes significantly diminished eBay's presence in natural search results, which impacted new user growth in the second half and had a cumulative effect on Q4 results.
Second, a stronger dollar impacted eBay's cross-border trade, depressing U.S. exports and affecting Q4 results for North America. In total, we simply underestimated the combined effect of these events on eBay's ecosystem. And these events occurred in a more competitive environment, where eCommerce and omnichannel players are upping their game.
But these are not excuses and this is not business as usual. In this environment, we need to sharpen our strategic focus and execute better. And Devin Wenig and his team are doing just that. They are moving decisively and aggressively with clear priorities: first, improve traffic and conversion; second, deliver strong product experiences that engage our target customers; and third, manage our cost structure to help fund investments that reengage eBay buyers. We're also sharpening our strategy with greater focus on the core consumer segment where we believe eBay can win, savvy shoppers who love great value, unique selection, discovery and engagement. And we're redeploying resources to our top priorities and scaling back or stopping other initiatives.
That said, 2015 will be another challenging year, and we expect eBay's performance to soften further before we see stabilization and improvement. We still have work to do.
However, eBay continues to be a great business. In 2014, eBay enabled $83 billion in GMV and generated $3 billion in free cash flow. And even at low growth rates expected for 2014 -- '15, eBay can still deliver strong cash flows at healthy margins. Separation strongly supports eBay's need to focus on work and win and to fully align its strategy, cost structure and capital allocation. And that's good for eBay's customers and for eBay's shareholders.
Turning briefly to eBay Enterprise. Gross merchandise sales in Q4 were up 9% and revenue was up 9%. eBay Enterprise is a good business, and Craig Hayman is bringing a sharper strategic focus to how eBay Enterprise can compete and win as a leading commerce partner to brands and retailers. We're taking a closer look at eBay Marketplaces and eBay Enterprise going forward, and it's clear that the 2 businesses have increasingly divergent opportunities. As a result, we've decided to explore strategic alternatives for eBay Enterprise, including a full or partial sale or IPO. Until this process is complete, we do not anticipate commenting further.
In summary, we are on the right strategic path, and we're acting decisively and aggressively as we position eBay and PayPal for success. We're sharpening our strategic focus and streamlining our cost structure and our portfolio, and we're creating operating agreements that preserve both synergies and strategic flexibility.
Regarding our cost structure. Our decision announced today to eliminate approximately 2,400 positions, or about 7% of our global workforce, was a difficult one. Eliminating jobs is never easy. But these decisions were necessary at eBay, PayPal and eBay Enterprise to simplify the organizations, reduce complexity, speed decision-making and create competitive cost structures.
Before closing, I want to update you on our progress toward creating 2 strong boards for eBay and PayPal. NBCUniversal executive Bonnie Hammer joined our board earlier this month. And today, I'm pleased to announce the addition of seasoned Wall Street executives Perry Traquina and Frank Yeary. Bonnie, Perry and Frank will bring tremendous value and expertise to our current board.
In addition, we announced today an agreement with Carl Icahn, our largest active shareholder. This agreement reflects our alignment on separation and our shared belief in the benefits of avoiding distraction. As part of this agreement, Icahn Capital executive Jonathan Christodoro will be joining our board as our fourth new director. We look forward to welcoming Jonathan to the board.
Looking ahead, we are clear in what we need to do to deliver our 2015 plans and ensure a smooth separation process, and we'll continue to do what's best for our business, for our customers and for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who will provide more details on the quarter, and then we'll take questions."
27862,275176206,747747,"eBay Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast.In the fourth quarter, we enabled $72 billion of commerce volume on behalf of our customers.

In the fourth quarter, we enabled $72 billion of commerce volume on behalf of our customers. Mobile commerce volume was $17 billion, up 59% from last year. Revenue was $4.9 billion, up 9%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90, up 10%. We generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, and we bought back $1.2 billion of stock. 
In Q4, we generated net revenues of $4.9 billion, up 9%. Organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter. Braintree contributed approximately 1 point of growth, while currency negatively impacted growth by roughly 2 points. We delivered revenue near the high end of the guidance range despite the impact of the stronger dollar, which impacted revenues by approximately $30 million since our guidance in October.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90, up 10%. EPS growth was driven by 9% top line growth and lower share count, partially offset by lower operating margins. Operating margins declined by 150 basis points due to the higher customer service and site ops cost and slightly higher operating expenses.
A little more color on operating expenses, which were 41% of revenue in the quarter, up 50 basis points. The biggest driver was sales and marketing, up 70 basis points. The incremental spend was to drive traffic at Marketplaces and to drive comprehension and usage by our customers at PayPal. We gained operating leverage on our G&A line, which was down 110 basis points.
We generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter, and CapEx was 8% of revenue. We had excellent free cash flow for the full year 2014, ending with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $14.6 billion, including $4.5 billion in the U.S. During the year, we generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow. We lowered our cost of capital by repurchasing 88 million shares of stock and issuing $3.5 billion in debt at attractive rates. And we funded our PayPal Credit portfolio primarily using our offshore cash. We have significant capacity to capitalize 2 independent companies while providing them each with the financial flexibility to invest and grow.
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a great quarter and a strong close to an excellent year. For the first time, we achieved revenues of more than $2 billion in the quarter, reaching $2.2 billion, up 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong account growth and accelerating transaction growth, which was partially offset by a 3-point sequential deceleration on eBay growth. More than 50% of PayPal's revenues came from outside the U.S.
A few quick comments on PayPal operating metrics. Total active accounts growth was 13%, with rising engagement per account. TPV, on an FX-neutral basis, grew 27%, with Merchant Services FX-neutral TPV increasing 36%. Transaction margins remained well above the 60% level, while we continue to expand off of eBay, grow large merchant ubiquity and accelerate Braintree growth with merchants and consumers. PayPal's segment margin declined 370 basis points to 22% due to increased investment in Braintree, product, brand as well as costs from onetime regulatory matters.
Now let's turn to the Marketplaces business. Marketplaces delivered $2.3 billion in revenue, up 5% on an FX-neutral basis, a challenging close to a tough year. FX-neutral transaction revenue grew 3%, while marketing services revenue grew 12%, helped by strong growth of our global classifieds business. StubHub continued to detract from revenue due to a lower take rate from the pricing changes earlier in the year. eBay is a good business, but we have real challenges that we're working our way through. And as John mentioned, it's going to get worse before it gets better. 
A little more on what's going on. Since the fourth quarter of last year, our GMV has decelerated by 7 points globally and 11 points in the U.S., our largest and most competitive market. Our ecosystem has simply been disruptive. While volume through the first 5 months of the year was roughly stable, a series of factors have contributed to the second half decline, and we're wrestling with 3 fundamental challenges.
First, traffic. Traffic growth has decelerated by 7 points in the year. The drivers include both the decline in new buyers at the top of the funnel due to the SEO changes and occasional buyers not returning to our site or buying less frequently.
Secondly, FX-neutral selling prices on the site have declined 4 points over last year. This is a bit of a catch-22 for us. As we've made it easier for sellers from around the world to surface their inventory to global buyers, selection has increased from lower-priced regions. In addition, mobile has become a greater percentage of our mix, which skews more towards emerging markets and a younger demographic who tend to buy lower-priced items.
And third, as John mentioned, cross-border trade. We have a large cross-border trade business, and our U.S. business is a next -- is a net exporter. And the stronger the U.S. dollar -- and the stronger U.S. dollar slowed our cross-border flows.
The implication of these challenges has resulted in a deceleration in the 3-month active buyer growth to 5%, well below our 12-month active buyer growth of 11%. This is why things will get worse in the first half of 2015 before they get better in the second half of the year. That said, we're not standing still. We're taking decisive actions to focus the business in an effort to simplify and speed up decision-making while creating incremental capacity to invest to improve both traffic and technology. We're investing in marketing, improving product design and strengthening the SEO workflow to a more sustainable format. And we are prioritizing our resources towards our core shoppers and doubling down on areas of strength like our $2 billion eBay Deals business.
So let me put the Marketplace performance into perspective. In what I would characterize as a very difficult year, eBay remains the 28th most valuable brand in the world. It has a great business model with low capital intensity, which generated $3 billion in free cash flow in 2014. We have our hand on the issues and we're working through them as we enter 2015.
Now let's turn to eBay Enterprise. eBay Enterprise generated $1.9 billion in gross merchandise sales for its clients. GMS grew 9%, driven by the addition of new logos and same-store sales growth of 12%. Revenue was $443 million, up 9%. Segment margins for eBay Enterprise came in at 15.5%, relatively flat from last year.
So before we turn to 2015, let me step back and give a brief summary of our full year 2014 performance. We enabled $255 billion of commerce volume for merchants and consumers globally, which accelerated 2 points to 24%. PayPal enabled $228 billion of TPV, up 27%; eBay enabled $83 billion of GMV, up 8%; and eBay Enterprise enabled $4.7 billion of GMS, up 13%. Mobile commerce volume was $54 billion, up 66%. Revenue grew 12% and non-GAAP EPS grew 9%. And through this tough year, we managed to generate $4.4 billion in free cash flow. And we bought back $4.7 billion of stock and reduced our shares outstanding by roughly 5%. Not the worst performance, but a year we're glad to have behind us.
So with that, let me turn to our priorities for 2015. They're really twofold: first, execute on our business plans; and second, create the 2 world-class independent platforms. Let me talk to each. Executing our business plans. We are taking actions to streamline and simplify this cost structure in each of the businesses, and we're eliminating approximately 2,400 positions across the company, roughly 7% of the global workforce. And we're pursuing the sale or IPO of the eBay Enterprise so we are focused on our 2 core businesses. We are focusing our growth initiatives where we believe we have true competitive advantages and leveraging our large and growing customer bases. And during the year, we'll produce strong cash flow and opportunistically reduce our share count.
The second major workstream for us is positioning 2 great standalone companies. We believe the key criteria for success are: an operating agreement that provides strategic flexibility while preserving synergies and minimizing dis-synergies; a capital structure that provides each business a flexibly that enables its investment priorities; and creating 2 world-class Boards of Directors.
Now let me turn to guidance specifically, and then I'll provide an update on where we are on the separation process. We are projecting 2015 revenues of $18.6 billion to $19.1 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of 7% to 10%. We expect FX to impact revenue by approximately $600 million or roughly 3 points of growth as the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus the euro, pound and the Australian dollar by 12%, 8% and 10%, respectively. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $3.05 to $3.15, up 3% to 7% versus 2014, with our non-GAAP effective tax rate stable in the 19% to 20% range. And we expect to generate greater than $4 billion in free cash flow for the year with CapEx of 8% to 10% of revenues.
We have a lot of moving pieces in 2015, so I wanted to provide a bit more transparency on what is driving or detracting from our non-GAAP EPS expectations for the year. There our 5 key drivers. As we mentioned earlier, we are reducing our global workforce by roughly 7%. This will result in a GAAP charge of approximately $100 million in the first quarter and generate savings in 2015 of more than $300 million across the company. But the savings will be reinvested to drive growth.
Second, we will add approximately $1 billion to the top line in 2015. This top line growth, coupled with strong margins across our businesses, will generate $0.30 per share of earnings.
Third, we repurchased $4.7 billion in shares of common stock in 2014. And our Board of Directors has approved an increase of our outstanding authorization by $2 billion, leaving $3 billion authorization remaining. We plan to offset dilution from our comp base programs and continue to opportunistically reduce our share count in 2015. This will add approximately $0.10 per share to EPS.
Fourth, the strong dollar will have a large negative impact from a translation perspective and will create a headwind for cross-border trade growth. Translation, net of hedges, will negatively impact EPS by $0.10 to $0.15 per share in the year.
And fifth, the dis-synergy costs associated with the separation will add approximately $200 million of ongoing cost in 2015 or approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
With that as context for eBay Inc.'s guidance and the drivers of EPS from 2014 to 2015, let me provide a little more context by business unit. For PayPal, we expect 15% to 18% growth on an FX-neutral basis. We have strong momentum in the core business. We are expanding credit both internationally and with small merchants, and we are extending our reach with Braintree. Slower on-eBay growth and lower monetization from Braintree and large merchants will partially offset the strong volume growth.
For PayPal, we are expecting segment margins of 24% to 25%, up 1 to 2 points versus 2014. We are expecting transaction margin compression due to lower take rate and higher operating expenses as we invest in growth priorities. This will be offset by strong operating leverage and the benefits from our Q1 headcount reduction and anticipated gains on PayPal's FX hedges.
For eBay, we expect FX-neutral revenue growth between 0 and 5%, with the first half growth slower than the second half as we look to rebuild our active buyer base. We expect segment margins of 37% to 39%, flat versus 2014. We are taking actions to streamline our cost structure in the first quarter, and we'll reinvest in product, sales and marketing while improving site security, stability and site speed. While growth is lower than we'd like, we'll be disciplined in our approach and the business will generate strong cash flows.
For eBay Enterprise, we expect FX-neutral revenue growth of 5% to 8% with segment margins of 5% to 10%, greater than 2014. As John mentioned, this is a good business but has increasingly divergent opportunities with eBay, and therefore, we are pursuing a sale or IPO.
As we move to become independent companies and fully allocate cost, we expect the business unit segment margins to be impacted by 3 to 4 points from corporate overhead and approximately 1 point from the dis-synergies associated with the separation. From a tax rate perspective, we expect the standalone tax rate for PayPal to be lower than eBay Inc.'s tax rate and the eBay Marketplaces and eBay Enterprise to be higher than the eBay Inc. tax rate.
Next, I'd like to switch gears and give you an update on where we are related to separation. As I mentioned earlier, there are 3 primary workstreams we are focused on to set up these 2 businesses to succeed.
First, the separation itself. Our guiding principle has been to move as swiftly as possible to set up each business to be fully self-sufficient and put in transitional service agreements where time, complexity and/or costs become an impediment. At this stage, we expect to incur approximately $200 million of ongoing costs, which is in line with our expectations. The dis-synergy costs are associated with separating data centers, infrastructure and IT-related task as we migrate from of shared services-type environment to a path towards self-sufficiently -- self-sufficiency. Additionally, there'll be facilities cost associated with separating shared facilities and G&A-related costs associated with creating 2 public companies.
The second major workstream has been capital structure. Our guiding principle here has been to ensure each business is well capitalized with financial flexibility to pursue their strategic priorities, whether it is the resources to fund growth or the flexibility to return cash to shareholders. We have a great balance sheet, and at this stage, we feel increasingly confident that we can achieve our objectives. Our intentions are to sufficiently capitalize eBay with net cash of approximately $2 billion with significant debt capacity and leave PayPal with approximately $5 billion of net cash. We believe we can accomplish this in a tax-efficient manner.
The third critical workstream relates to the operating agreement between the 2 companies. Our guiding principle here has been to provide each business with a strategic flexibility to maximize its independent potential while maintaining the synergies that have been captured and created over the years. At this stage, we're making good progress, but at the same time, we have lots to do.
Overall, from a separation standpoint, we are on track to file our initial Form 10 by the end of February, and we are increasingly confident in our ability to effect the separation in the second half of this year.
I know that was a lot of cover in a relatively short time, but now we'd be happy to answer any questions you have. Operator?"

On the PayPal take rate, there's really been one dynamic that has been driving take rate for quite a bit of time now. And it primarily focuses on opportunities we see to expand our served market and enter new areas. And they come in 3 forms. One, credit. As we expand our credit portfolio, all else equal, our monetization on credit-related transactions is higher. Secondly, as we expand with larger merchants over time, all else equal, our take rate has a tendency to be lower. And then third, as we expand into new markets, the shared economy through Braintree, our take rate has a tendency to be lower. So in all 3 cases, we've expand our served market. The implications are a lower take rate, and yet we're still able to generate 60% transaction margins. As we project going forward, there will continue to be take rate on -- sorry, pressure on PayPal's take rate, and it's going to be primarily because of our success with the growth of Braintree and the growth of PayPal ubiquity in large merchants.

And what this is grounded in is an increasingly competitive environment that requires us to sharpen and focus the Marketplace strategy. And as I mentioned earlier, we talked a lot over the last several years about the lines between eCommerce and mobile and offline blurring, the taking of $1 trillion market and making it a $10 trillion market, and that's still the case. But Marketplace in this competitive world is going to focus on the $4 trillion where our core consumers align with our competitive strengths. This is where we think we can win. And in particular it's -- in simplest terms, it's not the convenience consumer. It's the average and -- I'm sorry, the avid shopper, the person who loves great value, loves selection, loves shopping. That's the majority of our current customer base, and that actually is 40% of the market, $4 trillion. And so Devin and team are more focused on -- focusing on what specifically that consumer wants than ever before. So an example, that consumer wants great deals, so we're growing our Deals business. We're growing the $2 billion Deals business and putting less emphasis on adding more full-priced inventory on the site. On delivery, our core consumer wants free delivery or they want to buy online and pick it up in store so they don't pay for delivery and they get to shop. And we're spending less on same-day delivery, which is really something that's geared toward the convenience user. Similarly, on trust, our core consumer likes eBay buyer guarantee. That's what they like, and there's some other trust initiatives that have less value. So it's really a re-prioritization on the more specific focused things that our core consumer represent, and we want to grow our $80 billion marketplace into the $4 trillion opportunity."

And eBay is kind of a unique piece. We have the world's largest collection of unstructured data. And our listings, by the very nature of the marketplace, turn over every 7 to 14 days. And so it's always been a struggle for us to get that to work sustainably and effectively in Google's SEO. And we have the sort of repeated pattern where every a couple of years, there's a rule change that impacts our business. So Devin and team have set out to fix this the right way, which involves us, in essence, creating our own product catalog and creating it in a way so that it has more sustainable performance in SEO. And unfortunately, we can't do that overnight. We clawed our way back to where SEO traffic is more or less where it was before the event, but it's not yet driving growth and it's not yet driving the same new buyers. I'll remind you, SEO is a modest part of our traffic but it is an important source of new buyers for us. And so the remaining work to be done in over the first 3, 4 quarters of 2014 is building out that product catalog and getting so where SEO is generating traffic growth and back to generating the new buyers in a sustainable way."

More of our growth will come from larger merchants and Braintree volume, and as a result, we expect take rate to become -- continue to come down and transaction margins to be coming down as well in 2015. However, we said operating margins would improve by 1 to 2 points. And while transaction margins are coming down and we'll be continuing to invest quite a bit, a simplified org structure and quite a bit of G&A leverage will help contribute to the 1 to 2 points of margin growth. Your second question on card present rates, I'll just say within our wallet or our funding mix, we're always looking for instruments that give consumers choice and that all else equal, given that choice allows us to deliver a proposition for merchants that addresses their -- one of their key criteria, which is, PayPal, how can you help me lower my cost? So we are always looking for opportunities to add instruments and/or use our leverage and/or technology to lower processing costs within the wallet to offset pressures that come with a lower take rate, and we'll continue to do that in '15 and beyond."

One Touch, which is the way that we can have -- with One Touch, consumers can pay with PayPal with One Touch on any Braintree or PayPal-enabled mobile app. v.zero, which is the Braintree next-generation platform which started out with third-party developers and small merchants and is now working its way. We're building our whole next-generation PayPal core platform on it. Installments credit, we've rolled out installments credit with Apple online in the U.K. and Germany and that will come to the U.S. That's a way to allow our merchants to give more choice to consumers and allows the consumer to be able to buy an item, a high-priced or lower-priced item, with great convenience. And then both businesses, mobile continues to be a major source of innovation. PayPal's got its new Mobile SDK. And if I turn to the Marketplace in the midst of what was a very challenging year, to be clear, we got that. But mobile GMV was up 42% for the year. Mobile GMV and eBay's mobile GMV was $28 billion. And you saw the iPad app that we launched right before Christmas. That is the freshest, I think, most innovative mobile experience that eBay has built in years. And it's geared importantly to infrequent users or new users. If you check it out, it's fresh. If you've never used eBay before, you can come in and it's engaging and intuitive. And so throughout all the challenges the marketplace has right now and all the operational execution they're focused on, we are -- Marketplace is still focused on innovations like its mobile experience, like live auctions and other things. So there is no lack of attention for innovation across other business."

Just on -- one of the things, Scott, on Braintree that I referenced earlier is increasingly, the Braintree foundational technology, the lines blur between Braintree and PayPal. So the v.zero platform is increasingly becoming the core of the merchant platform for PayPal. You'll begin to see PayPal's peer-to-peer and Venmo peer-to-peer converge toward where we're leveraging a common back end. And so that Mobile SDK and One Touch are increasingly converging. So it has both absolute value of getting us into the fastest-growing segment of the market, the sharing economy apps. But it's also, I think, increasingly innovation and the freshness of PayPal's core products. And that line will blur, and I think it's part of the reason you're seeing accelerating growth in the PayPal part of the equation in addition to Braintree's. Sorry, go ahead to the second question."

Your third question, I think, just related to hedges. I mean, in effect, our -- to make it simple, our PayPal international business is a dollar-functional currency, which allows us to put in place economic hedges for projected revenue. We don't have that luxury for the eBay business. It's not dollar functional. Therefore, putting in economic hedges would subject us and you to quite a bit of volatility because we would not get the appropriate accounting treatment.

So in, I think, the first 75 days, what he's come away saying, very impressed with PayPal's unique assets, its global footprint, our risk capabilities. He keeps saying our risk capabilities are phenomenal, our brand, and the opportunity to extend and expand that brand across consumers and across merchants is significant. So what he's bringing is a greater focus. I would say one of the challenges PayPal has always had is there's too many opportunities. And there's greater focus in the 2015 plan, which -- that I've seen in the last several years: focus on product, extending Braintree, extending One Touch, extending Venmo; secondly, on expanding things like our credit offering, which increase our relevance both to merchants and to consumers; and then marketing. PayPal really did marketing for the first time in 2014, and we had pretty clear positive return on investment. It was one of the contributors to those very high growth rates. Dan brings a lot of consumer marketing experience, and the 2015 plan continues and have even more marketing. So the 2015 plan, which is, in many ways, a continuation of the current with more sharp focus is -- he's got his footprints on it or handprints on it. And then he's simplifying the organization to accelerate innovation. So you'll get a chance to hear from him in the second quarter.

On the merchant side, just geographically, you see more growth outside of the U.S. than you see in the U.S. So PayPal's global footprint continues to expand. From a size standpoint, large merchants, we've gone from roughly 0 to almost 70% penetration on large merchants in the large developed markets. So large merchants, size of merchant becomes increasingly relevant. And then in the developer community and particularly where Braintree pulls us through into the shared the economy, it's a different set more -- can be more service oriented versus merchants that are strictly product oriented. So on the merchant side, geographic, more international, size, more large and type increasing service versus just product. On the consumer side, just from the nature of the growth in mobile, you see that the increased frequency of PayPal's user is increasingly technology savvy and has embraced mobile. And product, coupled with that dynamic and the customer base, has allowed the PayPal consumer to be more technology savvy. But I would maybe follow up on John's point that we've made tremendous progress on the merchant side, but with Dan on board on the consumer side and the relevancy of PayPal products to consumers to use more frequently is where Dan is spending a lot of his time in his first 75 days or so."

And it's the infrequent shopper, the one that maybe comes 2, 3, 4x a year, tends to come in the holiday season, they didn't come back at the rate we thought even though we ran some brand campaigns, we ran some -- so 2015, Devin and the team will continue strong marketing spend, consistent with the levels of '14, more focused on the top of the funnel. We'll continue to fill that SEO and those 2 things driving traffic. In addition, the product, as I mentioned earlier, the iPad new product is a good example of gearing more towards more the infrequent or new user that's not familiar with eBay. So Devin and team are trying to make the new person that's never used eBay, when they first arrived at eBay, make it easy, intuitive to use.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 earnings call. In a year marked by unexpected events and distractions, our double-digit revenue growth, solid earnings growth and strong cash flow reflect the fundamental strength of our company. We have some challenges, but overall, our focus and operating discipline delivered solid company performance in a year that, quite frankly, we're glad to see come to an end.
Before I talk more about Q4, let me take a moment to provide some context as we head into 2015, an important year of transition for our company. With the planned separation of eBay and PayPal in 2015, we are moving forward with clarity and speed. We're taking aggressive, decisive actions to address both the opportunities we see and the challenges we face. At the same time, we're creating sharper strategic focus at eBay and PayPal, and we're implementing more competitive cost structures in each business. All of these actions are designed to set up eBay and PayPal to succeed. We remain deeply committed to doing what's best for eBay and PayPal and to delivering sustainable value for shareholders. And we believe more strongly than ever that separation is the right path for our company.
Now let's take a look at the results for the quarter. We enabled $72 billion of commerce volume in the fourth quarter, up 21%. Mobile continues to be a major contributor. For Q4, mobile commerce volume was $17 billion, up 59%. And note, mobile now represents 23% of enabled commerce volume. Overall, revenue was up 9% in Q4 and non-GAAP EPS was up 10%. eBay and PayPal both generated double-digit customer growth, with PayPal reaching nearly 162 million active registered accounts and eBay exceeding 155 million active buyers.
At PayPal, Dan Schulman joined in Q4 as President and CEO Designee, and we're excited to have him on our leadership team. Dan is quickly immersing himself in all aspects of PayPal's business and providing strong, focused leadership on 2015 priorities and on positioning PayPal for continued competitive success. PayPal had another strong quarter, finishing a very strong year. Merchant Services TPV grew 36% on an FX-neutral basis in Q4 and revenue was up 18% on an FX-neutral basis.
Throughout the holiday season, PayPal drove strong consumer engagement, adding nearly 5 million active accounts and processing record payments volume. PayPal continues to deliver great product experiences that offer choice and flexibility for consumers and help merchants grow their business. For example, PayPal's One Touch has continued its international expansion effort. And for both consumers and merchants, PayPal extended its credit offerings, including adding installment payment options, and PayPal Working Capital launched in Australia and the U.K., offering merchants more convenient ways to invest in and grow their businesses. In a rapidly changing global payments environment, we believe that PayPal is positioned to leverage its global footprint, digital payments leadership and unique competitive strengths.
Turning to eBay Marketplaces. Q4 was disappointing. Significant events in 2014 have disrupted our ecosystem and overwhelmed the progress we were making on a number of fronts, impacting our performance. We have experienced these ecosystem disruptions before, and they simply take time to work through and correct.
Here's what's happened and here's what we're doing about it. First, the password reset and SEO changes significantly impacted traffic, which did not recover in the second half as expected. eBay's loyal customers are back following the reset of our passwords, but our more occasional customers have not returned as quickly as expected in Q4. And the SEO changes significantly diminished eBay's presence in natural search results, which impacted new user growth in the second half and had a cumulative effect on Q4 results.
Second, a stronger dollar impacted eBay's cross-border trade, depressing U.S. exports and affecting Q4 results for North America. In total, we simply underestimated the combined effect of these events on eBay's ecosystem. And these events occurred in a more competitive environment, where eCommerce and omnichannel players are upping their game.
But these are not excuses and this is not business as usual. In this environment, we need to sharpen our strategic focus and execute better. And Devin Wenig and his team are doing just that. They are moving decisively and aggressively with clear priorities: first, improve traffic and conversion; second, deliver strong product experiences that engage our target customers; and third, manage our cost structure to help fund investments that reengage eBay buyers. We're also sharpening our strategy with greater focus on the core consumer segment where we believe eBay can win savvy shoppers who love great value, unique selection, discovery and engagement. And we're redeploying resources to our top priorities and scaling back or stopping other initiatives.
That said, 2015 will be another challenging year, and we expect eBay's performance to soften further before we see stabilization and improvement. We still have work to do.
However, eBay continues to be a great business. In 2014, eBay enabled $83 billion in GMV and generated $3 billion in free cash flow. And even at low growth rates expected for 2014 -- '15, eBay can still deliver strong cash flows at healthy margins. Separation strongly supports eBay's need to focus on where it can win and to fully align its strategy, cost structure and capital allocation. And that's good for eBay's customers and for eBay's shareholders.
Turning briefly to eBay Enterprise. Gross merchandise sales in Q4 were up 9% and revenue was up 9%. eBay Enterprise is a good business, and Craig Hayman is bringing a sharper strategic focus to how eBay Enterprise can compete and win as a leading commerce partner to brands and retailers. We're taking a closer look at eBay Marketplaces and eBay Enterprise going forward, and it's clear that the 2 businesses have increasingly divergent opportunities. As a result, we've decided to explore strategic alternatives for eBay Enterprise, including a full or partial sale or IPO. Until this process is complete, we do not anticipate commenting further.
In summary, we are on the right strategic path, and we're acting decisively and aggressively as we position eBay and PayPal for success. We're sharpening our strategic focus and streamlining our cost structure and our portfolio, and we're creating operating agreements that preserve both synergies and strategic flexibility.
Regarding our cost structure. Our decision announced today to eliminate approximately 2,400 positions, or about 7% of our global workforce, was a difficult one. Eliminating jobs is never easy. But these decisions were necessary at eBay, PayPal and eBay Enterprise to simplify the organizations, reduce complexity, speed decision-making and create competitive cost structures.
Before closing, I want to update you on our progress toward creating 2 strong boards for eBay and PayPal. NBCUniversal executive Bonnie Hammer joined our board earlier this month. And today, I'm pleased to announce the addition of seasoned Wall Street executives Perry Traquina and Frank Yeary. Bonnie, Perry and Frank will bring tremendous value and expertise to our current board.
In addition, we announced today an agreement with Carl Icahn, our largest active shareholder. This agreement reflects our alignment on separation and our shared belief in the benefits of avoiding distraction. As part of this agreement, Icahn Capital executive Jonathan Christodoro will be joining our board as our fourth new director. We look forward to welcoming Jonathan to the board.
Looking ahead, we are clear in what we need to do to deliver our 2015 plans and ensure a smooth separation process, and we'll continue to do what's best for our business, for our customers and for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who will provide more details on the quarter, and then we'll take questions."
27862,275176206,747762,"eBay Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast.In the fourth quarter, we enabled $72 billion of commerce volume on behalf of our customers. Mobile commerce volume was $17 billion, up 59% f",2506,"Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast.
In the fourth quarter, we enabled $72 billion of commerce volume on behalf of our customers. Mobile commerce volume was $17 billion, up 59% from last year. Revenue was $4.9 billion, up 9%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90, up 10%. We generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, and we bought back $1.2 billion of stock. 
In Q4, we generated net revenues of $4.9 billion, up 9%. Organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter. Braintree contributed approximately 1 point of growth, while currency negatively impacted growth by roughly 2 points. We delivered revenue near the high end of the guidance range despite the impact of the stronger dollar, which impacted revenue by approximately $30 million since our guidance in October.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90, up 10%. EPS growth was driven by 9% top line growth and lower share count, partially offset by lower operating margins. Operating margins declined by 150 basis points due to the higher customer service and site ops cost and slightly higher operating expenses.
A little more color on operating expenses, which were 41% of revenue in the quarter, up 50 basis points. The biggest driver was sales and marketing, up 70 basis points. The incremental spend was to drive traffic at Marketplaces and to drive comprehension and usage by our customers at PayPal. We gained operating leverage on our G&A line, which was down 110 basis points.
We generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter, and CapEx was 8% of revenue. We had excellent free cash flow for the full year 2014, ending with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $14.6 billion, including $4.5 billion in the U.S. During the year, we generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow. We lowered our cost of capital by repurchasing 88 million shares of stock and issuing $3.5 billion in debt at attractive rates. And we funded our PayPal Credit portfolio primarily using our offshore cash. We have significant capacity to capitalize 2 independent companies while providing them each with the financial flexibility to invest and grow.
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a great quarter and a strong close to an excellent year. For the first time, we achieved revenues of more than $2 billion in the quarter, reaching $2.2 billion, up 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong account growth and accelerating transaction growth, which was partially offset by a 3-point sequential deceleration on eBay growth. More than 50% of PayPal's revenues came from outside the U.S.
A few quick comments on PayPal operating metrics. Total active accounts growth was 13%, with rising engagement per account. TPV, on an FX-neutral basis, grew 27%, with Merchant Services FX-neutral TPV increasing 36%. Transaction margins remained well above the 60% level, while we continue to expand off of eBay, grow large merchant ubiquity and accelerate Braintree growth with merchants and consumers. PayPal's segment margin declined 370 basis points to 22% due to increased investment in Braintree, product, brand as well as costs from onetime regulatory matters.
Now let's turn to the Marketplaces business. Marketplaces delivered $2.3 billion in revenue, up 5% on an FX-neutral basis, a challenging close to a tough year. FX-neutral transaction revenue grew 3%, while marketing services revenue grew 12%, helped by strong growth of our global classifieds business. StubHub continued to detract from revenue due to a lower take rate from the pricing changes earlier in the year. eBay is a good business, but we have real challenges that we're working our way through. And as John mentioned, it's going to get worse before it gets better. 
A little more on what's going on. Since the fourth quarter of last year, our GMV has decelerated by 7 points globally and 11 points in the U.S., our largest and most competitive market. Our ecosystem has simply been disrupted. While volume through the first 5 months of the year was roughly stable, a series of factors have contributed to the second half decline, and we're wrestling with 3 fundamental challenges.
First, traffic. Traffic growth has decelerated by 7 points in the year. The drivers include both the decline in new buyers at the top of the funnel due to the SEO changes and occasional buyers not returning to our site or buying less frequently.
Secondly, FX-neutral selling prices on the site have declined 4 points over last year. This is a bit of a catch-22 for us. As we've made it easier for sellers from around the world to surface their inventory to global buyers, selection has increased from lower-priced regions. In addition, mobile has become a greater percentage of our mix, which skews more towards emerging markets and a younger demographic who tend to buy lower-priced items.
And third, as John mentioned, cross-border trade. We have a large cross-border trade business, and our U.S. business is a next -- is a net exporter. And the stronger the U.S. dollar -- and the stronger U.S. dollar slowed our cross-border flows.
The implication of these challenges has resulted in a deceleration in the 3-month active buyer growth to 5%, well below our 12-month active buyer growth of 11%. This is why things will get worse in the first half of 2015 before they get better in the second half of the year. That said, we're not standing still. We're taking decisive actions to focus the business in an effort to simplify and speed up decision-making while creating incremental capacity to invest to improve both traffic and technology. We're investing in marketing, improving product design and strengthening the SEO workflow to a more sustainable format. And we are prioritizing our resources towards our core shoppers and doubling down on areas of strength like our $2 billion eBay Deals business.
So let me put the Marketplace performance into perspective. In what I would characterize as a very difficult year, eBay remains the 28th most valuable brand in the world. It has a great business model with low capital intensity, which generated $3 billion in free cash flow in 2014. We have our hand on the issues and we're working through them as we enter 2015.
Now let's turn to eBay Enterprise. eBay Enterprise generated $1.9 billion in gross merchandise sales for its clients. GMS grew 9%, driven by the addition of new logos and same-store sales growth of 12%. Revenue was $443 million, up 9%. Segment margins for eBay Enterprise came in at 15.5%, relatively flat from last year.
So before we turn to 2015, let me step back and give a brief summary of our full year 2014 performance. We enabled $255 billion of commerce volume for merchants and consumers globally, which accelerated 2 points to 24%. PayPal enabled $228 billion of TPV, up 27%; eBay enabled $83 billion of GMV, up 8%; and eBay Enterprise enabled $4.7 billion of GMS, up 13%. Mobile commerce volume was $54 billion, up 66%. Revenue grew 12% and non-GAAP EPS grew 9%. And through this tough year, we managed to generate $4.4 billion in free cash flow. And we bought back $4.7 billion of stock and reduced our shares outstanding by roughly 5%. Not the worst performance, but a year we're glad to have behind us.
So with that, let me turn to our priorities for 2015. They're really twofold: first, execute on our business plans; and second, create the 2 world-class independent platforms. Let me talk to each. 
Executing our business plans. We are taking actions to streamline and simplify this cost structure in each of the businesses, and we're eliminating approximately 2,400 positions across the company, roughly 7% of the global workforce. And we're pursuing the sale or IPO of the eBay Enterprise so we are focused on our 2 core businesses. We are focusing our growth initiatives where we believe we have true competitive advantages and leveraging our large and growing customer bases. And during the year, we'll produce strong cash flow and opportunistically reduce our share count.
The second major workstream for us is positioning 2 great standalone companies. We believe the key criteria for success are: an operating agreement that provides strategic flexibility while preserving synergies and minimizing dis-synergies; a capital structure that provides each business a flexibly that enables its investment priorities; and creating 2 world-class boards of directors.
Now let me turn to guidance specifically, and then I'll provide an update on where we are on the separation process. We are projecting 2015 revenues of $18.6 billion to $19.1 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of 7% to 10%. We expect FX to impact revenue by approximately $600 million or roughly 3 points of growth as the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus the euro, pound and the Australian dollar by 12%, 8% and 10%, respectively. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $3.05 to $3.15, up 3% to 7% versus 2014, with our non-GAAP effective tax rate stable in the 19% to 20% range. And we expect to generate greater than $4 billion in free cash flow for the year with CapEx of 8% to 10% of revenues.
We have a lot of moving pieces in 2015, so I wanted to provide a bit more transparency on what is driving or detracting from our non-GAAP EPS expectations for the year. There are 5 key drivers. 
As we mentioned earlier, we are reducing our global workforce by roughly 7%. This will result in a GAAP charge of approximately $100 million in the first quarter and generate savings in 2015 of more than $300 million across the company. But the savings will be reinvested to drive growth.
Second, we will add approximately $1 billion to the top line in 2015. This top line growth, coupled with strong margins across our businesses, will generate $0.30 per share of earnings.
Third, we repurchased $4.7 billion in shares of common stock in 2014. And our Board of Directors has approved an increase of our outstanding authorization by $2 billion, leaving $3 billion authorization remaining. We plan to offset dilution from our comp base programs and continue to opportunistically reduce our share count in 2015. This will add approximately $0.10 per share to EPS.
Fourth, the strong dollar will have a large negative impact from a translation perspective and will create a headwind for cross-border trade growth. Translation, net of hedges, will negatively impact EPS by $0.10 to $0.15 per share in the year.
And fifth, the dis-synergy costs associated with the separation will add approximately $200 million of ongoing cost in 2015 or approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
With that as context for eBay Inc.'s guidance and the drivers of EPS from 2014 to 2015, let me provide a little more context by business unit. For PayPal, we expect 15% to 18% growth on an FX-neutral basis. We have strong momentum in the core business. We are expanding credit both internationally and with small merchants, and we are extending our reach with Braintree. Slower on-eBay growth and lower monetization from Braintree and large merchants will partially offset the strong volume growth.
For PayPal, we are expecting segment margins of 24% to 25%, up 1 to 2 points versus 2014. We are expecting transaction margin compression due to lower take rate and higher operating expenses as we invest in growth priorities. These will be offset by strong operating leverage and the benefits from our Q1 headcount reduction and anticipated gains on PayPal's FX hedges.
For eBay, we expect FX-neutral revenue growth between 0 and 5%, with the first half growth slower than the second half as we look to rebuild our active buyer base. We expect segment margins of 37% to 39%, flat versus 2014. We are taking actions to streamline our cost structure in the first quarter, and we'll reinvest in product, sales and marketing while improving site security, stability and site speed. While growth is lower than we'd like, we'll be disciplined in our approach and the business will generate strong cash flows.
For eBay Enterprise, we expect FX-neutral revenue growth of 5% to 8% with segment margins of 5% to 10%, greater than 2014. As John mentioned, this is a good business but has increasingly divergent opportunities with eBay, and therefore, we are pursuing a sale or IPO.
As we move to become independent companies and fully allocate cost, we expect the business unit segment margins to be impacted by 3 to 4 points from corporate overhead and approximately 1 point from the dis-synergies associated with the separation. From a tax rate perspective, we expect the standalone tax rate for PayPal to be lower than eBay Inc.'s tax rate and the eBay Marketplaces and eBay Enterprise to be higher than the eBay Inc. tax rate.
Next, I'd like to switch gears and give you an update on where we are related to separation. As I mentioned earlier, there are 3 primary workstreams we are focused on to set up these 2 businesses to succeed.
First, the separation itself. Our guiding principle has been to move as swiftly as possible to set up each business to be fully self-sufficient and put in transitional service agreements where time, complexity and/or costs become an impediment. At this stage, we expect to incur approximately $200 million of ongoing cost, which is in line with our expectations. The dis-synergy costs are associated with separating data centers, infrastructure and IT-related task as we migrate from of shared services-type environment to a path towards self-sufficiently -- self-sufficiency. Additionally, there'll be facilities costs associated with separating shared facilities and G&A-related costs associated with creating 2 public companies.
The second major workstream has been capital structure. Our guiding principle here has been to ensure each business is well capitalized with financial flexibility to pursue their strategic priorities, whether it is the resources to fund growth or the flexibility to return cash to shareholders. We have a great balance sheet, and at this stage, we feel increasingly confident that we can achieve our objectives. Our intentions are to sufficiently capitalize eBay with net cash of approximately $2 billion with significant debt capacity and leave PayPal with approximately $5 billion of net cash. We believe we can accomplish this in a tax-efficient manner.
The third critical workstream relates to the operating agreement between the 2 companies. Our guiding principle here has been to provide each business with a strategic flexibility to maximize its independent potential while maintaining the synergies that have been captured and created over the years. At this stage, we're making good progress, but at the same time, we have lots to do.
Overall, from a separation standpoint, we are on track to file our initial Form 10 by the end of February, and we are increasingly confident in our ability to effect the separation in the second half of this year.

On the PayPal take rate, there's really been one dynamic that has been driving take rate for quite a bit of time now. And it primarily focuses on opportunities we see to expand our served market and enter new areas. And they've come in 3 forms. One, credit. As we expand our credit portfolio, all else equal, our monetization on credit-related transactions is higher. Secondly, as we expand with larger merchants over time, all else equal, our take rate has a tendency to be lower. And then third, as we expand into new markets, the shared economy through Braintree, our take rate has a tendency to be lower. So in all 3 cases, we've expanded our served market. The implications are a lower take rate, and yet we're still able to generate 60% transaction margins. As we project going forward, there will continue to be take rate on -- sorry, pressure on PayPal's take rate, and it's going to be primarily because of our success with the growth of Braintree and the growth of PayPal ubiquity in large merchants. And we expect that trend of a compressed take rate to continue to come down going forward."

And what this is grounded in is an increasingly competitive environment that requires us to sharpen and focus the Marketplace strategy. And as I mentioned earlier, we talked a lot over the last several years about the lines between eCommerce and mobile and offline blurring [ph], the taking of $1 trillion market and making it a $10 trillion market, and that's still the case. But Marketplace in this competitive world is going to focus on the $4 trillion where our core consumers align with our competitive strengths. This is where we think we can win. And in particular it's -- in simplest terms, it's not the convenience consumer. It's the average and -- I'm sorry, the avid shopper, the person who loves great value, loves selection, loves shopping. That's the majority of our current customer base, and that actually is 40% of the market, $4 trillion. And so Devin and team are more focused on -- focusing on what specifically that consumer wants than ever before. So an example, that consumer wants great deals, so we're growing our Deals business. We're growing the $2 billion Deals business and putting less emphasis on adding more full-priced inventory on the site. On delivery, our core consumer wants free delivery or they want to buy online and pick it up in store so they don't pay for delivery and they get to shop. And we're spending less on same-day delivery, which is really something that's geared toward the convenience user. Similarly, on trust, our core consumer likes eBay buyer guarantee. That's what they like, and there's some other trust initiatives that have less value. So it's really a re-prioritization on the more specific focused things that our core consumer represent, and we want to grow our $80 billion marketplace into the $4 trillion opportunity."

However, we said operating margins would improve by 1 to 2 points. And while transaction margins are coming down and we'll be continuing to invest quite a bit, a simplified org [ph] structure and quite a bit of G&A leverage will help contribute to the 1 to 2 points of margin growth. Your second question on card present rates, I'll just say within our wallet or our funding mix, we're always looking for instruments that give consumers choice and that, all else equal, given that choice allows us to deliver a proposition for merchants that addresses their -- one of their key criteria, which is, PayPal, how can you help me lower my cost? So we are always looking for opportunities to add instruments and/or use our leverage and/or technology to lower processing costs within the wallet to offset pressures that come with a lower take rate, and we'll continue to do that in '15 and beyond."

One Touch, which is the way that we can have -- with One Touch, consumers can pay with PayPal with One Touch on any Braintree or PayPal-enabled mobile app. v.zero, which is the Braintree next-generation platform which started out with third-party developers and small merchants and is now working its way. We're building our whole next-generation PayPal core platform on it. Installments credit, we've rolled out installments credit with Apple online in the U.K. and Germany and that will come to the U.S. That's a way to allow a merchant to give more choice to consumers and allows the consumer to be able to buy an item, a high-priced or lower-priced item, with great convenience. And then both businesses, mobile continues to be a major source of innovation. PayPal's got its new Mobile SDK. And if I turn to the Marketplace in the midst of what was a very challenging year, to be clear, we got that. But mobile GMV was up 42% for the year. Mobile GMV and eBay's mobile GMV was $28 billion. And you saw the iPad app that we launched right before Christmas. That is the freshest, I think, most innovative mobile experience that eBay has built in years. And it's geared importantly to infrequent users or new users. If you check it out, it's fresh. If you've never used eBay before, you can come in and it's engaging and intuitive. And so throughout all the challenges the marketplace has right now and all the operational execution they're focused on, we are -- Marketplace is still focused on innovations like its mobile experience, like live auctions and other things. So there is no lack of attention for innovation across other business."

You'll begin to see PayPal's peer-to-peer and Venmo peer-to-peer converge toward where we're leveraging a common back end. And so that Mobile SDK and One Touch are increasingly converging. So it has both absolute value of getting us into the fastest-growing segment of the market, the sharing economy apps. But it's also, I think, increasingly innovation and the freshness of PayPal's core products.

Your third question, I think, just related to hedges. I mean, in effect, our -- to make it simple, our PayPal international business is a dollar-functional currency, which allows us to put in place economic hedges for projected revenue. We don't have that luxury for the eBay business. It's not dollar functional.

So in the -- I think, the first 75 days, what he's come away saying, very impressed with PayPal's unique assets, its global footprint, our risk capabilities. He keeps saying our risk capabilities are phenomenal, our brand, and the opportunity to extend and expand that brand across consumers and across merchants is significant. So what he's bringing is a greater focus. I would say one of the challenges PayPal has always had is there's too many opportunities. And there's greater focus in the 2015 plan, which -- that I've seen in the last several years: focused on product, extending Braintree, extending One Touch, extending Venmo; secondly, on expanding things like our credit offering, which increase our relevance both to merchants and to consumers; and then marketing. PayPal really did marketing for the first time in 2014, and we had pretty clear positive return on investment. It was one of the contributors to those very high growth rates. Dan brings a lot of consumer marketing experience, and the 2015 plan continues and has even more marketing. So the 2015 plan, which is, in many ways, a continuation of the current with more sharp focus is -- he's got his footprints on it or handprints on it. And then he's simplifying the organization to accelerate innovation. So you'll get a chance to hear from him in the second quarter.

On the merchant side, just geographically, you see more growth outside of the U.S. than you see in the U.S. So PayPal's global footprint continues to expand.

So large merchants, size of merchant becomes increasingly relevant. And then in the developer community and particularly where Braintree pulls us through into the shared the economy, it's a different set more -- can be more service oriented versus merchants that are strictly product oriented. So on the merchant side, geographic, more international, size, more large and type increasing service versus just product. On the consumer side, just from the nature of the growth in mobile, you see that the increased frequency of PayPal's user is increasingly technology savvy and has embraced mobile. And product, coupled with that dynamic and the customer base, has allowed the PayPal consumer to be more technology savvy. But I would maybe follow up on John's point that we've made tremendous progress on the merchant side, but with Dan on board on the consumer side and the relevancy of PayPal products to consumers to use more frequently is where Dan is spending a lot of his time in his first 75 days or so."

We'll continue to fill that SEO and those 2 things driving traffic. In addition, the product, as I mentioned earlier, the iPad new product is a good example of gearing more towards more the infrequent or new user that's not familiar with eBay. So Devin and team are trying to make the new person that's never used eBay, when they first arrive at eBay, make it easy, intuitive to use. And so both marketing and product are very focused on that.

Before I turn it over to Dan and Devin, let me briefly recap where we are in the separation process. As you know, last September, we announced our decision to separate eBay and PayPal into independent publicly traded companies. Separation will enable each business to operate with greater focus and strategic agility and better positioned to capitalize on their respective growth opportunities. 
We believe more than ever that separation is the best path for eBay and PayPal and the right approach to delivering sustainable value to shareholders. We're moving forward with clarity and speed. We passed a significant milestone in Q1 with the initial filing of PayPal's Form 10, and we filed our First Amendment earlier this month with additional information. We expect separation to occur in the third quarter. 
The operating agreement between eBay and PayPal is designed to preserve synergies while giving each business the strategic flexibility to pursue growth opportunities. Highlights of the operating agreement include: first, economics in the form of incentive payments designed to maintain PayPal's current penetration rate of approximately 80%; second, data sharing that enables each company to provide great customer service and maintain world-class risk, trust and fraud prevention programs; third, product development and service agreements that ensure PayPal devotes resources to developing new payments, product and services for eBay, preserving a high level of service quality; and fourth, noncompete agreements that encourage eBay and PayPal to continue their strong partnership.
The operating agreement is designed to set up eBay and PayPal to succeed as independent companies. Meanwhile, Dan and Devin are building out their leadership teams and driving sharper strategic focus on the opportunities ahead. You'll hear more from them in a moment.
In Q1, we also announced 2 new board members: Tony Bates and Gail McGovern. This is in addition to our previous announcements of new board members, Bonnie Hammer, Frank Yeary, Perry Traquina and Jonathan Christodoro. We feel very good about our ability to create 2 world-class boards for eBay and PayPal at separation.
In summary, we remain deeply committed to doing what's best for eBay and PayPal and to delivering sustainable value for shareholders. Looking ahead, we are clear on what we need to do to deliver on our 2015 plans and ensure a smooth separation process. We'll continue to do what's best for our business, for our customers and for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Dan Schulman, who'll provide more details on PayPal."

PayPal is off to a solid start for the year and I like our current trajectory and progress. We grew our revenues 17% on an FX-neutral basis, and our Merchant Services TPV continued to climb in the first quarter, growing 33% year-over-year, more than double the pace for the eCommerce market, indicating we gained meaningful share. 
Our growth and the new capabilities we are building position us well as we look towards the future. There are 4 key metrics that I believe measure the growth and health of our business. They are: one, our top line growth; two, the growth of our account base, which demonstrates our skill; three, the engagement of that base as measured by revenue per active account; and four, free cash flow. 
These metrics are my top priorities as they measure the progress of our strategic initiatives, which are to grow ubiquity, increase engagement of both merchants and consumers and produce a strong return for investors. We showed good progress in all of these areas in the first quarter.
First, the top line. The 17% revenue growth we delivered is a strong foundation to build on as we move into 2015. Second, we continue our steady growth in customer accounts, increasing total active accounts by 3.6 million to 165 million customers across the globe. We expect strong growth to continue in 2015 as we further penetrate the merchant population and build out our products and services to grow more and more relevant to consumers.
Third, our customer engagement also steadily increased, with transactions per account growing to 23 in Q1 from 21 in the first quarter a year ago. This -- we processed as well more than 1 billion transactions in the first quarter. This represents an increase of 24% year-over-year. And importantly, our monetization per account accelerated sequentially to $49. 
We also continued to see an increase in mobile payments transactions, now reaching nearly 30% of our overall transactions with mobile payments transactions growing over 40% year-over-year. Our Merchant Services business now represents 76% of total volume, growing at 33%. And we increased our penetration on eBay by 260 basis points year-over-year. 
We continue to improve our penetration of the top online merchants, reaching 74% of the IR 100 merchants in the U.S. Braintree maintained its strong triple-digit growth in the first quarter and signed some great new accounts, including Lyft, and One Kings Lane. 
The fourth key metric for PayPal is free cash flow. We took significant cost actions in Q1 to streamline our operations and free up capacity. As a result, we expect segment margins to be up 1 to 2 points on a year-over-year basis for the full year 2015 as we discussed in January. We do expect to reinvest additional margin leverage to continue to expand our business in order to generate significant long-term returns for shareholders. 
At the same time, we are committed to growing free cash flow. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, including onetime costs associated with separation. We are currently in one of the most exciting periods in the history of financial services. 
Today, PayPal operates in 2 fast-growing parts of the digital payments industry: online and mobile. Both online and off-line payments world are digitizing and converging through mobile experiences. As a result, I believe our addressable market is not just the $2.5 trillion [ph] associated with online and mobile but more like the $25 trillion [ph] associated with commerce, both online and off-line. PayPal has a powerful set of assets, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the changes sweeping through our industry.
To capitalize on this opportunity, we are in the midst of a massive transformation, completely rebuilding our technology platform, enabling greater scale, faster production cycles and closer collaboration between teams so we can continuously deliver better products to our customers. PayPal now has one of the largest hybrid clouds in the world, and we have transformed our core business capabilities into robust service-based platforms. 
PayPal's newly modernized technology platform is becoming a strategic asset. In revamping our technology and processes, we are dramatically reducing our product development cycles, allowing us to deploy software releases in weeks versus months. 
We're also accelerating through strategic acquisitions. In March, we announced the acquisition of CyActive, which will play a key role within our Security Center of Excellence.

discipline to get it done. I'm excited about where we are, what we are building and about PayPal's strong position and potential in this dynamic market. Thanks a lot, and I'll now turn it over to Devin to discuss eBay's results."

It's great to have the chance today to share my thoughts about eBay's Q1 performance and our plans for the future. Let's start with the quarter.
eBay had a good quarter 1, showing signs of stabilization. Let me share some key metrics. GMV and 3-month trailing active buyers each grew 5%, consistent with the prior quarter. Overall traffic, including mobile, grew at steady rates as well. International GMV on an FX-neutral basis grew 7%, a 1-point acceleration from Q4 and sold item growth was 9%, also a 1-point acceleration. In addition, StubHub and eBay Classifieds both performed well. 
After the challenges faced in 2014 and following 2 sequential quarters of declining growth, our quarter 1 results are encouraging. I'm pleased with how our team is executing and delivering. We are certainly not ready to declare a victory over last year's SEO and password reset challenges but we are making progress. 
SEO-generated traffic is still impacting growth. While this channel is beginning to stabilize, effectively managing SEO traffic is a constantly evolving process. We're working this to stay out front of it. Also following the password reset, we're making ongoing investments to ensure we have a stable secure platform for our users. We're focused on increasing user engagement and confidence over time. Steady progress but we're just getting started. We have more work to do to ensure we deliver consistent, sustainable performance and accelerate growth. 
Let me step back now and provide broader context. I'll focus the rest of my remarks on our path forward and the tremendous opportunities we see ahead. eBay turns 20 this year. In our industry and in Silicon Valley, that's an extraordinary milestone. eBay helped define the beginning of eCommerce, and we intend to continue being a leader in its future. 
Over the past 2 decades, eBay has created tremendous assets and deep global commerce expertise. We're launching the next chapter with a passionate community of 25 million sellers. They offer incredible diverse selection and value through 800 million listings, and we have a global base of more than 157 million active buyers who generate nearly $83 billion of GMV annually. I believe that as we begin creating the next 20 years of global commerce leadership for eBay, that's a great place to start.
We intend to lead by focusing on 3 strategic pillars: first, building a more robust commerce platform; second, engaging the core buyer and seller segments who create a vibrant marketplace and fuel our commerce flywheel; and third, creating exceptional product and brand experiences. A robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace, exceptional customer experiences, that's our formula for success. Let me touch on each area.
First, managing a robust commerce platform is essential to creating sustainable performance. We're focused on building a stronger, more resilient foundation. We'll move towards becoming the world's first online global marketplace to use structured catalog data at scale for all listings. We believe that doing so will help us deliver an exceptional unmatched experience for both buyers and sellers. 
At the same time, we'll diversify our sources of traffic and customer acquisition, leveraging promising early trends on social and messaging platforms. eBay will have multiple robust channels competing for our marginal investment dollar. This requires a transformation in our attack and our marketing, which is already under way. The result, a more competitive eBay with more control over our experience and ultimately, our performance.
Creating a vibrant marketplace is our second pillar. eBay is at its best when we bring diverse inventory at great value to customers who love to shop. Our core buyer and seller segments make eBay the world's most vibrant marketplace to find, discover and buy practically anything. eBay's consumers love to shop. They hunt for value at different price points. They demand broad selection and they enjoy discovering unique things that express their personality. For these consumers who represent our broad, addressable and growing market, we intend to make eBay the global destination for great value and selection. 
Ensuring a trusted marketplace is foundational, and we'll continue making investments in this area. We also will run our business more by category. We will sharpen how we merchandise our sellers' inventory, presenting eBay's unique range of choice and value in new and innovative ways. 
On the seller's side, eBay's sweet spot is small and medium-size merchants and brands. They represent 70% of the global retail market, offering the diverse inventory and value our consumers are looking for. As a partner and not a competitor to SMBs, we intend to make eBay the global platform for them to grow and to thrive. We will offer improved seller tools, unmatched access to data and more balanced and predictable policies and standards.
Consumer selling is another key eBay strength, and we intend to revitalize this segment of our market. An estimated $100 billion of value is trapped in people's closets and garages and that's just in the U.S. This is an enormous opportunity. With simplified listing flows, predictive pricing data and higher touch intermediation for those that require it, we intend to make eBay the platform for consumers to buy and sell anything, anytime, anywhere. 
And finally, our third pillar, creating exceptional product and brand experiences. eBay is a powerful global brand, and we'll strengthen that brand by delivering exceptional engaging product experiences. Some of our recent launches such as our iPad app and our launch of live auctions are great examples of what we can do and we will do going forward. We will continue to substantially upgrade the buying and selling experience on eBay with much more to come this year.
In summary, Q1 was a good start, and I'm confident in our full year outlook, including generating $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion of free cash flow. Going forward, we intend to play our game, no one else's and focus where eBay can win. Global commerce trends such as the impact of mobile on consumer behavior and the influence of digital on retail favor many of our core strengths. We'll take advantage of this. 
We've assembled a world-class management team with deep technology, retail, data and customer service expertise. And as we take eBay forward, we will operate with clarity and with discipline. We will pursue thoughtful capital allocation strategies that deliver compelling shareholder value while maximizing our strategic flexibility.
It is an incredible privilege to be eBay's next CEO, building on our extraordinary heritage and leading this iconic brand forward. My team and I are excited to be creating eBay's next chapter, and I look forward to sharing more with you in the months ahead. And with that, I will turn it over to Bob."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Q1 was a great start to the year. We delivered $4.4 billion of total revenue and $0.77 of non-GAAP EPS. We generated $829 million in free cash flow and repurchased $1 billion of our stock. We are making excellent progress on our plans to separate PayPal from eBay, and we currently anticipate a third quarter close.
In Q1, we generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 4% with strength across the board. Organic revenue growth was 9% in the quarter, and currency negatively impacted growth by approximately 5 points. We delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range despite the impact of the stronger dollar, which negatively impacted Q1 revenue by approximately $30 million since the guidance we provided in January.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 10%. EPS growth was driven by a strong FX-neutral revenue growth, good operating leverage across the company and a lower share count. 
Operating expenses were 41% of revenue in the quarter, down 120 basis points, driven primarily by the benefits from the steps both Dan and Devin took to streamline their respective businesses, partially offset by provision for transaction loan losses and increased regulatory cost for PayPal. We generated free cash flow of $829 million in the quarter and CapEx was 7% of revenue.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $14.1 billion, including approximately $4.1 billion in the U.S. eBay ended the quarter with $11.7 billion and PayPal with $2.4 billion in cash.
We are taking steps to continue to strengthen our balance sheet to provide both businesses with the financial flexibility to pursue their strategic and capital priorities. First, we continue to fund an increasing portion of our loan portfolio balance with offshore cash, currently at 78% of total. Second, as part of internal structuring, we plan to move approximately $3.5 billion of cash to PayPal in a tax-efficient manner prior to separation. And third, we announced the sale of an 85% participation interest in a pool of U.S. PayPal credit receivables, which will free up approximately $700 million of incremental capacity in the U.S. to fund PayPal's growth. As a technology-enabled lender, credit is an important driver of our business but does not need to be funded by our balance sheet. As a result of this transaction, 2015 operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million.
eBay Inc. has an excellent balance sheet. As a result of these actions, both eBay and PayPal will be well capitalized at separation.
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue in Q1 was $2.1 billion, up 17% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong Merchant Services growth and rising engagement per user, which reflects the growing popularity and relevance of the PayPal value proposition throughout the world. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operating metrics. TPV on an FX-neutral basis grew 25%. Merchant Services FX-neutral TPV increased 33%. Transaction margin was down 80 basis points, driven by the rapid growth in Braintree volume and continued penetration of large merchants.
Segment margins declined 40 basis points, less than the drop in transaction margin. PayPal generated strong leverage from Dan's steps to streamline the business while still investing in Braintree to PayPal brand and credit.
Now let's turn to the Marketplaces business. As Devin indicated, Marketplaces showed signs of stabilization in Q1. Trailing 3-month active buyer growth and FX-neutral GMV were both 5%, flat with Q4 results. Marketplaces delivered $2.1 billion in revenue, up 3% on an FX-neutral basis. FX-neutral transaction revenue grew 3% while marketing services revenue grew 5%, helped by strong growth of our global Classifieds business.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operating metrics. 12-month active buyer growth was up 8%, and sold items growth increased to 9%. Total GMV grew 5%, with U.S. GMV up 2% and international GMV up 7% on an FX-neutral basis. We saw an acceleration of U.S. GMV, which is a measure of consumer buying, which accelerated by 1 point versus the fourth quarter. However, this acceleration was offset by a decline in cross-border trade due to the stronger dollar.
Segment margin was down 50 basis points from last year. Devin took steps to streamline his organization in the first quarter and is reinvesting in the 3 priorities he highlighted: a robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace and exceptional customer experiences.
Now let's turn to eBay Enterprise. eBay Enterprise generated $1 billion in gross merchandise sales for its clients. GMS grew 8% and same-store sales grew 10%. Revenue was $288 million, up 7%. We continue to expand the enterprise relationships and are pleased to announce that Enterprise is now the #1 eCommerce platform, as measured by the 2015 Internet Retailer Top 500 guide. Segment margin for Enterprise came in at 4.8%, relatively flat from last year.
We continue to explore strategic alternatives for eBay Enterprise, including a full or partial sale or IPO and we'll update you as appropriate.
Now let me turn to guidance. We are off to a great start for the year. We are maintaining our full year guidance for FX-neutral revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS. However, the first quarter momentum will be offset by the impact of strengthening U.S. dollar, which will cost us approximately $250 million in revenue and $0.05 in non-GAAP EPS versus the full year guidance we provided in January. 
We are projecting 2015 revenues of $18.35 billion to $18.85 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5%. And we are projecting 2015 non-GAAP EPS of $3.05 to $3.15, up 3% to 7%. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $4 billion in free cash flow for the year, with CapEx of 8% to 10% of revenue. CapEx in 2015 will be higher due to onetime costs associated with separating the businesses.
Let me provide a little more context in how the U.S. -- the stronger U.S. dollar will impact our full year results. As you know, we have a very global business with 52% of our revenue and even a greater portion of our net income coming from outside the U.S. Additionally, the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the euro, pound and Australian dollar by 7%, 1% and 5%, respectively, versus when we guided in January. This is driving the impact on our guidance for the year. The Marketplaces business will bear the brunt of the impact from a stronger dollar, with greater than 2/3 of the $250 million or $175 million impacting Marketplaces revenue. Going forward, our earnings for the full year are reasonably well hedged, but Marketplaces revenue will continue to be exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen.
With that full year context, here's a closer look by business unit. The short story, on an FX-neutral basis, there is no change to the guidance we gave you in January. However, we wanted to provide you with additional details that would allow you to start to model the independent companies. 
First, a quick housekeeping item. Historically, we have provided segment margins by business unit. As we look to stand up 2 independent companies, we will transition to providing fully allocated operating margins, which include corporate costs, dis-synergies associated with the separation and the value transfer associated with the operating agreements. 
Earlier, John discussed the details of the operating agreements. We anticipate the financial implications to be an estimated value transfer of approximately $25 million to $50 million on an annualized basis from PayPal to eBay. 
So what does that mean for full year guidance by business unit? For PayPal, we continue to expect 15% to 18% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis. We expect that reported revenue at spot rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 3 points from the stronger U.S. dollar, net of hedges. We expect a 19% to 21% fully allocated non-GAAP operating margin, flat to up 1 point from 2014, which includes 4 to 5 points impact from costs to stand up PayPal as an independent company. And as Dan mentioned, we expect free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.
For eBay, we continue to expect FX-neutral revenue growth between 0% and 5%. We expect that reported revenue at spot rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 8 points from the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect fully allocated non-GAAP operating margin of 32% to 34%, flat with 2014. And this also includes 4- to 5-point impact from stand-up costs. And as Devin mentioned, we expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
In summary, we're off to a great start to the year. We've streamlined the organization and had better execution with strength across all 3 businesses. The full year FX-neutral revenue outlook is on track, but our strong Q1 momentum will be offset by the negative impact of the stronger dollar. We are making excellent progress on our plans to stand up 2 independent companies, and we expect to conclude the separation in the third quarter.

We grew up as a marketplace and eBay looks at the world historically through listings rather than products. Listings have -- gave eBay a tremendous selection advantage. It's why we have the most things for sale of any marketplace in the world. But listings are also transient. They come and go. They don't have link equity and they're hard to attach content to. So if you go back over eBay's history, there's been a pattern of SEO disruptions across various search engines. We now believe that the state of our business and our technology is that we can maintain the advantage given to us by a marketplace business model but include a structured data catalog, which gives us persistence and link equity and makes our sellers' inventory more discoverable, both on and off eBay. The way we're approaching that is it is a deep transformation. It's a multiyear process. We're approaching it by category but horizontally but also focusing on the vertical areas where we believe we can have the most impact early on. I'd say we're off to a good start but it's an early start. And it will take -- it is a multiyear transformation. But we do know that where we structured and catalogued our inventory, those items are more discoverable on eBay and they're more persistent and generate more traffic through search engines and other digital channels. So we feel good about the approach but it is not a short-term fix."

It is a very exciting opportunity in front of us, with addressable market that is expanding dramatically for us. Cash is digitizing, the world of money is digitizing. The way consumers manage and move their money is transforming technology platforms and fundamentally redefine that. And merchants are moving towards digital commerce where they can use mobile to get ever closer to their customers, drive engagement, drive incremental sales. And I think that PayPal is very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. We have a number of assets that we bring to that fight from our brand to our scale to our platform to our service, and I can talk about that in more detail later. But what we have said is that we will grow our segment margins this year by 1% to 2%. We feel very comfortable with that. We feel very comfortable that with the operating leverage that we have in this business, and the cost actions that I took earlier this year reducing headcount to really focus our cost, as well as increased economies of scale as we grow larger, are going to allow us to grow free cash flow in a disciplined fashion and yet have the investment dollars to invest in the opportunities that we see ahead. Those opportunities could be increased investments on our platform to speed up our ability to deliver capabilities, enhance capabilities, which you'll see us rolling out even this quarter going forward, new markets that we can move into. And so we feel, as we look at our model, that we have the operating leverage to maintain consistent margins and invest to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. And I feel comfortable with that -- with those investment dollars. I'd also point out one other thing that Bob mentioned is that PayPal is going to be extremely well-funded on its balance sheet as we go forward with perhaps some -- approximately $6 billion of funding of cash on our balance sheet, enabling us to look at not just organic growth but inorganic growth as well. And so when I look at all of those things together, I feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given and the investment opportunities we see."

When you combine the Paydiant platform with our platform at PayPal, you have probably, in my estimation, the world's leading mobile payments platform. And as I mentioned, as the online and the off-line world continue to converge together, driven by the confluence of mobile at that -- at the heart of that, the Paydiant acquisition enables us to move much more aggressively into that converged space, so into that off-line space. It also provides, on the consumer side, the ability to utilize things like private label cards, rewards. So it's got a host of capabilities that supplement what we have on the PayPal platform. So for both merchants and for consumers, it was an acquisition that enabled us to more aggressively and more quickly address that expandable market."

So thanks for your question, Gil. It's insightful. So the first thing I would just kind of take one step backwards and tell you, as you probably have seen, is we've kind of reorganized PayPal around merchants and consumers. And when we did that, we put Bill Reidy in charge of the merchant segment. Bill, as you know, is the CEO of Braintree. And what we really did by putting that together is really combine the Braintree platform and the PayPal platforms much more closely together, so that we're able to enable things like One Touch, not just on full site integrations and on mobile but into the PayPal base. We think that the world is moving increasingly towards mobile payments that we have with the combination now of Paydiant, Braintree and the PayPal platform, the leading mobile payments platform in the world. We did over 1 billion mobile payments transactions last year. You heard that this quarter, we're up 40% year-over-year. We're taking things like One Touch, and we want to put it right into our merchant on-boarding process that we have for PayPal. And so we are taking the things that we've learned through both Venmo and Braintree, putting them together with some of our other acquisitions to provide to our PayPal embedded base not only the services that you see now but services that we'll introduce even as of this quarter that will take us to a whole different level as a result of that integration together. That's question #1 that you asked, and I feel really good about that and excited about it. Number two was on NFC and do I feel like NFC is embedded enough to go after that? We are obviously doing trials around NFC ourselves at this point. But I think the real key and the thing that I believe in is that any great open technology payments platform has to have at its heart this idea of being technology-agnostic at the point-of-sale. Even though NFC is beginning to gain some momentum, it's still probably 2% to 5% of the point-of-sale terminals out there in the marketplace, maybe more on a transactional basis. But it's a small part. And I've seen many times where we think 1 technological standard is going to emerge and it's equipped by something else. And so what I would like the PayPal platform to be and what we're building towards and have a lot of capabilities already is the ability to be able to utilize your mobile phone but not just the NFC but QR codes, Bluetooth, HCE, really depends on what the merchant has upgraded towards. I think if you bet on a single technology, it's a risky proposition and it takes a lot longer to move into the marketplace. The second thing is I'm a big believer that you don't want to just enable a form factor change. We don't want to just substitute a card swipe for a phone tap. You really want to think about what is the value proposition change that you're going to do. How can you, with that phone tap, enable a merchant to get ever closer to their consumers through either rewards, loyalty, couponing, offers and associate that with the payment choice of type that a consumer wants to pay with? Whether it be a debit card, a credit card, private label, Bill Me Later, whatever it may be, that's what we want to provide. And so you're seeing us look at our platform, and our goal is to be the world's largest open digital payments platform. And to do that, we have to build with those tenets in mind."

It's -- what is it, 10% to 12% of overall commerce right now, growing at double-digit percentages. We've got 165 million consumers but there are huge swaths of the market where we're not even present right now. And you can be sure that we're looking at that because I think there's tremendous opportunity for us to take advantage of this online growth that's going on all over the world right now. At the same time, interestingly, you see retailers and merchants starting to think about how can they use mobile to dramatically change the way that they interact with their customers. And I call that really sort of digital commerce. How can retailers more personalize the experience for a customer when they walk into their store? And mobile can enable that. But it's difficult to do that. The merchant can certainly write the right application to talk with their customers, to engage with their customers. But underneath that, they need a platform to power that, whether it be to power their loyalty and rewards programs, to power any payment type that comes in. And we've talked about recently, this vision of us becoming much more of a partner for retailers and becoming sort of what we call the operating system for digital commerce, to be able to enable them to move into this digital commerce world. The advent of Paydiant, Braintree and PayPal all coming together is a real head start for us moving into that. And it's not so much that we want to move into the off-line world. It's that the off-line and online worlds are moving that way naturally, and they're moving that way through mobile. And that plays right into a strength that we have right now. And I think that's one element. And then on the consumer side, consumers are going to look to manage to move their money in different ways than they ever had before. Our transactions per active account are going up. The amount that people are spending with us are going up. We have a nice engaged base. But I believe that we can do so much more on that as we become a part of how consumers manage and move their money. We can move from being much more transactional to much more relational with them, and that is our aspiration and vision on that. So I think a lot of opportunities in numerous places."

So on PayPal Credit, Sanjay, we're a technology-enabled lender, and we do that because it makes sense for the partnership that we're enabling with merchants. It provides them additional value. They get to close more sales as a result of that. If we extend PayPal Working Capital to them, it obviously enables them to expand their business. When we do that, we see our customer satisfaction scores jump dramatically as a result of that. We see more volume come through those merchants. We see much lower churn with that. And so for merchants who avail themselves of that, a tremendous benefit. And for consumers, they get to complete a transaction that they might not have otherwise completed. For us, it takes a cost and converts it into a revenue, and so it's a win all the way round for that entire ecosystem. So we think providing credit makes sense in terms of what we're trying to do from a platform perspective. But just because we do that, as Bob articulated in his remarks, doesn't mean that we need to fund that through our own balance sheet. And so we think that providing the service is the right thing, but having the flexibility to what we want to do that through our balance sheet or not, there are multiple ways that we can look at that. What we just did is one example of funding that loan portfolio with other people's money. And that having the return of $700 million of cash to us on our domestic balance sheet, which obviously opens us up to being able to do other things with that. So that's question #1. Question #2 on the EU stuff. Look, there are regulatory changes that go on throughout the world. The European ones are ones that are on everybody's minds right now. Some of those regulatory impacts affect our cost structure. Some of those are going to affect pricing on certain -- some of them are going to affect how you do business in certain ways. And so we look at each and every one of those changes on a market-by-market basis and react accordingly to those. The one thing we definitely don't do is react publicly to those. We think about them and then we decide what the right way to react is on that. But this is nothing new, as you well know, Sanjay, you're an expert in all of this. There are changes going on all the time all over the world. And one of the assets, I think, PayPal brings to this world is we're 100% focused on digital payments. And one of the core competencies we have is our regulatory and compliance oversight. And so we are on top of all of these things all the time. In terms of the CFPB, we work with regulators over the world. And I will say this and this is probably the most important thing, is that there's no difference between what a regulator wants and what PayPal wants. We pride ourselves on being a customer champion, and regulators only want what's best for consumers and customers in general. And so we are very aligned philosophically on what we both want to provide. As the CFPB comes in and looks at the ways that we've done business, they may have suggestions on how we can do that better. And we certainly work with them to try and provide the best alternative to our consumers to make sure that we are as clear as possible in our communications and fully compliant with all regulations. And we, as in every single quarter, take a look at what exposures might be. We reserve for them appropriately. And that's a thing that we do every single quarter. So hopefully, that helps to answer all of your questions."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 earnings call. We had a strong first quarter, and despite currency headwinds pressuring top line growth, eBay and PayPal were off to a good start for the full year. I feel very good about the focus and performance of our teams at eBay and PayPal. Each business is executing well with greater focus and operating discipline as we prepare for separation.
Joining our call today are eBay CEO designee, Devin Wenig; and PayPal CEO designee, Dan Schulman. Devin and Dan will provide more perspective on Q1 performance for eBay and PayPal, respectively, as well as their views on the future opportunities and focus for each business. Bob will then provide full details on the quarter, including eBay Enterprise.
But let me provide some highlights. In the first quarter, eBay Inc. revenue was up 9% on an FX-neutral basis, with PayPal contributing 17% growth and eBay Marketplaces up 3%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 10%. For Q1, PayPal enabled $61 billion of payment volume, topping 165 million active accounts, and eBay drove $20 billion of gross merchandise volume, topping 157 million active buyers. 
Before I turn it over to Dan and Devin, let me briefly recap where we are in the separation process. As you know, last September, we announced our decision to separate eBay and PayPal into independent publicly traded companies. Separation will enable each business to operate with greater focus and strategic agility and better positioned to capitalize on their respective growth opportunities. 
We believe more than ever that separation is the best path for eBay and PayPal and the right approach to delivering sustainable value to shareholders. We're moving forward with clarity and speed. We passed a significant milestone in Q1 with the initial filing of PayPal's Form 10, and we filed our First Amendment earlier this month with additional information. We expect separation to occur in the third quarter. 
The operating agreement between eBay and PayPal is designed to preserve synergies while giving each business the strategic flexibility to pursue growth opportunities. Highlights of the operating agreement include: first, economics in the form of incentive payments designed to maintain PayPal's current penetration rate of approximately 80%; second, data sharing that enables each company to provide great customer service and maintain world-class risk, trust and fraud prevention programs; third, product development and service agreements that ensure PayPal devotes resources to developing new payments, product and services for eBay, preserving a high level of service quality; and fourth, non-compete agreements that encourage eBay and PayPal to continue their strong partnership.
The operating agreement is designed to set up eBay and PayPal to succeed as independent companies. Meanwhile, Dan and Devin are building out their leadership teams and driving sharper strategic focus on the opportunities ahead. You'll hear more from them in a moment.
In Q1, we also announced 2 new board members: Tony Bates and Gail McGovern. This is in addition to our previous announcements of new board members, Bonnie Hammer, Frank Yeary, Perry Traquina and Jonathan Christodoro. We feel very good about our ability to create 2 world-class boards for eBay and PayPal at separation.
In summary, we remain deeply committed to doing what's best for eBay and PayPal and to delivering sustainable value for shareholders. Looking ahead, we are clear on what we need to do to deliver on our 2015 plans and ensure a smooth separation process. We'll continue to do what's best for our business, for our customers and for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Dan Schulman, who'll provide more details on PayPal."

PayPal is off to a solid start for the year, and I like our current trajectory and progress. We grew our revenues 17% on an FX-neutral basis, and our Merchant Services TPV continued to climb in the first quarter, growing 33% year-over-year, more than double the pace of the eCommerce market, indicating we gained meaningful share. 
Our growth and the new capabilities we are building position us well as we look towards the future. There are 4 key metrics that I believe measure the growth and health of our business. They are: one, our top line growth; two, the growth of our account base, which demonstrates our scale; three, the engagement of that base as measured by revenue per active account; and four, free cash flow. 
These metrics are my top priorities as they measure the progress of our strategic initiatives, which are to grow ubiquity, increase engagement of both merchants and consumers and produce a strong return for investors. We showed progress in all of these areas in the first quarter.
First, the top line. The 17% revenue growth we delivered is a strong foundation to build on as we move into 2015. 
Second, we continue our steady growth in customer accounts, increasing total active accounts by 3.6 million to 165 million customers across the globe. We expect strong growth to continue in 2015 as we further penetrate the merchant population and build out our products and services to grow more and more relevant to consumers.
Third, our customer engagement also steadily increased, with transactions per account growing to 23 in Q1 from 21 in the first quarter a year ago. We processed as well more than 1 billion transactions in the first quarter. This represents an increase of 24% year-over-year. And importantly, our monetization per account accelerated sequentially to $49. 
We also continued to see an increase in mobile payments transactions, now reaching nearly 30% of our overall transactions, with mobile payments transactions growing over 40% year-over-year. Our Merchant Services business now represents 76% of total volume, growing at 33%. And we increased our penetration on eBay by 260 basis points year-over-year. 
We continue to improve our penetration of the top online merchants, reaching 74% of the IR 100 merchants in the U.S. Braintree maintained its strong triple-digit growth in the first quarter and signed some great new accounts, including Lyft, Chegg and One Kings Lane. 
The fourth key metric for PayPal is free cash flow. We took significant cost actions in Q1 to streamline our operations and free up capacity. As a result, we expect segment margins to be up 1 to 2 points on a year-over-year basis for the full year 2015, as we discussed in January. We do expect to reinvest additional margin leverage to continue to expand our business in order to generate significant long-term returns for shareholders. 
At the same time, we are committed to growing free cash flow. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, including onetime costs associated with separation. 
We are currently in one of the most exciting periods in the history of financial services. Today PayPal operates in 2 fast-growing parts of the digital payments industry: online and mobile. Both the online and off-line payments worlds are digitizing and converging through mobile experiences. As a result, I believe our addressable market is not just the $2.5 trillion associated with online and mobile but more like the $25 trillion associated with commerce, both online and off-line. PayPal has a powerful set of assets, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the changes sweeping through our industry.
To capitalize on this opportunity, we are in the midst of a massive transformation, completely rebuilding our technology platform, enabling greater scale, faster production cycles and closer collaboration between teams so we can continuously deliver better products to our customers. PayPal now has one of the largest hybrid clouds in the world, and we have transformed our core business capabilities into robust service-based platforms. 
PayPal's newly modernized technology platform is becoming a strategic asset. In revamping our technology and processes, we are dramatically reducing our product development cycles, allowing us to deploy software releases in weeks versus months. 
We're also accelerating through strategic acquisitions. In March, we announced the acquisition of CyActive, which will play a key role within our security center of excellence. This transaction closed on April 9. 
We also announced the acquisition of Paydiant, which closed on the 1st of April. Using Paydiant's platform, our merchant partners can create their own brand of digital wallets to accelerate mobile and store payments and drive consumer engagement. 
Everything we've done in the first 6 months of my tenure is positioning PayPal to take advantage of what I see as one of the greatest opportunities for growth that the payments industry has ever seen. We have a lot to execute on, but we now have the right organizational structure, leadership team and operational discipline to get it done. I'm excited about where we are, what we are building and about PayPal's strong position and potential in this dynamic market. 
Thanks a lot, and I'll now turn it over to Devin to discuss eBay's results."

It's great to have the chance today to share my thoughts about eBay's Q1 performance and our plans for the future. Let's start with the quarter.
eBay had a good quarter 1, showing signs of stabilization. Let me share some key metrics. GMV and 3-month trailing active buyers each grew 5%, consistent with the prior quarter. Overall traffic, including mobile, grew at steady rates as well. International GMV on an FX-neutral basis grew 7%, a 1-point acceleration from Q4; and sold item growth was 9%, also a 1-point acceleration. In addition, StubHub and eBay Classifieds both performed well. 
After the challenges faced in 2014 and following 2 sequential quarters of declining growth, our quarter 1 results are encouraging. I'm pleased with how our team is executing and delivering. We are certainly not ready to declare a victory over last year's SEO and password reset challenges but we are making progress. 
SEO-generated traffic is still impacting growth. While this channel is beginning to stabilize, effectively managing SEO traffic is a constantly evolving process. We're working to stay out front of it. 
Also following the password reset, we're making ongoing investments to ensure we have a stable, secure platform for our users. We're focused on increasing user engagement and confidence over time. Steady progress but we're just getting started. We have more work to do to ensure we deliver consistent, sustainable performance and accelerate growth. 
Let me step back now and provide broader context. I'll focus the rest of my remarks on our path forward and the tremendous opportunities we see ahead. eBay turns 20 this year. In our industry and in Silicon Valley, that's an extraordinary milestone. eBay helped define the beginning of eCommerce, and we intend to continue being a leader in its future. 
Over the past 2 decades, eBay has created tremendous assets and deep global commerce expertise. We're launching the next chapter with a passionate community of 25 million sellers. They offer incredible, diverse selection and value through 800 million listings, and we have a global base of more than 157 million active buyers who generate nearly $83 billion of GMV annually. I believe that as we begin creating the next 20 years of global commerce leadership for eBay, that's a great place to start.
We intend to lead by focusing on 3 strategic pillars: first, building a more robust commerce platform; second, engaging the core buyer and seller segments, who create a vibrant marketplace and fuel our commerce flywheel; and third, creating exceptional product and brand experiences. A robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace, exceptional customer experiences, that's our formula for success. Let me touch on each area.
First, managing a robust commerce platform is essential to creating sustainable performance. We're focused on building a stronger, more resilient foundation. We'll move towards becoming the world's first online global marketplace to use structured catalog data at scale for all listings. We believe that doing so will help us deliver an exceptional, unmatched experience for both buyers and sellers. 
At the same time, we'll diversify our sources of traffic and customer acquisition, leveraging promising early trends on social and messaging platforms. eBay will have multiple robust channels competing for our marginal investment dollar. This requires a transformation in our attack and our marketing, which is already under way. The result, a more competitive eBay with more control over our experience and ultimately, our performance.
Creating a vibrant marketplace is our second pillar. eBay is at its best when we bring diverse inventory at great value to customers who love to shop. Our core buyer and seller segments make eBay the world's most vibrant marketplace to find, discover and buy practically anything. eBay's consumers love to shop. They hunt for value at different price points. They demand broad selection and they enjoy discovering unique things that express their personality. For these consumers who represent our broad, addressable and growing market, we intend to make eBay the global destination for great value and selection. 
Ensuring a trusted marketplace is foundational, and we'll continue making investments in this area. We also will run our business more by category. We will sharpen how we merchandise our sellers' inventory, presenting eBay's unique range of choice and value in new and innovative ways. 
On the seller's side, eBay's sweet spot is small and medium-sized merchants and brands. They represent 70% of the global retail market, offering the diverse inventory and value our consumers are looking for. As a partner and not a competitor to SMBs, we intend to make eBay the global platform for them to grow and to thrive. We will offer improved seller tools, unmatched access to data and more balanced and predictable policies and standards.
Consumer selling is another key eBay strength, and we intend to revitalize this segment of our market. An estimated $100 billion of value is trapped in people's closets and garages and that's just in the U.S. This is an enormous opportunity. With simplified listing flows, predictive pricing data and higher touch intermediation for those that require it, we intend to make eBay the platform for consumers to buy and sell anything, anytime, anywhere. 
And finally, our third pillar, creating exceptional product and brand experiences. eBay is a powerful global brand, and we'll strengthen that brand by delivering exceptional, engaging product experiences. Some of our recent launches such as our iPad app and our launch of live auctions are great examples of what we can do and we will do going forward. We will continue to substantially upgrade the buying and selling experience on eBay with much more to come this year.
In summary, Q1 was a good start, and I'm confident in our full year outlook, including generating $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion of free cash flow. Going forward, we intend to play our game, no one else's, and focus where eBay can win. Global commerce trends such as the impact of mobile on consumer behavior and the influence of digital on retail favor many of our core strengths. We'll take advantage of this. 
 
We've assembled a world-class management team with deep technology, retail, data and customer service expertise. And as we take eBay forward, we will operate with clarity and with discipline. We will pursue thoughtful capital allocation strategies that deliver compelling shareholder value while maximizing our strategic flexibility.
It is an incredible privilege to be eBay's next CEO, building on our extraordinary heritage and leading this iconic brand forward. My team and I are excited to be creating eBay's next chapter, and I look forward to sharing more with you in the months ahead. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Bob."
27862,283341779,792384,"eBay Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Q1 was a great start to the year. We delivered $4.4 billion of total revenue and $0.77 of non-GAAP EPS. We generated $829 million in free c",1526,"Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Q1 was a great start to the year. We delivered $4.4 billion of total revenue and $0.77 of non-GAAP EPS. We generated $829 million in free cash flow and repurchased $1 billion of our stock. We are making excellent progress on our plans to separate PayPal from eBay, and we currently anticipate a third quarter close.
In Q1, we generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 4% with strength across the board. Organic revenue growth was 9% in the quarter, and currency negatively impacted growth by approximately 5 points. We delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range despite the impact of the stronger dollar, which negatively impacted Q1 revenue by approximately $30 million since the guidance we provided in January.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 10%. EPS growth was driven by a strong FX-neutral revenue growth, good operating leverage across the company and a lower share count. 
Operating expenses were 41% of revenue in the quarter, down 120 basis points, driven primarily by the benefits from the steps both Dan and Devin took to streamline their respective businesses, partially offset by a provision for transaction and loan losses and increased regulatory cost for PayPal. We generated free cash flow of $829 million in the quarter and CapEx was 7% of revenue.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $14.1 billion, including approximately $4.1 billion in the U.S. eBay ended the quarter with $11.7 billion and PayPal with $2.4 billion in cash.
We are taking steps to continue to strengthen our balance sheet to provide both businesses with the financial flexibility to pursue their strategic and capital priorities. First, we continue to fund an increasing portion of our loan portfolio balance with offshore cash, currently at 78% of total. Second, as part of internal structuring, we plan to move approximately $3.5 billion of cash to PayPal in a tax-efficient manner prior to separation. And third, we announced the sale of an 85% participation interest in a pool of U.S. PayPal credit receivables, which will free up approximately $700 million of incremental capacity in the U.S. to fund PayPal's growth. As a technology-enabled lender, credit is an important driver of our business but does not need to be funded by our balance sheet. As a result of this transaction, 2015 operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million.
eBay Inc. has an excellent balance sheet. As a result of these actions, both eBay and PayPal will be well capitalized at separation.
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue in Q1 was $2.1 billion, up 17% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong Merchant Services growth and rising engagement per user, which reflects the growing popularity and relevance of the PayPal value proposition throughout the world. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operating metrics. TPV on an FX-neutral basis grew 25%. Merchant Services FX-neutral TPV increased 33%. Transaction margin was down 80 basis points, driven by the rapid growth in Braintree volume and continued penetration of large merchants.
Segment margins declined 40 basis points, less than the drop in transaction margin. PayPal generated strong leverage from Dan's steps to streamline the business while still investing in Braintree, the PayPal brand and credit.
Now let's turn to the Marketplaces business. As Devin indicated, Marketplaces showed signs of stabilization in Q1. Trailing 3-month active buyer growth and FX-neutral GMV were both 5%, flat with Q4 results. Marketplaces delivered $2.1 billion in revenue, up 3% on an FX-neutral basis. FX-neutral transaction revenue grew 3% while marketing services revenue grew 5%, helped by strong growth of our global Classifieds business.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operating metrics. 12-month active buyer growth was up 8%, and sold items growth increased to 9%. Total GMV grew 5%, with U.S. GMV up 2% and international GMV up 7% on an FX-neutral basis. We saw an acceleration of U.S. GMV, which is a measure of consumer buying, which accelerated by 1 point versus the fourth quarter. However, this acceleration was offset by a decline in cross-border trade due to the stronger dollar.
Segment margin was down 50 basis points from last year. Devin took steps to streamline his organization in the first quarter and is reinvesting in the 3 priorities he highlighted: a robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace and exceptional customer experiences.
Now let's turn to eBay Enterprise. eBay Enterprise generated $1 billion in gross merchandise sales for its clients. GMS grew 8% and same-store sales grew 10%. Revenue was $288 million, up 7%. We continue to expand the enterprise relationships and are pleased to announce that Enterprise is now the #1 eCommerce platform, as measured by the 2015 Internet Retailer Top 500 guide. Segment margin for Enterprise came in at 4.8%, relatively flat from last year. 
We continue to explore strategic alternatives for eBay Enterprise, including a full or partial sale or IPO, and we'll update you as appropriate.
Now let me turn to guidance. We are off to a great start for the year. We are maintaining our full year guidance for FX-neutral revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS. However, the first quarter momentum will be offset by the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which will cost us approximately $250 million in revenue and $0.05 in non-GAAP EPS versus the full year guidance we provided in January. 
We are projecting 2015 revenues of $18.35 billion to $18.85 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5%. And we are projecting 2015 non-GAAP EPS of $3.05 to $3.15, up 3% to 7%. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $4 billion in free cash flow for the year, with CapEx of 8% to 10% of revenue. CapEx in 2015 will be higher due to onetime costs associated with separating the businesses.
Let me provide a little more context in how the U.S. -- the stronger U.S. dollar will impact our full year results. As you know, we have a very global business with 52% of our revenue and even a greater portion of our net income coming from outside the U.S. Additionally, the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the euro, pound and Australian dollar by 7%, 1% and 5%, respectively, versus when we guided in January. This is driving the impact on our guidance for the year. The Marketplaces business will bear the brunt of the impact from a stronger dollar, with greater than 2/3 of the $250 million or $175 million impacting Marketplaces revenue. Going forward, our earnings for the full year are reasonably well hedged, but Marketplaces revenue will continue to be exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen.
With that full year context, here's a closer look by business unit. The short story, on an FX-neutral basis, there is no change to the guidance we gave you in January. However, we wanted to provide you with additional details that would allow you to start to model the independent companies. 
First, a quick housekeeping item. Historically, we have provided segment margins by business unit. As we look to stand up 2 independent companies, we will transition to providing fully allocated operating margins, which include corporate costs, dis-synergies associated with the separation and the value transfer associated with the operating agreements. 
Earlier, John discussed the details of the operating agreements. We anticipate the financial implications to be an estimated value transfer of approximately $25 million to $50 million on an annualized basis from PayPal to eBay. 
So what does that mean for full year guidance by business unit? For PayPal, we continue to expect 15% to 18% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis. We expect that reported revenue at spot rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 3 points from the stronger U.S. dollar, net of hedges. We expect a 19% to 21% fully allocated non-GAAP operating margin, flat to up 1 point from 2014, which includes 4 to 5 points impact from costs to stand up PayPal as an independent company. And as Dan mentioned, we expect free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.
For eBay, we continue to expect FX-neutral revenue growth between 0% and 5%. We expect that reported revenue at spot rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 8 points from the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect fully allocated non-GAAP operating margin of 32% to 34%, flat with 2014. And this also includes 4 to 5-point impact from stand-up costs. And as Devin mentioned, we expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
In summary, we're off to a great start to the year. We've streamlined the organization and had better execution with strength across all 3 businesses. The full year FX-neutral revenue outlook is on track, but our strong Q1 momentum will be offset by the negative impact of a stronger dollar. We are making excellent progress on our plans to stand up 2 independent companies, and we expect to conclude the separation in the third quarter.

We grew up as a marketplace and eBay looks at the world historically through listings rather than products. Listings gave eBay a tremendous selection advantage. It's why we have the most things for sale of any marketplace in the world. But listings are also transient. They come and go. They don't have link equity and they're hard to attach content to. So if you go back over eBay's history, there's been a pattern of SEO disruptions across various search engines. We now believe that the state of our business and our technology is that we can maintain the advantage given to us by a marketplace business model but include a structured data catalog, which gives us persistence and link equity and makes our sellers' inventory more discoverable, both on and off eBay. The way we're approaching that is it is a deep transformation. It's a multiyear process. We're approaching it by category but horizontally but also focusing on the vertical areas where we believe we can have the most impact early on. I'd say we're off to a good start but it's an early start. And it will take -- it is a multiyear transformation. But we do know that where we structured and catalogued our inventory, those items are more discoverable on eBay and they're more persistent and generate more traffic through search engines and other digital channels. So we feel good about the approach but it is not a short-term fix."

Thanks for the question, Carlos. Appreciate it. So you're right. It is a very exciting opportunity in front of us, with an addressable market that is expanding dramatically for us. Cash is digitizing, the world of money is digitizing. The way consumers manage and move their money is transforming technology platforms and fundamentally redefine that. And merchants are moving towards digital commerce, where they can use mobile to get ever closer to their customers, drive engagement, drive incremental sales. And I think that PayPal is very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. We have a number of assets that we bring to that fight from our brand to our scale to our platform to our service, and I can talk about that in more detail later. But what we have said is that we will grow our segment margins this year by 1% to 2%. We feel very comfortable with that. And we feel very comfortable that with the operating leverage that we have in this business and the cost actions that I took earlier this year, reducing headcount to really focus our costs, as well as increased economies of scale as we grow larger, are going to allow us to grow free cash flow in a disciplined fashion and yet have the investment dollars to invest in the opportunities that we see ahead. Those opportunities could be increased investments on our platform to speed up our ability to deliver capabilities, enhance capabilities, which you'll see us rolling out even this quarter going forward, new markets that we can move into. And so we feel, as we look at our model, that we have the operating leverage to maintain consistent margins and invest to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. And I feel comfortable with that -- with those investment dollars. I'd also point out one other thing that Bob mentioned is that PayPal is going to be extremely well-funded on its balance sheet as we go forward with perhaps some -- approximately $6 billion of funding of cash on our balance sheet, enabling us to look at not just organic growth but inorganic growth as well. And so when I look at all of those things together, I feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given and the investment opportunities we see."

Eric, thanks for the question. We're very excited about the Paydiant acquisition. Paydiant is not necessarily a name that a lot of people recognize from a brand perspective, but very leading merchants in the country sure do recognize it. It is a mobile-based platform that provides merchants who want to write their own applications to engage and connect with their customers to use that underlying platform to power those applications, whether that be through rewards, through payment processing or through QR codes at the point-of-sale. When you combine the Paydiant platform with our platform at PayPal, you have probably, in my estimation, the world's leading mobile payments platform. And as I mentioned, as the online and the off-line world continue to converge together, driven by the confluence of mobile at the heart of that, the Paydiant acquisition enables us to move much more aggressively into that converged space, so into that off-line space. It also provides, on the consumer side, the ability to utilize things like private label cards, rewards. So it's got a host of capabilities that supplement what we have on the PayPal platform. So for both merchants and for consumers, it was an acquisition that enabled us to more aggressively and more quickly address that expandable market."

So thanks for your question, Gil. It's insightful. So the first thing I would just kind of take one step backwards and tell you, as you probably have seen, is we've kind of reorganized PayPal around merchants and consumers. And when we did that, we put Bill Ready in charge of the merchant segment. Bill, as you know, was the CEO of Braintree. And what we really did by putting that together is really combine the Braintree platform and the PayPal platforms much more closely together, so that we're able to enable things like One Touch, not just on full sec [ph] integrations and on mobile but into the PayPal base. We think that the world is moving increasingly towards mobile payments that we have with the combination now of Paydiant, Braintree and the PayPal platform, the leading mobile payments platform in the world. We did over 1 billion mobile payments transactions last year. You heard that this quarter, we're up 40% year-over-year. We're taking things like One Touch, and we want to put it right into our merchant on-boarding process that we have for PayPal. And so we are taking the things that we've learned through both Venmo and Braintree, putting them together with some of our other acquisitions to provide to our PayPal embedded base not only the services that you see now but services that we'll introduce even as of this quarter that will take us to a whole different level as a result of that integration together. That's question #1 that you asked, and I feel really good about that and excited about it. Number two was on NFC and do I feel like NFC is embedded enough to go after that? We are obviously doing trials around NFC ourselves at this point. But I think the real key and the thing that I believe in is that any great open technology payments platform has to have at its heart this idea of being technology-agnostic at the point-of-sale. Even though NFC is beginning to gain some momentum, it's still probably 2% to 5% of the point-of-sale terminals out there in the marketplace, maybe more on a transactional basis. But it's a small part. And I've seen many times where we think one technological standard is going to emerge and it's eclipsed by something else. And so what I would like the PayPal platform to be and what we're building towards and have a lot of capabilities already is the ability to be able to utilize your mobile phone but not just the NFC but QR codes, Bluetooth, HCE, really depends on what the merchant has upgraded towards. I think if you bet on a single technology, it's a risky proposition and it takes a lot longer to move into the marketplace. The second thing is I'm a big believer that you don't want to just enable a form factor change. We don't want to just substitute a card swipe for a phone tap. You really want to think about what is the value proposition change that you're going to do. How can you, with that phone tap, enable a merchant to get ever closer to their consumers through either rewards, loyalty, couponing, offers and associate that with the payment choice of type that a consumer wants to pay with, whether it be a debit card, a credit card, private label, Bill Me Later, whatever it may be?

And to do that, we have to build with those tenets in mind."

Online is still exploding. It's -- what is it, 10% to 12% of overall commerce right now, growing at double-digit percentages. We've got 165 million consumers but there are huge swaths of the market where we're not even present right now. And you can be sure that we're looking at that because I think there's tremendous opportunity for us to take advantage of this online growth that's going on all over the world right now. At the same time, interestingly, you see retailers and merchants starting to think about how can they use mobile to dramatically change the way that they interact with their customers. And I call that really sort of digital commerce. How can retailers more personalize the experience for a customer when they walk into their store? And mobile can enable that. But it's difficult to do that. The merchant can certainly write the right application to talk with their customers, to engage with their customers. But underneath that, they need a platform to power that, whether it be to power their loyalty and rewards programs, to power any payment type that comes in. And we've talked about recently this vision of us becoming much more of a partner for retailers and becoming sort of what we call the operating system for digital commerce, to be able to enable them to move into this digital commerce world. The advent of Paydiant, Braintree and PayPal all coming together is a real head start for us moving into that. And it's not so much that we want to move into the off-line world. It's that the off-line and online worlds are moving that way naturally, and they're moving that way through mobile. And that plays right into a strength that we have right now. And I think that's one element. And then on the consumer side, consumers are going to look to manage and move their money in different ways than they ever had before. Our transactions per active account are going up. The amount that people are spending with us are going up. We have a nice engaged base. But I believe that we can do so much more on that as we become a part of how consumers manage and move their money. We can move from being much more transactional to much more relational with them, and that is our aspiration and vision on that. So I think a lot of opportunities in numerous places."

So on PayPal Credit, Sanjay, we're a technology-enabled lender, and we do that because it makes sense for the partnership that we're enabling with merchants. It provides them additional value. They get to close more sales as a result of that. If we extend PayPal Working Capital to them, it obviously enables them to expand their business. When we do that, we see our customer satisfaction scores jump dramatically as a result of that. We see more volume come through those merchants. We see much lower churn with that. And so for merchants who avail themselves of that, it's a tremendous benefit. And for consumers, they get to complete a transaction that they might not have otherwise completed. For us, it takes a cost and converts it into a revenue, and so it's a win all the way around for that entire ecosystem. So we think providing credit makes sense in terms of what we're trying to do from a platform perspective. But just because we do that, as Bob articulated in his remarks, doesn't mean that we need to fund that through our own balance sheet. And so we think that providing the service is the right thing, but having the flexibility to opt whether we want to do that through our balance sheet or not, there are multiple ways that we can look at that. What we just did is one example of funding that loan portfolio with other people's money. And that having the return of $700 million of cash to us on our domestic balance sheet, which obviously opens us up to being able to do other things with that. So that's question #1. Question #2, on the EU stuff. Look, there are regulatory changes that go on throughout the world. The European ones are ones that are on everybody's minds right now. Some of those regulatory impacts affect our cost structure. Some of those are going to affect pricing on certain -- some of them are going to affect how you do business in certain ways. And so we look at each and every one of those changes on a market-by-market basis and react accordingly to those. The one thing we definitely don't do is react publicly to those. We think about them and then we decide what the right way to react is on that. But this is nothing new, as you well know, Sanjay, you're an expert in all of this. There are changes going on all the time all over the world. And one of the assets, I think, PayPal brings to this world is we're 100% focused on digital payments. And one of the core competencies we have is our regulatory and compliance oversight. And so we are on top of all of these things all the time. In terms of the CFPB, we work with regulators all over the world. And I will say this, and this is probably the most important thing, is that there's no difference between what a regulator wants and what PayPal wants. We pride ourselves on being a customer champion, and regulators only want what's best for consumers and customers in general. And so we are very aligned philosophically on what we both want to provide. As the CFPB comes in and looks at the ways that we've done business, they may have suggestions on how we can do that better. And we certainly work with them to try and provide the best alternative to our consumers to make sure that we are as clear as possible in our communications and fully compliant with all regulations. And we, as in every single quarter, take a look at what exposures might be. We reserve for them appropriately. And that's a thing that we do every single quarter. So hopefully, that helps to answer all of your questions."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 earnings call. We had a strong first quarter, and despite currency headwinds pressuring top line growth, eBay and PayPal are off to a good start for the full year. I feel very good about the focus and performance of our teams at eBay and PayPal. Each business is executing well with greater focus and operating discipline as we prepare for separation.
Joining our call today are eBay CEO designee, Devin Wenig; and PayPal CEO designee, Dan Schulman. Devin and Dan will provide more perspective on Q1 performance for eBay and PayPal, respectively, as well as their views on the future opportunities and focus for each business. Bob will then provide full details on the quarter, including eBay Enterprise.
But let me provide some highlights. In the first quarter, eBay Inc. revenue was up 9% on an FX-neutral basis, with PayPal contributing 17% growth and eBay Marketplaces up 3%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 10%. For Q1, PayPal enabled $61 billion of payment volume, topping 165 million active accounts, and eBay drove $20 billion of gross merchandise volume, topping 157 million active buyers. 
Before I turn it over to Dan and Devin, let me briefly recap where we are in the separation process. As you know, last September, we announced our decision to separate eBay and PayPal into independent publicly traded companies. Separation will enable each business to operate with greater focus and strategic agility and better positioned to capitalize on their respective growth opportunities. 
We believe more than ever that separation is the best path for eBay and PayPal and the right approach to delivering sustainable value to shareholders. We're moving forward with clarity and speed. We passed a significant milestone in Q1 with the initial filing of PayPal's Form 10, and we filed our first amendment earlier this month with additional information. We expect separation to occur in the third quarter. 
The operating agreement between eBay and PayPal is designed to preserve synergies while giving each business the strategic flexibility to pursue growth opportunities. Highlights of the operating agreement include: first, economics in the form of incentive payments designed to maintain PayPal's current penetration rate of approximately 80%; second, data sharing that enables each company to provide great customer service and maintain world-class risk, trust and fraud prevention programs; third, product development and service agreements that ensure PayPal devotes resources to developing new payments, products and services for eBay, preserving a high level of service quality; and fourth, non-compete agreements that encourage eBay and PayPal to continue their strong partnership.
The operating agreement is designed to set up eBay and PayPal to succeed as independent companies. Meanwhile, Dan and Devin are building out their leadership teams and driving sharper strategic focus on the opportunities ahead. You'll hear more from them in a moment.
In Q1, we also announced 2 new board members: Tony Bates and Gail McGovern. This is in addition to our previous announcements of new board members Bonnie Hammer, Frank Yeary, Perry Traquina and Jonathan Christodoro. We feel very good about our ability to create 2 world-class boards for eBay and PayPal at separation.
In summary, we remain deeply committed to doing what's best for eBay and PayPal and to delivering sustainable value for shareholders. Looking ahead, we are clear on what we need to do to deliver on our 2015 plans and ensure a smooth separation process. We'll continue to do what's best for our business, for our customers and for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Dan Schulman, who'll provide more details on PayPal."

PayPal is off to a solid start for the year, and I like our current trajectory and progress. We grew our revenues 17% on an FX-neutral basis, and our Merchant Services TPV continued to climb in the first quarter, growing 33% year-over-year, more than double the pace of the eCommerce market, indicating we gained meaningful share. 
Our growth and the new capabilities we are building position us well as we look towards the future. There are 4 key metrics that I believe measure the growth and health of our business. They are: one, our top line growth; two, the growth of our account base, which demonstrates our scale; three, the engagement of that base as measured by revenue per active account; and four, free cash flow. 
These metrics are my top priorities as they measure the progress of our strategic initiatives, which are to grow ubiquity, increase engagement of both merchants and consumers and produce a strong return for investors. We showed progress in all of these areas in the first quarter.
First, the top line. The 17% revenue growth we delivered is a strong foundation to build on as we move into 2015. 
Second, we continue our steady growth in customer accounts, increasing total active accounts by 3.6 million to 165 million customers across the globe. We expect strong growth to continue in 2015 as we further penetrate the merchant population and build out our products and services to grow more and more relevant to consumers.
Third, our customer engagement also steadily increased, with transactions per account growing to 23 in Q1 from 21 in the first quarter a year ago. We processed as well more than 1 billion transactions in the first quarter. This represents an increase of 24% year-over-year. And importantly, our monetization per account accelerated sequentially to $49. 
We also continued to see an increase in mobile payments transactions, now reaching nearly 30% of our overall transactions, with mobile payments transactions growing over 40% year-over-year. Our Merchant Services business now represents 76% of total volume, growing at 33%. And we increased our penetration on eBay by 260 basis points year-over-year. 
We continue to improve our penetration of the top online merchants, reaching 74% of the IR 100 merchants in the U.S. Braintree maintained its strong triple-digit growth in the first quarter and signed some great new accounts, including Lyft, Chegg and One Kings Lane. 
The fourth key metric for PayPal is free cash flow. We took significant cost actions in Q1 to streamline our operations and free up capacity. As a result, we expect segment margins to be up 1 to 2 points on a year-over-year basis for the full year 2015, as we discussed in January. We do expect to reinvest additional margin leverage to continue to expand our business in order to generate significant long-term returns for shareholders. 
At the same time, we are committed to growing free cash flow. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, including onetime costs associated with separation. 
We are currently in one of the most exciting periods in the history of financial services. Today PayPal operates in 2 fast-growing parts of the digital payments industry: online and mobile. Both the online and off-line payments worlds are digitizing and converging through mobile experiences. As a result, I believe our addressable market is not just the $2.5 trillion associated with online and mobile but more like the $25 trillion associated with commerce, both online and off-line. PayPal has a powerful set of assets, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the changes sweeping through our industry.
To capitalize on this opportunity, we are in the midst of a massive transformation, completely rebuilding our technology platform, enabling greater scale, faster production cycles and closer collaboration between teams so we can continuously deliver better products to our customers. PayPal now has one of the largest hybrid clouds in the world, and we have transformed our core business capabilities into robust service-based platforms. 
PayPal's newly modernized technology platform is becoming a strategic asset. In revamping our technology and processes, we are dramatically reducing our product development cycles, allowing us to deploy software releases in weeks versus months. 
We're also accelerating through strategic acquisitions. In March, we announced the acquisition of CyActive, which will play a key role within our security center of excellence. This transaction closed on April 9. 
We also announced the acquisition of Paydiant, which closed on the 1st of April. Using Paydiant's platform, our merchant partners can create their own brand of digital wallets to accelerate mobile in-store payments and drive consumer engagement. 
Everything we've done in the first 6 months of my tenure is positioning PayPal to take advantage of what I see as one of the greatest opportunities for growth that the payments industry has ever seen. We have a lot to execute on, but we now have the right organizational structure, leadership team and operational discipline to get it done. I'm excited about where we are, what we are building and about PayPal's strong position and potential in this dynamic market. 
Thanks a lot, and I'll now turn it over to Devin to discuss eBay's results."

It's great to have the chance today to share my thoughts about eBay's Q1 performance and our plans for the future. Let's start with the quarter.
eBay had a good quarter 1, showing signs of stabilization. Let me share some key metrics. GMV and 3-month trailing active buyers each grew 5%, consistent with the prior quarter. Overall traffic, including mobile, grew at steady rates as well. International GMV on an FX-neutral basis grew 7%, a 1-point acceleration from Q4; and sold item growth was 9%, also a 1-point acceleration. In addition, StubHub and eBay Classifieds both performed well. 
After the challenges faced in 2014 and following 2 sequential quarters of declining growth, our quarter 1 results are encouraging. I'm pleased with how our team is executing and delivering. We are certainly not ready to declare a victory over last year's SEO and password reset challenges but we are making progress. 
SEO-generated traffic is still impacting growth. While this channel is beginning to stabilize, effectively managing SEO traffic is a constantly evolving process. We're working to stay out front of it. 
Also following the password reset, we're making ongoing investments to ensure we have a stable, secure platform for our users. We're focused on increasing user engagement and confidence over time. Steady progress but we're just getting started. We have more work to do to ensure we deliver consistent, sustainable performance and accelerate growth. 
Let me step back now and provide broader context. I'll focus the rest of my remarks on our path forward and the tremendous opportunities we see ahead. eBay turns 20 this year. In our industry and in Silicon Valley, that's an extraordinary milestone. eBay helped define the beginning of eCommerce, and we intend to continue being a leader in its future. 
Over the past 2 decades, eBay has created tremendous assets and deep global commerce expertise. We're launching the next chapter with a passionate community of 25 million sellers. They offer incredible, diverse selection and value through 800 million listings, and we have a global base of more than 157 million active buyers who generate nearly $83 billion of GMV annually. I believe that as we begin creating the next 20 years of global commerce leadership for eBay, that's a great place to start.
We intend to lead by focusing on 3 strategic pillars: first, building a more robust commerce platform; second, engaging the core buyer and seller segments, who create a vibrant marketplace and fuel our commerce flywheel; and third, creating exceptional product and brand experiences. A robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace, exceptional customer experiences, that's our formula for success. Let me touch on each area.
First, managing a robust commerce platform is essential to creating sustainable performance. We're focused on building a stronger, more resilient foundation. We'll move towards becoming the world's first online global marketplace to use structured catalog data at scale for all listings. We believe that doing so will help us deliver an exceptional, unmatched experience for both buyers and sellers. 
At the same time, we'll diversify our sources of traffic and customer acquisition, leveraging promising early trends on social and messaging platforms. eBay will have multiple robust channels competing for our marginal investment dollar. This requires a transformation in our attack and our marketing, which is already under way. The result, a more competitive eBay with more control over our experience and ultimately, our performance.
Creating a vibrant marketplace is our second pillar. eBay is at its best when we bring diverse inventory at great value to customers who love to shop. Our core buyer and seller segments make eBay the world's most vibrant marketplace to find, discover and buy practically anything. eBay's consumers love to shop. They hunt for value at different price points. They demand broad selection and they enjoy discovering unique things that express their personality. For these consumers who represent a broad, addressable and growing market, we intend to make eBay the global destination for great value and selection. 
Ensuring a trusted marketplace is foundational, and we'll continue making investments in this area. We also will run our business more by category. We will sharpen how we merchandise our sellers' inventory, presenting eBay's unique range of choice and value in new and innovative ways. 
On the seller's side, eBay's sweet spot is small and medium-sized merchants and brands. They represent 70% of the global retail market, offering the diverse inventory and value our consumers are looking for. As a partner and not a competitor to SMBs, we intend to make eBay the global platform for them to grow and to thrive. We will offer improved seller tools, unmatched access to data and more balanced and predictable policies and standards.
Consumer selling is another key eBay strength, and we intend to revitalize this segment of our market. An estimated $100 billion of value is trapped in people's closets and garages and that's just in the U.S. This is an enormous opportunity. With simplified listing flows, predictive pricing data and higher touch intermediation for those that require it, we intend to make eBay the platform for consumers to buy and sell anything, anytime, anywhere. 
And finally, our third pillar, creating exceptional product and brand experiences. eBay is a powerful global brand, and we'll strengthen that brand by delivering exceptional, engaging product experiences. Some of our recent launches such as our iPad app and our launch of live auctions are great examples of what we can do and we will do going forward. We will continue to substantially upgrade the buying and selling experience on eBay with much more to come this year.
In summary, Q1 was a good start, and I'm confident in our full year outlook, including generating $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion of free cash flow. Going forward, we intend to play our game, no one else's, and focus where eBay can win. Global commerce trends such as the impact of mobile on consumer behavior and the influence of digital on retail favor many of our core strengths. We'll take advantage of this. 
 
We've assembled a world-class management team with deep technology, retail, data and customer service expertise. And as we take eBay forward, we will operate with clarity and with discipline. We will pursue thoughtful capital allocation strategies that deliver compelling shareholder value while maximizing our strategic flexibility.
It is an incredible privilege to be eBay's next CEO, building on our extraordinary heritage and leading this iconic brand forward. My team and I are excited to be creating eBay's next chapter, and I look forward to sharing more with you in the months ahead. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Bob."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Q1 was a great start to the year. We delivered $4.4 billion of total revenue and $0.77 of non-GAAP EPS. We generated $829 million in free c",1526,"Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Q1 was a great start to the year. We delivered $4.4 billion of total revenue and $0.77 of non-GAAP EPS. We generated $829 million in free cash flow and repurchased $1 billion of our stock. We are making excellent progress on our plans to separate PayPal from eBay, and we currently anticipate a third quarter close.
In Q1, we generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 4% with strength across the board. Organic revenue growth was 9% in the quarter, and currency negatively impacted growth by approximately 5 points. We delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range despite the impact of the stronger dollar, which negatively impacted Q1 revenue by approximately $30 million since the guidance we provided in January.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 10%. EPS growth was driven by a strong FX-neutral revenue growth, good operating leverage across the company and a lower share count. 
Operating expenses were 41% of revenue in the quarter, down 120 basis points, driven primarily by the benefits from the steps both Dan and Devin took to streamline their respective businesses, partially offset by a provision for transaction and loan losses and increased regulatory cost for PayPal. We generated free cash flow of $829 million in the quarter and CapEx was 7% of revenue.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $14.1 billion, including approximately $4.1 billion in the U.S. eBay ended the quarter with $11.7 billion and PayPal with $2.4 billion in cash.
We are taking steps to continue to strengthen our balance sheet to provide both businesses with the financial flexibility to pursue their strategic and capital priorities. First, we continue to fund an increasing portion of our loan portfolio balance with offshore cash, currently at 78% of total. Second, as part of internal structuring, we plan to move approximately $3.5 billion of cash to PayPal in a tax-efficient manner prior to separation. And third, we announced the sale of an 85% participation interest in a pool of U.S. PayPal credit receivables, which will free up approximately $700 million of incremental capacity in the U.S. to fund PayPal's growth. As a technology-enabled lender, credit is an important driver of our business but does not need to be funded by our balance sheet. As a result of this transaction, 2015 operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million.
eBay Inc. has an excellent balance sheet. As a result of these actions, both eBay and PayPal will be well capitalized at separation.
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue in Q1 was $2.1 billion, up 17% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong Merchant Services growth and rising engagement per user, which reflects the growing popularity and relevance of the PayPal value proposition throughout the world. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operating metrics. TPV on an FX-neutral basis grew 25%. Merchant Services FX-neutral TPV increased 33%. Transaction margin was down 80 basis points, driven by the rapid growth in Braintree volume and continued penetration of large merchants.
Segment margins declined 40 basis points, less than the drop in transaction margin. PayPal generated strong leverage from Dan's steps to streamline the business while still investing in Braintree, the PayPal brand and credit.
Now let's turn to the Marketplaces business. As Devin indicated, Marketplaces showed signs of stabilization in Q1. Trailing 3-month active buyer growth and FX-neutral GMV were both 5%, flat with Q4 results. Marketplaces delivered $2.1 billion in revenue, up 3% on an FX-neutral basis. FX-neutral transaction revenue grew 3% while marketing services revenue grew 5%, helped by strong growth of our global Classifieds business.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operating metrics. 12-month active buyer growth was up 8%, and sold items growth increased to 9%. Total GMV grew 5%, with U.S. GMV up 2% and international GMV up 7% on an FX-neutral basis. We saw an acceleration of U.S. GMV, which is a measure of consumer buying, which accelerated by 1 point versus the fourth quarter. However, this acceleration was offset by a decline in cross-border trade due to the stronger dollar.
Segment margin was down 50 basis points from last year. Devin took steps to streamline his organization in the first quarter and is reinvesting in the 3 priorities he highlighted: a robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace and exceptional customer experiences.
Now let's turn to eBay Enterprise. eBay Enterprise generated $1 billion in gross merchandise sales for its clients. GMS grew 8% and same-store sales grew 10%. Revenue was $288 million, up 7%. We continue to expand the enterprise relationships and are pleased to announce that Enterprise is now the #1 eCommerce platform, as measured by the 2015 Internet Retailer Top 500 guide. Segment margin for Enterprise came in at 4.8%, relatively flat from last year. 
We continue to explore strategic alternatives for eBay Enterprise, including a full or partial sale or IPO, and we'll update you as appropriate.
Now let me turn to guidance. We are off to a great start for the year. We are maintaining our full year guidance for FX-neutral revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS. However, the first quarter momentum will be offset by the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which will cost us approximately $250 million in revenue and $0.05 in non-GAAP EPS versus the full year guidance we provided in January. 
We are projecting 2015 revenues of $18.35 billion to $18.85 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5%. And we are projecting 2015 non-GAAP EPS of $3.05 to $3.15, up 3% to 7%. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $4 billion in free cash flow for the year, with CapEx of 8% to 10% of revenue. CapEx in 2015 will be higher due to onetime costs associated with separating the businesses.
Let me provide a little more context on how the U.S. -- the stronger U.S. dollar will impact our full year results. As you know, we have a very global business with 52% of our revenue and even a greater portion of our net income coming from outside the U.S. Additionally, the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the euro, pound and Australian dollar by 7%, 1% and 5%, respectively, versus when we guided in January. This is driving the impact on our guidance for the year. The Marketplaces business will bear the brunt of the impact from a stronger dollar, with greater than 2/3 of the $250 million or $175 million impacting Marketplaces revenue. Going forward, our earnings for the full year are reasonably well hedged, but Marketplaces revenue will continue to be exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen.
With that full year context, here's a closer look by business unit. The short story, on an FX-neutral basis, there is no change to the guidance we gave you in January. However, we wanted to provide you with additional details that would allow you to start to model the independent companies. 
First, a quick housekeeping item. Historically, we have provided segment margins by business unit. As we look to stand up 2 independent companies, we will transition to providing fully allocated operating margins, which include corporate costs, dis-synergies associated with the separation and the value transfer associated with the operating agreements. 
Earlier, John discussed the details of the operating agreements. We anticipate the financial implications to be an estimated value transfer of approximately $25 million to $50 million on an annualized basis from PayPal to eBay. 
So what does that mean for full year guidance by business unit? For PayPal, we continue to expect 15% to 18% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis. We expect that reported revenue at spot rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 3 points from the stronger U.S. dollar, net of hedges. We expect a 19% to 21% fully allocated non-GAAP operating margin, flat to up 1 point from 2014, which includes 4 to 5 points impact from costs to stand up PayPal as an independent company. And as Dan mentioned, we expect free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.
For eBay, we continue to expect FX-neutral revenue growth between 0% and 5%. We expect that reported revenue at spot rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 8 points from the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect fully allocated non-GAAP operating margin of 32% to 34%, flat with 2014. And this also includes 4 to 5-point impact from stand-up costs. And as Devin mentioned, we expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
In summary, we're off to a great start to the year. We've streamlined the organization and had better execution with strength across all 3 businesses. The full year FX-neutral revenue outlook is on track, but our strong Q1 momentum will be offset by the negative impact of a stronger dollar. We are making excellent progress on our plans to stand up 2 independent companies, and we expect to conclude the separation in the third quarter.

And if it's a category-by-category exercise, for example, dependent on the structure of catalog, have you made significant progress in some categories that give you confidence that this will work? Second on PayPal. You said PayPal has a lot of opportunity and has still a relatively small user base in its addressable market. In an environment of seemingly increasing competition, why is the right answer for the business to focus on growing free cash flow instead of reinvesting more aggressively in product and user growth? Or in other words, why do you think that maintaining a 25% margin versus investing in new products or customer acquisition to accelerate user top line growth is not the right answer?"

We grew up as a marketplace and eBay looks at the world historically through listings rather than products. Listings gave eBay a tremendous selection advantage. It's why we have the most things for sale of any marketplace in the world. But listings are also transient. They come and go. They don't have link equity and they're hard to attach content to. So if you go back over eBay's history, there's been a pattern of SEO disruptions across various search engines. We now believe that the state of our business and our technology is that we can maintain the advantage given to us by a marketplace business model but include a structured data catalog, which gives us persistence and link equity and makes our sellers' inventory more discoverable, both on and off eBay. The way we're approaching that is, it is a deep transformation. It's a multiyear process. We're approaching it by category but horizontally but also focusing on the vertical areas where we believe we can have the most impact early on. I'd say we're off to a good start but it's an early start. And it will take -- it is a multiyear transformation. But we do know that where we structured and cataloged our inventory, those items are more discoverable on eBay and they're more persistent and generate more traffic through search engines and other digital channels. So we feel good about the approach but it is not a short-term fix."

Thanks for the question, Carlos. Appreciate it. So you're right. It is a very exciting opportunity in front of us, with an addressable market that is expanding dramatically for us. Cash is digitizing, the world of money is digitizing. The way consumers manage and move their money is transforming technology platforms and fundamentally redefine that. And merchants are moving towards digital commerce, where they can use mobile to get ever closer to their customers, drive engagement, drive incremental sales. And I think that PayPal is very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. We have a number of assets that we bring to that fight from our brand to our scale to our platform to our service, and I can talk about that in more detail later. But what we have said is that we will grow our segment margins this year by 1% to 2%. We feel very comfortable with that. And we feel very comfortable that with the operating leverage that we have in this business and the cost actions that I took earlier this year, reducing headcount to really focus our costs, as well as increased economies of scale as we grow larger, are going to allow us to grow free cash flow in a disciplined fashion and yet have the investment dollars to invest in the opportunities that we see ahead. Those opportunities could be increased investments on our platform to speed up our ability to deliver capabilities, enhance capabilities, which you'll see us rolling out even this quarter going forward, new markets that we can move into. And so we feel, as we look at our model, that we have the operating leverage to maintain consistent margins and invest to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. And I feel comfortable with that -- with those investment dollars. I'd also point out one other thing that Bob mentioned is that PayPal is going to be extremely well-funded on its balance sheet as we go forward with perhaps some -- approximately $6 billion of funding of cash on our balance sheet, enabling us to look at not just organic growth but inorganic growth as well. And so when I look at all of those things together, I feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given and the investment opportunities we see."

Eric, thanks for the question. We're very excited about the Paydiant acquisition. Paydiant is not necessarily a name that a lot of people recognize from a brand perspective, but very leading merchants in the country sure do recognize it. It is a mobile-based platform that provides merchants who want to write their own applications to engage and connect with their customers to use that underlying platform to power those applications, whether that be through rewards, through payment processing or through QR codes at the point-of-sale. When you combine the Paydiant platform with our platform at PayPal, you have probably, in my estimation, the world's leading mobile payments platform. And as I mentioned, as the online and the off-line world continue to converge together, driven by the confluence of mobile at the heart of that, the Paydiant acquisition enables us to move much more aggressively into that converged space, so into that off-line space. It also provides, on the consumer side, the ability to utilize things like private label cards, rewards. So it's got a host of capabilities that supplement what we have on the PayPal platform. So for both merchants and for consumers, it was an acquisition that enabled us to more aggressively and more quickly address that expandable market."

So thanks for your question, Gil. It's insightful. So the first thing I would just kind of take one step backwards and tell you, as you probably have seen, is we've kind of reorganized PayPal around merchants and consumers. And when we did that, we put Bill Ready in charge of the merchant segment. Bill, as you know, was the CEO of Braintree. And what we really did by putting that together is really combine the Braintree platform and the PayPal platforms much more closely together, so that we're able to enable things like One Touch, not just on full sec [ph] integrations and on mobile but into the PayPal base. We think that the world is moving increasingly towards mobile payments that we have with the combination now of Paydiant, Braintree and the PayPal platform, the leading mobile payments platform in the world. We did over 1 billion mobile payments transactions last year. You heard that this quarter, we're up 40% year-over-year. We're taking things like One Touch, and we want to put it right into our merchant on-boarding process that we have for PayPal. And so we are taking the things that we've learned through both Venmo and Braintree, putting them together with some of our other acquisitions to provide to our PayPal embedded base not only the services that you see now but services that we'll introduce even as of this quarter that will take us to a whole different level as a result of that integration together. That's question #1 that you asked, and I feel really good about that and excited about it. Number two was on NFC and do I feel like NFC is embedded enough to go after that? We are obviously doing trials around NFC ourselves at this point. But I think the real key and the thing that I believe in is that any great open technology payments platform has to have at its heart this idea of being technology-agnostic at the point-of-sale. Even though NFC is beginning to gain some momentum, it's still probably 2% to 5% of the point-of-sale terminals out there in the marketplace, maybe more on a transactional basis. But it's a small part. And I've seen many times where we think one technological standard is going to emerge and it's eclipsed by something else. And so what I would like the PayPal platform to be and what we're building towards and have a lot of capabilities already is the ability to be able to utilize your mobile phone but not just the NFC but QR codes, Bluetooth, HCE, really depends on what the merchant has upgraded towards. I think if you bet on a single technology, it's a risky proposition and it takes a lot longer to move into the marketplace. The second thing is I'm a big believer that you don't want to just enable a form factor change. We don't want to just substitute a card swipe for a phone tap. You really want to think about what is the value proposition change that you're going to do. How can you, with that phone tap, enable a merchant to get ever closer to their consumers through either rewards, loyalty, couponing, offers and associate that with the payment choice of type that a consumer wants to pay with, whether it be a debit card, a credit card, private label, Bill Me Later, whatever it may be? That's what we want to provide. And so you're seeing us look at our platform, and our goal is to really be the world's largest open digital payments platform. And to do that, we have to build with those tenets in mind."

Online is still exploding. It's -- what is it, 10% to 12% of overall commerce right now, growing at double-digit percentages. We've got 165 million consumers but there are huge swaths of the market where we're not even present right now. And you can be sure that we're looking at that because I think there's tremendous opportunity for us to take advantage of this online growth that's going on all over the world right now. At the same time, interestingly, you see retailers and merchants starting to think about how can they use mobile to dramatically change the way that they interact with their customers. And I call that really sort of digital commerce. How can retailers more personalize the experience for a customer when they walk into their store? And mobile can enable that. But it's difficult to do that. The merchant can certainly write the right application to talk with their customers, to engage with their customers. But underneath that, they need a platform to power that, whether it be to power their loyalty and rewards programs, to power any payment type that comes in. And we've talked about recently this vision of us becoming much more of a partner for retailers and becoming sort of what we call the operating system for digital commerce, to be able to enable them to move into this digital commerce world. The advent of Paydiant, Braintree and PayPal all coming together is a real head start for us moving into that. And it's not so much that we want to move into the off-line world. It's that the off-line and online worlds are moving that way naturally, and they're moving that way through mobile. And that plays right into a strength that we have right now. And I think that's one element. And then on the consumer side, consumers are going to look to manage and move their money in different ways than they ever had before. Our transactions per active account are going up. The amount that people are spending with us are going up. We have a nice engaged base. But I believe that we can do so much more on that as we become a part of how consumers manage and move their money. We can move from being much more transactional to much more relational with them, and that is our aspiration and vision on that. So I think a lot of opportunities in numerous places."

So on PayPal Credit, Sanjay, we're a technology-enabled lender, and we do that because it makes sense for the partnership that we're enabling with merchants. It provides them additional value. They get to close more sales as a result of that. If we extend PayPal Working Capital to them, it obviously enables them to expand their business. When we do that, we see our customer satisfaction scores jump dramatically as a result of that. We see more volume come through those merchants. We see much lower churn with that. And so for merchants who avail themselves of that, it's a tremendous benefit. And for consumers, they get to complete a transaction that they might not have otherwise completed. For us, it takes a cost and converts it into a revenue, and so it's a win all the way around for that entire ecosystem. So we think providing credit makes sense in terms of what we're trying to do from a platform perspective. But just because we do that, as Bob articulated in his remarks, doesn't mean that we need to fund that through our own balance sheet. And so we think that providing the service is the right thing, but having the flexibility to opt whether we want to do that through our balance sheet or not, there are multiple ways that we can look at that. What we just did is one example of funding that loan portfolio with other people's money. And that having the return of $700 million of cash to us on our domestic balance sheet, which obviously opens us up to being able to do other things with that. So that's question #1. Question #2, on the EU stuff. Look, there are regulatory changes that go on throughout the world. The European ones are ones that are on everybody's minds right now. Some of those regulatory impacts affect our cost structure. Some of those can affect pricing on certain -- some of them can affect how you do business in certain ways. And so we look at each and every one of those changes on a market-by-market basis and react accordingly to those. The one thing we definitely don't do is react publicly to those. We think about them and then we decide what the right way to react is on that. But this is nothing new, as you well know, Sanjay, you're an expert in all of this. There are changes going on all the time all over the world. And one of the assets, I think, PayPal brings to this world is we're 100% focused on digital payments. And one of the core competencies we have is our regulatory and compliance oversight. And so we are on top of all of these things all the time. In terms of the CFPB, we work with regulators all over the world. And I will say this, and this is probably the most important thing, is that there's no difference between what a regulator wants and what PayPal wants. We pride ourselves on being a customer champion, and regulators only want what's best for consumers and customers in general. And so we are very aligned philosophically on what we both want to provide. As the CFPB comes in and looks at the ways that we've done business, they may have suggestions on how we can do that better. And we certainly work with them to try and provide the best alternative to our consumers to make sure that we are as clear as possible in our communications and fully compliant with all regulations. And we, as in every single quarter, take a look at what exposures might be. We reserve for them appropriately. And that's a thing that we do every single quarter. So hopefully, that helps to answer all of your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 earnings call. This is a special moment. Our Q2 results marked the final consolidated earnings call for eBay Inc. 
On Monday July 20, PayPal and eBay will begin trading as separate, independent public companies. 
Our call will run a little longer today. I'll be brief, and Bob will provide a quick summary of the overall eBay Inc. financial results, and then we'll turn it over to Dan and Devin, who will provide full details on the quarter and outlook for each business. 
Suffice it to say, we are very pleased with our overall Q2 performance. FX-neutral revenue from continuing operations was up 12%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 9%. 
PayPal and eBay both delivered strong Q2 results and have strong momentum. Dan, Devin and their respective teams are executing well and looking to create the next great chapter for PayPal and eBay. 
Since announcing the decision to separate last September, our teams have done a remarkable job. We said we would move with speed and clarity, and we have. We said we would create operating agreements that preserve synergies while creating strategic flexibility for each business. We have. We said we would build 2 world-class management teams and Boards of Directors. We have. And we said we would set each business up for long-term success, and I believe we have done just that. 
Each business is well capitalized with strong balance sheets, and Dan and Devin each have clear, focused strategies to drive PayPal and eBay forward. 
In closing, I joined this company 10 years ago because I was inspired by the purpose and values of our founder, Pierre Omidyar. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Serving our customers and bringing our purpose to life has been a privilege. I am proud of what we've accomplished, building 2 global leaders in commerce and payments. 
Each step of the way, we've been committed to doing what's best for our customers, our employees and our shareholders, and this moment's no different. Launching PayPal and eBay as independent companies is clearly the best path for each business and the right approach for delivering sustainable value to shareholders. 
Last, I'm proud that we're executing a smooth succession process, and I am thrilled for Dan and Devin. They are the right leaders who will launch the next chapters for PayPal and eBay, and I'm confident that under their leadership and that of their respective teams, PayPal and eBay have great futures ahead. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide a summary of our overall Q2 results."

I'll provide a brief update on the quarter results at the Inc. level before handing the call over to PayPal and eBay teams for more detail. 
During the discussion, we will reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Before I start, I wanted to highlight that the eBay's board has authorized the decision to sell eBay Enterprise, and as a result, those results will be included in discontinued operations. And while it is not in our press release, about 3 minutes ago, we concluded the sale of eBay Enterprise for approximately $925 million. I'll touch on that a bit later. 
Q2 was a great quarter, demonstrating continued momentum for both businesses. Revenue from continuing operations was $4.4 billion, up 12% on an FX-neutral basis, a 2-point acceleration from the first quarter. PayPal revenue was $2.3 billion, up 19%, and eBay revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 9% on continuing operations. 
We generated $688 million of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the first half of the year. 
In the quarter, we completed the sale of the PayPal loan portfolio, increasing U.S. cash balance by roughly $700 million, and we exited our stake in craigslist. As of June 30, PayPal and eBay are capitalized with $6.6 billion and $8.5 billion cash, respectively. 
In Q2, on a continuing operating basis, we generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 12% with strength across both businesses. Currency negatively impacted our growth by approximately 5 points. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 9% on a continuing operations basis. The EPS improvement was driven by accelerating top line growth, a streamlined cost structure and a lower share count. 
Operating margins were up 110 basis points on a continuing operations basis while we continued to invest in our key strategic priorities. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, we have improved our cash balance by $0.5 billion to $15.1 billion. We generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We bought back $1 billion in stock, and we executed on strategic initiatives, closing 2 acquisitions, selling craigslist and a portion of our credit receivable portfolio. 
Additionally, we've moved $3.8 billion of cash from eBay to PayPal. Upon separation, both businesses will have the financial flexibility to pursue their respective capital allocation priorities. 
As I mentioned earlier, eBay's board has authorized management to sell eBay Enterprise. Just minutes ago, we announced that we restated a definitive agreement to sell the business for $925 million. The discontinued ops will result in an impairment charge of $786 million, and we expect the deal to close the transaction in the second half of this year. 
I want to touch on 3 quick items before handing the call over to Dan and Devin. First, on segment margins. As a reminder, Patrick and Scott will refer to segment margins in discussing their second quarter results. These exclude corporate cost, dissynergies and stand-up related costs. They also exclude incremental revenue that results from previously eliminated intercompany revenues. 
In the second quarter, these costs for PayPal represented approximately 3 to 4 points and approximately 4 to 5 points for eBay. 
Second, GAAP to non-GAAP results are wider than usual. In addition to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, the quarter includes the impact from the selling our investment in craigslist, the onetime cost associated with separation and the impairment charge associated with the sale of eBay Enterprise. 
And lastly, let me describe 4 important filings that will take place in the next 6 weeks. We will file and eBay Inc. 8-K that will provide a pro forma view of eBay after giving effect to the distribution of PayPal. eBay Inc. will file its 10-Q, including segment results for only the eBay and PayPal businesses. And PayPal will file a 10-Q in the second quarter, including stand-alone revenue and operating margins. And lastly, in mid-August, eBay will file an 8-K to provide investors with meaningful, historical financial information, including stand-alone revenue and operating margins. 
In closing, I want to say thank you. It's been a privilege working with you over the years. I feel great about what we've accomplished over the last 10 years, but I feel even better about the teams that we are passing the baton to. 
So with that, let me now turn the call over to the new leadership teams at eBay and PayPal to discuss their segment-specific results for the quarter."
27862,305324257,833730,"eBay Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm glad that Patrick and I have the opportunity to meet so many of you in person during our recent roadshow. It almost goes without saying that this is an exciting time for PayPal. I'm",1867,"Thank you, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm glad that Patrick and I have the opportunity to meet so many of you in person during our recent roadshow. 
It almost goes without saying that this is an exciting time for PayPal. I'm happy to report as we enter this next chapter in our history that we had another strong quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to help shape the transformation of digital and mobile payments for much of the world. 
With that, let me highlight some of our results and initiatives for the quarter. Payment volume was $66 billion, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating from Q1 where our payment volume was already up a robust 25%. 
Importantly, PayPal continued to gain share globally, growing at roughly double the pace of e-commerce. More specifically, our Merchant Services payment volume increased by a strong 36% as we continue to win with the larger, leading commerce players, both traditional retailers and next-generation platforms. This metric also accelerated 3 points from Q1. 
On our last earnings call, I outlined the 4 metrics that best measure the growth and health of our business. As a reminder, they are top line revenue growth, the scale of our customer base, the engagement of that base as shown by transactions per active account and free cash flow. We continue to drive incremental progress across all of these metrics. 
First, I'll start with our top line growth. As Bob mentioned, our Q2 revenue was $2.3 billion, up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, a 200 basis point improvement from Q1. 
Second, our customer base continues to expand. We ended the quarter with 169 million active accounts, an increase of 11% and up from 165 million active accounts at the end of Q1. This growth is driven by the growing strength of our PayPal brands. 
PayPal was named as one of the top 100 brands throughout the world in a recent study. And in countries like Australia and the U.K., we rank as one of the top 10 most trusted brands. This trust helps to drive both acquisition and engagement. 
Also, in a recent study, U.S. consumers who plan to make their first mobile payment in a physical store in the next 6 months were asked how they would choose to pay. Over 70% said they would trust PayPal over others with their transaction. And that brand preference is a powerful asset as we look towards the future. 
Third, we continue to deepen engagement with our customer base. We processed almost 1.1 billion transactions in the second quarter, up 27% even as we continue to grow customers at the top of our funnel. Our monetization per account increased to $50 from $48 a year ago, and our customers use PayPal more often. 
Transactions per active account rose substantially from last year, now at [indiscernible] year, up from 21x a year in Q2 of last year. 
Let me spend just a bit more time on engagement as that metric is an important reflection of the value we bring to our ecosystem. That value starts with mobile leadership. For the second quarter, mobile transactions represented 30% of our total transactions, up 1 point from Q1 and grew 42%. We see ourselves as a mobile-first platform, and the majority of our development efforts continue to support our innovation across mobile payments and digital commerce. 
Being a trusted way to pay in today's most popular apps is helping to drive this increase in mobile engagement across not only online and in app, but importantly, we are seeing the very beginning of our in-store strategy play out. 
PayPal continues to make very strong inroads with leading mobile players. We are now live with 67% of the top 100 mobile merchants. Importantly, we are making initial strides, empowering the in-store mobile shopping experiences developed by our merchant partners. 
The Paydiant-powered Subway app became the #2 downloaded food and beverage iOS app in the U.S. in June and is now available across 30,000-plus stores. And in collaboration with Telstar, we announced the national rollout of PayPal as a way to pay at 5,000 Burger King stores. 
As pleased as we are with our customers' engagement, we aspire to much more. We want a creative value proposition that inspires the average PayPal customer to use our app 2 to 3x a week versus the 2 to 3x per month they use PayPal today. And while that is a significant stretch goal for us, we already see this type of usage better with our Venmo users. 
For a generation that has never written a check, Venmo is the way to pay the rent, pay back a friend, and it is in the middle of how the millennial generation manage and move their money. As a result, in Q2, Venmo processed $1.6 billion of transaction volume, a 247% increase. 
And finally, we are on track to deliver our free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for 2015. As John mentioned earlier, the separation process has gone very well, and we've completed this significant effort in record time. 
The separation has given PayPal the opportunity to invest heavily in our infrastructure, setting up state-of-the-art networks and data centers to give PayPal the competitive edge. This was no small task, and our technology teams deserve a tremendous amount of recognition for this achievement. 
At the same time, we continue to push forward the transformation of our technology platform. We've made great progress and are approximately 2/3 of the way through this 3-year initiative. We have rearchitected much of our back-end infrastructure and consequently, have sped up payment processing by up to 50% in the past year and reduced time to push code live to site by more than half. 
We are a fully agile software development shop, now one of the largest in the world. And being agile allows us to innovate more quickly, integrate more effectively and introduce new products or deploy new markets faster than ever. 
And a great example of our new flexibility and speed to market is One Touch. One Touch is the most significant improvement to our checkout experience in the past 5-plus years. One Touch lets people pay with just a single touch on any mobile phone, tablet and desktop across iOS, Android and Windows operating systems. It removes almost all friction from the checkout experience. 
One Touch was started on our Braintree platform, but as we've integrated the PayPal and Braintree software stacks, we were able to migrate its functionality within 6 months to our traditional PayPal payment flows in the U.S., U.K. and Canada with many other markets targeted for later this year. 
And while it will take time to properly deploy One Touch through our various payment flows, we expect it to be available for over 50% of our U.S. transactions by year-end. 
Braintree continues to be the payments partner of choice for mobile disruptors and innovators. In Q2, we announced that Pinterest is now using Braintree's full stack processing platform. Notably, of the 5 major retailers that were part of Pinterest viable pins launched, 4 of them are using Braintree. These include Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Michaels and Gardeners Supply Company. 
And in line with our strategy of processing 100% share of checkout for our merchant partners, we also announced the addition of Android Pay, a new form of payment on our platform. 
Earlier this month, we took another important step to further enhance customer confidence and trust in the PayPal brand. On July 1, we extended our buyer protection program to cover not only physical products but also intangible goods and services, including digital goods, digital music, digital books, digital games, travel tickets and software downloads. 
As a result, PayPal now offers buyer protection on 99% plus of everything bought on our platform. We believe this is an industry-leading value proposition, and that was enabled by our world-class risk and data analytics teams. 
I want to reiterate what we said during our road show. PayPal is much more than a web-based proprietary payment platform. We are making significant progress in our quest to become the world's leading open payments platform for merchants and consumers. 
With the integration of Braintree and the addition of Paydiant to our technology platform, we can provide end-to-end solutions for merchants of all sizes, online, in app and in store. By being payment, device, point of sale and operating system agnostic, we enable merchants to navigate the increasingly complicated and confusing landscape of payment options and changing consumer behaviors. 
Beyond the checkout experience with merchants, the accelerated adoption of mobile commerce and payments by consumers affords us the opportunity to transform the management and movement of money. For consumers, we make their transactions safer, easier and less expensive. 
Earlier this month, we announced the $890 million acquisition of Xoom, providing us an opportunity to accelerate our entrance into the international remittances industry, a $600 billion market ripe for disruption. 
By adding additional value-added services to our technology platform, we believe we can amplify our customer flywheel, creating a more powerful network effect. Xoom lets people send money to and pay bills for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast and cost-effective way using their mobile phone, tablet or computer. 
And during the 12 months ended March 31, 2015, Xoom reported that its 1.3 million active customers sent roughly $7 billion to people on 38 different markets, including the Philippines, India, Mexico, Brazil and China. 
Xoom's brand promise resonates with ours. They have a strong and engaged customer profile and a mobile and digital service orientation, providing real and transparent value globally. 
Technology should make managing and moving our money right, not a privilege for just the affluent, and we believe our technology platform, global reach and trusted brand can move PayPal from being an occasional transaction to being an integral part of consumers' financial life. Adding remittance capabilities bolsters our efforts to achieve that goal. 
I'd like to close by saying that all of us at PayPal are thrilled to return to our original roots as an independent company. On July 20, our original stock ticker symbol, PYPL, will once again be publicly traded on NASDAQ for the second time in our 17-year history. 
I'd like to take a moment to thank each generation of leadership and especially all of our employees, who brought us to this point. More specifically, I'd like to thank John, Bob, Mike, Alan, Beth and the eBay Inc. team for all they have done over the past 9 months and helping us formulate and separate 2 future Fortune 500 companies. 
I also want to thank Devin and the eBay team for their support of PayPal. I look forward to a long and productive relationship with them. 
It's been a remarkable journey, but we are just starting. Today, the potential to improve and transform how money works for people has never been greater. We are fully signed up to meet that challenge and excited by the tremendous opportunity ahead. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Patrick to discuss our financial metrics in more detail."

We generated $66 billion of payment volume, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, an acceleration of 3 points, driven by strong growth at Braintree and Venmo as volume translated into $2.3 billion of revenue, up 16% on a reported basis and 19% on a FX-neutral basis. 
Our increased share gain is an indication that our strategy is working. We are winning with the leaders in digital and mobile commerce, both with large retailers, who are expanding their footprint in mobile and online and with the next-generation apps that are transforming commerce. We have expanded our product solution from a proprietary, web-based payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. 
And as a direct effect of that strategy where larger customers and the broader service stack translate to a lower average take rate but higher volumes, our transaction margin is declining year-over-year. But in return, expanding volumes bring economies of scale for half of our operating expenses, creating capacity to invest and the opportunity to maintain or expand our operating margin. 
And indeed, in the second quarter, our segment margin expanded 160 basis points to 26.1% despite the 190 basis points degradation in transaction margin to 63.2%. And for the first 6 months of the year, our segment margin was up 60 basis points despite a decline of 140 basis points in our transaction margin. 
Before going to guidance, let me first provide some context on our earnings quarterly profile. First, the second quarter revenue and margin benefited from the premium received on the sale of our U.S. held credit receivable portfolio in the second quarter. This sale frees up capital that we can redeploy into higher-yielding investments, but it comes with a cost. 
In the second half of the year, we will not receive revenue or operating income associated with the assets we sold. This negatively impacts revenue growth and operating margin by approximately 1 point in the second half of the year. 
Second, Q3 has historically represented our lowest quarterly segment margin as we invest ahead of the holiday selling season, and the holiday season has an increased level of activity from large merchants, thus, lowering our Q4 transaction margin. 
And third, we will see the full impact of dissynergy cost and the operating agreement in the second half of the year. We expect a negative margin impact of approximately 5% in the second half of the year versus approximately 3% in the first half. 
Now to guidance. Going forward, we will only provide guidance on an annual basis using our quarterly earnings call to report on our progress. 
For 2015, we are executing on our strategy, and our Q2's strong performance only reinforces our confidence in our full year guidance. 
We continue to expect our FX-neutral revenue growth to be 15% to 18% for full year 2015 and our non-GAAP operating margin to be 20% to 21%, flat to up 1 point. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be 19% to 20% versus our prior range of 18% to 19%. This increase is due to a stronger U.S. performance. 
This translates into 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27, including approximately a $0.02 negative impact from the operating agreement in the second half of the year. 
Finally, we expect to generate free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion with a capital expenditures assumption of 8% to 10% of revenue, including approximately $100 million in onetime separation-related activities. 
Let me conclude with our balance sheet. Excluding the Xoom transaction, which we hope to close in Q4 '15 following receipt of regulatory approvals and other conditions, we stand up as an independent company with no debt and approximately $6.6 billion in cash and investments, $2.3 billion of which is in the U.S. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we will prioritize our investment activity to focus on organic activity first followed by M&A and lastly, buying back stock. We will continue to be an acquisitive company and expect to take a disciplined approach, looking for strong network effects and minimum short-term dilution. 
I will end my remarks by saying that we have developed a unique set of assets. We have created a leading, sustainable financial model, which allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale in a vibrant market, fueled by the digitization of money and the proliferation of connected devices. We are fully committed to our vision of being the world's leading open technology payments platform. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Devin and Scott at eBay."

Today, I'll cover 3 areas: first, I'll comment on our Q2 results; second, I'll provide an update on our strategy to drive eBay's business forward; and third, I'll share my perspective about the future of eBay. 
6 months into 2015, I'm encouraged by the state of our business and the progress we're making against our strategy. The year is shaping up well, and I'm confident in our full year outlook. 
Turning to Q2. Overall, we performed well last quarter, and our business was stable. eBay GMV grew at 6% on an FX-neutral basis, a 1-point acceleration from Q1 while revenue grew at 5% on an FX-neutral basis, a 2-point acceleration from Q1. 
Our active buyer base grew at 6% on a trailing 12-month basis, and our trailing 3-month active buyer growth was largely stable. Our active buyers transacted $20 billion of GMV in the quarter with 41% of that closing on mobile. 
Our Q2 GMV, revenue and active buyer growth are clearly steps in the right direction. We've made solid progress, but we have a lot of work ahead of us to maximize eBay's significant potential. We're still feeling the effects of new buyer cohorts we did not acquire over the past year due to the SEO traffic issues, and we're still working to recover buyers that we lost after yet last year's cybersecurity incident. 
To be clear, our absolute priority is to improve our competitiveness and drive more stable, profitable growth over the long term. We have a clear vision and strategy for our business. So let me now remind you of our plan for eBay and talk about some of the efforts we have underway along with some perspective on early results. 
As I mentioned on the last call, we intend to focus on our target customer base and on a market segment where we believe we can win. eBay was built on enabling unique selection and unmatched spectrum of value to our buyers around the world, and we plan to focus our resources and innovation on this large segment of the market. 
First, we're building a more robust commerce platform. Second, we're enhancing with our engagement with the core buyer and seller segments, who create a vibrant marketplace. And third, we're creating exceptional product and brand experiences. 
Let me touch on our efforts in each of these areas in a bit more detail. 
First, managing a robust commerce platform is key to creating sustainable performance. Our primary effort in this area is focused around leveraging structured data to drive discoverability, both on and off our marketplace as well as improving the user experience. This is a long-term effort, and our rollout is initially focused on categories where we have a predominance of manufactured goods. 
On June 29, we started to require that our sellers provide product identifiers, where relevant, when listing an item. This is enabling us to create innovative, new browse and product pages, which were not previously possible in our marketplace. So far, we've launched hundreds of thousands of new browse pages into the SEO ecosystem, and early results show that these pages convert equal to or better than the pages that they're replacing. 
We've launched thousands of new product pages across 22 categories through last week. These pages are the seeds of our ability to showcase our offering across new, refurbished and used items and provide the consumers the ability to make value-based choices that are truly unique to eBay. 
While this is an encouraging start, these efforts are in the early stages, and we'll continue to share more in our progress along the way. We also continue to experiment and grow new sources to diversify our traffic for consistent long-term growth. While still small relative to our more established channels, traffic from social channels is growing over 100% year-on-year in the U.S. 
On Facebook, we're early adopters of dynamic product ads, which enable retargeting on mobile. And on Pinterest, eBay's inspirational shopping content is driving very high engagement and click-through rates, and this success has positioned us as a top advertiser on the platform. 
We're also focused on growing our newer channels, including Instagram and Tumblr, and we've recently launched efforts on Snapchat and Periscope. We view social media and messaging platforms as a great way to reach our customers in the places they love while allowing us to diversify our sources of traffic and user acquisition for consistent, long-term growth. 
The second pillar of our strategy is to create a vibrant marketplace. For eBay consumers who love to shop, we'll continue to enhance our platform to bring them amazing value and unique selection. We source inventory on our site from small and medium-sized sellers, who range from well-known brands to medium-sized retailers to smaller entrepreneurs. These sellers represent 70% of global retail, and they're growing faster than the top 250 retailers. 
They bring to us a mix of inventory from unique items to discounted and season inventory to liquidation goods. We're on pace to sign a record number of managed sellers this year. Some key brands and sellers we've added include ASICS, Puma, GoPro, Sony and Bosch Power Tools. 
We're also driving a vibrant marketplace by reinventing our consumer selling approach. In Q2, we expanded our intermediated selling service, eBay Valet into the fashion category, and we now accept items for hundreds of designer fashion brands. While it's still early, the value proposition of eBay Valet is resonating with sellers and driving stronger peak engagement, and we continue to see strong growth in our Classifieds business, which is capturing the local C2C opportunity. 
On the seller experience front, we recently launched our promoted listings product, enabling eBay sellers to increase item visibility and drive buyer traffic to items they want to showcase such as new listings or seasonal must haves. While still an invite-only program, initial results show click-through rates on par with our organic search experience, and we're seeing strong seller demand to scale the program. 
Finally, our third pillar, exceptional product and brand experiences. In Q2, we rolled out improvements to our iPhone, iPad and Android experiences, and we launched our Apple Watch app, which enables users to interact with us quickly and easily while on the go. We've also rolled out significant improvements to search quality and relevance to enable buyers to more effectively find what they're looking for. 
Looking towards the second half, we'll be launching a new experience across mobile channels that we're really excited about. This experience is built upon learnings from our iPad app, a more engaging, discovery-based experience for buyers that also builds on our simplified mobile selling experience. This release will unify the mobile experience across our platforms, and it will enable a consistent user experience and faster product generation. 
Executing against our strategy also means being vigilant about our portfolio and ensuring that our investments are aligned with our strategic direction. As Bob mentioned earlier, we've just entered into an agreement to sell eBay Enterprise, and in June, we divested our stake in craigslist. 
Looking forward, we're investing organically to build out our eBay seller tools and data to acquire the small and medium-sized business, and we're beginning to scale Classifieds, a rapidly growing U.S. Classifieds mobile app. You can expect us to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation going forward. 
In summary, Q2 is a good quarter. We delivered against our strategy, and we're on track to deliver for the full year. You can count on us to continue to focus where we need to win and to make the hard decisions along the way that will enable us to more clearly define our space as a leader. 
I also want to congratulate Dan and the entire PayPal team, and we look forward to a close relationship working together in the future. As eBay celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, we're making rapid changes to position this business for the future. My goal and that of the entire leadership team is for eBay to be the best global marketplace and a great, enduring Internet business. eBay was founded with the purpose-driven ethos, which has fueled our company and our brand. As we write the next chapter for this incredible business, we will continue to focus on our purpose: to empower people and create opportunity through connected commerce. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Scott, who'll go into more details around our financial performance."

Overall, in Q2, we continued to stabilize many of our underlying operating metrics while delivering positive signs of acceleration in GMV and revenue growth. 
We remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives amidst the separation-related activities, and we are confident in our full year outlook. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation where we'll begin on Slide 16. 
Net revenues were $2.1 billion with revenue growth accelerating 2 points to 5% on an FX-neutral basis compared to Q1. Transaction revenue grew 5% on an FX-neutral basis, also accelerating 2 points versus Q1. The increase in transaction revenue growth was largely driven by the acceleration in GMV growth. 
Marketing Services revenue grew 7% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating 2 points over the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by our advertising format. 
In addition, we continue to deliver strong results in our Classifieds formats, which is expanding its geographic footprint in Latin America and the U.S. 
Finally, we continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, which negatively impacted total revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 8 points. 
On Slide 17, some highlights on our operating metrics. As Devin explained earlier, we grew trailing 12-month active buyers by 6%, down 2 points compared to Q1. We expected this decline as we continue to deal with the implications of fewer new buyers on eBay due to SEO challenges and the friction introduced by resetting passwords after the cybersecurity incident. 
We grew GMV 6% on an FX-neutral basis, 1 point faster than Q1. In the U.S., GMV grew 2%, consistent with Q1. 
It's worth noting that U.S. GMV, a measure of consumer buying, grew 6% as U.S. buyers took advantage of the global selection and value available on eBay. We grew our International business 8% on an FX-neutral basis, 1 point faster than the prior quarter. That acceleration was driven by the strength in Europe, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. 
Segment margin is down 50 basis points from last year as the savings from our Q1 restructuring were more than offset by negative currency translation plus the investment in our key initiatives. 
Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses were 44% of revenue in the quarter, down 1.4 points year-over-year. In Q2, we benefited from the restructuring at the beginning of the year, which delivered savings across all areas of the business. 
Additionally, we lapped expenses incurred in Q2 2014 in both marketing and transaction losses related to the security -- the cybersecurity incident. 
As highlighted in our June investor presentation, over the long term, we expect sales and marketing and product development cost to remain relatively flat versus 2015 as a percentage of revenue. We also expect to drive leverage in G&A and reinvest in our key strategic initiatives, which include building a more robust commerce platform, creating a more vibrant marketplace and developing exceptional product and brand experiences. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss our exposure to and approach to hedging. Our revenue continues to be heavily exposed to currency fluctuations. 
Earlier this year, we took action to utilize additional hedging strategies to economically protect full year net income. Some of those strategies are not eligible for hedge accounting, and thus, we must mark-to-market the hedging instruments through earnings, potentially creating volatility in our quarterly results going forward. 
Now let me turn to guidance on Slide 18. As a reminder, in our June investor presentation, we've provided 2015 full year guidance of 0 to 5% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis, fully allocated operating margin of 32% to 34% and free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. 
Based on our first half performance, we're more confident in our full year outlook. As a result, we are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to 3%, projecting 2015 neutral -- FX-neutral growth between 3% to 5%. Fully allocated operating margin and free cash flow remain in line with our previous guidance. 
Additionally, we are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $1.72 to $1.77 per share. For the third quarter, we are projecting revenue growth of 3% to 5% as well on an FX-neutral basis and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. 
I'd like to take a moment to provide some perspective on our approach to capital allocation. While our focus is first and foremost, on revitalizing our business, our philosophy is that the capital return and disciplined M&A will be important to shareholder value as well. 
We can -- we will continue to be good stewards of capital and ensure we use a strategic and disciplined approach in all of our activities. Our policy has several key tenets, including focusing on long-term value creation while making sure we have the resources to execute our strategy; driving growth while balancing profitability; supplementing organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments while maximizing the capital deployed in these assets; and managing the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital while offsetting both the dilution and reducing share count via opportunistic share repurchases at attractive prices. 
We believe that by adhering to these principles, we will drive the most value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Turning to our balance sheet and the implementation of this policy. We ended Q2 with $8.5 billion in cash, $7.6 billion in debt, thus, approximately $1 billion of net cash. 
In the second half of the year, we expect to generate strong cash flows, leveraging our capital efficient business model and disciplined approach to capital allocation. This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion for share repurchase, which, when coupled with our existing $2 billion authorization, brings our total capacity to repurchase shares to $3 billion. 
We continue to be disciplined in how we will assess our assets, selling our equity stake in craigslist while settling all outstanding litigation with them and our board authorized the sale of eBay Enterprise, and we've announced this sale this morning. 
Finally, we expect the rating agencies to conclude their ratings review process soon, providing clarity on eBay credits rating. The rating will be an investment-grade profile at the high end of the BBB range, which we believe is important for our existing creditors and customers. 
In summary, in the first half of 2015, we continue to stabilize many of our underlying metrics while delivering positive signs of acceleration in GMV and revenue growth. We remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives, and we are confident in our full year outlook. And while the road ahead will not be an easy one, we are incredibly excited about our future opportunities and our ability to win.

First on levels of marketing spend, in line with what we normally do on holiday, we will ramp up our holiday spend. It's likely that depending on the underlying metrics that we see, we may do that a little bit more aggressively this season, but let's keep in mind that we are a very disciplined marketer. We don't throw money against the wall and hope things stick. We measure almost every $0.01 that we spend, and we try to get a return on that. It doesn't have to be immediate, but we understand the CLV of user acquisition, and we're disciplined about the way we spend. So as you've heard me say before, it's not hard to grow an e-commerce company. It is hard to grow value in an e-commerce company, and we're solving the grow value. So we will spend into the holiday, but we won't spend to acquire business or users at any cost because plenty are doing that, but not plenty are creating value. On diversification of marketing, it is very important to me that we end up in a couple of years with multiple channels that are competing for our incremental investment dollar. I'll remind you that the majority of eBay's traffic comes directly to us either to our apps or to our site. That's the premium of our brand showing up. But not an insignificant minority comes through channels, and it's very important that we have more of those channels that are competing for our dollar. And as you heard in my remarks, we're working very closely with the social and the messaging platforms to try to scale our investment to helpfully have positive ROI, acquire new users and new traffic. I'd say it's early. I'm encouraged by what I see. We're optimistic about the future, but it is early, and we are a very large digital marketer, one of the largest on the web, and the total amount that we've been able to spend into positive results on these platforms is still very small compared to our more established channels. So it'll take time, but we're on the path. Thanks for the question."

It literally does take out all friction out of the commerce experience, where you can check out with a single touch, and so we're very excited about it. What we're doing with One Touch is we've been able to seamlessly bring that over from the Braintree platform into our PayPal flows, and so as we bring it into our PayPal flow, a consumer doesn't need to do anything differently except opt in. That's what they have to do for that on each device in which they want to integrate One Touch. So for them, it's a seamless type of integration. On the merchant side, the same thing. We're able to do this in a seamless fashion. The merchant doesn't have to upgrade. It automatically happens for the merchant as we take that One Touch capability into that PayPal payment flow, and so we're just going about this in a disciplined fashion. Rolling it out, we started this a little over a month ago to 1% of our traffic. We've ramped that up to 5% of our traffic then we started expanding it into other countries. We'll start expanding it throughout the world, but we're just doing it in a very disciplined fashion to make sure there are no issues with it.

First of all, we are very focused on I call it 2 major constituencies. We've got merchants on one side, consumers on the other. Obviously, developers are a third constituency for us, but let's focus on merchants and consumers right now. So the first thing that we needed to do, and we have spent a lot of time, and I give a tremendous amount of credit to the team at PayPal and the former leadership teams at PayPal in terms of their foresight in the technological upgrades that we've done on our platform. The technology upgrades we've done allow us to innovate. They allow us to deploy changes and innovations in times that were unheard of even a year or so ago. So we have the ability to constantly do AB testing on our website on all the different programs that we have right now. That's difficult for us several years ago. As a result of that, our acquisition and our acquisition flow on that is improving dramatically as is our retention efforts. We are ramping up our life cycle management efforts across the world because we now have realtime data and information that we can use. We know what the various variables are that we lead to indication and churn or the indication of a very profitable customer, and we're accelerating on all of those, and the technology upgrades we did on the platform is helping us tremendously on that. On the consumer side, we obviously want to be more a part of their financial lives. We want to move from being a occasional use, twice a month, to them using us 2 to 3x a month. And we think that's obviously a stretched goals through all of our active base, but we already have an example of that in Venmo. Venmo users use the service 2 to 4x a week. It's a part of how they manage and move their money, and we want to become more of a part of how consumers manage and move their money. The acquisition of Xoom is a good example of that. It takes capabilities that another company has built up. You apply that to the scale that we have in our base and our global reach, and we think taking those capabilities, combining them with the assets that we have at PayPal, gives us a tremendously powerful flywheel for both acquisition and engagement of our consumers, and we're very excited about that combination. And so as we look into the future, and we look at the potential of consolidation and acquisitions going forward, as Patrick mentioned, we'll take a very disciplined approach to that. Now that our platform is significantly upgraded, we can do a lot more things organically, and we will take advantage of that, and we have a very disciplined product road map in place. That's where One Touch came from. That's where our expanded buyer protection came from. These were all organic efforts. But if we see a capability or an ability to enter into a market at scale through an acquisition that helps our flywheel, both in acquisition and engagement, we'll look at that carefully."

We started the year, and we described some of the issues that we were working through, and we discussed the fact that some of the buyer cohorts that we had lost last year",490,"Colin, to your question on growth, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. We started the year, and we described some of the issues that we were working through, and we discussed the fact that some of the buyer cohorts that we had lost last year will take some time to reacquire, and because of that, it wasn't as simple as passing a calendar date and lapping it. There were some systematic issues on reacquiring buyers that we were working our way through. We were confident we would do it, but we also explained that it would take time. And in that context, we gave guidance for 2015, which was 0 to 5% revenue growth. As we got a bit further in the first half, we clarified our strategy and communicated that on our investor presentation and through our roadshow, and what we said there is we feel great about our future, but this will be a transformative moment for eBay, where we've got a lot of hard work to, and we're going to make some choices, which in and amongst themselves are the right decisions for eBay, but they'll create some short-term growth issues. And in that context, we extended the guidance through 2016. Now with the first half over, what I'd say is things are going pretty well, and we feel pretty good about that, and that's given us the ability [indiscernible] guidance up, but I just refer you back to everything we said in the first half. We're doing what we said we do. We're executing the strategy. We're working through the issues. All of that remains exactly as I said in the first quarter on the roadshow and through the investor presentation. So I would just say we're feeling good about where we are. We are on the right path, but I'd caution against any assumption that says well, we just popped out of this, and now growth rates are going back to exactly where they were. There are a lot more factors involved. We feel great about where we are and the path we're on, and like I said, I think we laid down a bunch of markers and what's important to me is we're doing exactly what we said, and we're trickling towards the upper end of that trajectory, and we'll keep updating you as we go. On the small and medium-sized business issue, I just say the overwhelming majority of what eBay sells comes from small and medium-sized businesses, overwhelming majority. A large seller on eBay is a couple of million dollars, and that's the incredible breadth and the fragmentation that is eBay, the 25 million sellers are the incredible spectrum of small sellers and entrepreneurs and even individuals. In many ways, that's our strength. So the segment we're leaning into really is where we have #1 market share and where we're the best and where we believe we can win."

Thanks for your question. Very consistently over the last -- you look back over time, we've grown our subscribers through the ups and downs of eBay by anywhere between 3 million and 5 million a quarter that have come in quarter-after-quarter, and this was no exception again this quarter. We grew our actives from 165 million to 169 million. And so as we work closely with eBay, and we look at the acquisition that comes off of that, we've obviously expanded our acquisition efforts tremendously off of eBay. We have a tremendous amount of organic traffic that comes to our website that we convert. We have merchants now, 10 million-plus merchants across the world, that also generate consumer acquisition. And as our value proposition strengthens, as our brand strengthens, as our scale strengthens, there is a network effect that just naturally goes on. And as our life cycle efforts, which are still relatively nascent I would say in general, expand, I think we can improve our ability to both attract customers to PayPal and importantly, retain and engage them, make them active customers. So I feel very good about that, and I think our history proves that point. In terms of TPV growth, again if you look at our TPV results over the last several quarters, you can see very strong and accelerating TPV growth, and that is across-the-board. Not only is our MS growing this quarter, but very strong growth out of Braintree, very strong growth out of Venmo, very strong growth in credit on the revenue side. So we have a very balanced portfolio across the world and across our product mix. We're seeing good strength driving that TPV and revenue."

Whether the initiatives are in or not when we gave the guidance, of course, everything in the business was in it. There was no footnote to that, but as we see the progress of these initiatives, we'll update the guidance when we get closer to '16. Vis-à-vis, I just I guess I wouldn't comment on a specific asset, I just comment on our approach to our portfolio, which is everything has to have a reason to exist in the portfolio. Not everything has to have a path to direct ownership or accretion of our results immediately, but ultimately, we don't hold things for the sake of holding them,and you've seen that through the disposition of Enterprise and of craigslist. And ultimately, we'll look at everything through that same lens. I think that vis-a-vis that relationship, it's been a strong relationship. They've done a great job. We've learned and grown together, and it's been a very positive and constructive relationship, but again our portfolio, we understand that every investment we have needs to have a reason.

On the user growth, as we said and as you've seen, these are sort of long-cycle movements. They don't immediately move up and down. They sort of are longer cycle sine wave-type movements, and we've been moving down since last year, but I think what was very important in this announcement, in this earnings was the fact that we've seen for the first time really since May of '14 quarter-on-quarter stability in user acquisition. So that doesn't mean we snap right back, but I feel like there is a reasonable chance that we're at the bottom of that sine wave now. We can now start working our way back up. So that to me is an encouraging sign. And just vis-à-vis the opportunity when user growth, I mean, yes. One of the things I'm proud of stuff over the last 4 years is we added roughly 16 million active accounts, which is a sign of relevance, to say the least. So I think the ability to continue to acquire users and drive eBay's relevance across consumers and sellers is absolutely part of what we're talking about in our strategy. On the pages, it's really early and like I said, this is going to be a long-term effort. I think we put pages up that I think are very interesting. They're interesting not just to reacquire SEO traffic, but they're interesting for what they mean to the shopping experience on eBay. This is not about another commodity page to sell another commodity item. This about sharpening the focus on what is truly, uniquely different about our business, and that's a spectrum of choices and value, which can only be done when we understand product families. So I am encouraged by it, but we have 800 million items for sale, and this is going to take quite a long time, but the benefits will come as we work them. It's not all or nothing, and we'll just keep working our way down and providing updates as we go. Thanks for the question."

Maybe a couple of points on each of these. The repurchases, we expanded the authorization by $1 billion to $3 billion this morning. With regards to your question specifically around the debt, we're still in the final stages with the bond rating agencies about finalizing their ratings. We believe that will be a strong investment-grade rating, and that would be a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, somewhere between 2.5 to 3, which would provide us sufficient financial flexibility to take on additional debt if we chose. And over the course of the following months and years, we'll continue to execute and be disciplined around each of those tenets."

We bring, first of all, now almost 170 million users onto the platform. Those are typically more active users than the normal Internet user. They spend more. They are more active, and so we bring a very engaged base to the merchant. It's simple and easy to integrate with us. We've made that a very low-touch experience now. We're increasingly doing in context so that when a consumer purchases on a merchant website, they don't need to bounce back to something else. They could do it in context on the merchant's website. So our value proposition is improving quite substantially. One Touch is another substantial improvement on that, and it's really a matter of going in and getting the right channels and getting the right touch points to those merchants. We have a channel that goes after large merchants. We're making very good progress on that. We -- obviously there are some merchants that there was an inherent conflict when we were a part of eBay. This now opens our opportunity to look at every single merchant out there as a truly independent third-party payments platform on that. We're also beginning to win with some players like big commerce, whether you're using our platform. That really goes into the small market with partnerships, and we're looking at more and more of that and making some very good progress on that. So I'm very encouraged by kind of the efforts in terms of our merchant-acquiring business. It's growing substantially. Our value proposition is stronger than ever. And if you look at our strategy, the whole idea behind merchant acquiring is how do we become a great partner for merchants? How do we do more and more for them in this increasingly complicated world? How do we become 100% share of checkout so they can easily integrate any form of payment that they want to put in there, whether it's Bitcoin or Android Pay or any of the credit card companies, we can integrate that for them. We can integrate into their loyalty. We can integrate into their rewards. We can integrate into offers, and so we really want to be a -- fully a partner with a completely agnostic platform that allows the merchant to interact with their consumers in a very personal level. And so we're putting in a lot of places, a lot of pieces to that puzzle and feel really good about the initials success we've seen on that."

Our Q2 results marked the final consolidated earnings call for eBay Inc. On Monday, July 20, PayPal and eBay will begin trading as separate, independent public companies. Our call will run a little longer today. I'll be brief, and Bob will provide a quick summary of the overall eBay Inc. financial results, and then we'll turn it over to Dan and Devin, who will provide full details on the quarter and outlook for each business. 
Suffice it to say, we are very pleased with our overall Q2 performance. FX-neutral revenue from continuing operations was up 12% and non-GAAP EPS was up 9%. PayPal and eBay both delivered strong Q2 results and have strong momentum. Dan, Devin and their respective teams are executing well and looking to create the next great chapter for PayPal and eBay. 
Since announcing the decision to separate last September, our teams have done a remarkable job. We said we would move with speed and clarity. And we have. We said we would create operating agreements that preserve synergies while creating strategic flexibility for each business. We have. We said we would build 2 world-class management teams and Boards of Directors. We have. And we said we would set each business up for long-term success. And I believe we have done just that. Each business is well capitalized with strong balance sheets, and Dan and Devin each have clear, focused strategies to drive PayPal and eBay forward. 
In closing, I joined this company 10 years ago because I was inspired by the purpose and values of our founder, Pierre Omidyar. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Serving our customers and bringing our purpose to life has been a privilege. I am proud of what we've accomplished, building 2 global leaders in commerce and payments. Each step of the way, we've been committed to doing what's best for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. And this moment is no different. Launching PayPal and eBay as independent companies is clearly the best path for each business and the right approach for delivering sustainable value to shareholders. 
Last, I'm proud that we're executing a smooth succession process, and I am thrilled for Dan and Devin. They are the right leaders who will launch the next chapters for PayPal and eBay, and I'm confident that under their leadership and that of their respective teams, PayPal and eBay have great futures ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide a summary of our overall Q2 results."

I'll provide a brief update on the quarter results at the Inc. level before handing the call over to PayPal and eBay teams for more detail. During the discussion, we will reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Before I start, I wanted to highlight that the eBay's board has authorized the decision to sell eBay Enterprise. And as a result, those results will be included in discontinued operations. And while it is not in our press release, about 3 minutes ago, we concluded the sale of eBay Enterprise for approximately $925 million. I'll touch on that a bit later. 
Q2 was a great quarter, demonstrating continued momentum for both businesses. Revenue from continuing operations was $4.4 billion, up 12% on an FX-neutral basis, a 2 point acceleration from the first quarter. PayPal revenue was $2.3 billion, up 19%, and eBay revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 9% on continuing operations. 
We generated $688 million of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the first half of the year. In the quarter, we completed the sale of the PayPal loan portfolio, increasing U.S. cash balance by roughly $700 million, and we exited our stake in Craigslist. As of June 30, PayPal and eBay are capitalized with $6.6 billion and $8.5 billion cash, respectively. 
In Q2, on a continuing operating basis, we generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 12%, with strength across both businesses. Currency negatively impacted our growth by approximately 5 points. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 9% on a continuing operations basis. The EPS improvement was driven by accelerating top line growth, a streamlined cost structure and a lower share count. Operating margins were up 110 basis points on a continuing operations basis while we continued to invest in our key strategic priorities. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, we have improved our cash balance by $0.5 billion to $15.1 billion. We generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We bought back $1 billion in stock, and we executed on strategic initiatives, closing 2 acquisitions, selling Craigslist and a portion of our credit receivable portfolio. Additionally, we've moved $3.8 billion of cash from eBay to PayPal. Upon separation, both businesses will have the financial flexibility to pursue their respective capital allocation priorities. 
As I mentioned earlier, eBay's board has authorized management to sell eBay Enterprise. Just minutes ago, we announced that we've reached a definitive agreement to sell the business for $925 million. The discontinued ops will result in an impairment charge of $786 million, and we expect the deal to close the transaction in the second half of this year. 
I want to touch on 3 quick items before handing the call over to Dan and Devin. First, on segment margins. As a reminder, Patrick and Scott will refer to segment margins in discussing their second quarter results. These exclude corporate cost, dissynergies and standup-related costs. They also exclude incremental revenue that results from previously eliminated intercompany revenues. In the second quarter, these costs for PayPal represented approximately 3 to 4 points and approximately 4 to 5 points for eBay. Second, GAAP to non-GAAP results are wider than usual. In addition to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, the quarter includes the impact from selling our investment in Craigslist, the onetime cost associated with separation and the impairment charge associated with the sale of eBay Enterprise. 
And lastly, let me describe 4 important filings that will take place in the next 6 weeks. We will file an eBay Inc. 8-K that will provide a pro forma view of eBay after giving effect to the distribution of PayPal. eBay Inc. will file its 10-Q, including segment results for only the eBay and PayPal businesses. And PayPal will file a 10-Q in the second quarter, including stand-alone revenue and operating margins. And lastly, in mid-August, eBay will file an 8-K to provide investors with meaningful, historical financial information, including stand-alone revenue and operating margins. 
In closing, I want to say thank you. It's been a privilege working with you over the years. I feel great about what we've accomplished over the last 10 years, but I feel even better about the teams that we are passing the baton to. So with that, let me now turn the call over to the new leadership teams at eBay and PayPal to discuss their segment-specific results for the quarter."
27862,305324257,833849,"eBay Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm glad that Patrick and I have the opportunity to meet so many of you in person during our recent roadshow. It almost goes without saying that this is an exciting time for PayPal. I'm ha",1874,"Thank you, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm glad that Patrick and I have the opportunity to meet so many of you in person during our recent roadshow. It almost goes without saying that this is an exciting time for PayPal. I'm happy to report as we enter this next chapter in our history that we had another strong quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to help shape the transformation of digital and mobile payments around much of the world. 
With that, let me highlight some of our results and initiatives for the quarter. Payment volume was $66 billion, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating from Q1 where our payment volume was already up a robust 25%. Importantly, PayPal continued to gain share globally, growing at roughly double the pace of e-commerce. More specifically, our Merchant Services payment volume increased by a strong 36% as we continue to win with the larger, leading commerce players, both traditional retailers and next-generation platforms. This metric also accelerated 3 points from Q1. 
On our last earnings call, I outlined the 4 metrics that best measure the growth and health of our business. As a reminder, they are top line revenue growth, the scale of our customer base, the engagement of that base as shown by transactions per active account and free cash flow. We continue to drive incremental progress across all of these metrics. 
First, I'll start with our top line growth. As Bob mentioned, our Q2 revenue was $2.3 billion, up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, a 200 basis point improvement from Q1. Second, our customer base continues to expand. We ended the quarter with 169 million active accounts, an increase of 11% and up from 165 million active accounts at the end of Q1. This growth is driven by the growing strength of our PayPal brands. 
PayPal was named as one of the top 100 brands throughout the world in a recent study. And in countries like Australia and the U.K., we rank as one of the top 10 most trusted brands. This trust helps to drive both acquisition and engagement. Also in a recent study, U.S. consumers, who plan to make their first mobile payment in a physical store in the next 6 months, were asked how they would choose to pay. Over 70% said they would trust PayPal over others with that transaction. And that brand preference is a powerful asset as we look towards the future. 
Third, we continue to deepen engagement with our customer base. We processed almost 1.1 billion transactions in the second quarter, up 27%. Even as we continue to grow customers at the top of our funnel, our monetization per account increased to $50 from $48 a year ago. And our customers used PayPal more often. Transactions per active account rose substantially from last year, now at 24 times [ph] a year up from 21 times a year in Q2 of last year. 
Let me spend just a bit more time on engagement as that metric is an important reflection of the value we bring to our ecosystem. That value starts with mobile leadership. For the second quarter, mobile transactions represented 30% of our total transactions, up 1 point from Q1 and grew 42%. We see ourselves as a mobile-first platform, and the majority of our development efforts continue to support our innovation across mobile payments and digital commerce. 
Being a trusted way to pay in today's most popular apps is helping to drive this increase in mobile engagement across not only online and in app, but importantly, we are seeing the very beginning of our in-store strategy play out. PayPal continues to make very strong inroads with leading mobile players. We are now live with 67% of the top 100 mobile merchants. Importantly, we are making initial strides, empowering the in-store mobile shopping experiences developed by our merchant partners. The Paydiant-powered SUBWAY app became the #2 downloaded food and beverage iOS app in the U.S. in June and is now available across 30,000-plus stores. And in collaboration with Tillster, we announced the national rollout of PayPal as a way to pay at 5,000 Burger King stores. 
As pleased as we are with our customers' engagement, we aspire to much more. We want a creative value proposition that inspires the average PayPal customer to use our app 2 to 3 times a week versus the 2 to 3 times per month they use PayPal today. And while that is a significant stretch goal for us, we already see this type of usage pattern with our Venmo users. For a generation that has never written a check, Venmo is the way to pay the rent, pay back a friend. And it is in the middle of how the millennial generation manage and move their money. As a result, in Q2, Venmo processed $1.6 billion of transaction volume, a 247% increase. And finally, we are on track to deliver our free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for 2015. 
As John mentioned earlier, the separation process has gone very well, and we've completed this significant effort in record time. The separation has given PayPal the opportunity to invest heavily in our infrastructure, setting up state-of-the-art networks and data centers to give PayPal the competitive edge. This was no small task, and our technology teams deserve a tremendous amount of recognition for this achievement. 
At the same time, we continue to push forward the transformation of our technology platform. We've made great progress and are approximately 2/3 of the way through this 3-year initiative. We have rearchitected much of our back-end infrastructure and consequently have sped up payment processing by up to 50% in the past year and reduced time to push code live to site by more than half. We are a fully agile software development shop, now one of the largest in the world. And being agile allows us to innovate more quickly, integrate more effectively and introduce new products or deploy new markets faster than ever. 
And a great example of our new flexibility and speed to market is One Touch. One Touch is the most significant improvement to our checkout experience in the past 5-plus years. One Touch lets people pay with just a single touch on any mobile phone, tablet and desktop across iOS, Android and Windows operating systems. It removes almost all friction from the checkout experience. One Touch was started on our Braintree platform. But as we have integrated the PayPal and Braintree software stacks, we were able to migrate its functionality within 6 months to our traditional PayPal payment flows in the U.S., U.K. and Canada with many other markets targeted for later this year. And while it will take time to properly deploy One Touch through our various payment flows, we expect it to be available for over 50% of our U.S. transactions by year end. 
Braintree continues to be the payments partner of choice for mobile disruptors and innovators. In Q2, we announced that Pinterest is now using Braintree's full stack processing platform. Notably, of the 5 major retailers that were part of Pinterest's Buyable Pins launched, 4 of them are using Braintree. These include Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Michaels and Gardener's Supply Company. And in line with our strategy of processing 100% share of checkout for our merchant partners, we also announced the addition of Android Pay, a new form of payment on our platform. 
Earlier this month, we took another important step to further enhance customer confidence and trust in the PayPal brand. On July 1, we extended our buyer protection program to cover not only physical products but also intangible goods and services, including digital goods, digital music, digital books, digital games, travel tickets and software downloads. As a result, PayPal now offers buyer protection on 99% plus of everything bought on our platform. We believe this is an industry-leading value proposition, and that was enabled by our world-class risk and data analytics teams. 
I want to reiterate what we said during our roadshow. PayPal is much more than a Web-based proprietary payment button. We are making significant progress in our quest to become the world's leading open payments platform for merchants and consumers. With the integration of Braintree and the addition of Paydiant to our technology platform, we can provide end-to-end solutions for merchants of all sizes, online, in app and in store. By being payment, device, point of sale and operating system-agnostic, we enable merchants to navigate the increasingly complicated and confusing landscape of payment options and changing consumer behaviors. 
Beyond the checkout experience with merchants, the accelerated adoption of mobile commerce and payments by consumers affords us the opportunity to transform the management and movement of money. For consumers, we make their transactions safer, easier and less expensive. Earlier this month, we announced the $890 million acquisition of Xoom, providing us an opportunity to accelerate our entrance into the international remittances industry, a $600 billion market ripe for disruption. By adding additional value-added services to our technology platform, we believe we can amplify our customer flywheel, creating a more powerful network effect. 
Xoom lets people send money to and pay bills for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast and cost-effective way using their mobile phone, tablet or computer. And during the 12 months ended March 31, 2015, Xoom reported that its 1.3 million active customers sent roughly $7 billion to people on 38 different markets, including the Philippines, India, Mexico, Brazil and China. Xoom's brand promise resonates with ours. They have a strong and engaged customer profile and a mobile and digital service orientation, providing real and transparent value globally. 
Technology should make managing and moving our money a right, not a privilege for just the affluent. And we believe our technology platform, global reach and trusted brand can move PayPal from being an occasional transaction to being an integral part of consumers' financial life. Adding remittance capabilities bolsters our efforts to achieve that goal. 
I'd like to close by saying that all of us at PayPal are thrilled to return to our original roots as an independent company. On July 20, our original stock ticker symbol, PYPL, will once again be publicly traded on NASDAQ for the second time in our 17-year history. I'd like to take a moment to thank each generation of leadership and especially all of our employees who brought us to this point. More specifically, I'd like to thank John, Bob, Mike, Alan, Beth and the eBay Inc. team for all they have done over the past 9 months in helping us formulate and separate 2 future Fortune 500 companies. I also want to thank Devin and the eBay team for their support of PayPal. I look forward to a long and productive relationship with them. 
It's been a remarkable journey, but we are just starting. Today, the potential to improve and transform how money works for people has never been greater. We are fully signed up to meet that challenge and excited by the tremendous opportunity ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Patrick to discuss our financial metrics in more detail."
27862,305324257,833849,"eBay Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan.

We feel good about our Q2 performance as PayPal continues to grow nearly double the rate of the industry. We generated $66 billion of payment volume, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, an acceleration of 3 points, driven by strong growth at Braintree and Venmo. This volume translated into $2.3 billion of revenue, up 16% on a reported basis and 19% on a FX-neutral basis. 
Our increased share gain is an indication that our strategy is working. We are winning with the leaders in digital and mobile commerce, both with large retailers who are expanding their footprint in mobile and online and with the next-generation apps that are transforming commerce. We have expanded our product solution from a proprietary, Web-based payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. And as a direct effect of that strategy, where larger customers and a broader service stack translate to a lower average take rate but higher volumes, our transaction margin is declining year-over-year. But in return, expanding volumes bring economies of scale for half of our operating expenses, creating capacity to invest and the opportunity to maintain or expand our operating margin. 
And indeed, in the second quarter, our segment margin expanded 160 basis points to 26.1% despite the 190 basis points degradation in transaction margin to 63.2%. And for the first 6 months of the year, our segment margin was up 60 basis points despite a decline of 140 basis points in our transaction margin. 
Before going to guidance, let me first provide some context on our earnings quarterly profile. First, the second quarter revenue and margin benefited from the premium received on the sale of our U.S.-held credit receivable portfolio in the second quarter. This sale frees up capital that we can redeploy into higher-yielding investments, but it comes with a cost. In the second half of the year, we will not receive revenue or operating income associated with the assets we sold. This negatively impacts revenue growth and operating margin by approximately 1 point in the second half of the year. 
Second, Q3 has historically represented our lowest quarterly segment margin as we invest ahead of the holiday selling season. And the holiday season has an increased level of activity from large merchants, thus lowering our Q4 transaction margin. And third, we will see the full impact of dissynergy cost and the operating agreement in the second half of the year. We expect a negative margin impact of approximately 5% in the second half of the year versus approximately 3% in the first half. 
Now to guidance. Going forward, we will only provide guidance on an annual basis, using our quarterly earnings call to report on our progress. For 2015, we are executing on our strategy and our Q2's strong performance only reinforces our confidence in our full year guidance. 
We continue to expect our FX-neutral revenue growth to be 15% to 18% for full year 2015 and our non-GAAP operating margin to be 20% to 21%, flat to up 1 point. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be 19% to 20% versus our prior range of 18% to 19%. This increase is due to a stronger U.S. performance. This translates into 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27, including approximately a $0.02 negative impact from the operating agreement in the second half of the year. Finally, we expect to generate free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion with a capital expenditures assumption of 8% to 10% of revenue, including approximately $100 million in onetime separation-related activities. 
Let me conclude with our balance sheet. Excluding the Xoom transaction, which we hope to close in Q4 '15 following receipt of regulatory approvals and other conditions, we stand up as an independent company with no debt and approximately $6.6 billion in cash and investments, $2.3 billion of which is in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we will prioritize our investment activity to focus on organic activity first, followed by M&A and lastly, buying back stock. We will continue to be an acquisitive company and expect to take a disciplined approach, looking for strong network effects and minimum short-term dilution. 
I will end my remarks by saying that we have developed a unique set of assets. We have created a leading, sustainable financial model, which allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale in a vibrant market, fueled by the digitization of money and the proliferation of connected devices. We are fully committed to our vision of being the world's leading open technology payments platform. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Devin and Scott at eBay."

Today, I'll cover 3 areas: first, I'll comment on our Q2 results; second, I'll provide an update on our strategy to drive eBay's business forward; and third, I'll share my perspective about the future of eBay. 6 months into 2015, I'm encouraged by the state of our business and the progress we're making against our strategy. The year is shaping up well, and I'm confident in our full year outlook. 
Turning to Q2. Overall, we performed well last quarter and our business was stable. eBay GMV grew at 6% on an FX-neutral basis, a 1 point acceleration from Q1, while revenue grew at 5% on an FX-neutral basis, a 2 point acceleration from Q1. Our active buyer base grew at 6% on a trailing 12-month basis and our trailing 3-month active buyer growth was largely stable. Our active buyers transacted $20 billion of GMV in the quarter with 41% of that closing on mobile. 
Our Q2 GMV, revenue and active buyer growth are clearly steps in the right direction. We've made solid progress, but we have a lot of work ahead of us to maximize eBay's significant potential. We're still feeling the effects of new buyer cohorts we did not acquire over the past year due to the SEO traffic issues, and we're still working to recover buyers that we lost after yet last year's cyber security incident. To be clear, our absolute priority is to improve our competitiveness and drive more stable, profitable growth over the long term. We have a clear vision and strategy for our business. So let me now remind you of our plan for eBay and talk about some of the efforts we have underway along with some perspective on early results. 
As I mentioned on the last call, we intend to focus on our target customer base and on a market segment where we believe we can win. eBay was built on enabling unique selection and unmatched spectrum of value to our buyers around the world, and we plan to focus our resources and innovation on this large segment of the market. First, we're building a more robust commerce platform. Second, we're enhancing with our engagement with the core buyer and seller segments, who create a vibrant marketplace. And third, we're creating exceptional product and brand experiences. 
Let me touch on our efforts in each of these areas in a bit more detail. First, managing a robust commerce platform is key to creating sustainable performance. Our primary effort in this area is focused around leveraging structured data to drive discoverability, both on and off our marketplace as well as improving the user experience. This is a long-term effort, and our rollout is initially focused on categories where we have a predominance of manufactured goods. 
On June 29, we started to require that our sellers provide product identifiers, where relevant, when listing an item. This is enabling us to create innovative, new browse and product pages, which were not previously possible in our marketplace. So far, we've launched hundreds of thousands of new browse pages into the SEO ecosystem, and early results show that these pages convert equal to or better than the pages that they're replacing. We've launched thousands of new product pages across 22 categories through last week. These pages are the seeds of our ability to showcase our offering across new, refurbished and used items and provide the consumers the ability to make value-based choices that are truly unique to eBay. While this is an encouraging start, these efforts are in the early stages, and we'll continue to share more in our progress along the way. 
We also continue to experiment and grow new sources to diversify our traffic for consistent long-term growth. While still small relative to our more established channels, traffic from social channels is growing over 100% year-on-year in the U.S. On Facebook, we're early adopters of dynamic product ads, which enable retargeting on mobile. And on Pinterest, eBay's inspirational shopping content is driving very high engagement and click-through rates. And this success has positioned us as a top advertiser on the platform. We're also focused on growing our newer channels, including Instagram and Tumblr, and we've recently launched efforts on Snapchat and Periscope. We view social media and messaging platforms as a great way to reach our customers in the places they love while allowing us to diversify our sources of traffic and user acquisition for consistent, long-term growth. 
The second pillar of our strategy is to create a vibrant marketplace. For eBay consumers who love to shop, we'll continue to enhance our platform to bring them amazing value and unique selection. We source inventory on our site from small- and medium-sized sellers, who range from well-known brands to medium-sized retailers to smaller entrepreneurs. These sellers represent 70% of global retail, and they're growing faster than the top 250 retailers. They bring to us a mix of inventory from unique items to discounted and season inventory to liquidation goods. We're on pace to sign a record number of managed sellers this year. Some key brands and sellers we've added include ASICS, PUMA, GoPro, Sony and Bosch Power Tools. 
We're also driving a vibrant marketplace by reinventing our consumer selling approach. In Q2, we expanded our intermediated selling service, eBay Valet, into the fashion category, and we now accept items for hundreds of designer fashion brands. While it's still early, the value proposition of eBay Valet is resonating with sellers and driving strong repeat engagement. And we continue to see strong growth in our Classifieds business, which is capturing the local C2C opportunity. 
On the seller experience front, we recently launched our promoted listings product, enabling eBay sellers to increase item visibility and drive buyer traffic to items they want to showcase, such as new listings or seasonal must-haves. While still an invite-only program, initial results show click-through rates on par with our organic search experience, and we're seeing strong seller demand to scale the program. 
Finally, our third pillar, exceptional product and brand experiences. In Q2, we rolled out improvements to our iPhone, iPad and Android experiences, and we launched our Apple Watch app, which enables users to interact with us quickly and easily while on the go. We've also rolled out significant improvements to search quality and relevance to enable buyers to more effectively find what they're looking for.  
Looking towards the second half, we'll be launching a new experience across mobile channels that we're really excited about. This experience is built upon learnings from our iPad app, a more engaging, discovery-based experience for buyers that also builds on our simplified mobile selling experience. This release will unify the mobile experience across our platforms, and it will enable a consistent user experience and faster product generation. 
Executing against our strategy also means being vigilant about our portfolio and ensuring that our investments are aligned with our strategic direction. As Bob mentioned earlier, we've just entered into an agreement to sell eBay Enterprise, and in June, we divested our stake in Craigslist. Looking forward, we're investing organically to build out our eBay seller tools and data to acquire the small and medium-sized business, and we're beginning to scale Close5, our rapidly growing U.S. Classifieds mobile app. You can expect us to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation going forward. 
In summary, Q2 is a good quarter. We delivered against our strategy, and we're on track to deliver for the full year. You can count on us to continue to focus where we need to win and to make the hard decisions along the way that will enable us to more clearly define our space as a leader. 
I also want to congratulate Dan and the entire PayPal team, and we look forward to a close relationship working together in the future. As eBay celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, we're making rapid changes to position this business for the future. My goal and that of the entire leadership team is for eBay to be the best global marketplace and a great enduring Internet business. eBay was founded with the purpose-driven ethos, which has fueled our company and our brand. As we write the next chapter for this incredible business, we will continue to focus on our purpose: to empower people and create opportunity through connected commerce. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Scott, who'll go into more details around our financial performance."
27862,305324257,833849,"eBay Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Devin.

Overall, in Q2, we continued to stabilize many of our underlying operating metrics while delivering positive signs of acceleration in GMV and revenue growth. 
We remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives amidst the separation-related activities, and we are confident in our full year outlook. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation where we'll begin on Slide 16. Net revenues were $2.1 billion with revenue growth accelerating 2 points to 5% on an FX-neutral basis compared to Q1. Transaction revenue grew 5% on an FX-neutral basis, also accelerating 2 points versus Q1. The increase in transaction revenue growth was largely driven by the acceleration in GMV growth. Marketing Services revenue grew 7% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating 2 points over the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by our advertising format. In addition, we continue to deliver strong results in our Classifieds format, which is expanding its geographic footprint in Latin America and the U.S. Finally, we continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, which negatively impacted total revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 8 points. 
On Slide 17, some highlights on our operating metrics. As Devin explained earlier, we grew trailing 12-month active buyers by 6%, down 2 points compared to Q1. We expected this decline as we continue to deal with the implications of fewer new buyers on eBay due to SEO challenges and the friction introduced by resetting passwords after the cybersecurity incident. We grew GMV 6% on an FX-neutral basis, 1 point faster than Q1. In the U.S., GMV grew 2%, consistent with Q1. It's worth noting that U.S. GMB, a measure of consumer buying, grew 6% as U.S. buyers took advantage of the global selection and value available on eBay. We grew our International business 8% on an FX-neutral basis, 1 point faster than the prior quarter. That acceleration was driven by the strength in Europe, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. Segment margin is down 50 basis points from last year, as the savings from our Q1 restructuring were more than offset by negative currency translation, plus the investment in our key initiatives. Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses were 44% of revenue in the quarter, down 1.4 points year-over-year. In Q2, we benefited from the restructuring at the beginning of the year, which delivered savings across all areas of the business. Additionally, we lapped expenses incurred in Q2 2014 in both marketing and transaction losses related to the security -- the cybersecurity incident. 
As highlighted in our June investor presentation, over the long term, we expect sales and marketing and product development cost to remain relatively flat versus 2015 as a percentage of revenue. We also expect to drive leverage in G&A, and reinvest in our key strategic initiatives, which include building a more robust commerce platform, creating a more vibrant marketplace, and developing exceptional product and brand experiences. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss our exposure to it and approach to hedging. Our revenue continues to be heavily exposed to currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, we took action to utilize additional hedging strategies to economically protect full year net income. Some of those strategies are not eligible for hedge accounting, and thus, we must mark-to-market the hedging instruments through earnings, potentially creating volatility in our quarterly results going forward. 
Now let me turn to guidance on Slide 18. As a reminder, in our June investor presentation, we've provided 2015 full year guidance of 0 to 5% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis, fully allocated operating margin of 32% to 34%, and free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. 
Based on our half -- first half performance, we are more confident in our full year outlook. As a result, we are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to 3%, projecting 2015 neutral -- FX-neutral growth between 3% to 5%. Fully allocated operating margin and free cash flow remain in line with our previous guidance. Additionally, we are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $1.72 to $1.77 per share. For the third quarter, we are projecting revenue growth of 3% to 5% as well on an FX-neutral basis and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. 
I'd like to take a moment to provide some perspective on our approach to capital allocation. While our focus is first and foremost on revitalizing our business, our philosophy is that the capital return and disciplined M&A will be important to shareholder value as well. We can -- we will continue to be good stewards of capital and ensure we use a strategic and disciplined approach in all of our activities. Our policy has several key tenets, including focusing on long-term value creation, while making sure we have the resources to execute our strategy; driving growth while balancing profitability; supplementing organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments while maximizing the capital deployed in those assets; and managing the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital, while offsetting both dilution and reducing share count via opportunistic share repurchases at attractive prices. We believe that by adhering to these principles, we will drive the most value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Turning to our balance sheet and the implementation of this policy. We ended Q2 with $8.5 billion in cash, $7.6 billion in debt, and thus, approximately $1 billion of net cash. In the second half of the year, we expect to generate strong cash flows, leveraging our capital efficient business model and disciplined approach to capital allocation. This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion for share repurchase, which when coupled with our existing $2 billion authorization, brings our total capacity to repurchase shares to $3 billion. We continue to be disciplined in how we will assess our assets, selling our equity stake in Craigslist, while settling all outstanding litigation with them, and our board authorized the sale of eBay Enterprise, and we've announced the sale this morning. Finally, we expect the rating agencies to conclude their ratings review process soon, providing clarity on eBay credits rating. The rating will be an investment-grade profile at the high end of the BBB range, which we believe is important for our existing creditors and customers. 
In summary, in the first half of 2015, we continue to stabilize many of our underlying metrics, while delivering positive signs of acceleration in GMV and revenue growth. We remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives, and we are confident in our full year outlook. And while the road ahead will not be an easy one, we are incredibly excited about our future opportunities and our ability to win.  And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

Do you feel like the product is where you'd like it to be to push the pedal down more on the marketing front this year? And what sort of impact are you expecting that to have in the back half of the year relative to your guidance?

First, on levels of marketing spend, in line with what we normally do on holiday, we will ramp up our holiday spend. It's likely that depending on the underlying metrics that we see, we may do that a little bit more aggressively this season, but let's keep in mind that we are a very disciplined marketer. We don't throw money against the wall and hope things stick. We measure almost every $0.01 that we spend, and we try to get a return on that. It doesn't have to be immediate, but we understand the CLV of user acquisition, and we're disciplined about the way we spend. So as you've heard me say before, it's not hard to grow an e-commerce company. It is hard to grow value in an e-commerce company, and we're solving the grow value. So we will spend into the holiday, but we won't spend to acquire business or users at any cost because plenty are doing that, but not plenty are creating value. On diversification of marketing, it is very important to me that we end up in a couple of years with multiple channels that are competing for our incremental investment dollar. I'll remind you that the majority of eBay's traffic comes directly to us either to our apps or to our site. That's the premium of our brand showing up. But not an insignificant minority comes through channels, and it's very important that we have more of those channels that are competing for our dollar. And as you heard in my remarks, we're working very closely with the social and the messaging platforms to try to scale our investment to helpfully have positive ROI, acquire new users and new traffic. I'd say it's early. I'm encouraged by what I see. We're optimistic about the future, but it is early, and we are a very large digital marketer, one of the largest on the web, and the total amount that we've been able to spend into positive results on these platforms is still very small compared to our more established channels. So it'll take time, but we're on the path. Thanks for the question."

So as I mentioned, we think One Touch is one of the most significant products that we've rolled out, functionality we've rolled out in the last 5 years, the checkout experience. It literally does take out all friction out of the commerce experience, where you can check out with a single touch, and so we're very excited about it. What we're doing with One Touch is we've been able to seamlessly bring that over from the Braintree platform into our PayPal flows, and so as we bring it into our PayPal flow, a consumer doesn't need to do anything differently except opt in. That's what they have to do for that on each device in which they want to integrate One Touch. So for them, it's a seamless type of integration. On the merchant side, the same thing. We're able to do this in a seamless fashion. The merchant doesn't have to upgrade. It automatically happens for the merchant as we take that One Touch capability into that payment -- PayPal payment flow, and so we're just going about this in a disciplined fashion. Rolling it out, we started this a little over a month ago to 1% of our traffic. We've ramped that up to 5% of our traffic, then we started expanding it into other countries. We'll start expanding it throughout the world, but we're just doing it in a very disciplined fashion to make sure there are no issues with it. If we see it going better than we expect, we can accelerate that, but we need to make sure that we take that One Touch experience and in each of the different PayPal flows, and we have a couple of different flows there that it works as exceptionally as it is right now in helping to increase conversion rates."

First of all, we are very focused on, call it, 2 major constituencies. We've got merchants on one side, consumers on the other. Obviously, developers are a third constituency for us, but let's focus on merchants and consumers right now. So this first thing that we needed to do, and we have spent a lot of time, and I give a tremendous amount of credit to the team at PayPal and the former leadership teams at PayPal in terms of their foresight in the technological upgrades that we've done on our platform. The technology upgrades we've done allow us to innovate. They allow us to deploy changes and innovations in times that we're unheard of even a year or so ago. So we have the ability to constantly do A/B testing on our website on all the different programs that we have right now that's difficult for us several years ago. As a result of that, our acquisition and our acquisition flow on that is improving dramatically as is our retention efforts. We are ramping up our life cycle management efforts across the world because we now have realtime data and information that we can use. We know what the various variables are that lead to indication and churn or the indication of a very profitable customer, and we're accelerating on all of those, and the technology upgrades we did on the platform is helping us tremendously on that. On the consumer side, we obviously want to be more a part of their financial lives. We want to move from being a occasional use, twice a month, to them using us 2 to 3x a month. And we think that's obviously a stretched goal through all of our active base, but we already have an example of that in Venmo. Venmo users use the service 2 to 4x a week. It's a part of how they manage and move their money, and we want to become more of a part of how consumers manage and move their money. The acquisition of Xoom is a good example of that. It takes capabilities that another company has built up. You apply that to the scale that we have in our base and our global reach, and we think taking those capabilities, combining them with the assets that we have at PayPal, gives us a tremendously powerful flywheel for both acquisition and engagement of our consumers, and we're very excited about that combination. And so as we look into the future, and we look at the potential of consolidation and the acquisitions going forward, as Patrick mentioned, we'll take a very disciplined approach to that. Now that our platform is significantly upgraded, we can do a lot more things organically, and we will take advantage of that, and we have a very disciplined product road map in place. That's where One Touch came from. That's where our expanded buyer protection came from. These were all organic efforts. But if we see a capability or an ability to enter into a market at scale through an acquisition that helps our flywheel, both in acquisition and engagement, we'll look at that carefully."

We started the year, and we described some of the issues that we were working through, and we discussed the fact that some of the buyer cohorts that we had lost last year",492,"Colin, to your question on growth, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. We started the year, and we described some of the issues that we were working through, and we discussed the fact that some of the buyer cohorts that we had lost last year would take some time to reacquire, and because of that, it wasn't as simple as passing a calendar date and lapping it. There were some systematic issues on reacquiring buyers that we were working our way through. We were confident we would do it, but we also explained that it would take time, and in that context, we gave guidance for 2015, which was 0 to 5% revenue growth. As we got a bit further in the first half, we clarified our strategy and communicated that on our investor presentation and through our roadshow, and what we said there is we feel great about our future, but this will be a transformative moment for eBay, where we've got a lot of hard work to do, and we're going to make some choices, which in and amongst themselves, are the right decisions for eBay, but they'll create some short-term growth issues. And in that context, we extended the guidance through 2016. Now with the first half over, what I'd say is things are going pretty well, and we feel pretty good about that, and that's given us the ability [indiscernible] the guidance up, but I'd just refer you back to everything we said in the first half. We're doing what we said we do. We're executing the strategy. We're working through the issues. All of that remains exactly as I said in the first quarter on the roadshow and through the investor presentation. So I would just say we're feeling good about where we are. We're on the right path, but I'd caution against any assumption that says, ""Well, we just popped out of this, and now growth rates are going back to exactly where they were. There are a lot more factors involved. We feel great about where we are and the path we're on, and like I said, I think we laid down a bunch of markers, and what's important to me is we're doing exactly what we said, and we're trickling towards the upper end of that trajectory, and we'll keep updating you as we go. On the small and medium-sized business issue, I'd just say the overwhelming majority of what eBay sells comes from small and medium-sized businesses, overwhelming majority. A large seller on eBay is a couple of million dollars, and that's the incredible breadth and the fragmentation that is eBay. The 25 million sellers are the incredible spectrum of small sellers and entrepreneurs and even individuals, and in many ways, that's our strength. So the segment we're leaning into really is where we have #1 market share and where we're the best and where we believe we can win."

Thanks for your question. Very consistently over the last -- you look back over time, we've grown our subscribers through the ups and downs of eBay by anywhere between 3 million and 5 million a quarter that have come in quarter-after-quarter, and this was no exception again this quarter. We grew our actives from 165 million to 169 million. And so as we work closely with eBay, and we look at the acquisition that comes off of that, we've obviously expanded our acquisition efforts tremendously off of eBay. We have a tremendous amount of organic traffic that comes to our website that we convert. We have merchants now, 10 million-plus merchants across the world, that also generate consumer acquisition. And as our value proposition strengthens, as our brand strengthens, as our scale strengthens, there's a network effect that just naturally goes on. And as our life cycle efforts, which are still relatively nascent, I would say, in general, expand, I think we can improve our ability to both attract customers to PayPal, and importantly, retain and engage them, make them active customers. So I feel very good about that, and I think our history proves that point. In terms of TPV growth, again, if you look at our TPV results over the last several quarters, you can see very strong and accelerating TPV growth, and that is across the board. Not only is our MS growing this quarter, but very strong growth out of Braintree, very strong growth out of Venmo, very strong growth in credit on the revenue side. So we have a very balanced portfolio across the world and across our product mix. We're seeing good strength driving that TPV and revenue."

On the user growth, as we said, and as you've seen, these are sort of long-cycle movements. They don't immediately move up and down. They sort of are longer cycle sine wave-type movements, and we've been moving down since last year, but I think what was very important in this announcement, in this earnings, was the fact that we've seen for the first time really since May of '14 quarter-on-quarter stability in user acquisition. So that doesn't mean we snap right back, but I feel like there is a reasonable chance that we're at the bottom of that sine wave now, and can now start working our way back up. So that to me is an encouraging sign. And just vis-à-vis the opportunity on user growth, I mean, yes. One of the things I'm proudest of stuff over the last 4 years is we added roughly 16 million active accounts, which is a sign of relevance, to say the least. So I think the ability to continue to acquire users and drive eBay's relevance across consumers and sellers is absolutely part of what we're talking about in our strategy. On the pages, it's really early, and like I said, this is going to be a long-term effort. I think we put pages up that I think are very interesting. They're interesting, not just to reacquire SEO traffic, but they're interesting for what they mean for the shopping experience on eBay. This is not about another commodity page to sell another commodity item. This about sharpening the focus on what is truly, uniquely different about our business, and that's a spectrum of choices and value, which can only be done when we understand product families. So I am encouraged by it, but we have 800 million items for sale, and this is going to take quite a long time, but the benefits will come as we work them.

A couple of points maybe around the capital structure, and first, we've got a terrific business model that its 0 to 5% revenue growth over the next couple of years generates more than a couple of billion dollars worth of free cash flow annually. And the tenets of the capital structure policy, if you will, that I laid out earlier around focusing on the long-term value creation, balancing our growth and profitability and investing and doing disciplined M&A and managing our portfolio at a disciplined way, while optimizing the financial flexibility and the access to debt and the cost of capital, we will continue to, I think, put down clear, demonstrated results around each of those, while we continue to offset dilution and reduce the share count via opportunistic share repurchases. Maybe a couple of points on each of these. The repurchases, we expanded the authorization by $1 billion to $3 billion this morning. With regards to your question specifically around the debt, we're still in the final stages with the bond rating agencies about finalizing their ratings. We believe that will be a strong investment-grade rating, and that would be a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, somewhere between 2.5 to 3, which would provide us sufficient financial flexibility to take on additional debt if we chose. And over the course of the following months and years, we'll continue to execute and be disciplined around each of those tenets."

That's because we provide an extremely strong proposition to the merchant. We bring, first of all, now almost 170 million users onto the platform. Those are typically more active users than the normal Internet user. They spend more. They are more active, and so we bring a very engaged base to the merchant. It's simple and easy to integrate with us. We've made that a very low-touch experience now. We're increasingly doing in context, so that when a consumer purchases on a merchant website, they don't need to bounce back to something else. They can do it in context on the merchant's website. So our value proposition is improving quite substantially. One Touch is another substantial improvement on that, and it's really a matter of going in and getting the right channels and getting the right touch points to those merchants. We have a channel that goes after large merchants. We're making very good progress on that. We -- obviously, there are some merchants that there was an inherent conflict when we were a part of eBay. This now opens our opportunity to look at every single merchant out there as a truly independent third-party payments platform on that. We're also beginning to win with some players like Bigcommerce, whether you're using our platform. That really goes into the small market with partnerships, and we're looking at more and more of that and making some very good progress on that. So I'm very encouraged by kind of the efforts in terms of our merchant-acquiring business. It's growing substantially. Our value proposition is stronger than ever. And if you look at our strategy, the whole idea behind merchant acquiring is how do we become a great partner for merchants? How do we do more and more for them in this increasingly complicated world? How do we become 100% share of checkout, so they can easily integrate any form of payment that they want to put in there, whether it's Bitcoin or Android Pay or any of the credit card companies, we can integrate that for them. We can integrate into their loyalty. We can integrate into their rewards. We can integrate into offers, and so we really want to be a -- fully a partner with a completely agnostic platform that allows the merchant to interact with their consumers on a very personal level. And so we're putting in a lot of places, a lot of pieces to that puzzle, and feel really good about the initials success we've seen on that."

Our Q2 results marked the final consolidated earnings call for eBay Inc. On Monday, July 20, PayPal and eBay will begin trading as separate, independent public companies. Our call will run a little longer today. I'll be brief, and Bob will provide a quick summary of the overall eBay Inc. financial results, and then we'll turn it over to Dan and Devin, who will provide full details on the quarter and outlook for each business. 
Suffice it to say, we are very pleased with our overall Q2 performance. FX-neutral revenue from continuing operations was up 12% and non-GAAP EPS was up 9%. PayPal and eBay both delivered strong Q2 results and have strong momentum. Dan, Devin and their respective teams are executing well and looking to create the next great chapter for PayPal and eBay. 
Since announcing the decision to separate last September, our teams have done a remarkable job. We said we would move with speed and clarity. And we have. We said we would create operating agreements that preserve synergies while creating strategic flexibility for each business. We have. We said we would build 2 world-class management teams and Boards of Directors. We have. And we said we would set each business up for long-term success. And I believe we have done just that. Each business is well capitalized with strong balance sheets, and Dan and Devin each have clear, focused strategies to drive PayPal and eBay forward. 
In closing, I joined this company 10 years ago because I was inspired by the purpose and values of our founder, Pierre Omidyar. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Serving our customers and bringing our purpose to life has been a privilege. I am proud of what we've accomplished, building 2 global leaders in commerce and payments. Each step of the way, we've been committed to doing what's best for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. And this moment is no different. Launching PayPal and eBay as independent companies is clearly the best path for each business and the right approach for delivering sustainable value to shareholders. 
Last, I'm proud that we're executing a smooth succession process, and I am thrilled for Dan and Devin. They are the right leaders who will launch the next chapters for PayPal and eBay, and I'm confident that under their leadership and that of their respective teams, PayPal and eBay have great futures ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide a summary of our overall Q2 results."

I'll provide a brief update on the quarter results at the Inc. level before handing the call over to PayPal and eBay teams for more detail. During the discussion, we will reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Before I start, I wanted to highlight that the eBay's board has authorized the decision to sell eBay Enterprise. And as a result, those results will be included in discontinued operations. And while it is not in our press release, about 3 minutes ago, we concluded the sale of eBay Enterprise for approximately $925 million. I'll touch on that a bit later. 
Q2 was a great quarter, demonstrating continued momentum for both businesses. Revenue from continuing operations was $4.4 billion, up 12% on an FX-neutral basis, a 2 point acceleration from the first quarter. PayPal revenue was $2.3 billion, up 19%, and eBay revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 9% on continuing operations. 
We generated $688 million of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the first half of the year. In the quarter, we completed the sale of the PayPal loan portfolio, increasing U.S. cash balance by roughly $700 million, and we exited our stake in Craigslist. As of June 30, PayPal and eBay are capitalized with $6.6 billion and $8.5 billion cash, respectively. 
In Q2, on a continuing operating basis, we generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 12%, with strength across both businesses. Currency negatively impacted our growth by approximately 5 points. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 9% on a continuing operations basis. The EPS improvement was driven by accelerating top line growth, a streamlined cost structure and a lower share count. Operating margins were up 110 basis points on a continuing operations basis while we continued to invest in our key strategic priorities. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, we have improved our cash balance by $0.5 billion to $15.1 billion. We generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We bought back $1 billion in stock, and we executed on strategic initiatives, closing 2 acquisitions, selling Craigslist and a portion of our credit receivable portfolio. Additionally, we've moved $3.8 billion of cash from eBay to PayPal. Upon separation, both businesses will have the financial flexibility to pursue their respective capital allocation priorities. 
As I mentioned earlier, eBay's board has authorized management to sell eBay Enterprise. Just minutes ago, we announced that we reached a definitive agreement to sell the business for $925 million. The discontinued ops will result in an impairment charge of $786 million, and we expect the deal to close the transaction in the second half of this year. 
I want to touch on 3 quick items before handing the call over to Dan and Devin. First, on segment margins. As a reminder, Patrick and Scott will refer to segment margins in discussing their second quarter results. These exclude corporate costs, dissynergies and standup-related costs. They also exclude incremental revenue that results from previously eliminated intercompany revenues. In the second quarter, these costs for PayPal represented approximately 3 to 4 points and approximately 4 to 5 points for eBay. Second, GAAP to non-GAAP results are wider than usual. In addition to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, the quarter includes the impact from selling our investment in Craigslist, the onetime costs associated with the separation and the impairment charge associated with the sale of eBay Enterprise. 
And lastly, let me describe 4 important filings that will take place in the next 6 weeks. We will file an eBay Inc. 8-K that will provide a pro forma view of eBay after giving effect to the distribution of PayPal. eBay Inc. will file its 10-Q, including segment results for only the eBay and PayPal businesses. And PayPal will file a 10-Q in the second quarter, including stand-alone revenue and operating margins. And lastly, in mid-August, eBay will file an 8-K to provide investors with meaningful, historical financial information, including stand-alone revenue and operating margins. 
In closing, I want to say thank you. It's been a privilege working with you over the years. I feel great about what we've accomplished over the last 10 years, but I feel even better about the teams that we are passing the baton to. So with that, let me now turn the call over to the new leadership teams at eBay and PayPal to discuss their segment-specific results for the quarter."
27862,305324257,833970,"eBay Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm glad that Patrick and I had the opportunity to meet so many of you in person during our recent roadshow. It almost goes without saying that this is an exciting time for PayPal. I'm hap",1875,"Thank you, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm glad that Patrick and I had the opportunity to meet so many of you in person during our recent roadshow. It almost goes without saying that this is an exciting time for PayPal. I'm happy to report as we enter this next chapter in our history that we had another strong quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to help shape the transformation of digital and mobile payments around much of the world. 
With that, let me highlight some of our results and initiatives for the quarter. Payment volume was $66 billion, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating from Q1 where our payment volume was already up a robust 25%. Importantly, PayPal continued to gain share globally, growing at roughly double the pace of e-commerce. More specifically, our Merchant Services payment volume increased by a strong 36% as we continue to win with the larger, leading commerce players, both traditional retailers and next-generation platforms. This metric also accelerated 3 points from Q1. 
On our last earnings call, I outlined the 4 metrics that best measure the growth and health of our business. As a reminder, they are top line revenue growth, the scale of our customer base, the engagement of that base as shown by transactions per active account and free cash flow. We continue to drive incremental progress across all of these metrics. 
First, I'll start with our top line growth. As Bob mentioned, our Q2 revenue was $2.3 billion, up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, a 200 basis point improvement from Q1. Second, our customer base continues to expand. We ended the quarter with 169 million active accounts, an increase of 11% and up from 165 million active accounts at the end of Q1. This growth is driven by the growing strength of our PayPal brands. 
PayPal was named as one of the top 100 brands throughout the world in a recent study. And in countries like Australia and the U.K., we rank as one of the top 10 most trusted brands. This trust helps to drive both acquisition and engagement. Also in a recent study, U.S. consumers, who plan to make their first mobile payment in a physical store in the next 6 months, were asked how they would choose to pay. Over 70% said they would trust PayPal over others with that transaction. And that brand preference is a powerful asset as we look towards the future. 
Third, we continue to deepen engagement with our customer base. We processed almost 1.1 billion transactions in the second quarter, up 27%. Even as we continue to grow customers at the top of our funnel, our monetization per account increased to $50 from $48 a year ago. And our customers used PayPal more often. Transactions per active account rose substantially from last year, now at 24 times [ph] a year up from 21 times a year in Q2 of last year. 
Let me spend just a bit more time on engagement as that metric is an important reflection of the value we bring to our ecosystem. That value starts with mobile leadership. For the second quarter, mobile transactions represented 30% of our total transactions, up 1 point from Q1 and grew 42%. We see ourselves as a mobile-first platform, and the majority of our development efforts continue to support our innovation across mobile payments and digital commerce. 
Being a trusted way to pay in today's most popular apps is helping to drive this increase in mobile engagement across not only online and in app, but importantly, we are seeing the very beginning of our in-store strategy play out. PayPal continues to make very strong inroads with leading mobile players. We are now live with 67% of the top 100 mobile merchants. Importantly, we are making initial strides, empowering the in-store mobile shopping experiences developed by our merchant partners. The Paydiant-powered SUBWAY app became the #2 downloaded food and beverage iOS app in the U.S. in June and is now available across 30,000-plus stores. And in collaboration with Tillster, we announced the national rollout of PayPal as a way to pay at 5,000 Burger King stores. 
As pleased as we are with our customers' engagement, we aspire to much more. We want to create a value proposition that inspires the average PayPal customer to use our app 2 to 3 times a week versus the 2 to 3 times per month they use PayPal today. And while that is a significant stretch goal for us, we already see this type of usage pattern with our Venmo users. For a generation that has never written a check, Venmo is the way to pay the rent, pay back a friend. And it is in the middle of how the millennial generation manage and moves their money. As a result, in Q2, Venmo processed $1.6 billion of transaction volume, a 247% increase. And finally, we are on track to deliver our free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for 2015. 
As John mentioned earlier, the separation process has gone very well, and we've completed this significant effort in record time. The separation has given PayPal the opportunity to invest heavily in our infrastructure, setting up state-of-the-art networks and data centers to give PayPal a competitive edge. This was no small task, and our technology teams deserve a tremendous amount of recognition for this achievement. 
At the same time, we continue to push forward the transformation of our technology platform. We've made great progress and are approximately 2/3 of the way through this 3-year initiative. We have rearchitected much of our back-end infrastructure and consequently have sped up payment processing by up to 50% in the past year and reduced time to push code live to site by more than half. We are a fully agile software development shop, now one of the largest in the world. And being agile allows us to innovate more quickly, integrate more effectively and introduce new products or deploy new markets faster than ever. 
And a great example of our new flexibility and speed to market is One Touch. One Touch is the most significant improvement to our checkout experience in the past 5-plus years. One Touch lets people pay with just a single touch on any mobile phone, tablet and desktop across iOS, Android and Windows operating systems. It removes almost all friction from the checkout experience. One Touch was started on our Braintree platform. But as we have integrated the PayPal and Braintree software stacks, we were able to migrate its functionality within 6 months to our traditional PayPal payment flows in the U.S., U.K. and Canada with many other markets targeted for later this year. And while it will take time to properly deploy One Touch through our various payment flows, we expect it to be available for over 50% of our U.S. transactions by year end. 
Braintree continues to be the payments partner of choice for mobile disruptors and innovators. In Q2, we announced that Pinterest is now using Braintree's full-stack processing platform. Notably, of the 5 major retailers that were part of Pinterest's Buyable Pins launch, 4 of them are using Braintree. These include Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Michaels and Gardener's Supply Company. And in line with our strategy of processing 100% share of checkout for our merchant partners, we also announced the addition of Android Pay, a new form of payment on our platform. 
Earlier this month, we took another important step to further enhance customer confidence and trust in the PayPal brand. On July 1, we extended our buyer protection program to cover not only physical products but also intangible goods and services, including digital goods, digital music, digital books, digital games, travel tickets and software downloads. As a result, PayPal now offers buyer protection on 99% plus of everything bought on our platform. We believe this is an industry-leading value proposition, and that was enabled by our world-class risk and data analytics teams. 
I want to reiterate what we said during our roadshow. PayPal is much more than a Web-based proprietary payment button. We are making significant progress in our quest to become the world's leading open payments platform for merchants and consumers. With the integration of Braintree and the addition of Paydiant to our technology platform, we can provide end-to-end solutions for merchants of all sizes, online, in app and in store. By being payment, device, point of sale and operating system-agnostic, we enable merchants to navigate the increasingly complicated and confusing landscape of payment options and changing consumer behaviors. 
Beyond the checkout experience with merchants, the accelerated adoption of mobile commerce and payments by consumers affords us the opportunity to transform the management and movement of money. For consumers, we make their transactions safer, easier and less expensive. Earlier this month, we announced the $890 million acquisition of Xoom, providing us an opportunity to accelerate our entrance into the international remittances industry, a $600 billion market ripe for disruption. By adding additional value-added services to our technology platform, we believe we can amplify our customer flywheel, creating a more powerful network effect. 
Xoom lets people send money to and pay bills for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast and cost-effective way using their mobile phone, tablet or computer. And during the 12 months ended March 31, 2015, Xoom reported that its 1.3 million active customers sent roughly $7 billion to people in 38 different markets, including the Philippines, India, Mexico, Brazil and China. Xoom's brand promise resonates with ours. They have a strong and engaged customer profile and a mobile and digital service orientation, providing real and transparent value globally. 
Technology should make managing and moving our money a right, not a privilege for just the affluent. And we believe our technology platform, global reach and trusted brand can move PayPal from being an occasional transaction to being an integral part of a consumers' financial life. Adding remittance capabilities bolsters our efforts to achieve that goal. 
I'd like to close by saying that all of us at PayPal are thrilled to return to our original roots as an independent company. On July 20, our original stock ticker symbol, PYPL, will once again be publicly traded on NASDAQ for the second time in our 17-year history. I'd like to take a moment to thank each generation of leadership and especially all of our employees who brought us to this point. More specifically, I'd like to thank John, Bob, Mike, Alan, Beth and the eBay Inc. team for all they have done over the past 9 months in helping us formulate and separate 2 future Fortune 500 companies. I also want to thank Devin and the eBay team for their support of PayPal. I look forward to a long and productive relationship with them. 
It's been a remarkable journey, but we are just starting. Today, the potential to improve and transform how money works for people has never been greater. We are fully signed up to meet that challenge and excited by the tremendous opportunity ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Patrick to discuss our financial metrics in more detail."

We generated $66 billion of payment volume, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, an acceleration of 3 points, driven by strong growth at Br",783,"Thank you, Dan. We feel good about our Q2 performance as PayPal continues to grow nearly double the rate of the industry. We generated $66 billion of payment volume, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, an acceleration of 3 points, driven by strong growth at Braintree and Venmo. This volume translated into $2.3 billion of revenue, up 16% on a reported basis and 19% on a FX-neutral basis. 
Our increased share gain is an indication that our strategy is working. We are winning with the leaders in digital and mobile commerce, both with large retailers who are expanding their footprint in mobile and online and with the next-generation apps that are transforming commerce. We have expanded our product solution from a proprietary, Web-based payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. And as a direct effect of that strategy, where larger customers and a broader service stack translate to a lower average take rate but higher volumes, our transaction margin is declining year-over-year. But in return, expanding volumes bring economies of scale for half of our operating expenses, creating capacity to invest and the opportunity to maintain or expand our operating margin. 
And indeed, in the second quarter, our segment margin expanded 160 basis points to 26.1% despite 190 basis points degradation in transaction margin to 63.2%. And for the first 6 months of the year, our segment margin was up 60 basis points despite a decline of 140 basis points in our transaction margin. 
Before going to guidance, let me first provide some context on our earnings quarterly profile. First, the second quarter revenue and margin benefited from the premium received on the sale of our U.S.-held credit receivable portfolio in the second quarter. This sale frees up capital that we can redeploy into higher-yielding investments, but it comes with a cost. In the second half of the year, we will not receive revenue or operating income associated with the assets we sold. This negatively impacts revenue growth and operating margin by approximately 1 point in the second half of the year. 
Second, Q3 has historically represented our lowest quarterly segment margin as we invest ahead of the holiday selling season. And the holiday season has an increased level of activity from large merchants, thus lowering our Q4 transaction margin. And third, we will see the full impact of dissynergy costs and the operating agreement in the second half of the year. We expect a negative margin impact of approximately 5% in the second half of the year versus approximately 3% in the first half. 
Now to guidance. Going forward, we will only provide guidance on an annual basis, using our quarterly earnings call to report on our progress. For 2015, we are executing on our strategy and our Q2 strong performance only reinforces our confidence in our full year guidance. 
We continue to expect our FX-neutral revenue growth to be 15% to 18% for full year 2015 and our non-GAAP operating margin to be 20% to 21%, flat to up 1 point. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be 19% to 20% versus our prior range of 18% to 19%. This increase is due to a stronger U.S. performance. This translates into 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27, including approximately a $0.02 negative impact from the operating agreement in the second half of the year. Finally, we expect to generate free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion with a capital expenditures assumption of 8% to 10% of revenue, including approximately $100 million in onetime separation-related activities. 
Let me conclude with our balance sheet. Excluding the Xoom transaction, which we hope to close in Q4 '15 following receipt of regulatory approvals and other conditions, we stand up as an independent company with no debt and approximately $6.6 billion in cash and investments, $2.3 billion of which is in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we will prioritize our investment activity to focus on organic activity first, followed by M&A and lastly, buying back stock. We will continue to be an acquisitive company and expect to take a disciplined approach, looking for strong network effects and minimum short-term dilution. 
I will end my remarks by saying that we have developed a unique set of assets. We have created a leading, sustainable financial model, which allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale in a vibrant market, fueled by the digitization of money and the proliferation of connected devices. We are fully committed to our vision of being the world's leading open technology payments platform. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Devin and Scott at eBay."

Today, I'll cover 3 areas: first, I'll comment on our Q2 results; second, I'll provide an update on our strategy to drive eBay's business forward; and third, I'll share my perspective about the future of eBay. 6 months into 2015, I'm encouraged by the state of our business and the progress we're making against our strategy. The year is shaping up well, and I'm confident in our full year outlook. 
Turning to Q2. Overall, we performed well last quarter and our business was stable. eBay GMV grew at 6% on an FX-neutral basis, a 1 point acceleration from Q1, while revenue grew at 5% on an FX-neutral basis, a 2 point acceleration from Q1. Our active buyer base grew at 6% on a trailing 12-month basis and our trailing 3-month active buyer growth was largely stable. Our active buyers transacted $20 billion of GMV in the quarter with 41% of that closing on mobile. 
Our Q2 GMV, revenue and active buyer growth are clearly steps in the right direction. We've made solid progress, but we have a lot of work ahead of us to maximize eBay's significant potential. We're still feeling the effects of new buyer cohorts we did not acquire over the past year due to the SEO traffic issues, and we're still working to recover buyers that we lost after yet -- last year's cyber security incident. To be clear, our absolute priority is to improve our competitiveness and drive more stable, profitable growth over the long term. We have a clear vision and strategy for our business. So let me now remind you of our plan for eBay and talk about some of the efforts we have underway along with some perspective on early results. 
As I mentioned on the last call, we intend to focus on our target customer base and on a market segment where we believe we can win. eBay was built on enabling unique selection and unmatched spectrum of value to our buyers around the world, and we plan to focus our resources and innovation on this large segment of the market. First, we're building a more robust commerce platform. Second, we're enhancing our engagement with the core buyer and seller segments, who create a vibrant marketplace. And third, we're creating exceptional product and brand experiences. 
Let me touch on our efforts in each of these areas in a bit more detail. First, managing a robust commerce platform is key to creating sustainable performance. Our primary effort in this area is focused around leveraging structured data to drive discoverability, both on and off our marketplace as well as improving the user experience. This is a long-term effort, and our rollout is initially focused on categories where we have a predominance of manufactured goods. 
On June 29, we started to require that our sellers provide product identifiers, where relevant, when listing an item. This is enabling us to create innovative, new browse and product pages, which were not previously possible in our marketplace. So far, we've launched hundreds of thousands of new browse pages into the SEO ecosystem, and early results show that these pages convert equal to or better than the pages that they're replacing. We've launched thousands of new product pages across 22 categories through last week. These pages are the seeds of our ability to showcase our offering across new, refurbished and used items and provide the consumers the ability to make value-based choices that are truly unique to eBay. While this is an encouraging start, these efforts are in the early stages, and we'll continue to share more on our progress along the way. 
We also continue to experiment and grow new sources to diversify our traffic for consistent long-term growth. While still small relative to our more established channels, traffic from social channels is growing over 100% year-on-year in the U.S. On Facebook, we're early adopters of dynamic product ads, which enable retargeting on mobile. And on Pinterest, eBay's inspirational shopping content is driving very high engagement and click-through rates. And this success has positioned us as a top advertiser on the platform. We're also focused on growing our newer channels, including Instagram and Tumblr, and we've recently launched efforts on Snapchat and Periscope. We view social media and messaging platforms as a great way to reach our customers in the places they love while allowing us to diversify our sources of traffic and user acquisition for consistent, long-term growth. 
The second pillar of our strategy is to create a vibrant marketplace. For eBay consumers who love to shop, we'll continue to enhance our platform to bring them amazing value and unique selection. We source inventory on our site from small- and medium-sized sellers, who range from well-known brands to medium-sized retailers to smaller entrepreneurs. These sellers represent 70% of global retail, and they're growing faster than the top 250 retailers. They bring to us a mix of inventory from unique items to discounted and season inventory to liquidation goods. We're on pace to sign a record number of managed sellers this year. Some key brands and sellers we've added include ASICS, PUMA, GoPro, Sony and Bosch Power Tools. 
We're also driving a vibrant marketplace by reinventing our consumer selling approach. In Q2, we expanded our intermediated selling service, eBay Valet, into the fashion category, and we now accept items for hundreds of designer fashion brands. While it's still early, the value proposition of eBay Valet is resonating with sellers and driving strong repeat engagement. And we continue to see strong growth in our Classifieds business, which is capturing the local C2C opportunity. 
On the seller experience front, we recently launched our promoted listings product, enabling eBay sellers to increase item visibility and drive buyer traffic to items they want to showcase, such as new listings or seasonal must-haves. While still an invite-only program, initial results show click-through rates on par with our organic search experience, and we're seeing strong seller demand to scale the program. 
Finally, our third pillar, exceptional product and brand experiences. In Q2, we rolled out improvements to our iPhone, iPad and Android experiences, and we launched our Apple Watch app, which enables users to interact with us quickly and easily while on the go. We've also rolled out significant improvements to search quality and relevance to enable buyers to more effectively find what they're looking for. 
Looking towards the second half, we'll be launching a new experience across mobile channels that we're really excited about. This experience is built upon learnings from our iPad app, a more engaging, discovery-based experience for buyers that also builds on our simplified mobile selling experience. This release will unify the mobile experience across our platforms, and it will enable a consistent user experience and faster product iteration. 
Executing against our strategy also means being vigilant about our portfolio and ensuring that our investments are aligned with our strategic direction. As Bob mentioned earlier, we've just entered into an agreement to sell eBay Enterprise, and in June, we divested our stake in Craigslist. Looking forward, we're investing organically to build out our eBay seller tools and data to acquire the small and medium-sized business, and we're beginning to scale Close5, our rapidly growing U.S. Classifieds mobile app. You can expect us to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation going forward. 
In summary, Q2 is a good quarter. We delivered against our strategy, and we're on track to deliver for the full year. You can count on us to continue to focus where we need to win and to make the hard decisions along the way that will enable us to more clearly define our space as a leader. 
I also want to congratulate Dan and the entire PayPal team, and we look forward to a close relationship working together in the future. As eBay celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, we're making rapid changes to position this business for the future. My goal and that of the entire leadership team is for eBay to be the best global marketplace and a great enduring Internet business. eBay was founded with a purpose-driven ethos, which has fueled our company and our brand. As we write the next chapter for this incredible business, we will continue to focus on our purpose: to empower people and create opportunity through connected commerce. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Scott, who'll go into more details around our financial performance."

Overall, in Q2, we continued to stabilize many of our underlying operating metrics while delivering positive signs of acceleration in GMV and revenue growth. 
We remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives amidst the separation-related activities, and we are confident in our full year outlook. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation where we'll begin on Slide 16. Net revenues were $2.1 billion with revenue growth accelerating 2 points to 5% on an FX-neutral basis compared to Q1. Transaction revenue grew 5% on an FX-neutral basis, also accelerating 2 points versus Q1. The increase in transaction revenue growth was largely driven by the acceleration in GMV growth. Marketing Services revenue grew 7% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating 2 points over the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by our advertising format. In addition, we continue to deliver strong results in our Classifieds format, which is expanding its geographic footprint in Latin America and the U.S. Finally, we continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, which negatively impacted total revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 8 points. 
On Slide 17, some highlights on our operating metrics. As Devin explained earlier, we grew trailing 12-month active buyers by 6%, down 2 points compared to Q1. We expected this decline as we continue to deal with the implications of fewer new buyers on eBay due to SEO challenges and the friction introduced by resetting passwords after the cybersecurity incident. We grew GMV 6% on an FX-neutral basis, 1 point faster than Q1. In the U.S., GMV grew 2%, consistent with Q1. It's worth noting that U.S. GMB, a measure of consumer buying, grew 6% as U.S. buyers took advantage of the global selection and value available on eBay. We grew our International business 8% on an FX-neutral basis, 1 point faster than the prior quarter. That acceleration was driven by the strength in Europe, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. Segment margin is down 50 basis points from last year, as the savings from our Q1 restructuring were more than offset by negative currency translation, plus the investment in our key initiatives. Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses were 44% of revenue in the quarter, down 1.4 points year-over-year. In Q2, we benefited from the restructuring at the beginning of the year, which delivered savings across all areas of the business. Additionally, we lapped expenses incurred in Q2 2014 in both marketing and transaction losses related to the security -- the cybersecurity incident. 
As highlighted in our June investor presentation, over the long term, we expect sales and marketing and product development costs to remain relatively flat versus 2015 as a percentage of revenue. We also expect to drive leverage in G&A, and reinvest in our key strategic initiatives, which include building a more robust commerce platform, creating a more vibrant marketplace, and developing exceptional product and brand experiences. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss our exposure to and approach to hedging. Our revenue continues to be heavily exposed to currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, we took action to utilize additional hedging strategies to economically protect full year net income. Some of those strategies are not eligible for hedge accounting, and thus, we must mark-to-market the hedging instruments through earnings, potentially creating volatility in our quarterly results going forward. 
Now let me turn to guidance on Slide 18. As a reminder, in our June investor presentation, we provided 2015 full year guidance of 0 to 5% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis, fully allocated operating margin of 32% to 34%, and free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. 
Based on our half -- first half performance, we are more confident in our full year outlook. As a result, we are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to 3%, projecting 2015 neutral -- FX-neutral growth between 3% to 5%. Fully allocated operating margin and free cash flow remain in line with our previous guidance. Additionally, we are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $1.72 to $1.77 per share. For the third quarter, we are projecting revenue growth of 3% to 5% as well on an FX-neutral basis and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. 
I'd like to take a moment to provide some perspective on our approach to capital allocation. While our focus is first and foremost on revitalizing our core business, our philosophy is that the capital return and disciplined M&A will be important to shareholder value as well. We can -- we will continue to be good stewards of capital and ensure we use a strategic and disciplined approach in all of our activities. Our policy has several key tenets, including focusing on long-term value creation, while making sure we have the resources to execute our strategy; driving growth while balancing profitability; supplementing organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments while maximizing the capital deployed in those assets; and managing the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital, while offsetting both dilution and reducing share count via opportunistic share repurchases at attractive prices. We believe that by adhering to these principles, we will drive the most value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Turning to our balance sheet and the implementation of this policy. We ended Q2 with $8.5 billion in cash, $7.6 billion in debt, and thus, approximately $1 billion of net cash. In the second half of the year, we expect to generate strong cash flows, leveraging our capitally efficient business model and disciplined approach to capital allocation. This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion for share repurchase, which when coupled with our existing $2 billion authorization, brings our total capacity to repurchase shares to $3 billion. We continue to be disciplined in how we will assess our assets, selling our equity stake in Craigslist, while settling all outstanding litigation with them, and our board authorized the sale of eBay Enterprise, and we've announced the sale this morning. Finally, we expect the rating agencies to conclude their ratings review process soon, providing clarity on eBay's credit rating. The rating will be an investment-grade profile at the high end of the BBB range, which we believe is important for our existing creditors and customers. 
In summary, in the first half of 2015, we continued to stabilize many of our underlying metrics, while delivering positive signs of acceleration in GMV and revenue growth. We remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives, and we are confident in our full year outlook. And while the road ahead will not be an easy one, we are incredibly excited about our future opportunities and our ability to win.  And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

First, on levels of marketing spend, in line with what we normally do in holiday, we will ramp up our holiday spend. It's likely that depending on the underlying metrics that we see, we may do that a little bit more aggressively this season, but let's keep in mind that we are a very disciplined marketer. We don't throw money against the wall and hope things stick. We measure almost every $0.01 that we spend, and we try to get a return on that. It doesn't have to be immediate, but we understand the CLV of user acquisition, and we're disciplined about the way we spend. So as you've heard me say before, it's not hard to grow an e-commerce company. It is hard to grow value in an e-commerce company, and we're solving to grow value. So we will spend into the holiday, but we won't spend to acquire business or users at any cost because plenty are doing that, but not plenty are creating value. On diversification of marketing, it is very important to me that we end up in a couple of years with multiple channels that are competing for our incremental investment dollar. I'll remind you that the majority of eBay's traffic comes directly to us either to our apps or to our site. That's the premium of our brand showing up. But not an insignificant minority comes through channels, and it's very important that we have more of those channels that are competing for our dollar. And as you heard in my remarks, we're working very closely with the social and the messaging platforms to try to scale our investment to healthily add positive ROI, acquire new users and new traffic. I'd say it's early. I'm encouraged by what I see. We're optimistic about the future, but it is early, and we are a very large digital marketer, one of the largest on the web, and the total amount that we've been able to spend into positive results on these platforms is still very small compared to our more established channels. So it'll take time, but we're on the path. Thanks for the question."

It literally does take out all friction out of the commerce experience, where you can check out with a single touch, and so we're very excited about it. What we're doing with One Touch is we've been able to seamlessly bring that over from the Braintree platform into our PayPal flows, and so as we bring it into our PayPal flow, a consumer doesn't need to do anything differently except opt in. That's what they have to do for that on each device in which they want to integrate One Touch. So for them, it's a seamless type of integration. On the merchant side, the same thing. We're able to do this in a seamless fashion. The merchant doesn't have to upgrade. It automatically happens for the merchant as we take that One Touch capability into that payment -- PayPal payment flow, and so we're just going about this in a disciplined fashion. Rolling it out, we started this a little over a month ago to 1% of our traffic. We've ramped that up to 5% of our traffic, then we started expanding it into other countries. We'll start expanding it throughout the world, but we're just doing it in a very disciplined fashion to make sure there are no issues with it.

First of all, we are very focused on, call it, 2 major constituencies. We've got merchants on one side, consumers on the other. Obviously, developers are a third constituency for us, but let's focus on merchants and consumers right now. So the first thing that we needed to do, and we have spent a lot of time, and I give a tremendous amount of credit to the team at PayPal and the former leadership teams at PayPal in terms of their foresight in the technological upgrades that we've done on our platform. The technology upgrades we've done allow us to innovate. They allow us to deploy changes and innovations in times that we're unheard of even a year or so ago. So we have the ability to constantly do A/B testing on our website, on all of the different programs that we have right now. That was difficult for us several years ago. As a result of that, our acquisition and our acquisition flow on that is improving dramatically as is our retention efforts. We are ramping up our life cycle management efforts across the world because we now have realtime data and information that we can use. We know what the various variables are that lead to an indication in churn or the indication of a very profitable customer, and we're accelerating on all of those, and the technology upgrades we did on the platform is helping us tremendously on that. On the consumer side, we obviously want to be more a part of their financial lives. We want to move from being an occasional use, twice a month, to them using us 2 to 3x a month. And we think that's obviously a stretched goal through all of our active base, but we already have an example of that in Venmo. Venmo users use the service 2 to 4x a week. It's a part of how they manage and move their money, and we want to become more of a part of how consumers manage and move their money. The acquisition of Xoom is a good example of that. It takes capabilities that another company has built up. You apply that to the scale that we have in our base and our global reach, and we think taking those capabilities, combining them with the assets that we have at PayPal, gives us a tremendously powerful flywheel for both acquisition and engagement of our consumers, and we're very excited about that combination. And so as we look into the future, and we look at the potential of consolidation and acquisitions going forward, as Patrick mentioned, we'll take a very disciplined approach to that. Now that our platform is significantly upgraded, we can do a lot more things organically, and we will take advantage of that, and we have a very disciplined product road map in place. That's where One Touch came from. That's where our expanded buyer protection came from. Those were all organic efforts. But if we see a capability or an ability to enter into a market at scale through an acquisition that helps our flywheel, both in acquisition and engagement, we'll look at that carefully."

We started the year, and we described some of the issues that we were working through, and we discussed the fact that some of the buyer cohorts that we had lost last year",492,"Colin, to your question on growth, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. We started the year, and we described some of the issues that we were working through, and we discussed the fact that some of the buyer cohorts that we had lost last year would take some time to reacquire, and because of that, it wasn't as simple as passing a calendar date and lapping it. There were some systematic issues on reacquiring buyers that we were working our way through. We were confident we would do it, but we also explained that it would take time, and in that context, we gave guidance for 2015, which was 0 to 5% revenue growth. As we got a bit further in the first half, we clarified our strategy and communicated that on our investor presentation and through our roadshow, and what we said there is we feel great about our future, but this will be a transformative moment for eBay, where we've got a lot of hard work to do, and we're going to make some choices, which in and amongst themselves, are the right decisions for eBay, but they'll create some short-term growth issues. And in that context, we extended the guidance through 2016. Now with the first half over, what I'd say is things are going pretty well, and we feel pretty good about that, and that's given us the ability [indiscernible] the guidance up, but I'd just refer you back to everything we said in the first half. We're doing what we said we do. We're executing the strategy. We're working through the issues. All of that remains exactly as I said in the first quarter on the roadshow and through the investor presentation. So I would just say we're feeling good about where we are. We're on the right path, but I'd caution against any assumption that says, ""Well, we've just popped out of this, and now growth rates are going back to exactly where they were. There are a lot more factors involved. We feel great about where we are and the path we're on, and like I said, I think we laid down a bunch of markers, and what's important to me is we're doing exactly what we said, and we're trickling towards the upper end of that trajectory, and we'll keep updating you as we go. On the small and medium-sized business issue, I'd just say the overwhelming majority of what eBay sells comes from small and medium-sized businesses, overwhelming majority. A large seller on eBay is a couple of million dollars, and that's the incredible breadth and the fragmentation that is eBay. The 25 million sellers are the incredible spectrum of small sellers and entrepreneurs and even individuals, and in many ways, that's our strength. So the segment we're leaning into really is where we have #1 market share and where we're the best and where we believe we can win."

Thanks for your question. Very consistently over the last -- you look back over time, we've grown our subscribers through the ups and downs of eBay by anywhere between 3 million and 5 million a quarter that have come in quarter-after-quarter, and this was no exception again this quarter. We grew our actives from 165 million to 169 million. And so as we work closely with eBay, and we look at the acquisition that comes off of that, we've obviously expanded our acquisition efforts tremendously off of eBay. We have a tremendous amount of organic traffic that comes to our website that we convert. We have merchants now, 10 million-plus merchants across the world, that also generate consumer acquisition. And as our value proposition strengthens, as our brand strengthens, as our scale strengthens, there's a network effect that just naturally goes on. And as our life cycle efforts, which are still relatively nascent, I would say, in general, expand, I think we can improve our ability to both attract customers to PayPal, and importantly, retain and engage them and make them active customers. So I feel very good about that, and I think our history proves that point. In terms of TPV growth, again, if you look at our TPV results over the last several quarters, you can see very strong and accelerating TPV growth, and that is across the board. Not only is our MS growing this quarter, but very strong growth out of Braintree, very strong growth out of Venmo, very strong growth in credit on the revenue side. So we have a very balanced portfolio across the world and across our product mix. We're seeing good strength driving that TPV and revenue."

Whether the initiatives were in or not, when we gave the guidance, of course, everything in the business was in it. There was no footnote to that, but as we see the progress of these initiatives, we'll update the guidance when we get closer to '16. Vis-à-vis MELI, I just -- I guess I wouldn't comment on a specific asset. I'd just comment on our approach to our portfolio, which is everything has to have a reason to exist in the portfolio. Not everything has to have a path to direct ownership or accretion of our results immediately, but ultimately, we don't hold things for the sake of holding them, and you've seen that through the disposition of Enterprise and of Craigslist, and ultimately, we'll look at everything through that same lens. I think that vis-a-vis that relationship, it's been a strong relationship. They've done a great job.

On the user growth, as we said, and as you've seen, these are sort of long-cycle movements. They don't immediately move up and down. They sort of are longer cycle sine wave-type movements, and we've been moving down since last year, but I think what was very important in this announcement, in this earnings, was the fact that we've seen for the first time really since May of '14 quarter-on-quarter stability in user acquisition. So that doesn't mean we snap right back, but I feel like there is a reasonable chance that we're at the bottom of that sine wave now, and can now start working our way back up. So that to me is an encouraging sign. And just vis-à-vis the opportunity on user growth, I mean, yes. One of the things I'm proudest of over the last 4 years is we added roughly 60 million active accounts, which is a sign of relevance, to say the least. So I think the ability to continue to acquire users and drive eBay's relevance across consumers and sellers is absolutely part of what we're talking about in our strategy. On the pages, it's really early, and like I said, this is going to be a long-term effort. I think we've put pages up that I think are very interesting. They're interesting, not just to reacquire SEO traffic, but they're interesting for what they mean for the shopping experience on eBay. This is not about another commodity page to sell another commodity item. This is about sharpening the focus on what is truly, uniquely different about our business, and that's a spectrum of choices and value, which can only be done when we understand product families. So I am encouraged by it, but we have 800 million items for sale, and this is going to take quite a long time, but the benefits will come as we work them. It's not all or nothing, and we'll just keep working our way down and providing updates as we go. Thanks for the question."

Maybe a couple of points on each of these. The repurchases, we expanded the authorization by $1 billion to $3 billion this morning. With regards to your question specifically around the debt, we're still in the final stages with the bond rating agencies about finalizing their ratings. We believe that will be a strong investment-grade rating, and that would be a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, somewhere between 2.5 to 3, which would provide us sufficient financial flexibility to take on additional debt if we chose.

That's because we provide an extremely strong proposition to the merchant. We bring, first of all, now almost 170 million users onto the platform. Those are typically more active users than the normal Internet user. They spend more. They are more active, and so we bring a very engaged base to the merchant. It's simple and easy to integrate with us. We've made that a very low-touch experience now. We're increasingly doing in context, so that when a consumer purchases on a merchant website, they don't need to bounce back to something else. They can do it in context on the merchant's website. So our value proposition is improving quite substantially. One Touch is another substantial improvement on that, and it's really a matter of going in and getting the right channels and getting the right touch points to those merchants. We have a channel that goes after large merchants. We're making very good progress on that. We -- obviously, there are some merchants that there was an inherent conflict when we were a part of eBay. This now opens our opportunity to look at every single merchant out there as a truly independent third-party payments platform on that. We're also beginning to win with some players like Bigcommerce, whether you're using our platform. That really goes into the small market with partnerships, and we're looking at more and more of that and making some very good progress on that. So I'm very encouraged by kind of the efforts in terms of our merchant-acquiring business. It's growing substantially. Our value proposition is stronger than ever. And if you look at our strategy, the whole idea behind merchant acquiring is how do we become a great partner for merchants? How do we do more and more for them in this increasingly complicated world? How do we become 100% share of checkout, so they can easily integrate any form of payment that they want to put in there, whether it's Bitcoin or Android Pay or any of the credit card companies, we can integrate that for them. We can integrate into their loyalty. We can integrate into their rewards. We can integrate into offers, and so we really want to be a -- fully a partner with a completely agnostic platform that allows the merchant to interact with their consumers on a very personal level. And so we're putting in a lot of places, a lot of pieces to that puzzle, and feel really good about the initial success we've seen on that."

Our Q2 results marked the final consolidated earnings call for eBay Inc. On Monday, July 20, PayPal and eBay will begin trading as separate, independent public companies. Our call will run a little longer today. I'll be brief, and Bob will provide a quick summary of the overall eBay Inc. financial results, and then we'll turn it over to Dan and Devin, who will provide full details on the quarter and outlook for each business.
Suffice it to say, we are very pleased with our overall Q2 performance. FX-neutral revenue from continuing operations was up 12% and non-GAAP EPS was up 9%. PayPal and eBay both delivered strong Q2 results and have strong momentum. Dan, Devin and their respective teams are executing well and looking to create the next great chapter for PayPal and eBay.
Since announcing the decision to separate last September, our teams have done a remarkable job. We said we would move with speed and clarity. And we have. We said we would create operating agreements that preserve synergies while creating strategic flexibility for each business. We have. We said we would build 2 world-class management teams and Boards of Directors. We have. And we said we would set each business up for long-term success. And I believe we have done just that. Each business is well capitalized with strong balance sheets, and Dan and Devin each have clear, focused strategies to drive PayPal and eBay forward.
In closing, I joined this company 10 years ago because I was inspired by the purpose and values of our founder, Pierre Omidyar. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Serving our customers and bringing our purpose to life has been a privilege. I am proud of what we've accomplished, building 2 global leaders in commerce and payments. Each step of the way, we've been committed to doing what's best for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. And this moment is no different. Launching PayPal and eBay as independent companies is clearly the best path for each business and the right approach for delivering sustainable value to shareholders.
Last, I'm proud that we're executing a smooth succession process, and I am thrilled for Dan and Devin. They are the right leaders who will launch the next chapters for PayPal and eBay, and I'm confident that under their leadership and that of their respective teams, PayPal and eBay have great futures ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide a summary of our overall Q2 results."

I'll provide a brief update on the quarter results at the Inc. level before handing the call over to PayPal and eBay teams for more detail. During the discussion, we will reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast.
Before I start, I wanted to highlight that the eBay's board has authorized the decision to sell eBay Enterprise. And as a result, those results will be included in discontinued operations. And while it is not in our press release, about 3 minutes ago, we concluded the sale of eBay Enterprise for approximately $925 million. I'll touch on that a bit later.
Q2 was a great quarter, demonstrating continued momentum for both businesses. Revenue from continuing operations was $4.4 billion, up 12% on an FX-neutral basis, a 2 point acceleration from the first quarter. PayPal revenue was $2.3 billion, up 19%, and eBay revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 9% on continuing operations.
We generated $688 million of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the first half of the year. In the quarter, we completed the sale of the PayPal loan portfolio, increasing U.S. cash balance by roughly $700 million, and we exited our stake in Craigslist. As of June 30, PayPal and eBay are capitalized with $6.6 billion and $8.5 billion cash, respectively.
In Q2, on a continuing operating basis, we generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 12%, with strength across both businesses. Currency negatively impacted our growth by approximately 5 points. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 9% on a continuing operations basis. The EPS improvement was driven by accelerating top line growth, a streamlined cost structure and a lower share count. Operating margins were up 110 basis points on a continuing operations basis while we continued to invest in our key strategic priorities.
Through the first 6 months of the year, we have improved our cash balance by $0.5 billion to $15.1 billion. We generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We bought back $1 billion in stock, and we executed on strategic initiatives, closing 2 acquisitions, selling Craigslist and a portion of our credit receivable portfolio. Additionally, we've moved $3.8 billion of cash from eBay to PayPal. Upon separation, both businesses will have the financial flexibility to pursue their respective capital allocation priorities.
As I mentioned earlier, eBay's board has authorized management to sell eBay Enterprise. Just minutes ago, we announced that we reached a definitive agreement to sell the business for $925 million. The discontinued ops will result in an impairment charge of $786 million, and we expect the deal to close the transaction in the second half of this year.
I want to touch on 3 quick items before handing the call over to Dan and Devin. First, on segment margins. As a reminder, Patrick and Scott will refer to segment margins in discussing their second quarter results. These exclude corporate costs, dissynergies and standup-related costs. They also exclude incremental revenue that results from previously eliminated intercompany revenues. In the second quarter, these costs for PayPal represented approximately 3 to 4 points and approximately 4 to 5 points for eBay. Second, GAAP to non-GAAP results are wider than usual. In addition to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, the quarter includes the impact from selling our investment in Craigslist, the onetime costs associated with the separation and the impairment charge associated with the sale of eBay Enterprise.
And lastly, let me describe 4 important filings that will take place in the next 6 weeks. We will file an eBay Inc. 8-K that will provide a pro forma view of eBay after giving effect to the distribution of PayPal. eBay Inc. will file its 10-Q, including segment results for only the eBay and PayPal businesses. And PayPal will file a 10-Q in the second quarter, including stand-alone revenue and operating margins. And lastly, in mid-August, eBay will file an 8-K to provide investors with meaningful, historical financial information, including stand-alone revenue and operating margins.
In closing, I want to say thank you. It's been a privilege working with you over the years. I feel great about what we've accomplished over the last 10 years, but I feel even better about the teams that we are passing the baton to. So with that, let me now turn the call over to the new leadership teams at eBay and PayPal to discuss their segment-specific results for the quarter."

I'm glad that Patrick and I had the opportunity to meet so many of you in person during our recent roadshow. It almost goes without saying that this is an exciting time for PayPal. I'm hap",1875,"Thank you, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm glad that Patrick and I had the opportunity to meet so many of you in person during our recent roadshow. It almost goes without saying that this is an exciting time for PayPal. I'm happy to report as we enter this next chapter in our history that we had another strong quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to help shape the transformation of digital and mobile payments around much of the world.
With that, let me highlight some of our results and initiatives for the quarter. Payment volume was $66 billion, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating from Q1 where our payment volume was already up a robust 25%. Importantly, PayPal continued to gain share globally, growing at roughly double the pace of e-commerce. More specifically, our Merchant Services payment volume increased by a strong 36% as we continue to win with the larger, leading commerce players, both traditional retailers and next-generation platforms. This metric also accelerated 3 points from Q1.
On our last earnings call, I outlined the 4 metrics that best measure the growth and health of our business. As a reminder, they are top line revenue growth, the scale of our customer base, the engagement of that base as shown by transactions per active account and free cash flow. We continue to drive incremental progress across all of these metrics.
First, I'll start with our top line growth. As Bob mentioned, our Q2 revenue was $2.3 billion, up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, a 200 basis point improvement from Q1. Second, our customer base continues to expand. We ended the quarter with 169 million active accounts, an increase of 11% and up from 165 million active accounts at the end of Q1. This growth is driven by the growing strength of our PayPal brands.
PayPal was named as one of the top 100 brands throughout the world in a recent study. And in countries like Australia and the U.K., we rank as one of the top 10 most trusted brands. This trust helps to drive both acquisition and engagement. Also in a recent study, U.S. consumers, who plan to make their first mobile payment in a physical store in the next 6 months, were asked how they would choose to pay. Over 70% said they would trust PayPal over others with that transaction. And that brand preference is a powerful asset as we look towards the future.
Third, we continue to deepen engagement with our customer base. We processed almost 1.1 billion transactions in the second quarter, up 27%. Even as we continue to grow customers at the top of our funnel, our monetization per account increased to $50 from $48 a year ago. And our customers used PayPal more often. Transactions per active account rose substantially from last year, now at 24 times [ph] a year up from 21 times a year in Q2 of last year.
Let me spend just a bit more time on engagement as that metric is an important reflection of the value we bring to our ecosystem. That value starts with mobile leadership. For the second quarter, mobile transactions represented 30% of our total transactions, up 1 point from Q1 and grew 42%. We see ourselves as a mobile-first platform, and the majority of our development efforts continue to support our innovation across mobile payments and digital commerce.
Being a trusted way to pay in today's most popular apps is helping to drive this increase in mobile engagement across not only online and in app, but importantly, we are seeing the very beginning of our in-store strategy play out. PayPal continues to make very strong inroads with leading mobile players. We are now live with 67% of the top 100 mobile merchants. Importantly, we are making initial strides, empowering the in-store mobile shopping experiences developed by our merchant partners. The Paydiant-powered SUBWAY app became the #2 downloaded food and beverage iOS app in the U.S. in June and is now available across 30,000-plus stores. And in collaboration with Tillster, we announced the national rollout of PayPal as a way to pay at 5,000 Burger King stores.
As pleased as we are with our customers' engagement, we aspire to much more. We want to create a value proposition that inspires the average PayPal customer to use our app 2 to 3 times a week versus the 2 to 3 times per month they use PayPal today. And while that is a significant stretch goal for us, we already see this type of usage pattern with our Venmo users. For a generation that has never written a check, Venmo is the way to pay the rent, pay back a friend. And it is in the middle of how the millennial generation manage and moves their money. As a result, in Q2, Venmo processed $1.6 billion of transaction volume, a 247% increase. And finally, we are on track to deliver our free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for 2015.
As John mentioned earlier, the separation process has gone very well, and we've completed this significant effort in record time. The separation has given PayPal the opportunity to invest heavily in our infrastructure, setting up state-of-the-art networks and data centers to give PayPal a competitive edge. This was no small task, and our technology teams deserve a tremendous amount of recognition for this achievement.
At the same time, we continue to push forward the transformation of our technology platform. We've made great progress and are approximately 2/3 of the way through this 3-year initiative. We have rearchitected much of our back-end infrastructure and consequently have sped up payment processing by up to 50% in the past year and reduced time to push code live to site by more than half. We are a fully agile software development shop, now one of the largest in the world. And being agile allows us to innovate more quickly, integrate more effectively and introduce new products or deploy new markets faster than ever.
And a great example of our new flexibility and speed to market is One Touch. One Touch is the most significant improvement to our checkout experience in the past 5-plus years. One Touch lets people pay with just a single touch on any mobile phone, tablet and desktop across iOS, Android and Windows operating systems. It removes almost all friction from the checkout experience. One Touch was started on our Braintree platform. But as we have integrated the PayPal and Braintree software stacks, we were able to migrate its functionality within 6 months to our traditional PayPal payment flows in the U.S., U.K. and Canada with many other markets targeted for later this year. And while it will take time to properly deploy One Touch through our various payment flows, we expect it to be available for over 50% of our U.S. transactions by year end.
Braintree continues to be the payments partner of choice for mobile disruptors and innovators. In Q2, we announced that Pinterest is now using Braintree's full-stack processing platform. Notably, of the 5 major retailers that were part of Pinterest's Buyable Pins launch, 4 of them are using Braintree. These include Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Michaels and Gardener's Supply Company. And in line with our strategy of processing 100% share of checkout for our merchant partners, we also announced the addition of Android Pay, a new form of payment on our platform.
Earlier this month, we took another important step to further enhance customer confidence and trust in the PayPal brand. On July 1, we extended our buyer protection program to cover not only physical products but also intangible goods and services, including digital goods, digital music, digital books, digital games, travel tickets and software downloads. As a result, PayPal now offers buyer protection on 99% plus of everything bought on our platform. We believe this is an industry-leading value proposition, and that was enabled by our world-class risk and data analytics teams.
I want to reiterate what we said during our roadshow. PayPal is much more than a Web-based proprietary payment button. We are making significant progress in our quest to become the world's leading open payments platform for merchants and consumers. With the integration of Braintree and the addition of Paydiant to our technology platform, we can provide end-to-end solutions for merchants of all sizes, online, in app and in store. By being payment, device, point of sale and operating system-agnostic, we enable merchants to navigate the increasingly complicated and confusing landscape of payment options and changing consumer behaviors.
Beyond the checkout experience with merchants, the accelerated adoption of mobile commerce and payments by consumers affords us the opportunity to transform the management and movement of money. For consumers, we make their transactions safer, easier and less expensive. Earlier this month, we announced the $890 million acquisition of Xoom, providing us an opportunity to accelerate our entrance into the international remittances industry, a $600 billion market ripe for disruption. By adding additional value-added services to our technology platform, we believe we can amplify our customer flywheel, creating a more powerful network effect.
Xoom lets people send money to and pay bills for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast and cost-effective way using their mobile phone, tablet or computer. And during the 12 months ended March 31, 2015, Xoom reported that its 1.3 million active customers sent roughly $7 billion to people in 38 different markets, including the Philippines, India, Mexico, Brazil and China. Xoom's brand promise resonates with ours. They have a strong and engaged customer profile and a mobile and digital service orientation, providing real and transparent value globally.
Technology should make managing and moving our money a right, not a privilege for just the affluent. And we believe our technology platform, global reach and trusted brand can move PayPal from being an occasional transaction to being an integral part of a consumers' financial life. Adding remittance capabilities bolsters our efforts to achieve that goal.
I'd like to close by saying that all of us at PayPal are thrilled to return to our original roots as an independent company. On July 20, our original stock ticker symbol, PYPL, will once again be publicly traded on NASDAQ for the second time in our 17-year history. I'd like to take a moment to thank each generation of leadership and especially all of our employees who brought us to this point. More specifically, I'd like to thank John, Bob, Mike, Alan, Beth and the eBay Inc. team for all they have done over the past 9 months in helping us formulate and separate 2 future Fortune 500 companies. I also want to thank Devin and the eBay team for their support of PayPal. I look forward to a long and productive relationship with them.
It's been a remarkable journey, but we are just starting. Today, the potential to improve and transform how money works for people has never been greater. We are fully signed up to meet that challenge and excited by the tremendous opportunity ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Patrick to discuss our financial metrics in more detail."

We feel good about our Q2 performance as PayPal continues to grow nearly double the rate of the industry. We generated $66 billion of payment volume, up 28% on an FX-neutral basis, an acceleration of 3 points, driven by strong growth at Braintree and Venmo. This volume translated into $2.3 billion of revenue, up 16% on a reported basis and 19% on a FX-neutral basis.
Our increased share gain is an indication that our strategy is working. We are winning with the leaders in digital and mobile commerce, both with large retailers who are expanding their footprint in mobile and online and with the next-generation apps that are transforming commerce. We have expanded our product solution from a proprietary, Web-based payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. And as a direct effect of that strategy, where larger customers and a broader service stack translate to a lower average take rate but higher volumes, our transaction margin is declining year-over-year. But in return, expanding volumes bring economies of scale for half of our operating expenses, creating capacity to invest and the opportunity to maintain or expand our operating margin.
And indeed, in the second quarter, our segment margin expanded 160 basis points to 26.1% despite 190 basis points degradation in transaction margin to 63.2%. And for the first 6 months of the year, our segment margin was up 60 basis points despite a decline of 140 basis points in our transaction margin.
Before going to guidance, let me first provide some context on our earnings quarterly profile. First, the second quarter revenue and margin benefited from the premium received on the sale of our U.S.-held credit receivable portfolio in the second quarter. This sale frees up capital that we can redeploy into higher-yielding investments, but it comes with a cost. In the second half of the year, we will not receive revenue or operating income associated with the assets we sold. This negatively impacts revenue growth and operating margin by approximately 1 point in the second half of the year.
Second, Q3 has historically represented our lowest quarterly segment margin as we invest ahead of the holiday selling season. And the holiday season has an increased level of activity from large merchants, thus lowering our Q4 transaction margin. And third, we will see the full impact of dissynergy costs and the operating agreement in the second half of the year. We expect a negative margin impact of approximately 5% in the second half of the year versus approximately 3% in the first half.
Now to guidance. Going forward, we will only provide guidance on an annual basis, using our quarterly earnings call to report on our progress. For 2015, we are executing on our strategy and our Q2 strong performance only reinforces our confidence in our full year guidance.
We continue to expect our FX-neutral revenue growth to be 15% to 18% for full year 2015 and our non-GAAP operating margin to be 20% to 21%, flat to up 1 point. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be 19% to 20% versus our prior range of 18% to 19%. This increase is due to a stronger U.S. performance. This translates into 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27, including approximately a $0.02 negative impact from the operating agreement in the second half of the year. Finally, we expect to generate free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion with a capital expenditures assumption of 8% to 10% of revenue, including approximately $100 million in onetime separation-related activities.
Let me conclude with our balance sheet. Excluding the Xoom transaction, which we hope to close in Q4 '15 following receipt of regulatory approvals and other conditions, we stand up as an independent company with no debt and approximately $6.6 billion in cash and investments, $2.3 billion of which is in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we will prioritize our investment activity to focus on organic activity first, followed by M&A and lastly, buying back stock. We will continue to be an acquisitive company and expect to take a disciplined approach, looking for strong network effects and minimum short-term dilution.
I will end my remarks by saying that we have developed a unique set of assets. We have created a leading, sustainable financial model, which allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale in a vibrant market, fueled by the digitization of money and the proliferation of connected devices. We are fully committed to our vision of being the world's leading open technology payments platform.
With that, let me turn the call over to Devin and Scott at eBay."

Today, I'll cover 3 areas: first, I'll comment on our Q2 results; second, I'll provide an update on our strategy to drive eBay's business forward; and third, I'll share my perspective about the future of eBay. 6 months into 2015, I'm encouraged by the state of our business and the progress we're making against our strategy. The year is shaping up well, and I'm confident in our full year outlook.
Turning to Q2. Overall, we performed well last quarter and our business was stable. eBay GMV grew at 6% on an FX-neutral basis, a 1 point acceleration from Q1, while revenue grew at 5% on an FX-neutral basis, a 2 point acceleration from Q1. Our active buyer base grew at 6% on a trailing 12-month basis and our trailing 3-month active buyer growth was largely stable. Our active buyers transacted $20 billion of GMV in the quarter with 41% of that closing on mobile.
Our Q2 GMV, revenue and active buyer growth are clearly steps in the right direction. We've made solid progress, but we have a lot of work ahead of us to maximize eBay's significant potential. We're still feeling the effects of new buyer cohorts we did not acquire over the past year due to the SEO traffic issues, and we're still working to recover buyers that we lost after yet -- last year's cyber security incident. To be clear, our absolute priority is to improve our competitiveness and drive more stable, profitable growth over the long term. We have a clear vision and strategy for our business. So let me now remind you of our plan for eBay and talk about some of the efforts we have underway along with some perspective on early results.
As I mentioned on the last call, we intend to focus on our target customer base and on a market segment where we believe we can win. eBay was built on enabling unique selection and unmatched spectrum of value to our buyers around the world, and we plan to focus our resources and innovation on this large segment of the market. First, we're building a more robust commerce platform. Second, we're enhancing our engagement with the core buyer and seller segments, who create a vibrant marketplace. And third, we're creating exceptional product and brand experiences.
Let me touch on our efforts in each of these areas in a bit more detail. First, managing a robust commerce platform is key to creating sustainable performance. Our primary effort in this area is focused around leveraging structured data to drive discoverability, both on and off our marketplace as well as improving the user experience. This is a long-term effort, and our rollout is initially focused on categories where we have a predominance of manufactured goods.
On June 29, we started to require that our sellers provide product identifiers, where relevant, when listing an item. This is enabling us to create innovative, new browse and product pages, which were not previously possible in our marketplace. So far, we've launched hundreds of thousands of new browse pages into the SEO ecosystem, and early results show that these pages convert equal to or better than the pages that they're replacing. We've launched thousands of new product pages across 22 categories through last week. These pages are the seeds of our ability to showcase our offering across new, refurbished and used items and provide the consumers the ability to make value-based choices that are truly unique to eBay. While this is an encouraging start, these efforts are in the early stages, and we'll continue to share more on our progress along the way.
We also continue to experiment and grow new sources to diversify our traffic for consistent long-term growth. While still small relative to our more established channels, traffic from social channels is growing over 100% year-on-year in the U.S. On Facebook, we're early adopters of dynamic product ads, which enable retargeting on mobile. And on Pinterest, eBay's inspirational shopping content is driving very high engagement and click-through rates. And this success has positioned us as a top advertiser on the platform. We're also focused on growing our newer channels, including Instagram and Tumblr, and we've recently launched efforts on Snapchat and Periscope. We view social media and messaging platforms as a great way to reach our customers in the places they love while allowing us to diversify our sources of traffic and user acquisition for consistent, long-term growth.
The second pillar of our strategy is to create a vibrant marketplace. For eBay consumers who love to shop, we'll continue to enhance our platform to bring them amazing value and unique selection. We source inventory on our site from small- and medium-sized sellers, who range from well-known brands to medium-sized retailers to smaller entrepreneurs. These sellers represent 70% of global retail, and they're growing faster than the top 250 retailers. They bring to us a mix of inventory from unique items to discounted and season inventory to liquidation goods. We're on pace to sign a record number of managed sellers this year. Some key brands and sellers we've added include ASICS, PUMA, GoPro, Sony and Bosch Power Tools.
We're also driving a vibrant marketplace by reinventing our consumer selling approach. In Q2, we expanded our intermediated selling service, eBay Valet, into the fashion category, and we now accept items for hundreds of designer fashion brands. While it's still early, the value proposition of eBay Valet is resonating with sellers and driving strong repeat engagement. And we continue to see strong growth in our Classifieds business, which is capturing the local C2C opportunity.
On the seller experience front, we recently launched our promoted listings product, enabling eBay sellers to increase item visibility and drive buyer traffic to items they want to showcase, such as new listings or seasonal must-haves. While still an invite-only program, initial results show click-through rates on par with our organic search experience, and we're seeing strong seller demand to scale the program.
Finally, our third pillar, exceptional product and brand experiences. In Q2, we rolled out improvements to our iPhone, iPad and Android experiences, and we launched our Apple Watch app, which enables users to interact with us quickly and easily while on the go. We've also rolled out significant improvements to search quality and relevance to enable buyers to more effectively find what they're looking for.
Looking towards the second half, we'll be launching a new experience across mobile channels that we're really excited about. This experience is built upon learnings from our iPad app, a more engaging, discovery-based experience for buyers that also builds on our simplified mobile selling experience. This release will unify the mobile experience across our platforms, and it will enable a consistent user experience and faster product iteration.
Executing against our strategy also means being vigilant about our portfolio and ensuring that our investments are aligned with our strategic direction. As Bob mentioned earlier, we've just entered into an agreement to sell eBay Enterprise, and in June, we divested our stake in Craigslist. Looking forward, we're investing organically to build out our eBay seller tools and data to acquire the small and medium-sized business, and we're beginning to scale Close5, our rapidly growing U.S. Classifieds mobile app. You can expect us to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation going forward.
In summary, Q2 is a good quarter. We delivered against our strategy, and we're on track to deliver for the full year. You can count on us to continue to focus where we need to win and to make the hard decisions along the way that will enable us to more clearly define our space as a leader.
I also want to congratulate Dan and the entire PayPal team, and we look forward to a close relationship working together in the future. As eBay celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, we're making rapid changes to position this business for the future. My goal and that of the entire leadership team is for eBay to be the best global marketplace and a great enduring Internet business. eBay was founded with a purpose-driven ethos, which has fueled our company and our brand. As we write the next chapter for this incredible business, we will continue to focus on our purpose: to empower people and create opportunity through connected commerce.
Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Scott, who'll go into more details around our financial performance."

Overall, in Q2, we continued to stabilize many of our underlying operating metrics while delivering positive signs of acceleration in GMV and revenue growth.
We remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives amidst the separation-related activities, and we are confident in our full year outlook. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation where we'll begin on Slide 16. Net revenues were $2.1 billion with revenue growth accelerating 2 points to 5% on an FX-neutral basis compared to Q1. Transaction revenue grew 5% on an FX-neutral basis, also accelerating 2 points versus Q1. The increase in transaction revenue growth was largely driven by the acceleration in GMV growth. Marketing Services revenue grew 7% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating 2 points over the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by our advertising format. In addition, we continue to deliver strong results in our Classifieds format, which is expanding its geographic footprint in Latin America and the U.S. Finally, we continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, which negatively impacted total revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 8 points.
On Slide 17, some highlights on our operating metrics. As Devin explained earlier, we grew trailing 12-month active buyers by 6%, down 2 points compared to Q1. We expected this decline as we continue to deal with the implications of fewer new buyers on eBay due to SEO challenges and the friction introduced by resetting passwords after the cybersecurity incident. We grew GMV 6% on an FX-neutral basis, 1 point faster than Q1. In the U.S., GMV grew 2%, consistent with Q1. It's worth noting that U.S. GMB, a measure of consumer buying, grew 6% as U.S. buyers took advantage of the global selection and value available on eBay. We grew our International business 8% on an FX-neutral basis, 1 point faster than the prior quarter. That acceleration was driven by the strength in Europe, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. Segment margin is down 50 basis points from last year, as the savings from our Q1 restructuring were more than offset by negative currency translation, plus the investment in our key initiatives. Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses were 44% of revenue in the quarter, down 1.4 points year-over-year. In Q2, we benefited from the restructuring at the beginning of the year, which delivered savings across all areas of the business. Additionally, we lapped expenses incurred in Q2 2014 in both marketing and transaction losses related to the security -- the cybersecurity incident.
As highlighted in our June investor presentation, over the long term, we expect sales and marketing and product development costs to remain relatively flat versus 2015 as a percentage of revenue. We also expect to drive leverage in G&A, and reinvest in our key strategic initiatives, which include building a more robust commerce platform, creating a more vibrant marketplace, and developing exceptional product and brand experiences.
I'd like to take a moment to discuss our exposure to and approach to hedging. Our revenue continues to be heavily exposed to currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, we took action to utilize additional hedging strategies to economically protect full year net income. Some of those strategies are not eligible for hedge accounting, and thus, we must mark-to-market the hedging instruments through earnings, potentially creating volatility in our quarterly results going forward.
Now let me turn to guidance on Slide 18. As a reminder, in our June investor presentation, we provided 2015 full year guidance of 0 to 5% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis, fully allocated operating margin of 32% to 34%, and free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
Based on our half -- first half performance, we are more confident in our full year outlook. As a result, we are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to 3%, projecting 2015 neutral -- FX-neutral growth between 3% to 5%. Fully allocated operating margin and free cash flow remain in line with our previous guidance. Additionally, we are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $1.72 to $1.77 per share. For the third quarter, we are projecting revenue growth of 3% to 5% as well on an FX-neutral basis and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 per share.
I'd like to take a moment to provide some perspective on our approach to capital allocation. While our focus is first and foremost on revitalizing our core business, our philosophy is that the capital return and disciplined M&A will be important to shareholder value as well. We can -- we will continue to be good stewards of capital and ensure we use a strategic and disciplined approach in all of our activities. Our policy has several key tenets, including focusing on long-term value creation, while making sure we have the resources to execute our strategy; driving growth while balancing profitability; supplementing organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments while maximizing the capital deployed in those assets; and managing the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital, while offsetting both dilution and reducing share count via opportunistic share repurchases at attractive prices. We believe that by adhering to these principles, we will drive the most value for our customers, shareholders and employees.
Turning to our balance sheet and the implementation of this policy. We ended Q2 with $8.5 billion in cash, $7.6 billion in debt, and thus, approximately $1 billion of net cash. In the second half of the year, we expect to generate strong cash flows, leveraging our capitally efficient business model and disciplined approach to capital allocation. This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion for share repurchase, which when coupled with our existing $2 billion authorization, brings our total capacity to repurchase shares to $3 billion. We continue to be disciplined in how we will assess our assets, selling our equity stake in Craigslist, while settling all outstanding litigation with them, and our board authorized the sale of eBay Enterprise, and we've announced the sale this morning. Finally, we expect the rating agencies to conclude their ratings review process soon, providing clarity on eBay's credit rating. The rating will be an investment-grade profile at the high end of the BBB range, which we believe is important for our existing creditors and customers.
In summary, in the first half of 2015, we continued to stabilize many of our underlying metrics, while delivering positive signs of acceleration in GMV and revenue growth. We remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives, and we are confident in our full year outlook. And while the road ahead will not be an easy one, we are incredibly excited about our future opportunities and our ability to win.  And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your plans heading into the holiday season this year. How much are you planning to push in terms of marketing? Do you feel like the product is where you'd like it to be to push the pedal down more on the marketing front this year? And what sort of impact are you expecting that to have in the back half of the year relative to your guidance? And then kind of on a related note, you talked about diversifying your traffic sources and leveraging more of the social media platforms. Can you talk a little bit about how the return on ad spend and sort of the customer dynamics there compare with your more tried-and-true channels like search?"

First, on levels of marketing spend, in line with what we normally do in holiday, we will ramp up our holiday spend. It's likely that depending on the underlying metrics that we see, we may do that a little bit more aggressively this season, but let's keep in mind that we are a very disciplined marketer. We don't throw money against the wall and hope things stick. We measure almost every $0.01 that we spend, and we try to get a return on that. It doesn't have to be immediate, but we understand the CLV of user acquisition, and we're disciplined about the way we spend. So as you've heard me say before, it's not hard to grow an e-commerce company. It is hard to grow value in an e-commerce company, and we're solving to grow value. So we will spend into the holiday, but we won't spend to acquire business or users at any cost because plenty are doing that, but not plenty are creating value. On diversification of marketing, it is very important to me that we end up in a couple of years with multiple channels that are competing for our incremental investment dollar. I'll remind you that the majority of eBay's traffic comes directly to us either to our apps or to our site. That's the premium of our brand showing up. But not an insignificant minority comes through channels, and it's very important that we have more of those channels that are competing for our dollar. And as you heard in my remarks, we're working very closely with the social and the messaging platforms to try to scale our investment to healthily add positive ROI, acquire new users and new traffic. I'd say it's early. I'm encouraged by what I see. We're optimistic about the future, but it is early, and we are a very large digital marketer, one of the largest on the web, and the total amount that we've been able to spend into positive results on these platforms is still very small compared to our more established channels. So it'll take time, but we're on the path. Thanks for the question."

It literally does take out all friction out of the commerce experience, where you can check out with a single touch, and so we're very excited about it. What we're doing with One Touch is we've been able to seamlessly bring that over from the Braintree platform into our PayPal flows, and so as we bring it into our PayPal flow, a consumer doesn't need to do anything differently except opt in. That's what they have to do for that on each device in which they want to integrate One Touch. So for them, it's a seamless type of integration. On the merchant side, the same thing. We're able to do this in a seamless fashion. The merchant doesn't have to upgrade. It automatically happens for the merchant as we take that One Touch capability into that payment -- PayPal payment flow, and so we're just going about this in a disciplined fashion. Rolling it out, we started this a little over a month ago to 1% of our traffic. We've ramped that up to 5% of our traffic, then we started expanding it into other countries. We'll start expanding it throughout the world, but we're just doing it in a very disciplined fashion to make sure there are no issues with it. If we see it going better than we expect, we can accelerate that, but we need to make sure that we take that One Touch experience and in each of the different PayPal flows, and we have a couple of different flows there, that it works as exceptionally as it is right now in helping to increase conversion rates."

First of all, we are very focused on, call it, 2 major constituencies. We've got merchants on one side, consumers on the other. Obviously, developers are a third constituency for us, but let's focus on merchants and consumers right now. So the first thing that we needed to do, and we have spent a lot of time, and I give a tremendous amount of credit to the team at PayPal and the former leadership teams at PayPal in terms of their foresight in the technological upgrades that we've done on our platform. The technology upgrades we've done allow us to innovate. They allow us to deploy changes and innovations in times that we're unheard of even a year or so ago. So we have the ability to constantly do A/B testing on our website, on all of the different programs that we have right now. That was difficult for us several years ago. As a result of that, our acquisition and our acquisition flow on that is improving dramatically as is our retention efforts. We are ramping up our life cycle management efforts across the world because we now have real-time data and information that we can use. We know what the various variables are that lead to an indication in churn or the indication of a very profitable customer, and we're accelerating on all of those, and the technology upgrades we did on the platform is helping us tremendously on that. On the consumer side, we obviously want to be more a part of their financial lives. We want to move from being an occasional use, twice a month, to them using us 2 to 3x a month. And we think that's obviously a stretched goal through all of our active base, but we already have an example of that in Venmo. Venmo users use the service 2 to 4x a week. It's a part of how they manage and move their money, and we want to become more of a part of how consumers manage and move their money. The acquisition of Xoom is a good example of that. It takes capabilities that another company has built up. You apply that to the scale that we have in our base and our global reach, and we think taking those capabilities, combining them with the assets that we have at PayPal, gives us a tremendously powerful flywheel for both acquisition and engagement of our consumers, and we're very excited about that combination. And so as we look into the future, and we look at the potential of consolidation and acquisitions going forward, as Patrick mentioned, we'll take a very disciplined approach to that. Now that our platform is significantly upgraded, we can do a lot more things organically, and we will take advantage of that, and we have a very disciplined product road map in place. That's where One Touch came from. That's where our expanded buyer protection came from. Those were all organic efforts. But if we see a capability or an ability to enter into a market at scale through an acquisition that helps our flywheel, both in acquisition and engagement, we'll look at that carefully."

We started the year, and we described some of the issues that we were working through, and we discussed the fact that some of the buyer cohorts that we had lost last year",492,"Colin, to your question on growth, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. We started the year, and we described some of the issues that we were working through, and we discussed the fact that some of the buyer cohorts that we had lost last year would take some time to reacquire, and because of that, it wasn't as simple as passing a calendar date and lapping it. There were some systematic issues on reacquiring buyers that we were working our way through. We were confident we would do it, but we also explained that it would take time, and in that context, we gave guidance for 2015, which was 0 to 5% revenue growth. As we got a bit further in the first half, we clarified our strategy and communicated that on our investor presentation and through our roadshow, and what we said there is we feel great about our future, but this will be a transformative moment for eBay, where we've got a lot of hard work to do, and we're going to make some choices, which in and amongst themselves, are the right decisions for eBay, but they'll create some short-term growth issues. And in that context, we extended the guidance through 2016. Now with the first half over, what I'd say is things are going pretty well, and we feel pretty good about that, and that's given us the ability [indiscernible] the guidance up, but I'd just refer you back to everything we said in the first half. We're doing what we said we do. We're executing the strategy. We're working through the issues. All of that remains exactly as I said in the first quarter on the roadshow and through the investor presentation. So I would just say we're feeling good about where we are. We're on the right path, but I'd caution against any assumption that says, ""Well, we've just popped out of this, and now growth rates are going back to exactly where they were. There are a lot more factors involved. We feel great about where we are and the path we're on, and like I said, I think we laid down a bunch of markers, and what's important to me is we're doing exactly what we said, and we're trickling towards the upper end of that trajectory, and we'll keep updating you as we go. On the small and medium-sized business issue, I'd just say the overwhelming majority of what eBay sells comes from small and medium-sized businesses, overwhelming majority. A large seller on eBay is a couple of million dollars, and that's the incredible breadth and the fragmentation that is eBay. The 25 million sellers are the incredible spectrum of small sellers and entrepreneurs and even individuals, and in many ways, that's our strength. So the segment we're leaning into really is where we have #1 market share and where we're the best and where we believe we can win."

Thanks for your question. Very consistently over the last -- you look back over time, we've grown our subscribers through the ups and downs of eBay by anywhere between 3 million and 5 million a quarter that have come in quarter-after-quarter, and this was no exception again this quarter. We grew our actives from 165 million to 169 million. And so as we work closely with eBay, and we look at the acquisition that comes off of that, we've obviously expanded our acquisition efforts tremendously off of eBay. We have a tremendous amount of organic traffic that comes to our website that we convert. We have merchants now, 10 million-plus merchants across the world, that also generate consumer acquisition. And as our value proposition strengthens, as our brand strengthens, as our scale strengthens, there's a network effect that just naturally goes on. And as our life cycle efforts, which are still relatively nascent, I would say, in general, expand, I think we can improve our ability to both attract customers to PayPal, and importantly, retain and engage them and make them active customers. So I feel very good about that, and I think our history proves that point. In terms of TPV growth, again, if you look at our TPV results over the last several quarters, you can see very strong and accelerating TPV growth, and that is across the board. Not only is our MS growing this quarter, but very strong growth out of Braintree, very strong growth out of Venmo, very strong growth in credit on the revenue side. So we have a very balanced portfolio across the world and across our product mix. We're seeing good strength driving that TPV and revenue."

On the user growth, as we said, and as you've seen, these are sort of long-cycle movements. They don't immediately move up and down. They sort of are longer cycle sine wave-type movements, and we've been moving down since last year, but I think what was very important in this announcement, in this earnings, was the fact that we've seen for the first time really since May of '14 quarter-on-quarter stability in user acquisition. So that doesn't mean we snap right back, but I feel like there is a reasonable chance that we're at the bottom of that sine wave now, and can now start working our way back up. So that to me is an encouraging sign. And just vis-à-vis the opportunity on user growth, I mean, yes. One of the things I'm proudest of over the last 4 years is we added roughly 60 million active accounts, which is a sign of relevance, to say the least. So I think the ability to continue to acquire users and drive eBay's relevance across consumers and sellers is absolutely part of what we're talking about in our strategy. On the pages, it's really early, and like I said, this is going to be a long-term effort. I think we've put pages up that I think are very interesting. They're interesting, not just to reacquire SEO traffic, but they're interesting for what they mean for the shopping experience on eBay. This is not about another commodity page to sell another commodity item. This is about sharpening the focus on what is truly, uniquely different about our business, and that's a spectrum of choices and value, which can only be done when we understand product families. So I am encouraged by it, but we have 800 million items for sale, and this is going to take quite a long time, but the benefits will come as we work them.

With regards to your question specifically around the debt, we're still in the final stages with the bond rating agencies about finalizing their ratings. We believe that will be a strong investment-grade rating, and that would be a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, somewhere between 2.5 to 3, which would provide us sufficient financial flexibility to take on additional debt if we chose. And over the course of the following months and years, we'll continue to execute and be disciplined around each of those tenets."

That's because we provide an extremely strong proposition to the merchant. We bring, first of all, now almost 170 million users onto the platform. Those are typically more active users than the normal Internet user. They spend more. They are more active, and so we bring a very engaged base to the merchant. It's simple and easy to integrate with us. We've made that a very low-touch experience now. We're increasingly doing in context, so that when a consumer purchases on a merchant website, they don't need to bounce back to something else. They can do it in context on the merchant's website. So our value proposition is improving quite substantially. One Touch is another substantial improvement on that, and it's really a matter of going in and getting the right channels and getting the right touch points to those merchants. We have a channel that goes after large merchants. We're making very good progress on that. We -- obviously, there are some merchants that there was an inherent conflict when we were a part of eBay. This now opens our opportunity to look at every single merchant out there as a truly independent third-party payments platform on that. We're also beginning to win with some players like Bigcommerce, whether you're using our platform. That really goes into the small market with partnerships, and we're looking at more and more of that and making some very good progress on that. So I'm very encouraged by kind of the efforts in terms of our merchant-acquiring business. It's growing substantially. Our value proposition is stronger than ever. And if you look at our strategy, the whole idea behind merchant acquiring is how do we become a great partner for merchants? How do we do more and more for them in this increasingly complicated world? How do we become 100% share of checkout, so they can easily integrate any form of payment that they want to put in there, whether it's Bitcoin or Android Pay or any of the credit card companies, we can integrate that for them. We can integrate into their loyalty. We can integrate into their rewards. We can integrate into offers, and so we really want to be a -- fully a partner with a completely agnostic platform that allows the merchant to interact with their consumers on a very personal level. And so we're putting in a lot of places, a lot of pieces to that puzzle, and feel really good about the initial success we've seen on that."

Welcome to our Q3 earnings call. Overall, we had a solid quarter, marked by FX-neutral GMV and revenue growth of 6% and 5%, respectively, both consistent with last quarter.

Overall, we had a solid quarter, marked by FX-neutral GMV and revenue growth of 6% and 5%, respectively, both consistent with last quarter. Our performance 1 quarter following our spinoff of PayPal is steady and it's in line with our expectations. I'm proud that the team was able to remain focused on executing our strategy while managing a complex separation. 
We still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to reposition our business and to deliver the level of performance that we aspire to achieve, but our Q3 results are a step in the right direction. When we spoke to you in July, we outlined our strategy to improve eBay's competitive position and drive stable and profitable long-term growth. We said that we'd build a more robust commerce platform, enhanced our engagement with the core buyers and sellers who create a vibrant marketplace and create exceptional product and brand experiences. 
We also indicated that our efforts would take time as we traded off short-term growth and focus more on long-term investments while dealing with the impact of near-term headwinds. And finally, we said that we'd be vigilant about our portfolio, and we'd be disciplined about allocating capital to drive value. This quarter, we drove hard to make progress on that strategy. Simply put, we're doing what we said we would do, and we have confidence in our plans going forward.
Now let me share some of the progress that we made in this quarter. First, as I discussed during the Q2 earnings call, our efforts to deliver a more robust commerce platform will be built on a solid foundation of structured data. And while this is a longer-term effort, we are making progress. 
I'll spend a moment to share some more context on our structured data initiative, including a few slides that accompany my commentary. There are 3 key efforts under way: first, we're collecting product data from our sellers as they list their inventory on our site. On June 29, we started requiring product information from our sellers across 18 categories in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Australia. We've seen positive reception and adoption in line with our expectations, with limited disruption to the listing process. The next phase will add coverage to more countries and categories, and our plan is to expand the requirement where relevant across all sites and categories by the end of 2016. 
Second, we used machine learning to process that data so that we can leverage it in our user experiences. Getting a product identifier is most useful to us after we associate that product information to similar products in our catalog and bring in additional data related to the product such as descriptions, pictures and reviews. In the roughly 12 weeks since we launched this initiative, 27 million more listings have been successfully mapped to products, and 5 million new products have been identified and added to our catalog. 
And finally, we're leveraging that data to improve our product and marketing experiences. We've already started using this data in several areas of the user experience such as SEO, merchandising, and our selling flows. We've provided a few examples of how we're using the data in the slides that accompany this call. While this is an encouraging start, these efforts are in the early stages, and we'll continue to share more on our progress along the way.
A robust commerce platform also means diversified sources of traffic and user acquisition. Along these lines, with continue to expand our use of social channels, and traffic from these channels saw significant growth in Q3. We're now consistently leveraging 10 unique social channels on a regular basis. 
Our second key strategic priority is to create a vibrant marketplace. In September, we celebrated our 20th anniversary, and we hosted a seller conference, which included many eBay-only sellers in San Jose. At that time, we announced a number of significant upcoming changes to our seller policies. These changes, which include more objective standards, are intended to help small- and medium-sized sellers be more successful on our platform and better reward sellers who provide great service to eBay buyers. 
We're also giving sellers the ability to customize how they manage returns based on their specific business needs, with as much or as little involvement from eBay as they choose. Finally, we launched a new product called Seller Hub, which puts a seller's listing and marketing tools, along with deep data insights and selling recommendations into 1 central place. It's a new destination for professional sellers to manage their end-to-end business on eBay. 
I was extremely energized by the engagement from the sellers I met, and I've been encouraged by the industry response to the changes that we announced. We're also investing in areas designed to drive more engagement from our consumer sellers. For example, we're growing our intermediated selling service, eBay Valet, where we're seeing significant growth. Of note, nearly 1/3 of Valet consignments come from repeat customers. And a majority of Valet customers progressed to buying and selling on their own on eBay. 
At the same time, we're ramping up our efforts to drive buyer velocity. For example, in Germany, we recently launched a pilot program called eBay Plus. This offering enables German consumers, in exchange for a low annual fee, to enjoy free expedited shipping, free returns, and it may include access to exclusive deals and promotions over time. The intent of the program is to reach more consumers and increase loyalty in this key market, where consumers have long valued free shipping and returns and the geography can support this type of program. We'll also promote within this subscription the ability for consumers to sell without fees, hence driving not only buying velocity but also the unique eBay sell-to-buy flywheel. 
Our third key strategic pillar is to create exceptional product and brand experiences. In September, we launched a new experience across all of our mobile channels. The launch of our new mobile product marks a shift towards a discovery-based experience for buyers that also enhances our simplified mobile selling experience. And it brings in key functionality from several of the vertical-based apps which we decommissioned in Q3. 
With this release, we've also unified the mobile experience across platforms, which enables a consistent user interface and is already resulting in faster product iteration. This is an important part of our long-term strategy. We believe that moving in this direction with our product will enable us to drive engagement and cross-category purchasing. It's also a better expression of our brand, which stands for discovery and the thrill of finding unique items and incredible deals. We believe this experience will ultimately help eBay become a more differentiated and more personal commerce destination. 
With the knowledge that we're making a very substantial change to the ecosystem and based on our experience when we launched the new iPad app last fall, we expected to see and we did see some disruption following the launch. To date, both the data and the reviews on our new mobile experience are following what we believe is a similar path to what we saw after the iPad launch, which was last fall, which was an initial dip, followed by a strong recovery. You can expect us to launch a series of incremental releases in response to user feedback over the coming weeks and months. Despite this, the percentage of GMV that closed on mobile still increased to 42% in the quarter, up 1% from last. 
Now let me briefly touch on 2 of our adjacent platforms that are great complements to our core, classifieds and StubHub. Our Classifieds portfolio is a key part of our strategy, and it provides another way to capture the local C2C opportunity, which often represents the same customers who are selling items more suited to a local transaction. 
Q3 was another strong quarter of growth for eBay Classifieds, with particular strength in the U.K. and in Germany. And in the U.S., we're investing in our Classifieds mobile app, Close5, and we're seeing significant growth, with nearly 3 million downloads of the app as of the end of the quarter, which is a 10x increase from the end of last quarter. 
StubHub, our tickets vertical, had a particularly strong quarter, getting back to strong growth as the industry-leading secondary ticket marketplace. This strong performance was driven by improvements to our product experience. We continue to see strong overlap between the eBay and the StubHub visitor bases, with 3 in 4 visitors to StubHub also visiting eBay. 
Lastly, we continue to expand StubHub globally in key international markets where we believe the market opportunity is just beginning to hit its stride. In September, we launched StubHub in Germany, which is our second major international market, along with the U.K. 
Finally, we continue to actively manage our investment portfolio. In this quarter, we sold part of our stake in Snapdeal while we organically invested in our fast-growing India platform. And we divested our stake in the China Classifieds business, 
In summary, we delivered solid results in Q3, and we made meaningful progress against our strategy. I look forward to updating you again on our progress, and we'll share our perspective on 2016 in January. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Scott, who'll go into more detail around our financial performance."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10. Our business was stable in Q3 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $462 m",1199,"Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10. Our business was stable in Q3 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $462 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $599 million of our stock.
On Slide 11, let's start at the top of the funnel, with Q3 active buyer growth. In the quarter, we added 2 million new active buyers, increasing the total active buyer base to 159 million, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Underlying this growth was a modest acceleration in our trailing 3-month active buyers. This was driven by the additional investment we made in our India platform, where we saw strong user acquisition in the quarter. 
In addition, the actions that we've taken to reduce friction in the password reset and sign-in process have reduced our existing buyer churn. However, the SEO headwinds continued to impact our ability to acquire new buyers.
Turning to Slide 12. We grew GMV 6% on an FX-neutral basis, consistent with Q2. In the U.S., GMV grew 3%, accelerating 1 point versus prior quarter. This acceleration was driven by the improvements we made to our product experience in StubHub. International GMV grew 7% on an FX-neutral basis, decelerating 1 point quarter-over-quarter. 
While we continue to focus on executing our strategy, this relatively stable growth across our platform continues to be dampened by the challenges of SEO, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacting cross-border trade quarters [ph] and the product changes we believe will benefit our users over the long term.
Sold item growth grew 7% in Q3, representing a 3-point deceleration versus prior quarter. This was driven by a decrease in low ASP purchases this quarter versus last and the impact of fewer new buyers who generally purchased lower ASP items.
Moving to Slide 13. We delivered net revenues of $2.1 billion, up 5% [ph] on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, which negatively impacted total revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 7 points. Transaction revenue grew 4% on an FX-neutral basis, decelerating 1 point versus Q2. The deceleration was driven by investments in additional seller incentive such as eBay Top-rated Seller and DailyDeals programs, which are treated as contra revenue. In Q3, this investment reflects a shift of marketing spend from operating expense so contra revenue. 
Marketing services grew 9% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating 3 points versus the prior quarter, with our Classifieds format contributing to strong results. The PayPal operating agreement was an addition to our MS&O revenue stream this quarter, adding 4 points of growth quarter-over-quarter and approximately 1 point to total revenue growth.
Turning to expenses on Page 14. The cost of revenue increased 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by the impact of foreign exchange and the payment processing costs, which now include the effects of our agreements with PayPal. Additionally, we made investments in our structured data and security efforts, which were paid for by disciplined in other areas. 
Operating expenses were 48.1% of revenue in the quarter, down 67 basis points versus last year. Each cost component benefited from the restructuring we completed earlier this year, but let me provide a bit more context on each. 
Sales and marketing expense is down 230 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by the decreased brand spend and the shift from sales and marketing expense to contra revenue that I mentioned earlier. Product development is relatively flat year-over-year, although we continue to refocus our investments into areas like our new mobile experience and structured data. G&A increased 120 basis points year-over-year, with operating leverage offset by dissynergies due to separation and a stronger U.S. dollar.
Moving to Slide 15. In Q3, we delivered $0.43 in non-GAAP EPS, down 6% year-over-year as revenue growth, good operating leverage and the impact of share repurchases were more than offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Our resulting operating margin was 31.9%, a 90 basis point decline versus prior year, driven by the impact of foreign exchange and dissynergy costs due to separation.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated free cash flow of $462 million in the quarter. CapEx was 12% of revenue, which is higher than our historical trends due to separation-related activities that we discussed last quarter. We expect free cash flow to accelerate in Q4, driven by our seasonal volume peak, lower separation-related CapEx spend and improved working capital performance.
Moving to Slide 17. As a reminder on our Q2 earnings call, I described our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We reiterate, our policy has several key tenets, including focusing on long-term value creation while making sure we have the resources to execute our strategy; driving growth while balancing profitability; supplementing organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments while maximizing the capital deployed in those assets; and managing the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital while both offsetting dilution and reducing share count via opportunistic share repurchases at attractive prices.
Turning to our balance sheet and the implementation of this policy. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and nonequity investments of $8 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. We've repurchased 21.9 million shares at an average price of $27.36 per share. We have $2.4 billion of the existing share repurchase authorization remaining. 
Shortly after the Q2 earnings call, we received an average investment grade rating from the credit agencies of BBB+. In Q3, we had a $250 million -- we had $250 million of debt mature, and in mid-October, we had a $600 million tranche mature, both of which we've repaid. We may seek outside financing to replace 2015 maturities and to provide additional flexibility to manage our capital structure. 
We continue to be disciplined in how we manage our investments. As Devin mentioned, in Q3, we sold a portion of our equity stake in Snapdeal and sold the entirety of our stake in a Shanghai-based Classifieds business. Consistent with prior practice, the gains from the sale of these 2 investments are excluded from our non-GAAP earnings but are reflected in our GAAP results. We also made 2 strategic acquisitions to bring in additional talent to eBay and enhance our Classifieds vertical presence. 
Finally, let me share our guidance on Slide 18. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.275 billion and $2.325 billion, representing 3% to 5% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 to $0.49 per share. For the full year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of 3% to 5% growth on an FX-neutral basis and raising our non-GAAP EPS projection to $1.80 to $1.82 a share, reflecting our Q2 earnings performance, the impact of shares repurchased and a more favorable tax rate. 
In summary, we remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives to reposition eBay for success while delivering on our financial commitments, buying back nearly $600 million of stock and continuing to demonstrate our disciplined approach to capital allocation.

And thus, the underlying core business in the U.S. was stable. To your question on net debt, our current BBB+ rating allows us at a 3x to 3.5x EBITDA multiple to be slightly in a net debt position. And we have no issues with being at that level. And right now, our plan is to -- or continue to assess how we think about our repurchasing our stock price and all of the underlying tenets of the capital allocation aspects that I laid out. I think the most important thing as we look forward is that, that 3x to 3.5x gives us the capacity that we think is necessary to provide the flexibility to do all the elements of long-term value creation that we talked about, drive the growth of the underlying business and give us the flexibility to acquire businesses in a disciplined way that we talked about in the past."

First of all, historically, auctions tended to correlate better with consumer-sold business on eBay. And for several years, that business has grown more slowly than the B2C business. But I think there's something also going on that's more significant than that, which is we've affirmatively moved through our policies and through our format guidance a portion even of the consumer-sold business to fixed-price. So we think that certain categories, we just see better conversion when we move them from an auction to a fixed-price listing. And example might be consumer electronics. So we've made it more favorable from a pricing perspective, and our guidance suggests to consumers that they list the cell phone at a price that we know it will sell at rather than necessarily engaging in an auction, just to give you 1 example. So part of it is we've moved it affirmatively. Part of it is our C2C business is something that, over the last few years as we talked about last quarter, we were very focused on big retail. And now we're coming back to looking at the opportunity in C2C. And I think there's a real opportunity over time to reinvigorate that business, and we might see some tailwinds based on that over time. So those are the 2 components that drive a decline in auctions versus the strength in the fixed-price format. On GMV, I think that roughly, the coverages in the accompanying slides, Carlos. We basically have said that there are 3 parts to what we're doing. Part of it is identifying the product identifiers. We looked at the relevant universe as manufactured items, and manufactured items is roughly 700 million [ph] items out of our inventory. And I think if you look at the slides, you'll see that we've covered a portion of that already with the mandate. And the plan is to roll that out very aggressively over the next, let's call it, 15 months. So the slide to provide more color on the coverage by listings in GMV."

On the first part, I think the 18 months that I refer to was -- there were questions on this structured data initiative, when will it start to make a dent in things like SEO? And when will we be able to see it in traffic and in SEO? And as I said, it isn't -- it doesn't all come at once. It comes as you progress. But I said I thought you'd be able to start to see it in around 18 months, and I still think that's the case. We are making good progress, but the external impact of that, meaning our benefits from SCR, our benefits from traffic from those channels is still relatively limited. And that's why both in my remarks and in the slides, we wanted to clarify that there are a number of steps we need to take. And that's why there's a bit of a gap between asking sellers for the information, processing that data, applying machine learning, putting that in products and marketing channels and then ultimately seeing the results. So I still think that's a fair time frame for us to begin to see benefits in the channels that we mentioned. On the seller policies, it's worth clarifying that when we talk about small and medium sellers, that's really the core of the eBay seller. It doesn't necessarily mean a mom-and-pop. We're very focused on that, but it also means multimillion-dollar businesses, but compared to large retailers, that's a smaller or medium size business. That is clearly our area of focus. I think our policies and the products that we've launched even in the first 90 days are squarely attuned to that segment of our marketplace. What we see is that there's really great energy around there. I'm really pleased with the progress we've made in a relatively short period of time. And I think that the opportunity for us to acquire new sellers, new inventory, differentiated inventory and differentiated sellers is real. I think the eBay brand is unique. I think the eBay -- we don't want to be like anyone else and we don't think that our brand is like anyone else's. And because of that, the ability to acquire unique inventory through unique sellers, both consumers and small and medium-sized businesses, is square in the center of where we're focused. And you'll see us do even more down the balance of this year and certainly into 2016."

So the U.S., as we talked about in the past, has a -- significantly impacted us from the strength of the U.S. dollar, which is heavily weighted on its export basis, on the expert out of the U.S. And as you think about the U.S. dollar strength, that's pushed down the GMV associated with the -- with that product going outside the U.S. If you look at the GMV, which I highlighted last time, it's actually relatively stable. It's at 6% growth in the core U.S. business versus 6% last quarter. And so the -- to your question, the near-term aspects of the things that we're working on are actually relatively muted in those. As we've talked about, it's going to take a fair amount of time for that -- for those -- for the impact of things like structured data and other things to impact the growth. And so in the near term, what the U.S. is facing is the pressure from the SEO, search issues, the associated active buyer growth impact and the FX that we talked about. Internationally, growth is roughly stable, the levels that they are and I would say a couple of things to highlight there. First off, China export continues to be pretty strong and consistent quarter-over-quarter. We've got a great business in India that continues to grow very nicely. And our Korea business continues to do very well and kind of in line with prior quarter growth. In Europe, the impact of SEO, the impact of some of the product changes that had a little bit muted impact on our growth, particularly at the latter part of the quarter, but still in the reasonably close to the range that they were in the prior quarter. And again, they're impacted a bit by foreign exchange and a bit by the aspects of the SEO aspects that we've talked about."

On marketing, let me just start by giving a slight helicopter view of the way we view marketing. Historically, we've been very focused on digital channels and we've been very ROI-driven. And what that's tended to do is drive our marketing spend down the funnel. In other words, we tend to market heavily when we make sales. And that's why we've heavily skewed towards things like paid search and other digital channels. I do think that as some of the market shifts and as more channels are available to us, we need to pivot some of our marketing to the mid-funnel and to the upper funnel. And upper funnel is what we would call brand spend. It's more about eBay than about buying any particular item. We've been working really hard because we don't like to waste money around here and we're very metrics-focused. And as you move from the bottom of the funnel to the top, it gets harder. Frankly, the time frame's extended and it gets harder to measure whether $1 was well spent in brand, and it's easier to measure that if $1 was well spent if you sold something or not. But I still believe that it's necessary. So we are already, particularly in the social channels that I mentioned in my remarks, beginning to move from selling individual items to selling eBay as a brand. And I think that you'll see more of that not only through the holiday but through 2016. I think it's very important for us to say to the world to we are. Some of that is closing some of the misconceptions about our business. I think the brand is ubiquitous but not everyone knows what we do. But some of that is really the sort of emotional connection of the brand, which is not a commodity, it's not a utility, and it's about consumers finding unique items at incredible deals, and that's really where we think north is for our brand. More specifically for this holiday, we'll be very active. Last holiday, we did a bit of TV, not in every DMA but we did some TV in the U.S. and some in Europe. We're not going to do a significant amount of TV this holiday, but we are -- we won't spend less. We're going to be very active in digital channels. And we're operationally ready for this holiday, and we will certainly be active marketing both through promotions and marketing channels for the holiday. So I hope that answered the first part. And I'll turn it to Scott on the capital question."

This quarter, we bought back 21.9 million shares at $27.36, roughly 1.8% of the company [indiscernible]. Now that all said, I think we all -- we talked about this in the past with everyone. There is a bit of a governor over the course of the first 2 years, where we cannot have plans where we'd be buying back more than 20% of the shares of the company. That said, this represents a fairly, I think, clear step of how we think about buybacks for us going forward."

I'm not going to componentize the qualitative side of structured data. But let me just describe it to you and why I think it ultimately has a positive impact on both traffic and on conversion. If you step back at what we're trying to do, what we're trying to do is really understand and associate the products that are on our shelves. We're trying to be able to group products. We're trying to be able to sell products in ways that are not dependent on search alone. We're trying to create better discoverability of products, both on the marketplace and off. If you come back to what we've been saying repeatedly, there might be a faster path to SEO recovery, but this cycle of spin it up and then spin it down is not sustainable. So we're building it on a much more sustainable foundation because ultimately, both SEO and frankly discoverability on eBay are crying for persistence. They're crying for us to understand that just because a listing comes and goes, we're still selling thousands of iPhones or sweaters or shovels or whatever we're selling. So that at the end of the day is why having a persistent view of the products we sell, I believe, is the traffic driver. And it's a conversion driver because ultimately, we have 800 million items for sale. This is the world's biggest store. It can be overwhelming and we're asking too much of search. Search is very important, but for search to be the only lever to pick through 800 million items is becoming not sustainable and ultimately, it causes a reduction in conversion. The ability for us to group items, to merge items, to understand what's the best item out of a lot, to create trade-offs, say between the very unique eBay categories like used, manufacturer, refurbished and new, and allow consumers to understand the value-based trade-offs of all of those choices, is to me endemic to what we're doing in the structured data initiative. So I can't give you a number, but I know that what we're driving at is better traffic and I know that we're driving a better conversion. And that's why it's worth the investment and it's why it's worth this significant shift in what we're doing. Scott will take the second part on take rate."

And if you look at it's up, I think, 10 basis points. We'll get a little bit uplift from the mix of StubHub in that number, but I think the more material shift quarter-on-quarter was what I called out with the contra revenue. And as we look at our overall expense base from marketing, we, as you know, are very disciplined in how we approach the deployment of that marketing spend. And occasionally, we'll move the investment between different buckets within that expense base, and in some cases, shift it from expense to contra revenue, broadly speaking. But things like seller incentives, Daily Deal incentives, even buyer couponing. And it's really dependent on how we see the capabilities of those different marketing channels to be effective and get the best return for us. In this quarter, that did depress revenue growth a little bit, helping some of the underlying aspects of the business in the best way we thought to spend marketing on a go-forward basis. And that's really why you see the differential between the GMV growth rate of about 6% and the transaction revenue growth rate of 4%."

In total for the core business or in the overall business, it was actually relatively stable. I know there were some anxiety around some September data that was out there and I think that depends by geography. Certainly, StubHub had a very strong September. The U.S. had a slightly weaker, as did parts of Europe, a slightly weaker September. And Asia had a strong September. And so I would -- I look at the overall portfolio and go not radically different month to month to month. SEO challenges, there's been no real new SEO challenges for the year. I know there's been a couple of changes around mobile and other things that have been out there, but broadly speaking, we haven't really seen an incremental new impact to our business versus what we've been talking about. I don't know if you want to talk about StubHub, Devin. I think overall, we don't give StubHub numbers, but you want to talk a bit about the changes?"

Some of that was around the way we display pricing changes. Some of that was around a brand campaign, which has now gone bright, and you may see it on during the baseball playoffs or on football games. All of those had an impact. And it was a fairly rapid turnaround of StubHub's performance back to growth, which is great to see. So I think they all contributed."

On the first question, on mobile, let me just reiterate that we're running the company for the long run. And some of the things we're doing are really fundamental. And it tends to be that in marketplace ecosystems like this, fundamental things may not be growth-friendly in the short run but they're important in the mid- to long run. And mobile is one of those. I don't have an exact time frame but you're already seeing the beginning of a recovery. And we watch carefully the ratings are sort of public face of it. Frankly, I care more what millions of people do than what a few people say. But they're both important and the data reflects what people are doing, and we are beginning to see a recovery that it is mirroring what we saw with the iPad launch. That was also a fairly large change. Metrics went down, then they came back up, and of course, they ended stronger than where we started. So that's the hope with what we're doing here, and we'll watch it carefully and adjust as we go. We're constantly looking at that data and listening to customers and we'll respond to it rapidly. Is it a slight drag on growth? Yes, it is, globally, as is frankly adding the requirement on structured data and a few other things. These are all things that are not necessarily growth-friendly in the short run but important for us to do in the long run. So there's no doubt there's some impact in there. On the second question, the answer is yes. Again, we watch the data carefully. If you look at things like our slides, where you see us deploying structured data, where you see -- and it is very small right now. You are seeing improvement in our rankings. You're seeing some traffic flowing, and you're seeing some conversion to the benefits being picked up. So that gives us comfort that we're on the right track.

And those include things like, over the last several months, providing security -- much more robust security questions, allowing for text messaging to allow quick retrieval of a sign-in code and then having users be able to remain signed in for a period of time. There's a number of other smaller things but have the impact of doing is actually reducing the churn of our existing user base.

And that's one of the ways that we think about using contra to go after them in the form of couponing as well as direct marketing on e-mails, et cetera.

Overall, we had a solid quarter, marked by FX-neutral GMV and revenue growth of 6% and 5%, respectively, both consistent with last quarter. Our performance 1 quarter following our spinoff of PayPal is steady, and it's in line with our expectations. I'm proud that the team was able to remain focused on executing our strategy while managing a complex separation. 
We still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to reposition our business and to deliver the level of performance that we aspire to achieve, but our Q3 results are a step in the right direction. When we spoke to you in July, we outlined our strategy to improve eBay's competitive position and drive stable and profitable long-term growth. We said that we'd build a more robust commerce platform, enhance our engagement with the core buyers and sellers who create a vibrant marketplace and create exceptional product and brand experiences. 
We also indicated that our efforts would take time as we traded off short-term growth and focus more on long-term investments, while dealing with the impact of near-term headwinds. And finally, we said that we'd be vigilant about our portfolio, and we'd be disciplined about allocating capital to drive value. This quarter, we drove hard to make progress on that strategy. Simply put, we're doing what we said we would do, and we have confidence in our plans going forward.
Now let me share some of the progress that we made in this quarter. First, as I discussed during the Q2 earnings call, our efforts to deliver a more robust commerce platform will be built on a solid foundation of structured data. And while this is a longer-term effort, we are making progress. 
I'll spend a moment to share some more context on our structured data initiative, including a few slides that accompany my commentary. There are 3 key efforts underway: first, we're collecting product data from our sellers as they list their inventory on our site. On June 29, we started requiring product information from our sellers across 18 categories in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Australia. We've seen positive reception and adoption in line with our expectations, with limited disruption to the listing process. The next phase will add coverage to more countries and categories, and our plan is to expand the requirement, where relevant, across all sites and categories by the end of 2016. 
Second, we use machine learning to process that data so that we can leverage it in our user experiences. Getting a product identifier is most useful to us after we associate that product information to similar products in our catalog and bring in additional data related to the product such as descriptions, pictures and reviews. In the roughly 12 weeks since we launched this initiative, 27 million more listings have been successfully mapped to products, and 5 million new products have been identified and added to our catalog. 
And finally, we're leveraging that data to improve our product and marketing experiences. We've already started using this data in several areas of the user experience such as SEO, merchandising, deals and our selling flows. We've provided a few examples of how we're using the data in the slides that accompany this call. While this is an encouraging start, these efforts are in the early stages, and we'll continue to share more on our progress along the way.
A robust commerce platform also means diversified sources of traffic and user acquisition. Along these lines, we continue to expand our use of social channels, and traffic from these channels saw significant growth in Q3. We're now consistently leveraging 10 unique social channels on a regular basis. 
Our second key strategic priority is to create a vibrant marketplace. In September, we celebrated our 20th anniversary, and we hosted a seller conference, which included many eBay-only sellers in San Jose. At that time, we announced a number of significant upcoming changes to our seller policies. These changes, which include more objective standards, are intended to help small- and medium-sized sellers be more successful on our platform and better reward sellers who provide great service to eBay buyers. 
We're also giving sellers the ability to customize how they manage returns based on their specific business needs, with as much or as little involvement from eBay as they choose. Finally, we launched a new product called Seller Hub, which puts a seller's listing and marketing tools, along with deep data insights and selling recommendations into one central place. It's a new destination for professional sellers to manage their end-to-end business on eBay. 
I was extremely energized by the engagement from the sellers I met, and I've been encouraged by the industry response to the changes that we announced. We're also investing in areas designed to drive more engagement from our consumer sellers. For example, we're growing our intermediated selling service, eBay Valet, where we're seeing significant growth. Of note, nearly 1/3 of Valet consignments come from repeat customers. And a majority of Valet customers progress to buying and selling on their own on eBay. 
At the same time, we're ramping up our efforts to drive buyer velocity. For example, in Germany, we recently launched a pilot program called eBay Plus. This offering enables German consumers, in exchange for a low annual fee, to enjoy free expedited shipping, free returns, and it may include access to exclusive deals and promotions over time. The intent of the program is to reach more consumers and increase loyalty in this key market, where consumers have long valued free shipping and returns, and the geography can support this type of program. We'll also promote within this subscription the ability for consumers to sell without fees, hence driving not only buying velocity but also the unique eBay sell-to-buy flywheel. 
Our third key strategic pillar is to create exceptional product and brand experiences. In September, we launched a new experience across all of our mobile channels. The launch of our new mobile product marks a shift towards a discovery-based experience for buyers that also enhances our simplified mobile selling experience. And it brings in key functionality from several of the vertical-based apps, which we decommissioned in Q3. 
With this release, we've also unified the mobile experience across platforms, which enables a consistent user interface and is already resulting in faster product iteration. This is an important part of our long-term strategy. We believe that moving in this direction with our product will enable us to drive engagement and cross-category purchasing. It's also a better expression of our brand, which stands for discovery and the thrill of finding unique items and incredible deals. We believe this experience will ultimately help eBay become a more differentiated and a more personal commerce destination. 
With the knowledge that we're making a very substantial change to the ecosystem and based on our experience when we launched the new iPad app last fall, we expected to see and we did see some disruption following the launch. To date, both the data and the reviews on our new mobile experience are following what we believe is a similar path to what we saw after the iPad launch, which was last fall, which was an initial dip, followed by a strong recovery. You can expect us to launch a series of incremental releases in response to user feedback over the coming weeks and months. Despite this, the percentage of GMV that closed on mobile still increased to 42% in the quarter, up 1% from last. 
Now let me briefly touch on 2 of our adjacent platforms that are great complements to our core, Classifieds and StubHub. Our Classifieds portfolio is a key part of our strategy, and it provides another way to capture the local C2C opportunity, which often represents the same customers who are selling items more suited to a local transaction. 
Q3 was another strong quarter of growth for eBay Classifieds, with particular strength in the U.K. and in Germany. And in the U.S., we're investing in our Classifieds mobile app, Close5, and we're seeing significant growth, with nearly 3 million downloads of the app as of the end of the quarter, which is a 10x increase from the end of last quarter. 
StubHub, our tickets vertical, had a particularly strong quarter, getting back to strong growth as the industry-leading secondary ticket marketplace. This strong performance was driven by improvements to our product experience. We continue to see strong overlap between the eBay and the StubHub visitor bases, with 3 in 4 visitors to StubHub also visiting eBay. 
Lastly, we continue to expand StubHub globally in key international markets where we believe the market opportunity is just beginning to hit its stride. In September, we launched StubHub in Germany, which is our second major international market, along with the U.K. 
Finally, we continue to actively manage our investment portfolio. In this quarter, we sold part of our stake in Snapdeal while we organically invested in our fast-growing India platform. And we divested our stake in the China Classifieds business, Baixing. 
In summary, we delivered solid results in Q3, and we made meaningful progress against our strategy. I look forward to updating you again on our progress, and we'll share our perspective on 2016 in January. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Scott, who'll go into more detail around our financial performance."

We generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $462 m",1205,"Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10. Our business was stable in Q3 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $462 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $599 million of our stock.
On Slide 11, let's start at the top of the funnel, with Q3 active buyer growth. In the quarter, we added 2 million new active buyers, increasing the total active buyer base to 159 million, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Underlying this growth was a modest acceleration in our trailing 3-month active buyers. This was driven by the additional investment we made in our India platform, where we saw strong user acquisition in the quarter. 
In addition, the action that we've taken to reduce friction in the password reset and sign-in process have reduced our existing buyer churn. However, the SEO headwinds continued to impact our ability to acquire new buyers.
Turning to Slide 12. We grew GMV 6% on an FX-neutral basis, consistent with Q2. In the U.S., GMV grew 3%, accelerating 1 point versus prior quarter. This acceleration was driven by the improvements we made to our product experience in StubHub. International GMV grew 7% on an FX-neutral basis, decelerating 1 point quarter-over-quarter. 
While we continue to focus on executing our strategy, this relatively stable growth across our platform continues to be dampened by the challenges of SEO, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacting cross-border trade quarters and the product changes we believe will benefit our users over the long term.
Sold item growth -- grew 7% in Q3, representing a 3-point deceleration versus prior quarter. This was driven by a decrease in low ASP purchases this quarter versus last and the impact of fewer new buyers who generally purchase lower ASP items.
Moving to Slide 13. We delivered net revenues of $2.1 billion, up 5% on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, which negatively impacted total revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 7 points. Transaction revenue grew 4% on an FX-neutral basis, decelerating 1 point versus Q2. The deceleration was driven by investments in additional seller incentives such as eBay top-rated Seller and DailyDeals programs, which are treated as contra revenue. In Q3, this investment reflects a shift of marketing spend from operating expense to contra revenue. 
Marketing services grew 9% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating 3 points versus the prior quarter, with our Classifieds format contributing to strong results. The PayPal operating agreement was an addition to our MS&O revenue stream this quarter, adding 4 points of growth quarter-over-quarter and approximately 1 point to total revenue growth.
Turning to expenses on Page 14. The cost of revenue increased 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by the impact of foreign exchange and the payment processing costs, which now include the effects of our agreements with PayPal. Additionally, we made investments in our structured data and security efforts, which were paid by -- paid for by disciplined prioritization in other areas. 
Operating expenses were 48.1% of revenue in the quarter, down 67 basis points versus last year. Each cost component benefited from the restructuring we completed earlier this year, but let me provide a bit more context on each. 
Sales and marketing expense is down 230 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by the decreased brand spend and the shift from sales and marketing expense to contra revenue that I mentioned earlier. Product development is relatively flat year-over-year, although we continue to refocus our investments into areas like our new mobile experience and structured data. G&A increased 120 basis points year-over-year, with operating leverage offset by dissynergies due to separation and a stronger U.S. dollar.
Moving to Slide 15. In Q3, we delivered $0.43 in non-GAAP EPS, down 6% year-over-year as revenue growth, good operating leverage and the impact of share repurchases were more than offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Our resulting operating margin was 31.9%, a 90 basis point decline versus prior year, driven by the impact of foreign exchange and dissynergy costs due to separation.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated free cash flow of $462 million in the quarter. CapEx was 12% of revenue, which is higher than our historical trends due to separation-related activities that we discussed last quarter. We expect free cash flow to accelerate in Q4, driven by our seasonal volume peak, lower separation-related CapEx spend and improved working capital performance.
Moving to Slide 17. As a reminder on our Q2 earnings call, I described our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We reiterate, our policy has several key tenets, including focusing on long-term value creation while making sure we have the resources to execute our strategy; driving growth while balancing profitability; supplementing organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments while maximizing the capital deployed in those assets; and managing the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital, while both offsetting dilution and reducing share count via opportunistic share repurchases at attractive prices.
Turning to our balance sheet and the implementation of this policy. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and nonequity investments of $8 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. We've repurchased 21.9 million shares at an average price of $27.36 per share. We have $2.4 billion of the existing share repurchase authorization remaining. 
Shortly after the Q2 earnings call, we received an average investment grade rating from the credit agencies of BBB+. In Q3, we had a $250 million -- we had $250 million of debt mature, and in mid-October, we had a $600 million tranche mature, both of which we've repaid. We may seek outside financing to replace 2015 maturities and to provide additional flexibility to manage our capital structure. 
We continue to be disciplined in how we manage our investments. As Devin mentioned, in Q3, we sold a portion of our equity stake in Snapdeal and sold the entirety of our stake in Baixing, a Shanghai-based Classifieds business. Consistent with prior practice, the gains from the sale of these 2 investments are excluded from our non-GAAP earnings but are reflected in our GAAP results. We also made 2 strategic acquisitions to bring in additional tech and talent to eBay and enhance our Classifieds vertical presence. 
Finally, let me share our guidance on Slide 18. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.275 billion and $2.325 billion, representing 3% to 5% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 to $0.49 per share. For the full year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of 3% to 5% growth on an FX-neutral basis and raising our non-GAAP EPS projection to $1.80 to $1.82 a share, reflecting our Q2 earnings performance, the impact of shares repurchased and a more favorable tax rate. 
In summary, we remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives to reposition eBay for success while delivering on our financial commitments, buying back nearly $600 million of stock and continuing to demonstrate our disciplined approach to capital allocation.

So starting first with fixed-price versus auction. I think there's a couple of things going on. First of all, historically, auctions tended to correlate better with the consumer-sold business on eBay. And for several years, that business has grown more slowly than the B2C business. But I think there's something also going on that's more significant than that, which is we've affirmatively moved through our policies and through our format guidance a portion even of the consumer-sold business to fixed price. So we think that certain categories, we just see better conversion when we move them from an auction to a fixed-price listing. An example might be consumer electronics. So we've made it more favorable from a pricing perspective, and our guidance suggests to consumers that they list the cell phone at a price that we know it will sell at rather than necessarily engaging in an auction, just to give you one example. So part of it is we've moved it affirmatively. Part of it is our C2C business is something that, over the last few years as we talked about last quarter, we were very focused on big retail. And now we're coming back to looking at the opportunity in C2C. And I think there's a real opportunity over time to reinvigorate that business, and we might see some tailwinds based on that over time. So those are the 2 components that drive the decline in auctions versus the strength in the fixed-price format. On GMV, I think that roughly, the coverages in the accompanying slides, Carlos, we basically have said that there are 3 parts to what we're doing. Part of it is identifying the product identifiers. We look at the relevant universe as manufactured items, and manufactured items is roughly 700 million items out of our inventory. And I think if you look at the slides, you'll see that we've covered a portion of that already with the mandate. And the plan is to roll that out very aggressively over the next, let's call it, 15 months. So the slide ought to provide more color on the coverage by listings in GMV."

On the first part, I think the 18 months that I referred to was -- there were questions on this structured data initiative, when will it start to make a dent in things like SEO? And when will we be able to see it in traffic and in SEO? And as I said, it isn't -- it doesn't all come at once. It comes as you progress. But I said I thought you'd be able to start to see it in around 18 months, and I still think that's the case. We are making good progress, but the external impact of that, meaning our benefits from SCR, our benefits from traffic from those channels is still relatively limited. And that's why both in my remarks and in the slides, we wanted to clarify that there are a number of steps we need to take. And that's why there's a bit of a gap between asking sellers for the information, processing that data, applying machine learning, putting that in products and marketing channels and then ultimately seeing the results. So I still think that's a fair time frame for us to begin to see benefits in the channels that we mentioned. On the seller policies, it's worth clarifying that when we talk about small and medium sellers, that's really the core of the eBay seller. It doesn't necessarily mean a mom-and-pop. We're very focused on that, but it also means multimillion-dollar businesses, but compared to large retailers, that's a smaller or medium-sized business. That is clearly our area of focus. I think our policies and the products that we've launched even in the first 90 days are squarely attuned to that segment of our marketplace. What we see is that there's really great energy around there. I'm really pleased with the progress we've made in a relatively short period of time. And I think that the opportunity for us to acquire new sellers, new inventory, differentiated inventory and differentiated sellers is real. I think the eBay brand is unique. I think the eBay -- we don't want to be like anyone else, and we don't think that our brand is like anyone else's. And because of that, the ability to acquire unique inventory through unique sellers, both consumers and small and medium-sized businesses, is square in the center of where we're focused. And you'll see us do even more down the balance of this year and certainly into 2016."

First off, backing up on the U.S. growth. So the U.S., as we talked about in the past, has a significantly impacted aspect of it from the strength of the U.S. dollar, which is heavily weighted on its export basis, on the export out of the U.S. And as you think about the U.S. dollar strength, that's pushed down the GMV associated with the -- with that product going outside of the U.S. If you look at the GMV, which I highlighted last time, it's actually relatively stable. It's at 6% growth in the core U.S. business versus 6% last quarter. And so the -- to your question, the near-term aspects of the things that we're working on are actually relatively muted in those. As we've talked about, it's going to take a fair amount of time for that -- for those -- for the impact of things like structured data and other things to impact the growth. And so in the near term, what the U.S. is facing is the pressure from the SEO, search issues, the associated active buyer growth impact and the FX that we talked about. Internationally, growth is roughly stable at the levels that they are and I would say a couple of things to highlight there. First off, China export continues to be pretty strong and consistent quarter-over-quarter. We've got a great business in India that continues to grow very nicely. And our Korea business continues to do very well and kind of in line with prior quarter growth. In Europe, the impact of SEO, the impact of some of the product changes have had a little bit muted impact on our growth, particularly at the latter part of the quarter, but still in the reasonably close to the range that they were in the prior quarter. And again, they're impacted a bit by foreign exchange and a bit by the aspects of the SEO aspects that we've talked about."

On marketing, let me just start by giving a slight helicopter view of the way we view marketing. Historically, we've been very focused on digital channels and we've been very ROI-driven. And what that's tended to do is drive our marketing spend down the funnel. In other words, we tend to market heavily when we make sales. And that's why we've heavily skewed towards things like paid search and other digital channels. I do think that as some of the market shifts and as more channels are available to us, we need to pivot some of our marketing to the mid-funnel and to the upper funnel. And upper funnel is what we would call brand spend. It's more about eBay than about buying any particular item. We've been working really hard because we don't like to waste money around here, and we're very metrics-focused. And as you move from the bottom of the funnel to the top, it gets harder. Frankly, the time frame's extend and it gets harder to measure whether $1 was well spent in brand, and it's easier to measure that if $1 was well spent if you sold something or not. But I still believe that it's necessary. So we are already, particularly in the social channels that I mentioned in my remarks, beginning to move from selling individual items to selling eBay as a brand. And I think that you'll see more of that not only through the holiday but through 2016. I think it's very important for us to say to the world who we are. Some of that is closing some of the misconceptions about our business. I think the brand is ubiquitous, but not everyone knows what we do. But some of that is really the sort of emotional connection of the brand, which is not a commodity, it's not a utility, and it's about consumers finding unique items and incredible deals, and that's really where we think north is for our brand. More specifically for this holiday, we'll be very active. Last holiday, we did a bit of TV, not in every DMA but we did some TV in the U.S. and some in Europe. We're not going to do a significant amount of TV this holiday, but we are -- we won't spend less. We're going to be very active in digital channels. And we're operationally ready for this holiday, and we will certainly be active marketing both through promotions and marketing channels for the holiday. So I hope that answered the first part. And I'll turn it to Scott on the capital question."

I'm not going to componentize the qualitative side of structured data. But let me just describe it to you and why I think it ultimately has a positive impact on both traffic and on conversion. If we step back at what we're trying to do, what we're trying to do is really understand and associate the products that are on our shelves. We're trying to be able to group products. We're trying to be able to sell products in ways that are not dependent on search alone. We're trying to create better discoverability of products, both on the marketplace and off. If you come back to what we've been saying repeatedly, there might be a faster path to SEO recovery, but this cycle of spin it up and then spin it down is not sustainable. So we're building it on a much more sustainable foundation because ultimately, both SEO and frankly discoverability on eBay are crying for persistence. They're crying for us to understand that just because a listing comes and goes, we're still selling thousands of iPhones or sweaters or shovels or whatever we're selling. So that at the end of the day is why having a persistent view of the products we sell, I believe, is the traffic driver. And it's a conversion driver because ultimately, we have 800 million items for sale. This is the world's biggest store. It can be overwhelming, and we're asking too much of search. Search is very important, but for search to be the only lever to pick through 800 million items is becoming not sustainable and ultimately, it causes a reduction in conversion. The ability for us to group items, to merge items, to understand what's the best item out of a lot, to create trade-offs, say between the very unique eBay categories like used, manufacturer refurbished and new, and allow consumers to understand the value-based trade-offs of all of those choices, is to me endemic to what we're doing in the structured data initiative. So I can't give you a number, but I know that what we're driving at is better traffic and I know that we're driving a better conversion. And that's why it's worth the investment and it's why it's worth this significant shift in what we're doing. Scott will take the second part on take rate."

And if you look at -- it's up, I think, 10 basis points. We'll get a little bit of uplift from the mix of StubHub in that number, but I think the more material shift quarter-on-quarter was what I called out with the contra revenue. And as we look at our overall expense base from marketing, we, as you know, are very disciplined in how we approach the deployment of that marketing spend. And occasionally, we'll move the investment between different buckets within that expense base, and in some cases, shift it from expense to contra revenue, broadly speaking. But things like seller incentives, DailyDeal incentives, even to the extent of buyer couponing, and it's really dependent on how we see the capabilities of those different marketing channels to be effective and get the best return for us. In this quarter, that did depress revenue growth a little bit, helping some of the underlying aspects of the business in the best way we thought to spend marketing on a go-forward basis. And that's really why you see the differential between the GMV growth rate of about 6% and the transaction revenue growth rate of 4%."

But the markets that we operate in, we have leading and winning positions in nearly all of them other than where we have seeds planted where we believe we can win. If we are not -- if we're in a market where we believe that we are not going to win or there's not a clear path to winning, then we'll exit that market and reallocate that investment to an area that we can. Our Classifieds portfolio, we have a great playbook, a team that really knows what they're doing. We've shown that we can grow and build this business. At times, we use the balance sheet. There was a small Classifieds acquisition this quarter. And it's been a great business for us that we'll continue to move into. An example that I mentioned of a competitive battleground is the U.S. Obviously, it's an enormous potential market, but what we see is that the Classifieds space in the U.S. has been thrown up for grabs. And it's a very big market opportunity. And we think we've got a winning proposition with Close5. It is growing very, very rapidly. And we'll continue to allocate resource for markets where we're not going to win into markets where we have a plausible chance of winning. We won't win in every market, but that's the way we look at the portfolio. On the consumer, we see the same data that you do. We know there've been a number of consumer companies that have been cautious about the fourth quarter. Obviously, our guidance implies stability. But we're -- I guess we're a bit cautious about it too only because we see some of the data points on GDP, on jobs and on what other companies have said, so we're watching it carefully.

And it tends to be that in marketplace ecosystems like this, fundamental things may not be growth-friendly in the short run but they're important in the mid- to long run. And mobile is one of those. I don't have an exact time frame, but you're already seeing the beginning of a recovery. And we watch carefully. The ratings are sort of public face of it. I -- frankly, I care more what millions of people do than what a few people say. But they're both important, and the data reflects what people are doing, and we are beginning to see a recovery. And it is mirroring what we saw with the iPad launch. That was also a fairly large change. Metrics went down, then they came back up, and of course, they ended stronger than where we started.

Yes, it is, globally, as is frankly adding the requirement on structured data and a few other things.

On the second question, the answer is yes. Again, we watch the data carefully. If you look at things like our slides, where you see us deploying structured data, where you see -- and it is very small right now. You are seeing improvement in our rankings.

Welcome to our Q3 earnings call. Overall, we had a solid quarter, marked by FX-neutral GMV and revenue growth of 6% and 5%, respectively, both consistent with last quarter. Our performance 1 quarter followin",1578,"Selim, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 earnings call. Overall, we had a solid quarter, marked by FX-neutral GMV and revenue growth of 6% and 5%, respectively, both consistent with last quarter. Our performance 1 quarter following our spinoff of PayPal is steady, and it's in line with our expectations. I'm proud that the team was able to remain focused on executing our strategy while managing a complex separation. 
We still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to reposition our business and to deliver the level of performance that we aspire to achieve, but our Q3 results are a step in the right direction. When we spoke to you in July, we outlined our strategy to improve eBay's competitive position and drive stable and profitable long-term growth. We said that we'd build a more robust commerce platform, enhance our engagement with the core buyers and sellers who create a vibrant marketplace and create exceptional product and brand experiences. 
We also indicated that our efforts would take time as we traded off short-term growth and focus more on long-term investments, while dealing with the impact of near-term headwinds. And finally, we said that we'd be vigilant about our portfolio, and we'd be disciplined about allocating capital to drive value. This quarter, we drove hard to make progress on that strategy. Simply put, we're doing what we said we would do, and we have confidence in our plans going forward.
Now let me share some of the progress that we made in this quarter. First, as I discussed during the Q2 earnings call, our efforts to deliver a more robust commerce platform will be built on a solid foundation of structured data. And while this is a longer-term effort, we are making progress. 
I'll spend a moment to share some more context on our structured data initiative, including a few slides that accompany my commentary. There are 3 key efforts underway: first, we're collecting product data from our sellers as they list their inventory on our site. On June 29, we started requiring product information from our sellers across 18 categories in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Australia. We've seen positive reception and adoption in line with our expectations, with limited disruption to the listing process. The next phase will add coverage to more countries and categories, and our plan is to expand the requirement, where relevant, across all sites and categories by the end of 2016. 
Second, we use machine learning to process that data so that we can leverage it in our user experiences. Getting a product identifier is most useful to us after we associate that product information to similar products in our catalog and bring in additional data related to the product such as descriptions, pictures and reviews. In the roughly 12 weeks since we launched this initiative, 27 million more listings have been successfully mapped to products, and 5 million new products have been identified and added to our catalog. 
And finally, we're leveraging that data to improve our product and marketing experiences. We've already started using this data in several areas of the user experience such as SEO, merchandising, deals and our selling flows. We've provided a few examples of how we're using the data in the slides that accompany this call. While this is an encouraging start, these efforts are in the early stages, and we'll continue to share more on our progress along the way.
A robust commerce platform also means diversified sources of traffic and user acquisition. Along these lines, we continue to expand our use of social channels, and traffic from these channels saw significant growth in Q3. We're now consistently leveraging 10 unique social channels on a regular basis. 
Our second key strategic priority is to create a vibrant marketplace. In September, we celebrated our 20th anniversary, and we hosted a seller conference, which included many eBay-only sellers in San Jose. At that time, we announced a number of significant upcoming changes to our seller policies. These changes, which include more objective standards, are intended to help small- and medium-sized sellers be more successful on our platform and better reward sellers who provide great service to eBay buyers. 
We're also giving sellers the ability to customize how they manage returns based on their specific business needs, with as much or as little involvement from eBay as they choose. Finally, we launched a new product called Seller Hub, which puts a seller's listing and marketing tools, along with deep data insights and selling recommendations into one central place. It's a new destination for professional sellers to manage their end-to-end business on eBay. 
I was extremely energized by the engagement from the sellers I met, and I've been encouraged by the industry response to the changes that we announced. We're also investing in areas designed to drive more engagement from our consumer sellers. For example, we're growing our intermediated selling service, eBay Valet, where we're seeing significant growth. Of note, nearly 1/3 of Valet consignments come from repeat customers. And a majority of Valet customers progress to buying and selling on their own on eBay. 
At the same time, we're ramping up our efforts to drive buyer velocity. For example, in Germany, we recently launched a pilot program called eBay Plus. This offering enables German consumers, in exchange for a low annual fee, to enjoy free expedited shipping, free returns, and it may include access to exclusive deals and promotions over time. The intent of the program is to reach more consumers and increase loyalty in this key market, where consumers have long valued free shipping and returns, and the geography can support this type of program. We'll also promote within this subscription the ability for consumers to sell without fees, hence driving not only buying velocity but also the unique eBay sell-to-buy flywheel. 
Our third key strategic pillar is to create exceptional product and brand experiences. In September, we launched a new experience across all of our mobile channels. The launch of our new mobile product marks a shift towards a discovery-based experience for buyers that also enhances our simplified mobile selling experience. And it brings in key functionality from several of the vertical-based apps, which we decommissioned in Q3. 
With this release, we've also unified the mobile experience across platforms, which enables a consistent user interface and is already resulting in faster product iteration. This is an important part of our long-term strategy. We believe that moving in this direction with our product will enable us to drive engagement and cross-category purchasing. It's also a better expression of our brand, which stands for discovery and the thrill of finding unique items and incredible deals. We believe this experience will ultimately help eBay become a more differentiated and a more personal commerce destination. 
With the knowledge that we're making a very substantial change to the ecosystem and based on our experience when we launched the new iPad app last fall, we expected to see and we did see some disruption following the launch. To date, both the data and the reviews on our new mobile experience are following what we believe is a similar path to what we saw after the iPad launch, which was last fall, which was an initial dip, followed by a strong recovery. You can expect us to launch a series of incremental releases in response to user feedback over the coming weeks and months. Despite this, the percentage of GMV that closed on mobile still increased to 42% in the quarter, up 1% from last. 
Now let me briefly touch on 2 of our adjacent platforms that are great complements to our core, Classifieds and StubHub. Our Classifieds portfolio is a key part of our strategy, and it provides another way to capture the local C2C opportunity, which often represents the same customers who are selling items more suited to a local transaction. 
Q3 was another strong quarter of growth for eBay Classifieds, with particular strength in the U.K. and in Germany. And in the U.S., we're investing in our Classifieds mobile app, Close5, and we're seeing significant growth, with nearly 3 million downloads of the app as of the end of the quarter, which is a 10x increase from the end of last quarter. 
StubHub, our tickets vertical, had a particularly strong quarter, getting back to strong growth as the industry-leading secondary ticket marketplace. This strong performance was driven by improvements to our product experience. We continue to see strong overlap between the eBay and the StubHub visitor bases, with 3 in 4 visitors to StubHub also visiting eBay. 
Lastly, we continue to expand StubHub globally in key international markets where we believe the market opportunity is just beginning to hit its stride. In September, we launched StubHub in Germany, which is our second major international market, along with the U.K. 
Finally, we continue to actively manage our investment portfolio. In this quarter, we sold part of our stake in Snapdeal while we organically invested in our fast-growing India platform. And we divested our stake in the China Classifieds business, Baixing. 
In summary, we delivered solid results in Q3, and we made meaningful progress against our strategy. I look forward to updating you again on our progress, and we'll share our perspective on 2016 in January. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Scott, who'll go into more detail around our financial performance."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10. Our business was stable in Q3 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $462 m",1203,"Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10. Our business was stable in Q3 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $462 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $599 million of our stock.
On Slide 11, let's start at the top of the funnel, with Q3 active buyer growth. In the quarter, we added 2 million new active buyers, increasing the total active buyer base to 159 million, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Underlying this growth was a modest acceleration in our trailing 3-month active buyers. This was driven by the additional investment we made in our India platform, where we saw strong user acquisition in the quarter. 
In addition, the action that we've taken to reduce friction in the password reset and sign-in process have reduced our existing buyer churn. However, the SEO headwinds continued to impact our ability to acquire new buyers.
Turning to Slide 12. We grew GMV 6% on an FX-neutral basis, consistent with Q2. In the U.S., GMV grew 3%, accelerating 1 point versus prior quarter. This acceleration was driven by the improvements we made to our product experience in StubHub. International GMV grew 7% on an FX-neutral basis, decelerating 1 point quarter-over-quarter. 
While we continue to focus on executing our strategy, this relatively stable growth across our platform continues to be dampened by the challenges of SEO, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacting cross-border trade quarters and the product changes we believe will benefit our users over the long term.
Sold item growth grew 7% in Q3, representing a 3-point deceleration versus prior quarter. This was driven by a decrease in low ASP purchases this quarter versus last and the impact of fewer new buyers who generally purchase lower ASP items.
Moving to Slide 13. We delivered net revenues of $2.1 billion, up 5% on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, which negatively impacted total revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 7 points. Transaction revenue grew 4% on an FX-neutral basis, decelerating 1 point versus Q2. The deceleration was driven by investments in additional seller incentives such as eBay top-rated Seller and DailyDeals programs, which are treated as contra revenue. In Q3, this investment reflects a shift of marketing spend from operating expense to contra revenue. 
Marketing services grew 9% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating 3 points versus the prior quarter, with our Classifieds format contributing to strong results. The PayPal operating agreement was an addition to our MS&O revenue stream this quarter, adding 4 points of growth quarter-over-quarter and approximately 1 point to total revenue growth.
Turning to expenses on Page 14. The cost of revenue increased 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by the impact of foreign exchange and the payment processing costs, which now include the effects of our agreements with PayPal. Additionally, we made investments in our structured data and security efforts, which were paid by -- paid for by disciplined prioritization in other areas. 
Operating expenses were 48.1% of revenue in the quarter, down 67 basis points versus last year. Each cost component benefited from the restructuring we completed earlier this year, but let me provide a bit more context on each. 
Sales and marketing expense is down 230 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by the decreased brand spend and the shift from sales and marketing expense to contra revenue that I mentioned earlier. Product development is relatively flat year-over-year, although we continue to refocus our investments into areas like our new mobile experience and structured data. G&A increased 120 basis points year-over-year, with operating leverage offset by dis-synergies due to separation and a stronger U.S. dollar.
Moving to Slide 15. In Q3, we delivered $0.43 in non-GAAP EPS, down 6% year-over-year as revenue growth, good operating leverage and the impact of share repurchases were more than offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Our resulting operating margin was 31.9%, a 90 basis point decline versus prior year, driven by the impact of foreign exchange and dis-synergy costs due to separation.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated free cash flow of $462 million in the quarter. CapEx was 12% of revenue, which is higher than our historical trends due to separation-related activities that we discussed last quarter. We expect free cash flow to accelerate in Q4, driven by our seasonal volume peak, lower separation-related CapEx spend and improved working capital performance.
Moving to Slide 17. As a reminder on our Q2 earnings call, I described our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We reiterate, our policy has several key tenets, including focusing on long-term value creation while making sure we have the resources to execute our strategy; driving growth while balancing profitability; supplementing organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments while maximizing the capital deployed in those assets; and managing the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital, while both offsetting dilution and reducing share count via opportunistic share repurchases at attractive prices.
Turning to our balance sheet and the implementation of this policy. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and nonequity investments of $8 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. We've repurchased 21.9 million shares at an average price of $27.36 per share. We have $2.4 billion of the existing share repurchase authorization remaining. 
Shortly after the Q2 earnings call, we received an average investment grade rating from the credit agencies of BBB+. In Q3, we had a $250 million -- we had $250 million of debt mature, and in mid-October, we had a $600 million tranche mature, both of which we've repaid. We may seek outside financing to replace 2015 maturities and to provide additional flexibility to manage our capital structure. 
We continue to be disciplined in how we manage our investments. As Devin mentioned, in Q3, we sold a portion of our equity stake in Snapdeal and sold the entirety of our stake in Baixing, a Shanghai-based Classifieds business. Consistent with prior practice, the gains from the sale of these 2 investments are excluded from our non-GAAP earnings but are reflected in our GAAP results. We also made 2 strategic acquisitions to bring in additional tech and talent to eBay and enhance our Classifieds vertical presence. 
Finally, let me share our guidance on Slide 18. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.275 billion and $2.325 billion, representing 3% to 5% revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 to $0.49 per share. For the full year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of 3% to 5% growth on an FX-neutral basis and raising our non-GAAP EPS projection to $1.80 to $1.82 a share, reflecting our Q2 earnings performance, the impact of shares repurchased and a more favorable tax rate. 
In summary, we remain focused on our strategy and executing our key initiatives to reposition eBay for success while delivering on our financial commitments, buying back nearly $600 million of stock and continuing to demonstrate our disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
And now we'd be happy to answer your questions."

So starting first with fixed-price versus auction. I think there's a couple of things going on. First of all, historically, auctions tended to correlate better with the consumer-sold business on eBay. And for several years, that business has grown more slowly than the B2C business. But I think there's something also going on that's more significant than that, which is we've affirmatively moved through our policies and through our format guidance a portion even of the consumer-sold business to fixed price. So we think that certain categories, we just see better conversion when we move them from an auction to a fixed-price listing. An example might be consumer electronics. So we've made it more favorable from a pricing perspective, and our guidance suggests to consumers that they list the cell phone at a price that we know it will sell at rather than necessarily engaging in an auction, just to give you one example. So part of it is we've moved it affirmatively. Part of it is our C2C business is something that, over the last few years as we talked about last quarter, we were very focused on big retail. And now we're coming back to looking at the opportunity in C2C. And I think there's a real opportunity over time to reinvigorate that business, and we might see some tailwinds based on that over time. So those are the 2 components that drive the decline in auctions versus the strength in the fixed-price format. On GMV, I think that roughly, the coverages in the accompanying slides, Carlos, we basically have said that there are 3 parts to what we're doing. Part of it is identifying the product identifiers. We look at the relevant universe as manufactured items, and manufactured items is roughly 700 million items out of our inventory. And I think if you look at the slides, you'll see that we've covered a portion of that already with the mandate. And the plan is to roll that out very aggressively over the next, let's call it, 15 months. So the slide ought to provide more color on the coverage by listings in GMV."

On the first part, I think the 18 months that I referred to was -- there were questions on this structured data initiative, when will it start to make a dent in things like SEO? And when will we be able to see it in traffic and in SEO? And as I said, it isn't -- it doesn't all come at once. It comes as you progress. But I said I thought you'd be able to start to see it in around 18 months, and I still think that's the case. We are making good progress, but the external impact of that, meaning our benefits from SEO, our benefits from traffic from those channels is still relatively limited. And that's why both in my remarks and in the slides, we wanted to clarify that there are a number of steps we need to take. And that's why there's a bit of a gap between asking sellers for the information, processing that data, applying machine learning, putting that in products and marketing channels and then ultimately seeing the results. So I still think that's a fair time frame for us to begin to see benefits in the channels that we mentioned. On the seller policies, it's worth clarifying that when we talk about small and medium sellers, that's really the core of the eBay seller. It doesn't necessarily mean a mom-and-pop. We're very focused on that, but it also means multimillion-dollar businesses, but compared to large retailers, that's a smaller or medium-sized business. That is clearly our area of focus. I think our policies and the products that we've launched even in the first 90 days are squarely attuned to that segment of our marketplace. What we see is that there's really great energy around there. I'm really pleased with the progress we've made in a relatively short period of time. And I think that the opportunity for us to acquire new sellers, new inventory, differentiated inventory and differentiated sellers is real. I think the eBay brand is unique. I think the eBay -- we don't want to be like anyone else, and we don't think that our brand is like anyone else's. And because of that, the ability to acquire unique inventory through unique sellers, both consumers and small and medium-sized businesses, is square in the center of where we're focused. And you'll see us do even more down the balance of this year and certainly into 2016."

I was wondering, Devin, if you could just kind of go through some of the puts and takes in terms of this ongoing delta between the 2. There's the impacts of search and security as kind of bad guys, I think, that are leveraged more to the U.S. business, but the U.S. business has had more than development, a structure content. And then you also have the currency effect of U.S. buyers buying European goods versus the opposite before the strength in the dollar. So could you talk through that first? And then secondly, on Slide 14 of the deck, the cost of revenue where you referenced the agreements with PayPal driving higher costs, I was of the understanding that the only incremental cost was tied to minimum volume thresholds, so can you just explain what the incremental cost was tied to?"

First off, backing up on the U.S. growth. So the U.S., as we talked about in the past, has a significantly impacted aspect of it from the strength of the U.S. dollar, which is heavily weighted on its export basis, on the export out of the U.S. And as you think about the U.S. dollar strength, that's pushed down the GMV associated with the -- with that product going outside of the U.S. If you look at the GMV, which I highlighted last time, it's actually relatively stable. It's at 6% growth in the core U.S. business versus 6% last quarter. And so the -- to your question, the near-term aspects of the things that we're working on are actually relatively muted in those. As we've talked about, it's going to take a fair amount of time for that -- for those -- for the impact of things like structured data and other things to impact the growth. And so in the near term, what the U.S. is facing is the pressure from the SEO, search issues, the associated active buyer growth impact and the FX that we talked about. Internationally, growth is roughly stable at the levels that they are and I would say a couple of things to highlight there. First off, China export continues to be pretty strong and consistent quarter-over-quarter. We've got a great business in India that continues to grow very nicely. And our Korea business continues to do very well and kind of in line with prior quarter growth. In Europe, the impact of SEO, the impact of some of the product changes have had a little bit muted impact on our growth, particularly at the latter part of the quarter, but still in the reasonably close to the range that they were in the prior quarter. And again, they're impacted a bit by foreign exchange and a bit by the aspects of the SEO aspects that we've talked about."

On marketing, let me just start by giving a slight helicopter view of the way we view marketing. Historically, we've been very focused on digital channels and we've been very ROI-driven. And what that's tended to do is drive our marketing spend down the funnel. In other words, we tend to market heavily when we make sales. And that's why we've heavily skewed towards things like paid search and other digital channels. I do think that as some of the market shifts and as more channels are available to us, we need to pivot some of our marketing to the mid-funnel and to the upper funnel. And upper funnel is what we would call brand spend. It's more about eBay than about buying any particular item. We've been working really hard because we don't like to waste money around here, and we're very metrics-focused. And as you move from the bottom of the funnel to the top, it gets harder. Frankly, the time frames extend and it gets harder to measure whether $1 was well spent in brand, and it's easier to measure that if $1 was well spent if you sold something or not. But I still believe that it's necessary. So we are already, particularly in the social channels that I mentioned in my remarks, beginning to move from selling individual items to selling eBay as a brand. And I think that you'll see more of that not only through the holiday but through 2016. I think it's very important for us to say to the world who we are. Some of that is closing some of the misconceptions about our business. I think the brand is ubiquitous, but not everyone knows what we do. But some of that is really the sort of emotional connection of the brand, which is not a commodity, it's not a utility, and it's about consumers finding unique items and incredible deals, and that's really where we think north is for our brand. More specifically for this holiday, we'll be very active. Last holiday, we did a bit of TV, not in every DMA but we did some TV in the U.S. and some in Europe. We're not going to do a significant amount of TV this holiday, but we are -- we won't spend less. We're going to be very active in digital channels. And we're operationally ready for this holiday, and we will certainly be active marketing both through promotions and marketing channels for the holiday. So I hope that answered the first part. And I'll turn it to Scott on the capital question."

And then we'll be opportunistic in terms of how and when we buy back shares. In this quarter, I don't think that is any different than how we think about it going forward. This quarter, we bought back 21.9 million shares at $27.36, roughly 1.8% of the company or the outstanding shares. Now that all said, I think we all -- we've talked about this in the past with everyone. There is a bit of a governor over the course of the first few years, where we cannot have plans where we'd be buying back more than 20% of the shares of the company. That said, this represents a fairly, I think, clear step of how we think about buybacks for us going forward."

I'm not going to componentize the qualitative side of structured data. But let me just describe it to you and why I think it ultimately has a positive impact on both traffic and on conversion. If we step back at what we're trying to do, what we're trying to do is really understand and associate the products that are on our shelves. We're trying to be able to group products. We're trying to be able to sell products in ways that are not dependent on search alone. We're trying to create better discoverability of products, both on the marketplace and off. If you come back to what we've been saying repeatedly, there might be a faster path to SEO recovery, but this cycle of spin it up and then spin it down is not sustainable. So we're building it on a much more sustainable foundation because ultimately, both SEO and frankly discoverability on eBay are crying for persistence. They're crying for us to understand that just because a listing comes and goes, we're still selling thousands of iPhones or sweaters or shovels or whatever we're selling. So that at the end of the day is why having a persistent view of the products we sell, I believe, is the traffic driver. And it's a conversion driver because ultimately, we have 800 million items for sale. This is the world's biggest store. It can be overwhelming, and we're asking too much of search. Search is very important, but for search to be the only lever to pick through 800 million items is becoming not sustainable and ultimately, it causes a reduction in conversion. The ability for us to group items, to merge items, to understand what's the best item out of a lot, to create trade-offs, say between the very unique eBay categories like used, manufacturer refurbished and new, and allow consumers to understand the value-based trade-offs of all of those choices, is to me endemic to what we're doing in the structured data initiative. So I can't give you a number, but I know that what we're driving at is better traffic and I know that we're driving a better conversion. And that's why it's worth the investment and it's why it's worth this significant shift in what we're doing. Scott will take the second part on take rate."

And if you look at -- it's up, I think, 10 basis points. We'll get a little bit of uplift from the mix of StubHub in that number, but I think the more material shift quarter-on-quarter was what I called out with the contra revenue. And as we look at our overall expense base from marketing, we, as you know, are very disciplined in how we approach the deployment of that marketing spend. And occasionally, we'll move the investment between different buckets within that expense base, and in some cases, shift it from expense to contra revenue, broadly speaking. But things like seller incentives, DailyDeal incentives, even to the extent of buyer couponing, and it's really dependent on how we see the capabilities of those different marketing channels to be effective and get the best return for us. In this quarter, that did depress revenue growth a little bit, helping some of the underlying aspects of the business in the best way we thought to spend marketing on a go-forward basis. And that's really why you see the differential between the GMV growth rate of about 6% and the transaction revenue growth rate of 4%."

Our Classifieds portfolio, we have a great playbook, a team that really knows what they're doing. We've shown that we can grow and build this business. At times, we use the balance sheet. There was a small Classifieds acquisition this quarter. And it's been a great business for us that we'll continue to move into. An example that I mentioned of a competitive battleground is the U.S. Obviously, it's an enormous potential market, but what we see is that the Classifieds space in the U.S. has been thrown up for grabs. And it's a very big market opportunity. And we think we've got a winning proposition with Close5. It is growing very, very rapidly. And we'll continue to allocate resource for markets where we're not going to win into markets where we have a plausible chance of winning. We won't win in every market, but that's the way we look at the portfolio. On the consumer, we see the same data that you do. We know there've been a number of consumer companies that have been cautious about the fourth quarter. Obviously, our guidance implies stability.

Yes, it is, globally, as is frankly adding the requirement on structured data and a few other things. These are all things that are not necessarily growth-friendly in the short run but important for us to do in the long run. So there's no doubt there's some impact in there. On the second question, the answer is yes. Again, we watch the data carefully. If you look at things like our slides, where you see us deploying structured data, where you see -- and it is very small right now. You are seeing improvement in our rankings. You're seeing some traffic flowing, and you're seeing some conversion benefits being picked up. So that gives us comfort that we're on the right track. But I'd caution that this is going to take time, as I've said consistently for months now. So..."

You talked about an acceleration in trailing 3 months and also India being strong. Can you just help us understand how to think about the value of those new buyers in India relative to kind of the average overall and how long it takes them to ramp up?

Doug, the active buyer growth of 5% is down a point Q-on-Q on a trailing 12-month basis. And what I've highlighted for the last couple of quarters is the trailing 3-month is really purposely to help highlight how the more recent trends have developed based on the actions that we've taken. And the trailing 3 months, we've seen some modest acceleration, as I called out, based on the investments in India, which obviously, on a GMV per user basis, is going to be lower than the rest of the world on average. And then the actions that we've taken to reduce friction on sign-in. And those include things like, over the last several months, providing security -- much more robust set of security questions, allowing for text messaging to allow quick retrieval of a sign-in code and then having users be able to remain signed in for a period of time. There's a number of other smaller things but what that's had the impact of doing is actually reducing the churn of our existing user base. And we continue to work on going after those customers that have come back and not been able to sign in. And that's one of the ways that we think about using contra to go after them in the form of couponing as well as direct marketing on e-mails, et cetera. I will call out as I did in my comments that there are -- there continue to be headwinds even in the underlying trailing 3-month results on active buyers that we see, where even though we're making some progress in our cataloging penetration, if you will, as well as the changes to the user experience in what you're seeing in the Google search, it's not sufficient as of yet to stem the tide of the active buyers -- or the new active buyers that aren't coming to the experience yet. And that's really our primary focus here."

The tension obviously is security, and security is an incredibly important priority for us, particularly given the events of last year. So we constantly are trying to push the efficient frontier of removing friction, but not reducing our customer security. And I think that there have been advancements. You're starting to see some of the big web companies do some interesting things with phone numbers, mobile phone numbers, even using -- basically piggybacking on things like biometric off of the iOS device. You should expect to see us do that. We'll continue to push to reduce sign-in and password reset friction as long as we feel like it doesn't compromise our customer security."

So if we look at the buyer cohorts, in western markets like the U.S. and the U.K., how long do you think it'll take for some of these new buyers that you're bringing in to get up to the levels of the top cohorts and kind of replace some of the drop-off that you saw from those top cohorts after the password breach last year? Is that a 1-year phenomenon? Is it a multiyear phenomenon? Just a little bit of help there will be great. And then somewhat related to that, just big picture, are you comfortable with the low double-digit, fixed-price GMV growth that you're currently seeing? It seems pretty stable. Or once all the recataloging work is done, could we see some more aggressive marketing and potentially drive that number or that growth rate higher? How should we think about that longer term?"

Underlying the trailing 12-month active buyer growth and the existing trailing 3-month is a relatively stable set of cohorts that aside from the new buyers remain relatively stable in terms of how much they buy. And so I don't anticipate that once we reactivate and get that new buyer growth going again, that it would be materially different, although I don't necessarily have data to prove that at this point."
