I'm pleased to speak to you about our fourth quarter and the full year 2014 business results. As you've seen in our press release, Omnicom had a solid fourth quarter, with organic growth of 5.9%, giving us a strong finish to the year. 
Before I discuss our results in detail, I want to reflect upon a number of factors that impact Omnicom, our clients and their consumers in countries where they operate. First, from a macroeconomic perspective, recent declines in oil and commodity prices are helping the consumer in many industries and countries. 
At this point, the U.S. economy looks to be the biggest beneficiary of these changes, with the declining oil prices likely being additive to U.S. GDP in 2015. When you move from the U.S. to the global economy, we're seeing a divergence, for the first time, in central bank policies and actions. Central banks from Australia to Europe to Canada have been lowering borrowing costs to try to kickstart growth in their economies. As a result, their currencies have declined versus the U.S. dollar.
At Omnicom, a little over 46% of our revenues are generated outside the United States. The significant change in exchange rates result in a 3.1% reduction in our revenue in the fourth quarter and will impact our reported results in 2015.
At the same time, it's important to point out that most of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hatched as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency. Both Phil and I will discuss the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in more detail later in the call.
From an industry perspective, we're undergoing a major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge, with media technology evolving at an astonishing pace. 
In 2014, digital ad spend worldwide exceeded $137 billion, a 15% increase. We expect that shift to digital will only accelerate over the next 5 years. There are also changes at Omnicom in 2014. 
In May, we made a mutual decision with Publicis to terminate our proposed merger, which had been announced in July of 2013. And later in the third quarter, we made leadership changes in top positions at Omnicom Corporate and the TBWA network. Given these macro industry and company events, I'm delighted with the results we report this morning. Our performance in this environment says a lot about the strength of our culture, the quality of our people and the depth of our leadership and governance.
Let me now turn it over to revenue performance by region. In the fourth quarter, North America grew 8.3%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media business, as well as solid results in public relations and our specialty health care business. 
In the U.K., our agencies continue to perform very well, with revenue up 6.2% in the quarter.
On the overall growth was 1.2%. More specifically, that euro country markets were flat. Germany was positive, while France and Netherlands continued to drag on the region. We're hopeful that the latest Central Bank actions combined with structural reforms will lead to stability and ultimately economic growth.
Growth in the rest of the region was relatively strong, led by Sweden and Turkey. And Russia was up despite economic turbulence. Latin America was down slightly in the quarter due to the loss of a government account in Chile in mid-2014. Asia's growth was up 3.2%, with key contributors this quarter being India and Singapore. We also had strong growth throughout the Middle East.
As promised, our margins for the quarter were on plan. This result was achieved despite negative margin pressures due to the currency declines I discussed earlier. 
For the full year 2014, Omnicom's worldwide organic growth was 5.7%. Our total revenue increased to $15.3 billion and our earnings per share was $4.23, a 10.2% increase from 2013, after excluding related costs to the proposed Omnicom Publicis merger.
Turning to our cash flow and return on capital. In 2014, we generated just shy of $1.6 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $125 million year-over-year. We returned approximately $1.5 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. 
As you may recall, post the termination of the proposed Publicis Omnicom merger, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.50 per share, and we resumed our share repurchase program. 
Looking forward, our practice for use of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged as does our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our credit rating.
As we move into 2015, given the current environment, we remain focused on the things we can control. Our management teams are dedicated to servicing their lines needs, attracting and retaining the best talent, while at the same time being laser-focused on managing costs.
I want to thank our people, our clients and all of our stakeholders for their contributions to our fourth quarter and to the full year results for 2014. Our strong and consistent performance are a testament to the fact that Omnicom's long-term strategies are working. As I've said before, we are attracting, retaining and developing top talent, expanding our capabilities in both new markets and new service areas, building our digital, data and analytical capabilities by investing in our agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies and delivering big ideas based upon meaningful consumer insights across all of the channels that we operate.
Our ability to stay on top or ahead of the changes in our industry comes down to having patented people at all levels of the organization. Simply put, we have the best talent in the business, which is why we win more than our fair share of the industry's recognition, awards and business. 
Last quarter, Omnicom agencies continue their tradition of being most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me just mention a few of the highlights.
BBDO was named most awarded agency network in the world in 2014 by the government for the ninth consecutive year. DDB was the second most awarded network. OMD was named Global Media Agency of the Year by [ph]. Advertising age honored Adam & Eve DBD as International Agency of the Year and DDB won Multicultural Agency of the Year. 
At the campaign, Asia Pacific Agency of the Year awards, TBWA and DDB won Creative Agencies for the Year in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Philippines and Indonesia and there were many others. I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their outstanding performance and creativity in 2014.
As I mentioned, earlier, and as you all know, our industry is becoming increasingly complex and our clients are looking to us for ways to navigate this rapidly changing landscape. 
At Omnicom, we are continually expanding our capabilities to meet our clients needs. Technology is providing the tools and we're providing the brains to deliver actionable consumer insights developed a better way to target consumers and then reaching them across many different disciplines and media to give Omnicom clients the best possible solution.
Our internal investments in people, our technology partnerships and our acquisitions have allowed us to expand our company and participate in these rapidly growing areas. 2014, more than any year I can remember, was the year that we truly saw the convergence of technology, creativity and media change the way our agencies operate. Several events come to mind. As part of our partnership deals with tech companies, our creative talent is working side-by-side with engineers from Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter and others, and the net result is increasing innovative solutions for our clients.
As an example, Lowe's, which was among the first to use as a marketing tool with its award-winning fix and campaign, launched its next-generation using capital and hyper. These are new innovative technologies that deliver unique and differentiated content to consumers.
The campaign for Lowe's is a fully-integrated effort. Together, our agencies and tech partners did everything from creative and targeting to media placement and analytics. We're seeing this trend play out as we broaden our reach and functionality of analytics data management platform, an investment we began in 2013.
As an example, data analysis from Annalect are part of the creative and digital teams servicing multiple clients. These change are levering data and analytics to help inform planning and creative the deliver relevant content to optimize campaigns with a realtime insights.
The result is much greater position, delivering the right message to the right audience at the right time and on the right device.
Finally, our acquisitions are also supplementing our expansion into rapidly growing areas. Early this month, we acquired TLGG, a strategic consulting and digital agency in Germany. Late in 2014, we purchased Washington-based, DDC Advocacy, an innovative CRM agency for clients in the public affairs space. And Omnicom's took full ownership of the critical mass, a leading global digital shop. 
In 2015, we continue to focus our acquisition efforts in key markets and areas of growth, including media, data and analytics, CRM, production and health care. Looking back on the year of unprecedented changes, Omnicom continues to be an industry leader in breaking new technologies, delivering outstanding creativity for our clients and their and generating an exceptional total return to shareholders.
I want to recognize our more than 70,000 people for bringing their A games to their clients everyday. 
I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers."

As John said, our operating companies have continued to perform very well, delivering against their operating and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients. As a result of the",2466,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our operating companies have continued to perform very well, delivering against their operating and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients. As a result of the excellent performance of our agencies, revenue for the quarter came in at just about $4.2 billion, up 3.4%. The year-over-year increase was driven by continued strong organic growth of 5.9%. This despite a considerable FX headwind this quarter of 3.1%. FX was negative this quarter across virtually every currency we operate in. I'll discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Turning to the figures below revenue, a quick reminder. As you know, we terminated merger this past May. During the fourth quarter of '13, we incurred $13.3 million of merger-related costs. These costs are included in our GAAP results for 2013. In discussing our performance for the quarter, my comments will compare the current quarter to last year's Q4 results, excluding the impact of the merger-related expenses.
You can find this non-GAAP presentation in the supplemental financial information section on Slide 19 through 24.
So turning to Slide 19. Our EBITDA for the quarter increased to $609 million from $589 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to Q4 last year. The resulting EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.5%, unchanged versus Q4 last year.
As said previously, the sharp decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar are virtually all currencies we operated in, negatively impacted our revenues across all of our international operations. Because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on our margins in the quarter was manageable.
Despite this FX headwind, we continue to see a positive impact from our efforts to drive efficiencies throughout our organization and our agencies and to control our cost. Operating income or EBIT, performed similarly to EBITA, increasing $15 million or 2.6% to $579 million. And our operating margin of 13.8% was down slightly versus Q4 2013 due to the increase in amortization on our intangible assets. Now turning to the items below operating income.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $30 million, down $1.4 million from the third quarter and down $9.8 million year-over-year. As compared to Q3, while we incurred additional interest expense related to the $750 million of 10-year senior notes that we issued early in the fourth quarter, the increase was effectively offset by the impact of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps we entered into late in the third quarter related to our 2020 senior notes. 
Net interest expense was also reduced by additional interest income earned by our international treasury centers as a result of higher-than-average cash balances in Q4 as compared to Q3. Versus last year, net interest expense was down $9.8 million in the quarter. This is primarily due to the positive impact of the interest rate swaps we entered into over the past year, in mid-Q2 and late Q3, net of the additional interest expense related to the new issuance of senior notes in Q4 of 2014, plus benefits from our cash management efforts in a form of increased interest income earned by our international treasury centers.
Our quarterly tax rate of 33.2% is in line with our normal expectations. Earnings from our affiliates were up slightly in the quarter to $5.7 million. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries increased to $3.4 million to $43.4 million, as a result of improved performance at several of our existing subsidiaries that have local minority owners as well as at several of our new acquisitions.
As a result, net income was $329.5 million, that's an increase of $15.7 million or 5% versus Q4 of last year and an increase of 9.7% compared to the 2013 reported amount. 
Now turning to Page 21.
The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $5.6 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $323.9 million, an increase of 5.7% versus Q4 last year. 
You can also see our diluted share count for the quarter was 249.9 million, which is down 4.1% versus last year, as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014.
Given our overall strong performance in the quarter, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of $0.12 or 10.2% versus Q4 2013 the or up $0.17 and 15% compared to the 2013 reported amount.
On Slide 22 through 24, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the full year. To save some time, I will just's give you a few highlights.
Full year revenue was up 5%, driven predominantly by organic growth of 5.7%, with FX swinging from positive for the first 9 months of the year to slightly negative for the year and net acquisitions turning from negative for the first 9 months of the year to slightly positive for the year. 
EBITDA increased 4.3% to $2.05 billion, while our full year EBITA margin was 13.4%, down about 10 basis points versus last year.
As a reminder, the 2014 EBITDA amounts include $8.8 million for merger-related costs incurred earlier in the year. Our effective tax rate for the year was 32.8%, slightly below our operating rate of 33.2%, reflecting the impact of the tax benefit we recognized upon termination of the merger in the second quarter. The benefit related to the merger expenses recognized in 2013, which were required to be capitalized for tax purposes at that time.
Net income for the year was $1.1 billion, up 7.6% over 2013. And our full year diluted EPS was $4.24 per share, up $0.40 versus 2013 non-GAAP amount of $3.84 and up $0.53 versus our reported 2013 amount of $3.71.
Excluding the impact of merger expenses and the related tax benefits from both years, full year diluted EPS for 2014 was $4.23 per share, up 10.2% versus 2013 diluted EPS of $3.84.
Turning back to Slide 7. We shift the discussion to the revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against everyone of our major currencies, most notably the euro, as well as the Australian and Canadian dollars, that real, the ruble and the yen. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $129 million or 3.1%. 
Looking ahead, considering the recent steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the dollar, in a relative short period of time, if FX rates for 2015 stay where they are, FX could have a negative impact on our revenues of approximately 5.5% during the first  quarter of 2015 and approximately 5% for the year.
Given it is only early February, it's hard to predict what will happen in FX rates for the balance of the year. Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $26 million, driven by our recent acquisitions in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Turkey and the U.K., as well as here in the U.S. 
With the transactions that we have completed through December 31, we expect acquisitions, net of dispositions, to add about 50 to 60 basis points to revenue in the first quarter and the year.
And finally, organic growth was positive $240 million or 5.9% this quarter. It was another strong quarter, with positive organic growth across all of our markets, with exceptions being France, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea and the smaller markets of Latin America. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued excellent performance across our media businesses, driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins, continuing strength domestically and in the U.K., with and specialty businesses turning in solid performances this quarter.
In addition to the strong performance in the U.S. in the U.K., our agencies in the emerging markets continue to perform very well. This quarter, we had excellent performances in India, Mexico and the UAE. 
In the euro markets, overall organic growth was basically flat. Germany and Spain were again positive as they have been for several quarters, with the France and Dutch market still struggling.
And we continue to see generally good performance across our businesses in our other markets, including Brazil, China, India and our non-Euro markets in Europe. Although the rate of growth continues to be somewhat uneven market-by-market. 
Slide 8 covers our full year revenue performance, which is basically in line with this quarter's results, except for FX, which was slightly positive through the first 9 months before turning slightly negative for the year.
On Slide 9 and 10, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 57% for North America; 10% for the U.K.; 18% for the rest of Europe; 10% for Asia Pacific; 3% for Latin America; and 2% for Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to the details on Slide 10. In North America, we had organic revenue growth of 8.3%, again, primarily, driven this quarter by the performance of our media businesses, health care and PR businesses. The U.K. once again had a very strong quarter and has been consistently positive organically for the last 2 years.
The rest of Europe was up 1.2%, led by a solid performance in Germany, continuing strong performance in Spain and our other non-Euro markets in Europe. On the downside, France and the Netherlands continue to struggle. Asia Pacific was up 3.2%. We had strong performance across the region, with India and Singapore leading the way with double-digit growth. China also had a solid quarter, especially in light of a difficult comp versus Q4 of 2013, while Japan and South Korea also facing difficult comps versus Q4 of 2013, experienced softness in the quarter.
Latin America overall was down slightly. A positive performance in Brazil also facing a difficult comp versus Q4 of last year and Mexico, was offset by weakness in Chile related to the loss of a significant client in that market, which will continue to cycle into the first half of next year.
In Africa and the Middle East region, although off a small base, was up 14%, led by very strong quarter from our businesses in UAE.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business per quarter, which again was split about evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 8.5%, primarily, driven by the excellent performances of our media businesses and marketing business overall was up 3.4%.
Within marketing services, CRM, coming off a robust performance in Q4 of 2013, was up 1%. The performance was mixed by business and disciplined in Q4. Our events in field marketing businesses had a challenging quarter, while our direct marketing, sales promotion and research businesses had strong performances, with strength across several markets.
Public relations was up 8.5% relative to a challenging Q4 2013 and reflecting strength in the U.S. and the U.K. in 2014. Specialty communications was up about 9.4% on the strength of our health care businesses in the U.S. and the U.K., partially offset a some weakness in Japan.
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector, keeping in mind these year-to-date figures for total growth, not just organic growth. As you can see, we're up in almost all categories, the larger changes were in our telecom and other industries group. Telecom continues to be impacted by the loss of BlackBerry and within other, we benefited from new business wins and project spending from our services clients.
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In 2014, we generated $1.58 billion of free cash flow, including changes in working capital, an increase of 8.6% versus 2013. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $468 million, up significantly from last year. 
As a reminder, in 2013, we only made 3 dividend payments because we paid our normal Q1 dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend earlier this year. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $111 million. Capital expenditures were $213 million, which was in line with our expectations for the year.
Acquisitions, including payments net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $207 million and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan, totaled $994 million. 
Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May, post the termination of the merger, we have purchased about 14.3 million shares net. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by about $410 million for the year.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure. As you may be aware, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes, a 3.65% during the fourth quarter. As a result, our total debt increased to $4.6 billion as of December 31 and our leverage approximates our historic norms. And our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of $869 million over the past year was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow, as we just discussed, as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance at December 31, 2014, of approximately $275 million.
In spite of the increase in our debt, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1x. And due to both decrease in our interest expense and increase in EBITA, our interest garbage ratio improved to 12.6x.
Turning to slide 16. We continue to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 20.3% and return on equity increased to  34.3%.
And finally, on Slide 17, we tracked our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from fiscal 2004 through 2014, which totaled $10 billion. And the bar showed the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $10.8 billion for cumulative payout ratio of 108%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So FX is certainly going to pose a bit of a challenge for us from a margin perspective, which is why I think we're not projecting and predicting and committing to our margins going to be for the full year '15. But we always strive to find the right balance. We're always looking for efficiencies and try to make our business has more effective in the way they manage their cost structure. We have a number of initiatives that have been going on for some time on the areas of real estate, IT and some others that we certainly continue to the benefit of and we are expecting content to push those initiatives in '15.

I'm pleased to speak to you about our fourth quarter and the full year 2014 business results. As you've seen in our press release, Omnicom had a solid fourth quarter with organic growth of 5.9%, givi",1586,"Thank you, Shub. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to speak to you about our fourth quarter and the full year 2014 business results. As you've seen in our press release, Omnicom had a solid fourth quarter with organic growth of 5.9%, giving us a strong finish to the year. 
Before I discuss our results in detail, I want to reflect upon a number of factors that impact Omnicom, our clients and their consumers in countries where they operate. First, from a macroeconomic perspective, recent declines in oil and commodity prices are helping the consumer in many industries and countries. At this point, the U.S. economy looks to be the biggest beneficiary of these changes, with the declining oil prices likely being additive to U.S. GDP in 2015. 
When you move from the U.S. to the global economy, we're seeing a divergence for the first time in central bank policies and actions. Central banks from Australia to Europe to Canada have been lowering borrowing costs to try to kickstart growth in their economies. As a result, their currencies have declined versus the U.S. dollar.
At Omnicom, a little over 46% of our revenues are generated outside the United States. The significant change in exchange rates resulted in a 3.1% reduction in our revenue in the fourth quarter and will impact our reported results in 2015. At the same time, it's important to point out that most of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency. Both Phil and I will discuss the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in more detail later in the call.
From an industry perspective, we're undergoing a major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge, with media technology evolving at an astonishing pace. In 2014, digital ad spend worldwide exceeded $137 billion, a 15% increase. We expect that shift to digital will only accelerate over the next 5 years. 
There are also changes at Omnicom in 2014. In May, we made a mutual decision with Publicis to terminate our proposed merger, which had been announced in July of 2013. And later in the third quarter, we made leadership changes in top positions at Omnicom corporate and the TBWA network. 
Given these macro industry and company events, I'm delighted with the results we report this morning. Our performance in this environment says a lot about the strength of our culture, the quality of our people and the depth of our leadership and governance.
Let me now turn to our revenue performance by region. In the fourth quarter, North America grew 8.3%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media business as well as solid results in public relations and our specialty health care business. In the U.K., our agencies continue to perform very well with revenue up 6.2% in the quarter. 
On the continent, overall growth was 1.2%. More specifically, the euro currency markets were flat. Germany was positive, while France and the Netherlands continued to drag on the region. We're hopeful that the latest central bank actions, combined with structural reforms, will lead to stability and ultimately economic growth. Growth in the rest of the region was relatively strong, led by Sweden and Turkey. And Russia was up despite economic turbulence. 
Latin America was down slightly in the quarter due to the loss of a government account in Chile in mid-2014. Asia's growth was up 3.2%, with key contributors this quarter being India and Singapore. We also had strong growth throughout the Middle East.
As promised, our margins for the quarter were on plan. This result was achieved despite negative margin pressures due to the currency declines I discussed earlier. 
For the full year 2014, Omnicom's worldwide organic growth was 5.7%. Our total revenue increased to $15.3 billion and our earnings per share was $4.23, a 10.2% increase from 2013 after excluding related costs to the proposed Omnicom-Publicis merger.
Turning to our cash flow and return on capital. In 2014, we generated just shy of $1.6 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $125 million year-over-year. We returned approximately $1.5 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. As you may recall, post the termination of the proposed Publicis-Omnicom merger, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.50 per share, and we resumed our share repurchase program. Looking forward, our practice for use of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged as does our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our credit rating.
As we move into 2015, given the current environment, we remain focused on the things we can control. Our management teams are dedicated to servicing their client's needs, attracting and retaining the best talent, while at the same time being laser-focused on managing costs.
I want to thank our people, our clients and all of our stakeholders for their contributions to our fourth quarter and to full year results for 2014. Our strong and consistent performance are a testament to the fact that Omnicom's long-term strategies are working. As I've said before, we are attracting, retaining and developing top talent, expanding our capabilities in both new markets and new service areas, building our digital, data and analytical capabilities by investing in our agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies and delivering big ideas based upon meaningful consumer insights across all the channels that we operate.
Our ability to stay on top or ahead of the changes in our industry comes down to having talented people at all levels of the organization. Simply put: We have the best talent in the business, which is why we win more than our fair share of the industry's recognition, awards and business. 
Last quarter, Omnicom agencies continued their tradition of being most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me just mention a few of the highlights.
BBDO was named most awarded agency network in the world in 2014 by the Gunn Report for the ninth consecutive year. DDB was the second most awarded network. OMD was named Global Media Agency of the Year by Adweek. Advertising Age honored Adam & Eve/DDB as International Agency of the Year, and DDB won Multicultural Agency of the Year. At the Campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year awards, TBWA and DDB won Creative Agencies for the Year in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Philippines and Indonesia, and there were many others. I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their outstanding performance and creativity in 2014.
As I mentioned, earlier, and as you all know, our industry is becoming increasingly complex and our clients are looking to us for ways to navigate this rapidly changing landscape. At Omnicom, we're continually expanding our capabilities to meet our clients' needs. Technology is providing the tools and we are providing the brains to deliver actionable consumer insights, develop better ways to target consumers and then reaching them across many different disciplines and media to give Omnicom clients the best possible solution. Our internal investments in people, our technology partnerships and our acquisitions have allowed us to expand our company and participate in these rapidly growing areas. 2014, more than any year I can remember, was the year that we truly saw the convergence of technology, creativity and media change the way our agencies operate. 
Several events come to mind. As part of our partnership deals with tech companies, our creative talent is working side by side with engineers from Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter and others, and the net result is increasing innovative solutions for our clients.
As an example, Lowe's, which was among the first to use Vines as a marketing tool with its award-winning ""Fix in Six"" campaign, launched its next-generation of Vines using ""Tap Thru"" and ""Hypermade."" These are new innovative technologies that deliver unique and differentiated content to consumers.
The campaign for Lowe's is a fully-integrated effort. Together, our agencies and tech partners did everything from creative and targeting to media placement and analytics. We're seeing this trend play out as we broaden our reach and functionality of Annalect's data management platform, an investment we began in 2013. As an example, data analysts from Annalect are part of the creative and digital teams servicing multiple clients. These teams are levering data and analytics to help inform planning and creative to deliver relevant content to optimize campaigns with the real-time insights. The result is much greater precision, delivering the right message to the right audience at the right time and on the right device.
Finally, our acquisitions are also supplementing our expansion into rapidly growing areas. Early this month, we acquired TLGG, a strategic consulting and digital agency in Germany. Late in 2014, we purchased Washington-based DDC Advocacy, an innovative CRM agency for clients in the public affairs space. And Omnicom's DAS took full ownership of the Critical Mass, a leading global digital shop. 
In 2015, we continue to focus our acquisition efforts in key markets and areas of growth, including media, data and analytics, CRM, production and health care. Looking back on a year of unprecedented changes, Omnicom continues to be an industry leader, embracing new technologies, delivering outstanding creativity for our clients and their brands and generating an exceptional total return to shareholders. I want to recognize our more than 70,000 people for bringing their A games to our clients everyday. 
I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers."
96161,283611752,758437,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our operating companies have continued to perform very well, delivering against their operating and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients. As a result of the",2474,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our operating companies have continued to perform very well, delivering against their operating and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients. As a result of the excellent performance of our agencies, revenue for the quarter came in at just about $4.2 billion, up 3.4%. The year-over-year increase was driven by continued strong organic growth of 5.9%, this despite a considerable FX headwind this quarter of 3.1%. FX was negative this quarter across virtually every currency we operate in. I'll discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Turning to the figures below revenue, a quick reminder. As you know, we terminated the merger this past May. During the fourth quarter of '13, we incurred $13.3 million of merger-related costs. These costs are included in our GAAP results for 2013. In discussing our performance for the quarter, my comments will compare the current quarter to last year's Q4 results, excluding the impact of the merger-related expenses. You can find this non-GAAP presentation in the Supplemental Financial Information section on Slide 19 through 24.
So turning to Slide 19. Our EBITDA for the quarter increased to $609 million from $589 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to Q4 last year. The resulting EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.5%, unchanged versus Q4 last year.
As said previously, the sharp decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar or virtually all currencies we operated in, negatively impacted our revenues across all of our international operations. Because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on our margins in the quarter was manageable. 
Despite this FX headwind, we continue to see a positive impact from our efforts to drive efficiencies throughout our organization and our agencies and to control our costs. Operating income or EBIT, performed similarly to EBITA, increasing $15 million or 2.6% to $579 million. And our operating margin of 13.8% was down slightly versus Q4 2013 due to the increase in amortization on our intangible assets. 
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $30 million, down $1.4 million from the third quarter and down $9.8 million year-over-year. As compared to Q3, while we incurred additional interest expense related to the $750 million of 10-year senior notes that we issued early in the fourth quarter, the increase was effectively offset by the impact of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps we entered into late in the third quarter related to our 2020 senior notes. 
Net interest expense was also reduced by additional interest income earned by our international treasury centers as a result of higher-than-average cash balances in Q4 as compared to Q3. Versus last year, net interest expense was down $9.8 million in the quarter. This was primarily due to the positive impact of the interest rate swaps we entered into over the past year, in mid-Q2 and late Q3, net of the additional interest expense related to the new issuance of senior notes in Q4 of 2014, plus benefits from our cash management efforts in the form of increased interest income earned by our international treasury centers.
Our quarterly tax rate of 33.2% is in line with our normal expectations. Earnings from our affiliates were up slightly in the quarter to $5.7 million. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries increased $3.4 million to $43.4 million, as a result of improved performance at several of our existing subsidiaries that have local minority owners as well as at several of our new acquisitions. 
As a result, net income was $329.5 million. That's an increase of $15.7 million or 5% versus Q4 last year and an increase of 9.7% compared to the 2013 reported amount. 
Now turning to Page 21. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $5.6 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $323.9 million, an increase of 5.7% versus Q4 last year. You can also see our diluted share count for the quarter was 249.9 million, which is down 4.1% versus last year, as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014. Given our overall strong performance in the quarter, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of $0.12 or 10.2% versus Q4 2013 or up $0.17 and 15% compared to the 2013 reported amount.
On Slides 22 through 24, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the full year. To save some time, I will just give you a few highlights.
Full year revenue was up 5%, driven predominantly by organic growth of 5.7%, with FX swinging from positive for the first 9 months of the year to slightly negative for the year, and net acquisitions turning from negative for the first 9 months of the year to slightly positive for the year. EBITDA increased 4.3% to $2.05 billion, while our full year EBITA margin was 13.4%, down about 10 basis points versus last year. As a reminder, the 2014 EBITDA amounts include $8.8 million for merger-related costs incurred earlier in the year. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was 32.8%, slightly below our operating rate of 33.2%, reflecting the impact of the tax benefit we recognized upon termination of the merger in the second quarter. The benefit related to merger expenses recognized in 2013, which were required to be capitalized for tax purposes at that time.
Net income for the year was $1.1 billion, up 7.6% over 2013. And our full year diluted EPS was $4.24 per share, up $0.40 versus 2013 non-GAAP amount of $3.84 and up $0.53 versus our reported 2013 amount of $3.71. Excluding the impact of merger expenses and the related tax benefits from both years, full year diluted EPS for 2014 was $4.23 (sic) [$4.24] per share, up 10.2% versus 2013 diluted EPS of $3.84.
Turning back to Slide 7. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major currencies, most notably the euro, as well as the Australian and Canadian dollars, the real, the ruble and the yen. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $129 million or 3.1%. Looking ahead, considering the recent steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the dollar in a relative short period of time, if FX rates for 2015 stay where they are, FX could have a negative impact on our revenues of approximately 5.5% during the first quarter of 2015 and approximately 5% for the year. Given it is only early February, it's hard to predict what will happen at FX rates for the balance of the year. 
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $26 million, driven by our recent acquisitions in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Turkey and the U.K. as well as here in the U.S. With the transactions that we have completed through December 31, we expect acquisitions, net of dispositions, to add about 50 to 60 basis points to revenue in the first quarter and the year.
And finally, organic growth was positive $240 million or 5.9% this quarter. It was another strong quarter with positive organic growth across all of our markets, with the exceptions being France, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea and the smaller markets of Latin America. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued excellent performance across our media businesses, driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins; continuing strength domestically and in the U.K., with PR and specialty businesses turning in solid performances this quarter.
In addition to the strong performance in the U.S. and the U.K., our agencies in the emerging markets continued to perform very well. This quarter, we had excellent performances in India, Mexico and the UAE. In the euro markets, overall organic growth was basically flat. Germany and Spain were again positive, as they have been for several quarters, with the France and Dutch markets still struggling. And we continue to see generally good performance across our businesses in our other markets, including Brazil, China, India and our non-euro markets in Europe, although the rate of growth continues to be somewhat uneven market-by-market. 
Slide 8 covers our full year revenue performance, which is basically in line with this quarter's results, except for FX, which was slightly positive through the first 9 months before turning slightly negative for the year.
On Slide 9 and 10, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 57% for North America; 10% for the U.K.; 18% for the rest of Europe; 10% for Asia Pacific; 3% for Latin America; and 2% for Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to the details on Slide 10. In North America, we had organic revenue growth of 8.3%, again, primarily, driven this quarter by the performance of our media businesses, health care and PR businesses. The U.K. once again had a very strong quarter and has been consistently positive organically for the last 2 years.
The rest of Europe was up 1.2%, led by a solid performance in Germany, continuing strong performance in Spain and our other non-euro markets in Europe. On the downside, France and the Netherlands continued to struggle. 
Asia Pacific was up 3.2%. We had strong performances across the region, with India and Singapore leading the way with double-digit growth. China also had a solid quarter, especially in light of a difficult comp versus Q4 of 2013. While Japan and South Korea also facing difficult comps versus Q4 of 2013, experienced softness in the quarter.
Latin America overall was down slightly. A positive performance in Brazil, also facing a difficult comp versus Q4 of last year, and Mexico, was offset by weakness in Chile related to the loss of a significant client in that market, which will continue to cycle into the first half of next year. And Africa and the Middle East region, although off a small base, was up 14%, led by very strong quarter from our businesses in the UAE.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again was split about evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 8.5%, primarily driven by the excellent performance of our media businesses; and marketing services overall was up 3.4%.
Within marketing services, CRM, coming off a robust performance in Q4 of 2013, was up 1%. The performance was mixed by business and discipline in Q4. Our events in field marketing businesses had a challenging quarter, while our direct marketing, sales promotion and research businesses had strong performances with strength across several markets.
Public relations was up 8.5% relative to a challenging Q4 2013 and reflecting strength in the U.S. and the U.K. in 2014. Specialty communications was up about 9.4% on the strength of our health care businesses in the U.S. and the U.K., partially offset by some weakness in Japan.
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector, keeping in mind these are year-to-date figures for total growth, not just organic growth. As you can see, we're up in almost all categories. The larger changes were in our telecom and other industries group. Telecom continues to be impacted by the loss of BlackBerry. And within other, we benefited from new business wins and project spending from our services clients.
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In 2014, we generated $1.58 billion of free cash flow, including changes in working capital, an increase of 8.6% versus 2013. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14. Dividends paid to our common shareholders were $468 million, up significantly from last year. As a reminder, in 2013, we only made 3 dividend payments because we paid our normal Q1 dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend earlier this year. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $111 million. Capital expenditures were $213 million, which was in line with our expectations for the year.
Acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $207 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan, totaled $994 million.  Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May, post the termination of the merger, we have purchased about 14.3 million shares net. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by about $410 million for the year.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure. As you may be aware, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes at 3.65% during the fourth quarter. As a result, our total debt increased to $4.6 billion as of December 31 and our leverage approximates our historic norms. And our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of $869 million over the past year was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow, as we just discussed, as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance at December 31, 2014, of approximately $275 million.
In spite of the increase in our debt, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1x. And due to both a decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.6x.
Turning to slide 16. We continue to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 20.3% and return on equity increased to 34.3%.
And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from fiscal 2004 through 2014, which totaled $10 billion. And the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period, totaled $10.8 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 108%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

But we always strive, find the right balance. We're always looking for efficiencies and try to make our businesses more effective in the way they manage their cost structure. We have a number of initiatives that have been going on for some time in the areas of real estate, IT and some others, that we certainly continue to see the benefit of.

In terms of the marketplace, we continue to win business. There's no question. Thank God we do. But with all the unrest in the world, I'm just being optimistic but conservative in observing the obvious: That it appears that the entire world's economy has slowed down a bit, and we can't make claims that we're going to outgrow that. Historically, we've been -- historically, we do at least 100 basis points better than GDP growth, but there's a great deal of unrest out there. And so we'll alter that estimate as we get more sight on it as we go through the year. But as of right now, I'm very comfortable with the 3.5% and I think that's what we're going to see for the -- until some of these things start to clear up."

I'm pleased to speak to you about our fourth quarter and the full year 2014 business results. As you've seen in our press release, Omnicom had a solid fourth quarter with organic growth of 5.9%, givi",1590,"Thank you, Shub. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to speak to you about our fourth quarter and the full year 2014 business results. As you've seen in our press release, Omnicom had a solid fourth quarter with organic growth of 5.9%, giving us a strong finish to the year. 
Before I discuss our results in detail, I want to reflect upon a number of factors that impact Omnicom, our clients and their consumers in countries where they operate. First, from a macroeconomic perspective, recent declines in oil and commodity prices are helping the consumer in many industries and countries. At this point, the U.S. economy looks to be the biggest beneficiary of these changes, with the declining oil prices likely being additive to U.S. GDP in 2015. 
When you move from the U.S. to the global economy, we're seeing a divergence for the first time in central bank policies and actions. Central banks from Australia to Europe to Canada have been lowering borrowing costs to try to kick start growth in their economies. As a result, their currencies have declined versus the U.S. dollar.
At Omnicom, a little over 46% of our revenues are generated outside the United States. The significant change in exchange rates resulted in a 3.1% reduction in our revenue in the fourth quarter and will impact our reported results in 2015. At the same time, it's important to point out that most of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency. Both Phil and I will discuss the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in more detail later in the call.
From an industry perspective, we're undergoing a major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge, with media and technology evolving at an astonishing pace. In 2014, digital ad spend worldwide exceeded $137 billion, a 15% increase. We expect that shift to digital will only accelerate over the next 5 years. 
There are also changes at Omnicom in 2014. In May, we made a mutual decision with Publicis to terminate our proposed merger, which had been announced in July of 2013. And later in the third quarter, we made leadership changes in top positions at Omnicom corporate and the TBWA network. 
Given these macro, industry and company events, I'm delighted with the results we report this morning. Our performance in this environment says a lot about the strength of our culture, the quality of our people and the depth of our leadership and governance.
Let me now turn to our revenue performance by region. In the fourth quarter, North America grew 8.3%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media business as well as solid results in public relations and our specialty health care business. In the U.K., our agencies continue to perform very well with revenue up 6.2% in the quarter. 
On the continent, overall growth was 1.2%. More specifically, the euro currency markets were flat. Germany was positive, while France and the Netherlands continued to drag on the region. We're hopeful that the latest central bank actions, combined with structural reforms, will lead to stability and ultimately economic growth. Growth in the rest of the region was relatively strong, led by Sweden and Turkey. And Russia was up despite economic turbulence. 
Latin America was down slightly in the quarter due to the loss of a government account in Chile in mid-2014. Asia's growth was up 3.2%, with key contributors this quarter being India and Singapore. We also had strong growth throughout the Middle East.
As promised, our margins for the quarter were on plan. This result was achieved despite negative margin pressures due to the currency declines I discussed earlier. 
For the full year 2014, Omnicom's worldwide organic growth was 5.7%. Our total revenue increased to $15.3 billion and our earnings per share was $4.23, a 10.2% increase from 2013 after excluding related costs to the proposed Omnicom-Publicis merger.
Turning to our cash flow and return on capital. In 2014, we generated just shy of $1.6 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $125 million year-over-year. We returned approximately $1.5 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. As you may recall, post the termination of the proposed Publicis-Omnicom merger, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.50 per share, and we resumed our share repurchase program. Looking forward, our practice for use of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged as does our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our credit rating.
As we move into 2015, given the current environment, we remain focused on the things we can control. Our management teams are dedicated to servicing their client's needs, attracting and retaining the best talent, while at the same time being laser-focused on managing costs.
I want to thank our people, our clients and all of our stakeholders for their contributions to our fourth quarter and to the full year results for 2014. Our strong and consistent performance are a testament to the fact that Omnicom's long-term strategies are working. As I've said before, we are attracting, retaining and developing top talent, expanding our capabilities in both new markets and newer service areas, building our digital, data and analytical capabilities by investing in our agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies, and delivering big ideas based upon meaningful consumer insights across all the channels that we operate.
Our ability to stay on top or ahead of the changes in our industry comes down to having talented people at all levels of the organization. Simply put: We have the best talent in the business, which is why we win more than our fair share of the industry's recognition, awards and business. 
Last quarter, Omnicom agencies continued their tradition of being most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me just mention a few of the highlights.
BBDO was named most awarded agency network in the world in 2014 by the Gunn Report for the ninth consecutive year. DDB was the second most awarded network. OMD was named Global Media Agency of the Year by Adweek. Advertising Age honored Adam & Eve/DDB as International Agency of the Year, and Alma DDB won Multicultural Agency of the Year. At the Campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year awards, TBWA and DDB won Creative Agencies for the Year in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Philippines and Indonesia, and there were many others. I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their outstanding performance and creativity in 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, and as you all know, our industry is becoming increasingly complex and our clients are looking to us for ways to navigate this rapidly changing landscape. At Omnicom, we're continually expanding our capabilities to meet our clients' needs. Technology is providing the tools and we are providing the brains to deliver actionable consumer insights, develop better ways to target consumers and then reaching them across many different disciplines and media to give Omnicom clients the best possible solution. Our internal investments in people, our technology partnerships and our acquisitions have allowed us to expand our company and participate in these rapidly growing areas. 2014, more than any year I can remember, was the year that we truly saw the convergence of technology, creativity and media change the way our agencies operate. 
Several events come to mind. As part of our partnership deals with tech companies, our creative talent is working side by side with engineers from Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter and others, and the net result is increasing innovative solutions for our clients.
As an example, Lowe's, which was among the first to use Vines as a marketing tool with its award-winning ""Fix in Six"" campaign, launched its next-generation of Vines using ""Tap Thru"" and ""Hypermade."" These are new innovative technologies that deliver unique and differentiated content to consumers.
The campaign for Lowe's is a fully-integrated effort. Together, our agencies and tech partners did everything from creative and targeting to media placement and analytics. We're seeing this trend play out as we broaden our reach and functionality of Annalect's data management platform, an investment we began in 2013. As an example, data analysts from Annalect are part of the creative and digital teams servicing multiple clients. These teams are levering data and analytics to help inform planning and creative to deliver relevant content to optimize campaigns with the real-time insights. The result is much greater precision, delivering the right message to the right audience at the right time and on the right device.
Finally, our acquisitions are also supplementing our expansion into rapidly growing areas. Early this month, we acquired TLGG, a strategic consulting and digital agency in Germany. Late in 2014, we purchased Washington-based DDC Advocacy, an innovative CRM agency for clients in the public affairs space. And Omnicom's DAS took full ownership of Critical Mass, a leading global digital shop. 
In 2015, we continue to focus our acquisition efforts in key markets and areas of growth, including media, data and analytics, CRM, production and health care. Looking back on a year of unprecedented changes, Omnicom continues to be an industry leader, embracing new technologies, delivering outstanding creativity for our clients and their brands and generating an exceptional total return to shareholders. I want to recognize our more than 70,000 people for bringing their A games to our clients every day. 
I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers."

As John said, our operating companies have continued to perform very well, delivering against their operating and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients. As a result of the",2475,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our operating companies have continued to perform very well, delivering against their operating and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients. As a result of the excellent performance of our agencies, revenue for the quarter came in at just about $4.2 billion, up 3.4%. The year-over-year increase was driven by continued strong organic growth of 5.9%, this despite a considerable FX headwind this quarter of 3.1%. FX was negative this quarter across virtually every currency we operate in. I'll discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Turning to the figures below revenue, a quick reminder. As you know, we terminated the merger this past May. During the fourth quarter of '13, we incurred $13.3 million of merger-related costs. These costs are included in our GAAP results for 2013. In discussing our performance for the quarter, my comments will compare the current quarter to last year's Q4 results, excluding the impact of the merger-related expenses. You can find this non-GAAP presentation in the Supplemental Financial Information section on Slides 19 through 24.
So turning to Slide 19. Our EBITDA for the quarter increased to $609 million from $589 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to Q4 last year. The resulting EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.5%, unchanged versus Q4 last year.
As said previously, the sharp decline in value, relative to the U.S. dollar or virtually all currencies we operated in, negatively impacted our revenues across all of our international operations. Because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on our margins in the quarter was manageable. 
Despite this FX headwind, we continue to see a positive impact from our efforts to drive efficiencies throughout our organization and our agencies and to control our costs. Operating income or EBIT, performed similarly to EBITA, increasing $15 million or 2.6% to $579 million. And our operating margin of 13.8% was down slightly versus Q4 2013 due to the increase in amortization on our intangible assets. 
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $30 million, down $1.4 million from the third quarter and down $9.8 million year-over-year. As compared to Q3, while we incurred additional interest expense related to the $750 million of 10-year senior notes that we issued early in the fourth quarter, the increase was effectively offset by the impact of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps we entered into late in the third quarter related to our 2020 senior notes. 
Net interest expense was also reduced by additional interest income earned by our international treasury centers as a result of higher-than-average cash balances in Q4 as compared to Q3. Versus last year, net interest expense was down $9.8 million in the quarter. This was primarily due to the positive impact of the interest rate swaps we entered into over the past year, in mid-Q2 and late Q3, net of the additional interest expense related to the new issuance of senior notes in Q4 of 2014, plus benefits from our cash management efforts in the form of increased interest income earned by our international treasury centers.
Our quarterly tax rate of 33.2% is in line with our normal expectations. Earnings from our affiliates were up slightly in the quarter to $5.7 million. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries increased $3.4 million to $43.4 million, as a result of improved performance at several of our existing subsidiaries that have local minority owners, as well as at several of our new acquisitions. 
As a result, net income was $329.5 million. That's an increase of $15.7 million or 5% versus Q4 last year and an increase of 9.7% compared to the 2013 reported amount. 
Now turning to Page 21. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter, after the allocation of $5.6 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $323.9 million, an increase of 5.7% versus Q4 last year. You can also see our diluted share count for the quarter was 249.9 million, which is down 4.1% versus last year, as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014. Given our overall strong performance in the quarter, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of $0.12 or 10.2% versus Q4 2013 or up $0.17 and 15% compared to the 2013 reported amount.
On Slides 22 through 24, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the full year. To save some time, I will just give you a few highlights.
Full year revenue was up 5%, driven predominantly by organic growth of 5.7%, with FX swinging from positive for the first 9 months of the year to slightly negative for the year, and net acquisitions turning from negative for the first 9 months of the year to slightly positive for the year. EBITDA increased 4.3% to $2.05 billion, while our full year EBITA margin was 13.4%, down about 10 basis points versus last year. As a reminder, the 2014 EBITDA amounts include $8.8 million for merger-related costs incurred earlier in the year. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was 32.8%, slightly below our operating rate of 33.2%, reflecting the impact of the tax benefit we recognized upon termination of the merger in the second quarter. The benefit related to merger expenses recognized in 2013, which were required to be capitalized for tax purposes at that time.
Net income for the year was $1.1 billion, up 7.6% over 2013. And our full year diluted EPS was $4.24 per share, up $0.40 versus 2013 non-GAAP amount of $3.84 and up $0.53 versus our reported 2013 amount of $3.71. Excluding the impact of merger expenses and the related tax benefits from both years, full year diluted EPS for 2014 was $4.23 (sic) [$4.24] per share, up 10.2% versus 2013 diluted EPS of $3.84.
Turning back to Slide 7. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major currencies, most notably the euro, as well as the Australian and Canadian dollars, the real, the ruble and the yen. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $129 million or 3.1%. Looking ahead, considering the recent steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the dollar in a relative short period of time, if FX rates for 2015 stay where they are, FX could have a negative impact on our revenues of approximately 5.5% during the first quarter of 2015 and approximately 5% for the year. Given it is only early February, it's hard to predict what will happen at FX rates for the balance of the year. 
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $26 million, driven by our recent acquisitions in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Turkey and the U.K., as well as here in the U.S. With the transactions that we have completed through December 31, we expect acquisitions, net of dispositions, to add about 50 to 60 basis points to revenue in the first quarter and the year.
And finally, organic growth was positive $240 million or 5.9% this quarter. It was another strong quarter with positive organic growth across all of our markets, with the exceptions being France, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea, and the smaller markets of Latin America. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued excellent performance across our media businesses, driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins; continuing strength domestically and in the U.K., with PR and specialty businesses turning in solid performances this quarter.
In addition to the strong performance in the U.S. and the U.K., our agencies in the emerging markets continued to perform very well. This quarter, we had excellent performances in India, Mexico and the UAE. In the euro markets, overall organic growth was basically flat. Germany and Spain were again positive, as they have been for several quarters, with the French and Dutch markets still struggling. And we continue to see generally good performance across our businesses in our other markets, including Brazil, China, India and our non-euro markets in Europe, although the rate of growth continues to be somewhat uneven market-by-market. 
Slide 8 covers our full year revenue performance, which is basically in line with this quarter's results, except for FX, which was slightly positive through the first 9 months before turning slightly negative for the year.
On Slides 9 and 10, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 57% for North America; 10% for the U.K.; 18% for the rest of Europe; 10% for Asia Pacific; 3% for Latin America; and 2% for Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to the details on Slide 10. In North America, we had organic revenue growth of 8.3%, again, primarily, driven this quarter by the performance of our media businesses, health care and PR businesses. The U.K. once again had a very strong quarter and has been consistently positive organically for the last 2 years.
The rest of Europe was up 1.2%, led by a solid performance in Germany, continuing strong performance in Spain and our other non-euro markets in Europe. On the downside, France and the Netherlands continued to struggle. 
Asia Pacific was up 3.2%. We had strong performances across the region, with India and Singapore leading the way with double-digit growth. China also had a solid quarter, especially in light of a difficult comp versus Q4 of 2013. While Japan and South Korea also facing difficult comps versus Q4 of 2013, experienced softness in the quarter.
Latin America overall was down slightly. A positive performance in Brazil, also facing a difficult comp versus Q4 of last year, and Mexico, was offset by weakness in Chile related to the loss of a significant client in that market, which will continue to cycle into the first half of next year. And Africa and the Middle East region, although off a small base, was up 14%, led by a very strong quarter from our businesses in the UAE.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again was split about evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 8.5%, primarily driven by the excellent performance of our media businesses; and marketing services overall was up 3.4%.
Within marketing services, CRM, coming off a robust performance in Q4 of 2013, was up 1%. The performance was mixed by business and discipline in Q4. Our events in field marketing businesses had a challenging quarter, while our direct marketing, sales promotion and research businesses had strong performances with strength across several markets.
Public relations was up 8.5% relative to a challenging Q4 2013 and reflecting strength in the U.S. and the U.K. in 2014. Specialty communications was up about 9.4% on the strength of our health care businesses in the U.S. and the U.K., partially offset by some weakness in Japan.
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector, keeping in mind these are year-to-date figures for total growth, not just organic growth. As you can see, we're up in almost all categories. The larger changes were in our telecom and other industries group. Telecom continues to be impacted by the loss of BlackBerry. And within other, we benefited from new business wins and project spending from our services clients.
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In 2014, we generated $1.58 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, an increase of 8.6% versus 2013. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14. Dividends paid to our common shareholders were $468 million, up significantly from last year. As a reminder, in 2013, we only made 3 dividend payments because we paid our normal Q1 dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend earlier this year. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $111 million. Capital expenditures were $213 million, which was in line with our expectations for the year.
Acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $207 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan, totaled $994 million.  Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May, post the termination of the merger, we have purchased about 14.3 million shares net. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by about $410 million for the year.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure. As you may be aware, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes at 3.65% during the fourth quarter. As a result, our total debt increased to $4.6 billion as of December 31 and our leverage approximates our historic norms. And our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of $869 million over the past year was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow, as we just discussed, as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance at December 31, 2014, of approximately $275 million.
In spite of the increase in our debt, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1x. And due to both a decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.6x.
Turning to slide 16. We continue to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 20.3% and return on equity increased to 34.3%.
And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from fiscal 2004 through 2014, which totaled $10 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period, totaled $10.8 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 108%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

But we strive to do that regardless of what the growth rates are across all of our businesses. So FX is certainly going to pose a bit of a challenge for us from a margin perspective, which is why I think we're not projecting and predicting and committing to what our margin's going to be for the full year '15. But we always strive, find the right balance. We're always looking for efficiencies and try to make our businesses more effective in the way they manage their cost structure. We have a number of initiatives that have been going on for some time in the areas of real estate, IT and some others, that we certainly continue to see the benefit of. And we expect to continue to push those initiatives in '15, so that they can help us offset whatever challenges FX does present for us. 
But as we had said earlier, the businesses themselves are largely hedged naturally in terms of the local currency of the expenses are the same as the local currency of the revenues, so that's helpful. But it's still certainly a challenge and we're going to continue to work through it every day."

That's something we focus on, on a daily basis, frankly, because we'd rather have it back in the U.S. to deploy it. But I think given the current FX environment, the current economic environment, we think we're likely to see some opportunities in Europe and, frankly, in some of the other markets outside the U.S. that might be a little more attractive to us from a pricing perspective.

Historically, we've been -- historically, we do at least 100 basis points better than GDP growth, but there's a great deal of unrest out there.

I am pleased to morning. I am pleased to speak to you about our first quarter results. As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a solid first quarter with organic growth of 5.1%, giving us a strong start to the year.
We also met our margin targets for the quarter and are on track to meet our internal targets for the full year. As reported in February, the strong U.S. dollar versus other currencies in the world will have a negative impact on our results for 2015.
In the first quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the U.S. FX reduced our non-U.S. revenue by $226 million, representing 13.9% of international revenue and 6.5% of our total revenue.
It is important to point out that our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency. As a result, the primary impact of these FX movements is in our dollar reported revenue and earnings.
Shub will provide more details about the impact of FX on our results later in the call.
Our operational results, excluding the impact of currencies, were excellent during the quarter. More specifically, looking at organic growth by region, North America was up by 4.8%, primarily, driven by brand advertising and more specifically, our media operations. Our U.K. growth was very strong at 9.3%, reflecting solid results across our portfolio of agencies and disciplines.
Euro Markets showed improvement and there are signs of stability in most countries in the region. Growth during the quarter was 2.7%.
France had slightly positive growth, Germany continue to be positive and Spain performed very well while the Netherlands remain negative. Outside the Euro Markets, Czech Republic, Russia and Turkey outperformed during the quarter. Although results in the Euro Markets this quarter are somewhat encouraging, the pace of growth is still somewhat sluggish across the region. We're hopeful that the ECB actions and other structural reforms will be successful and help restore growth in the region.
Turning to Asia. It was up 6.7%, with most markets performing very well, including Australia, China, India, Korea, Singapore and Thailand. And Latin America saw a growth of 3.4%, with strong growth in Brazil and Mexico, offset by a client loss in Chile.
Our ability to consistently win more than our fair share of new business has helped our us deliver our organic growth. For the quarter, and as we recently announced, we had some very good wins, including the consolidation of Wells Fargo media digital business at OMD and Organic; TBWA was awarded Thomson Reuters, Travelers, and the Royal Caribbean business during the quarter.
And just last week, announced the global consolidation of their creative and media across all their brands with BBDO and OMD. These are just a few of the key wins and there are many more throughout the company. I want to congratulate all of our agencies and people for their ongoing success on this front.
Looking at our bottom line, despite the currency impacts on the U.S. dollar, our net income was up just over 2%. And our average share count was down over 5% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of almost 8% to $0.83 per share for the quarter.
Overall, we had solid organic growth, our margins remain strong and in line with our expectations. And we're on track to meet our targets for 2015.
Before turning the call over to Phil, I'd like to make a few comments on what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. As I've discussed in our previous calls, our industry is ongoing immediate transportation,,, as new digital tools and platforms emerge with beauty and technology evolving as an accelerating pace.
As a result, we're moving from marketing to broad audiences to marketing to people. A recent example of this trend in the U.S. is the direction linear TV is headed. In the last few months, we've seen announcements from Apple DIRECTV, Dish, HBO, NBC, Sony and others on the launch of some form of web streaming service. These announcements further demonstrate consumers' desire to access content where they wanted, on the choice of their device and on their.
Another consequence of the rapid transformation of the industry is the huge amount of data that is being generated from new marketing technologies and platforms. I've said before, that an idea's brilliant only if the idea is both brilliantly executed and grounded in a meaningful consumer insight. While the volume of data is important, our ability to drive results through insights is the real value we bring to the table.
As marketers, our people fundamentally need to connect brands with consumers using all relevant insights and across all platforms and devices. With the increasing complexity of the marketing landscape, our clients' demand for our services is only increasing.
As you know, Omnicom has several core strategies to drive growth in this environment. These strategies are focused around continually improving and developing our talents, enhancing our capabilities in new markets and in driving ideas and creativity through consumer insights.
In short, we need to ensure our people can understand and apply new technologies in their creative thinking across disciplines. And we need to invest in tools and platforms that enable our people to drive insight and execute marketing programs on behalf of our clients across all mediums.
To achieve this, our strategy has been for all our agencies to invest in developing digital capabilities from within. For example, our media agencies are reinventing themselves into technology and analytics-driven businesses. Our creative agencies are building capabilities and using insights to produce new types of creative content. And our PR agencies are now experts in navigating social media channels.
We are also continuously investing in the reach functionality of our tools and platforms. All of our agencies from PR to media to advertising and CRM have access to Annalect's centralized analytics and technology platforms.
Of course, technology is not enough, you need smart, talented people who know how to use it. It is here that I think Omnicom truly leads our industry. Omnicom University, which is running in partnership with Harvard business school and is considered 1 of the foremost Executive education programs in our industry has digital skills training and strategy embedded in all aspects of the curriculum. And at the local level, our networks and agencies to do an excellent job of training and development within the context of their specific disciplines. For example, BBDO and productivity have a practice called digital labs, which are leveraged blogs, wide papers, seminars and data happens to keep their people on the leading edge of developments in both digital and interactive marketing. This enables them to apply the latest knowledge in their planning and creative processes.
Similarly, our Media Networks, Omnicom Media Group, has a rigorous and in-person coursework for all their people. Omnicom also cohosts regular training summits for all of our agencies in the United States, Europe and in Asia, in main partnership with companies such as AOL, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapshot where our people are able to experience the latest technologies available in the marketplace.
This training is critical, it is our way to ensure that our talent around the globe has the technology and know-how and digital insights needed to deliver solutions for our clients.
In summary, we're heading into 2015 from a position of strength. We're on track to meet our full year growth targets and have made great strides against our key strategic objectives. Omnicom continues to be an industry leader embracing new technologies and delivering outstanding creative results. I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers. Phil?"
96161,291346922,790887,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.Our organic",1998,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.
Our organic revenue growth for the quarter of 5.1% was above our expectations. While our underlying businesses continued to perform well, the negative impact of FX continues to create a considerable headwind on our revenue.
This quarter, the impact of FX reduced revenue by 6.4% or $226 million. And as was the case last quarter, FX was negative across every one of our significant foreign markets.
As a result, and inclusive of the slightly positive impact from our net acquisitions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.5 billion, down 0.99% versus Q1 last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. FX also had a negative effect on our EBITDA for the quarter, which decreased $2.1 million to $405 million versus our reported figure of $407 million in Q1 last year. However, because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, and currencies in virtually all markets were down, the negative impact of FX on our operating margin was not significant for the quarter.
Additionally, we continue to see the positive impact of our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 11.7%, up 10 basis points versus Q1 2014. And operating income, or EBIT, decreased $5 million to $378 million and our operating margin of 10.9% was unchanged versus Q1 2014, primarily due to the year-over-year increase in the amortization of our intangible assets, resulting from our recent acquisitions.
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.2 million, down $4.8 million versus Q1 of 2014 and up $4.2 million from the fourth quarter. As compared to Q1 of last year, net interest expense was down $4.8 million, primarily due to positive impact of the floating interest rate swap we entered into during May and September of 2014, as well as the small increase in interest income from our cash management efforts, partially offset by the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes.
Versus the fourth quarter, the increase in net interest expense reflected a full quarter's interest on the senior notes issued during October of last year, as well as the reduction in interest income earned by our international Treasury centers in Q1 when compared to Q4, driven by lower cash and working capital levels, which are typical after year end.
Accordingly tax rate of 32.8% is in line with our current tax rate projection for 2015. Earnings from our affiliates was slightly negative during the first quarter and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our last and fully owned subsidiaries decreased by $1.8 million to $20.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of the minority interest in certain subsidiaries in 2014, as well as FX because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.
As a result, net income was $209.1 million, that's an increase of $3.6 million or 1.8% versus Q1 last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $2.8 million of net income to participating securities, which were off by the dividend paying on restricted shares held by our employees, was $206.3 million, an increase of 2.4% versus last year. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 247.4 million, which is down 5.4% versus last year, as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014.
As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.83 per share, an increase of $0.06 or 7.8% versus Q1 2014.
Turning to Slide 4. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against every one of our major currencies. The decrease in value of the euro has the largest translation impact on our revenue but all currencies weakened significantly year-over-year versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter.
This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $226 million or 6.4%. The decline in the value of the euro represented approximately 45% of the total FX impact. other non-Euro currencies in Europe were approximately 15% and the U.K. pound was another 15% of the total FX impact.
Looking ahead, considering this steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, if freights continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues they approximately 7.5% during the second quarter and approximately 6.5% for the full year.
That being said, with current volatility in currency markets hard to pinpoint what will happen to FX rates over the remaining 8-plus months of the year. Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $14 million, driven by our acquisitions in Latin America, Europe and here in the U.S. over the last 12 months. And finally, organic growth was positive $179 million or 5.1% this quarter.
It was another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major markets with a few exceptions. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses, driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins, the most recent being Wells Fargo and early in the second quarter.
Our full-service health care businesses and our CRM and PR categories turned in solid performances this quarter. The continuation of the strong performance in the U.K. across most of our businesses, as well as excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Brazil, Mexico, India, Thailand and our Middle Eastern agencies.
In the Euro Markets, overall organic growth was positive, including France for the first time in a while. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was strong. 
On Slide 5, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 60% for North America, 10% for the U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East.
In North America, in which the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, we had organic revenue growth of 4.8%. Again, primarily, driven this quarter by the performance around media, full-service health care and PR businesses.
Turning to Europe, the U.K. once again had a very strong quarter. The rest of the Europe was up 2.7%, led by our agencies in Germany and Spain, as well as the positive performance of our non-Euro markets in Europe. Netherlands and Italy were again negative for the quarter. And France crossed into positive territory this quarter albeit slightly.
We are still cautiously optimistic about Europe as we head further into 2015, especially in view of the macroeconomic changes being pursued in the region. Asia Pacific was up 6.7%, with strong performances for most of our major Asian markets, including China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea,with 1 exception being Hong Kong. Latin America overall was up 3.4% organically. The positive performance in Brazil, which faced difficult comps versus Q1 of last year, as well as Mexico, was tempered by continued weakness in Chile. As we mentioned on the last few calls, the decrease in Chile was related to the loss of significant local client in that market, which we will finish cycling through in the second quarter of 2015.
In the Africa/Middle East region, although off a small base, was up 10.6%, led by a strong quarter from our businesses in Qatar, the UAE and South Africa. Slide 6 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again was split evenly between advertising and marketing services.
As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 7.7%; and marketing services overall was up 2.7%.
Within marketing services CRM was up 2.6% Eric almost all of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year. Public Relations was up 3.1% and specialty communications is up about 2.6% on strength of our full-service health care businesses.
On Slide 7, we present our mix of business by industry sector. There were no meaningful changes in this mix during the quarter despite a significant impact of FX, which is a good indication of the diversity of our portfolio of clients. Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 8. In the first quarter, we generated $3,022 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 9, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $126 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend that was approved in the second quarter of 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $25 million. Capital expenditures were $38 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments, and net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $32 million Eric and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $256 million.
Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May, post the termination of the merger, we have spent about $1.25 billion and purchased about $17.4 million. All-in, we've outspent spent our free cash flow by about $156 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. Focusing first on our capital structure. As a reminder, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes at 3.65% during the fourth quarter of 2014. This, coupled with a $75 million adjustments to our debt carrying value, related to the end of money amount of our interest rate swaps as required by U.S. GAAP, increased our total debt to 4.6 billion as of March 31. While our net dept position at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion.
The increase in our net debt of $1.1 billion over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $681 million, as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $415 million.
Net debt increased by $891 million compared to year and, as a result of the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances of approximately $140 million; the use of cash in excess of free cash flow for the quarter of $155 million; and the typically uses of working capital that historically occurred in our first quarter.
Although our net debt has increased, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x.
And due  both to the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in the EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9x. Turning to Slide 11. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. The last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.6% and return on equity increased to to 36.3%.
And finally, on Slide 12, we track our cumulative return of of cash to shareholders since 2004, the line on the top of that chart shows our cumulative net income in 2004 through Q1 2015, which totaled $10.2 billion.
And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum, of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But that this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.
Thank you."

On the TV upfront side, I think we should expect a continuation of the kind of cautious approach that we saw this past year between upfront and short-term naturally, some clients are going to want to secure specific properties particularly have initiatives during the year but outside of that, we see a somewhat cautious approach. For those of us that have been following the upfront for long time, I think we're used to the past where the upfront was really a selling time for the entire year that's the market and really has become I think the beginning of the annual sales season and it's an important part of it that it's the beginning of the sales season."

That's the part of all this. And in the long run, people really seem to think that advertisers will increase budgets as long as the return on investment is positive. But in the short run, I am not so sure. There seems to be such pressure on the multinational public companies with their FX pressures and dealing with shareholders that I don't not really sure how much of that efficiency they're reinvesting.

I think clients start -- each brand starts with targets and goals and objectives that they have to reach and if we are able to assist them in achieving those targets in a more efficient way, which is the hope, money doesn't always have to be reinvested back directly into advertising. For the most part, that's not a bad thing for Omnicom. The principal way that we earn our revenues and profits are really in helping clients navigate through the complexity of this new marketplace and where audiences are, how to reach them, how to obtain quantity content so they'll be interested in it. So wear something, which might have been invested in and say traditional TV in the past, if we found on alternate way to get that audience for less money, our part of that might have increased, whereas the traditional TV seller might not see a decline in the our sales."

In fact as we look at video, video is across a number of different platforms, some of it coming from the so-called traditional providers, others coming from full episode providers like Hulu, others coming from more pure digital plays like the YouTube, the Yahoo!s, the AOLs and whatnot. But as we go into sale season, what we're seeing are really initiatives that are coming from some of the more traditional providers in terms of not just offering up digital video but offering up I would say packages or ideas and concepts that allow us to bridge between more aggressively between the conventional sale and the digital capability and the digital products that they now have. And I anticipate that, that's going to be an ever more significant part of the conversations going ahead. We've certainly seen coverage over the past few days of I think leaders of major media companies discovering and like talking about that, that very concept and it's something that both our clients and we as agencies are very interested in discussing how we extract more value for our clients using that kind of approach."

Strongly, help us grow faster a feel we look at the programmatic business today, there's no question that the great majority of it after they exist today is display-based business but the client requirements that we're seeing from the plans will put together show a great demand for programmatic video. So no question in my mind the demand is it there. And where there is demand, generally speaking, we'll see supply response to that. But the availability of I would say premium video is not simply a programmatic question. It goes beyond that as our clients look at it but programmatically and as alternative in the upfront marketplace because content and context are so important to the kind of clients that we have. So there is the, whether it's the content has the right affinity or, whether it's simply just wholesome enough for their brand, it's key and access to that kind of premium video is key to growth.

I'm pleased to speak to you about our first quarter results. As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a solid first quarter with organic growth of 5.1%, giving us a strong start to the year. We also met",1308,"Thank you, Shub. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to speak to you about our first quarter results. As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a solid first quarter with organic growth of 5.1%, giving us a strong start to the year. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and are on track to meet our internal targets for the full year. As reported in February, the strong U.S. dollar versus other currencies in the world will have a negative impact on our results for 2015.
In the first quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the U.S. FX reduced our non-U.S. revenue by $226 million, representing 13.9% of international revenue and 6.5% of our total revenue. It is important to point out that our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency. As a result, the primary impact of these FX movements is in our dollar reported revenue and earnings. Phil will provide more details about the impact of FX on our results later in the call.
Our operational results, excluding the impact of currencies, were excellent during the quarter. More specifically, looking at organic growth by region, North America was up by 4.8%, primarily driven by brand advertising and more specifically, our media operations. Our U.K. growth was very strong at 9.3%, reflecting solid results across our portfolio of agencies and disciplines.
Euro markets showed improvement, and there are signs of stability in most countries in the region. Growth during the quarter was 2.7%.
France had slightly positive growth. Germany continue to be positive, and Spain performed very well, while the Netherlands remain negative. Outside the euro markets, Czech Republic, Russia and Turkey outperformed during the quarter. Although results in the euro markets this quarter are somewhat encouraging, the pace of growth is still somewhat sluggish across the region. We're hopeful that the ECB actions and other structural reforms will be successful and help restore growth in the region.
Turning to Asia. It was up 6.7%, with most markets performing very well, including Australia, China, India, Korea, Singapore and Thailand. And Latin America saw a growth of 3.4%, with strong growth in Brazil and Mexico, offset by a client loss in Chile.
Our ability to consistently win more than our fair share of new business has helped us deliver our organic growth. For the quarter, and as we recently announced, we had some very good wins, including the consolidation of Wells Fargo media and digital business at OMD and Organic. TBWA was awarded Thomson Reuters, Travelers and the Royal Caribbean business during the quarter. And just last week, Bacardi announced the global consolidation of their creative and media across all their brands with BBDO and OMD. These are just a few of the key wins, and there are many more throughout the company. I want to congratulate all of our agencies and people for their ongoing success on this front.
Looking at our bottom line. Despite the currency impacts on the U.S. dollar, our net income was up just over 2%, and our average share count was down over 5% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of almost 8% to $0.83 per share for the quarter. Overall, we had solid organic growth, our margins remain strong and in line with our expectations. And we're on track to meet our targets for 2015.
Before turning the call over to Phil, I'd like to make a few comments on what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. As I've discussed in our previous calls, our industry is undergoing a major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge, with media and technology evolving at an accelerating pace. As a result, we're moving from marketing to broad audiences to marketing to people. A recent example of this trend in the U.S. is the direction linear TV is headed. In the last few months, we've seen announcements from Apple, DIRECTV, DISH, HBO, NBC, Sony and others on the launch of some form of web streaming service. These announcements further demonstrate consumers' desire to access content where they want it, on their choice of their device and on their timetable.
Another consequence of the rapid transformation of the industry is the huge amount of data that is being generated from new marketing technologies and platforms. I've said before that an idea is brilliant only if the idea is both brilliantly executed and grounded in a meaningful consumer insight. While the volume of data is important, our ability to drive results through insights is the real value we bring to the table. As marketers, our people fundamentally need to connect brands with consumers using all relevant insights and across all platforms and devices. With the increasing complexity of the marketing landscape, our clients' demand for our services is only increasing. As you know, Omnicom has several core strategies to drive growth in this environment. These strategies are focused around continually improving and developing our talent, enhancing our capabilities in new markets and in driving ideas and creativity through consumer insights. 
In short, we need to ensure our people can understand and apply new technologies in their creative thinking across disciplines, and we need to invest in tools and platforms that enable our people to drive insight and execute marketing programs on behalf of our clients across all mediums. To achieve this, our strategy has been for our agencies to invest in developing digital capabilities from within. For example, our media agencies are reinventing themselves into technology- and analytics-driven businesses. Our creative agencies are building capabilities and using insights to produce new types of creative content. And our PR agencies are now experts in navigating social media channels. We are also continually investing in the reach and functionality of our tools and platforms. All of our agencies, from PR to media to advertising and CRM, have access to analytics -- centralized analytics and technology platforms.
Of course, technology is not enough. You need smart, talented people who know how to use it. It is here that I think Omnicom truly leads our industry. Omnicom University, which is run in partnership with Harvard Business School and is considered one of the foremost executive education programs in our industry, has digital skills training and strategy embedded in all aspects of the curriculum. And at the local level, our networks and agencies do an excellent job of training and development within the context of their specific disciplines. For example, BBDO and Proximity have a practice called Digital Lab, which leverages blogs, white papers, seminars and data hackathons, to keep their people on the leading edge of developments in both digital and interactive marketing. This enables them to apply the latest knowledge in their planning and creative processes.
Similarly, our media network, Omnicom Media Group, has a rigorous program of online and in-person coursework for all their people. Omnicom also cohosts regular training summits for all of our agencies in the United States, Europe and in Asia in partnership with companies such as AOL, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat, where our people are able to experience the latest technologies available in the marketplace. This training is critical. It is our way to ensure that our talent around the globe has the technology know-how and digital insights needed to deliver solutions for our clients.
In summary, we're heading into 2015 from a position of strength. We're on track to meet our full year growth targets and have made great strides against our key strategic objectives. Omnicom continues to be an industry leader embracing new technologies and delivering outstanding creative results. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers. Phil?"
96161,291346922,791133,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.Our organic",2000,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.
Our organic revenue growth for the quarter of 5.1% was above our expectation. While our underlying businesses continued to perform well, the negative impact of FX continues to create a considerable headwind on our revenue. This quarter, the impact of FX reduced revenue by 6.4% or $226 million. And as was the case last quarter, FX was negative across every one of our significant foreign markets.
As a result, and inclusive of the slightly positive impact from our net acquisitions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.5 billion, down 0.9% versus Q1 last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
FX also had a negative effect on our EBITDA for the quarter, which decreased $2.1 million to $405 million versus our reported figure of $407 million in Q1 last year. However, because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues and currencies in virtually all markets were down, the negative impact of FX on our operating margin was not significant for the quarter.
Additionally, we continue to see the positive impact of our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 11.7%, up 10 basis points versus Q1 2014. And operating income, or EBIT, decreased $5 million to $378 million. And our operating margin of 10.9% was unchanged versus Q1 2014, primarily due to the year-over-year increase in the amortization of our intangible assets, resulting from our recent acquisitions.
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.2 million, down $4.8 million versus Q1 of 2014 and up $4.2 million from the fourth quarter. As compared to Q1 of last year, net interest expense was down $4.8 million, primarily due to the positive impact of the floating interest rate swap we entered into during May and September of 2014 as well as the small increase in interest income from our cash management effort, partially offset by the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes. Versus the fourth quarter, the increase in net interest expense reflected a full quarter's interest on the senior notes issued during October of last year as well as the reduction in interest income earned by our international treasury centers in Q1 when compared to Q4, driven by lower cash and working capital levels, which are typical after year-end.
Quarterly tax rate of 32.8% is in line with our current tax rate projection for 2015. Earnings from our affiliates was slightly negative during the first quarter, and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our last and fully owned subsidiaries decreased by $1.8 million to $20.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries in 2014 as well as FX because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $209.1 million. That's an increase of $3.6 million or 1.8% versus Q1 last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $2.8 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the dividend paying unrestricted shares held by our employees, was $206.3 million, an increase of 2.4% versus last year. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 247.4 million, which is down 5.4% versus last year as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.83 per share, an increase of $0.06 or 7.8% versus Q1 2014.
Turning to Slide 4. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against every one of our major currencies. The decrease in value of the euro had the largest translation impact on our revenue, but all currencies weakened significantly year-over-year versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $226 million or 6.4%. The decline in the value of the euro represented approximately 45% of the total FX impact. Other non-euro currencies in Europe were approximately 15%, and the U.K. pound was another 15% of the total FX impact. 
Looking ahead, considering the steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, if rates continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7.5% during the second quarter and approximately 6.5% for the full year. That being said, with current volatility in currency markets, it is hard to pinpoint what will happen to FX rates over the remaining 8-plus months of the year. 
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $14 million, driven by our acquisitions in Latin America, Europe and here in the U.S. over the last 12 months. And finally, organic growth was positive $179 million or 5.1% this quarter.
It was another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major markets with a few exceptions. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses, driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins, the most recent being Wells Fargo and Bacardi early in the second quarter.
Our full-service health care businesses and our CRM and PR categories turned in solid performances this quarter; the continuation of the strong performance in the U.K. across most of our businesses; as well as excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Brazil, Mexico, India, Thailand and our Middle Eastern agencies. In the euro markets, overall organic growth was positive, including France, for the first time in a while. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was strong. 
On Slide 5, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 60% for North America, 10% for the U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East. In North America, in which the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, we had organic revenue growth of 4.8%, again primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our media, full-service health care and PR businesses.
Turning to Europe. The U.K. once again had a very strong quarter. The rest of Europe was up 2.7%, led by our agencies in Germany and Spain as well as the positive performance of our non-euro markets in Europe. The Netherlands and Italy were again negative for the quarter, and France crossed into positive territory this quarter albeit slightly. We are still cautiously optimistic about Europe as we head further into 2015, especially in view of the macroeconomic changes being pursued in the region. 
Asia Pacific was up 6.7%, with strong performances from most of our major Asian markets, including China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, with one exception being Hong Kong. Latin America overall was up 3.4% organically. The positive performance in Brazil, which faced difficult comps versus Q1 of last year, as well as Mexico was tempered by continued weakness in Chile. As we mentioned on the last few calls, the decrease in Chile was related to the loss of a significant local client in that market, which we will finish cycling through in the second quarter of 2015.
In the Africa and Middle East region, although off a small base, was up 10.6%, led by a strong quarter from our businesses in Qatar, the UAE and South Africa. 
Slide 6 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again is split evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 7.7%, and marketing services overall was up 2.7%. Within marketing services, CRM was up 2.6%. Almost all of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year. Public relations was up 3.1%, and specialty communications is up about 2.6% on the strength of our full-service health care businesses.
On Slide 7, we present our mix of business by industry sector. There were no meaningful changes in this mix during the quarter despite the significant impact of FX, which is a good indication of the diversity of our portfolio of clients. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 8. In the first quarter, we generated $322 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 9, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $126 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend that was approved in the second quarter of 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $25 million. Capital expenditures were $38 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments and net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $32 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $256 million.
Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May post the termination of the merger, we have spent about $1.25 billion and purchased about 17.4 million shares net. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $156 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. Focusing first on our capital structure. As a reminder, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes at 3.65% during the fourth quarter of 2014. This, coupled with the $75 million adjustment to our debt carrying value, related to the end of money amount of our interest rate swaps as required by U.S. GAAP, increased our total debt to $4.6 billion as of March 31, while our net dept position at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion. The increase in our net debt of $1.1 billion over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $681 million as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $415 million.
Net debt increased by $891 million compared to year-end as a result of the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances of approximately $140 million, the use of cash in excess of free cash flow for the quarter of $155 million and the typical uses of working capital that historically occur in our first quarter. 
Although our net debt has increased, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. And due to both the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9x. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.6%, and return on equity increased to 36.3%.
And finally, on Slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 to Q1 2015, which totaled $10.2 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

On the TV upfront side, I think we should expect a continuation of the kind of cautious approach that we saw this past year between upfront and short term naturally. Some clients are going to want to secure specific properties, particularly if they have initiatives during the year. But outside of that, we see a somewhat cautious approach. For those of us that have been following the upfront for a long time, I think we're used to the past, where the upfront was really a selling time for the entire year that's at the market. It really has become, I think, the beginning of the annual sales season. And it's an important part of it, but it's the beginning of the sales season."

And it seems to me that as we speak with industry players on the advertiser side, the agency side, the media operating side that the biggest thing they all talk about in terms of technology offering us, and we're really beginning to see it as kind of more efficient achievement of reaching impressions we target, right? That's part of all this. And in the long run, people really seem to think that advertisers will increase budgets as long as the return on investment is positive. But in the short run, like I'm not so sure. There seems to be such pressure on the multinational public companies with their FX pressures and dealing with shareholders that I don't -- I'm not really sure how much of that efficiency they're reinvesting. And how do you feel about that right now? Do you think clients are redeploying the savings that you're bringing them in terms of the efficiency of reach? Or are they sort of banking it? And how do you see that developing over time?"

I think clients start -- each brand starts with targets and goals and objectives that they have to reach. And if we are able to assist them in achieving those targets in a more efficient way, which is the hope, the money doesn't always have to be reinvested back directly into advertising. For the most part, that's not a bad thing for Omnicom. The principal way that we earn our revenues and profits are really in helping clients navigate through the complexity of this new marketplace and where audiences are, how to reach them, how to obtain quality content so they'll be interested in it. So whereas something which might have been invested in, say, traditional TV in the past, if we found an alternate way to get that audience for less money, our part of that might have increased, whereas the traditional TV seller might not -- might see a decline in their sales."

But as we go into sales season, what we're seeing are real initiatives that are coming from some of the more traditional providers in terms of not just offering up digital video, but offering up, I would say, packages or ideas and concepts that allow us to bridge between -- more aggressively between the conventional sale and the digital capability and the digital products that they now have. And I anticipate that that's going to be an ever more significant part of the conversations going ahead. We've certainly seen coverage over the past few days of, I think, leaders of major media companies, Discovery and the like, talking about that very concept. And it's something that both our clients and we, as agencies, are very interested in discussing how we extract more value for our clients using that kind of approach."

Our creative people, our account people, every one of our employees has to be very current in terms of what's out there, how it can be used to creatively create the tools and products that we need. So it -- we're very pleased to have the foundation that we have, and we keep adjusting and adding to it.

I don't know if you look at it that way or if you think that's the right math, but I just wanted to get your commentary on whether that business is bigger than you thought and what the impact is to your overall organic growth. And then I'll -- since it's the last question, I'll ask Daryl. One of the things on programmatic we've heard is just the lack of premium inventory generally, particularly around video. I know the TV networks have been very reluctant to move inventory into these platforms, and even some of the digital players are a little nervous about it. Can you just give us an update on whether you're seeing a change there and whether that's something that you think can make this business grow even faster in 2015?"

Well, I think it can certainly help the business grow faster. But if we look at the programmatic business today, there's no question that the great majority of it, as it exists today, is display-based business. But the client requirements that we're seeing from the plans that we've put together show a great demand for programmatic video. So there's a little question in my mind that the demand is it there. And where there is demand, generally speaking, we'll see supply respond to that. But the availability of, I would say, premium video is not simply a programmatic question. It goes beyond that as our clients look at it but programmatically and as alternatives in the upfront marketplace because content and context are so important to the kind of clients that we have. So there is the -- whether it's the content has the right affinity or whether it's simply just wholesome enough for their brand is key, and access to that kind of premium video is key to growth. There's no question, though, that the demand is there for it."

Again, though, we're not really drawing too many trends on one particular quarter as it relates to the rest of the year because I don't think the first quarter is going to tell the story for the year. But I'd say the programmatic business in Q1 of '14 was probably still continuing to ramp up, and the performance this year in the first quarter was good. But I don't think we're drawing any trends, that, that level of growth and that, that number is necessarily going to continue throughout the rest of the year."

We also met",1308,"Thank you, Shub. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to speak to you about our first quarter results. As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a solid first quarter with organic growth of 5.1%, giving us a strong start to the year. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and are on track to meet our internal targets for the full year. As reported in February, the strong U.S. dollar versus other currencies in the world will have a negative impact on our results for 2015.
In the first quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the U.S. FX reduced our non-U.S. revenue by $226 million, representing 13.9% of international revenue and 6.5% of our total revenue. It is important to point out that our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency. As a result, the primary impact of these FX movements is in our dollar reported revenue and earnings. Phil will provide more details about the impact of FX on our results later in the call.
Our operational results, excluding the impact of currencies, were excellent during the quarter. More specifically, looking at organic growth by region, North America was up by 4.8%, primarily driven by brand advertising and more specifically, our media operations. Our U.K. growth was very strong at 9.3%, reflecting solid results across our portfolio of agencies and disciplines. Euro markets showed improvement, and there are signs of stability in most countries in the region. Growth during the quarter was 2.7%.
France had slightly positive growth, Germany continued to be positive, and Spain performed very well, while the Netherlands remain negative. Outside the euro markets, Czech Republic, Russia and Turkey outperformed during the quarter. Although results in the euro markets this quarter are somewhat encouraging, the pace of growth is still somewhat sluggish across the region. We're hopeful that the ECB actions and other structural reforms will be successful and help restore growth in the region. Turning to Asia. It was up 6.7%, with most markets performing very well, including Australia, China, India, Korea, Singapore and Thailand. And Latin America saw a growth of 3.4%, with strong growth in Brazil and Mexico, offset by a client loss in Chile.
Our ability to consistently win more than our fair share of new business has helped us deliver our organic growth. For the quarter, and as we recently announced, we had some very good wins, including the consolidation of Wells Fargo media and digital business at OMD and Organic. TBWA was awarded Thomson Reuters, Travelers and the Royal Caribbean business during the quarter. And just last week, Bacardi announced the global consolidation of their creative and media across all their brands with BBDO and OMD. These are just a few of the key wins, and there are many more throughout the company. I want to congratulate all of our agencies and people for their ongoing success on this front.
Looking at our bottom line. Despite the currency impacts on the U.S. dollar, our net income was up just over 2%, and our average share count was down over 5% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of almost 8% to $0.83 per share for the quarter. Overall, we had solid organic growth, our margins remain strong and in line with our expectations. And we're on track to meet our targets for 2015.
Before turning the call over to Phil, I'd like to make a few comments on what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. As I've discussed in our previous calls, our industry is undergoing a major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge, with media and technology evolving at an accelerating pace. As a result, we're moving from marketing to broad audiences to marketing to people. A recent example of this trend in the U.S. is the direction linear TV is headed. In the last few months, we've seen announcements from Apple, DIRECTV, DISH, HBO, NBC, Sony and others on the launch of some form of web streaming service. These announcements further demonstrate consumers' desire to access content where they want it, on their choice of their device and on their timetable.
Another consequence of the rapid transformation of the industry is the huge amount of data that is being generated from new marketing technologies and platforms. I've said before that an idea is brilliant only if the idea is both brilliantly executed and grounded in a meaningful consumer insight. While the volume of data is important, our ability to drive results through insights is the real value we bring to the table. As marketers, our people fundamentally need to connect brands with consumers using all relevant insights and across all platforms and devices. With the increasing complexity of the marketing landscape, our clients' demand for our services is only increasing. As you know, Omnicom has several core strategies to drive growth in this environment. These strategies are focused around continually improving and developing our talent, enhancing our capabilities in new markets and in driving ideas and creativity through consumer insights. 
In short, we need to ensure our people can understand and apply new technologies in their creative thinking across disciplines, and we need to invest in tools and platforms that enable our people to derive insight and execute marketing programs on behalf of our clients across all mediums. To achieve this, our strategy has been for our agencies to invest in developing digital capabilities from within. For example, our media agencies are reinventing themselves into technology- and analytics-driven businesses. Our creative agencies are building capabilities and using insights to produce new types of creative content. And our PR agencies are now experts in navigating social media channels. We are also continually investing in the reach and functionality of our tools and platforms. All of our agencies, from PR to media to advertising and CRM, have access to analytics -- centralized analytics and technology platforms.
Of course, technology is not enough. You need smart, talented people who know how to use it. It is here that I think Omnicom truly leads our industry. Omnicom University, which is run in partnership with Harvard Business School and is considered one of the foremost executive education programs in our industry, has digital skills training and strategy embedded in all aspects of the curriculum. And at the local level, our networks and agencies do an excellent job of training and development within the context of their specific disciplines. For example, BBDO and Proximity have a practice called Digital Labs, which leverages blogs, white papers, seminars and data hackathons, to keep their people on the leading edge of developments in both digital and interactive marketing. This enables them to apply the latest knowledge in their planning and creative processes.
Similarly, our media network, Omnicom Media Group, has a rigorous program of online and in-person coursework for all their people. Omnicom also cohosts regular training summits for all of our agencies in the United States, Europe and in Asia in partnership with companies such as AOL, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat, where our people are able to experience the latest technologies available in the marketplace. This training is critical. It is our way to ensure that our talent around the globe has the technology know-how and digital insights needed to deliver solutions for our clients.
In summary, we're heading into 2015 from a position of strength. We're on track to meet our full year growth targets and have made great strides against our key strategic objectives. Omnicom continues to be an industry leader embracing new technologies and delivering outstanding creative results. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers. Phil?"
96161,291346922,791284,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.Our organic",2002,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.
Our organic revenue growth for the quarter of 5.1% was above our expectation. While our underlying businesses continue to perform well, the negative impact of FX continues to create a considerable headwind on our revenue. This quarter, the impact of FX reduced revenue by 6.4% or $226 million. And as was the case last quarter, FX was negative across every one of our significant foreign markets. As a result, and inclusive of the slightly positive impact from our net acquisitions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.5 billion, down 0.9% versus Q1 last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
FX also had a negative effect on our EBITDA for the quarter, which decreased $2.1 million to $405 million versus our reported figure of $407 million in Q1 last year. However, because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues and currencies in virtually all markets were down, the negative impact of FX on our operating margin was not significant for the quarter. Additionally, we continue to see the positive impact of our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 11.7%, up 10 basis points versus Q1 2014. And operating income, or EBIT, decreased $5 million to $378 million. And our operating margin of 10.9% was unchanged versus Q1 2014, primarily due to the year-over-year increase in the amortization of our intangible assets, resulting from our recent acquisitions.
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.2 million, down $4.8 million versus Q1 of 2014 and up $4.2 million from the fourth quarter. As compared to Q1 of last year, net interest expense was down $4.8 million, primarily due to the positive impact of a floating interest rate swap we entered into during May and September of 2014 as well as the small increase in interest income from our cash management effort, partially offset by the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes. Versus the fourth quarter, the increase in net interest expense reflected a full quarter's interest on the senior notes issued during October of last year as well as the reduction in interest income earned by our international treasury centers in Q1 when compared to Q4, driven by lower cash and working capital levels, which are typical after year-end.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% is in line with our current tax rate projection for 2015. Earnings from our affiliates were slightly negative during the first quarter, and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased by $1.8 million to $20.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of a minority interest in certain subsidiaries in 2014 as well as FX because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $209.1 million. That's an increase of $3.6 million or 1.8% versus Q1 last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $2.8 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the dividend paying unrestricted shares held by our employees, was $206.3 million, an increase of 2.4% versus last year. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 247.4 million, which is down 5.4% versus last year as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.83 per share, an increase of $0.06 or 7.8% versus Q1 2014.
Turning to Slide 4. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against every one of our major currencies. The decrease in value of the euro had the largest translation impact on our revenue, but all currencies weakened significantly year-over-year versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $226 million or 6.4%. The decline in the value of the euro represented approximately 45% of the total FX impact. Other non-euro currencies in Europe were approximately 15%, and the U.K. pound was another 15% of the total FX impact. 
Looking ahead, considering the steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, if rates continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7.5% during the second quarter and approximately 6.5% for the full year. That being said, with current volatility in currency markets, it is hard to pinpoint what will happen to FX rates over the remaining 8-plus months of the year.  Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $14 million, driven by our acquisitions in Latin America, Europe and here in the U.S. over the last 12 months. And finally, organic growth was positive $179 million or 5.1% this quarter.
It was another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major markets with a few exceptions. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses, driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins, the most recent being Wells Fargo and Bacardi early in the second quarter. Our full-service health care businesses and our CRM and PR categories turned in solid performances this quarter; the continuation of the strong performance in the U.K. across most of our businesses; as well as excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Brazil, Mexico, India, Thailand and our Middle Eastern agencies. In the Euro markets, overall organic growth was positive, including France, for the first time in a while. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was strong. 
On Slide 5, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 60% for North America, 10% for the U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East. In North America, in which the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, we had organic revenue growth of 4.8%, again primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our media, full-service health care and PR businesses.
Turning to Europe. The U.K. once again had a very strong quarter. The rest of Europe was up 2.7%, led by our agencies in Germany and Spain as well as the positive performance of our non-euro markets in Europe. The Netherlands and Italy were again negative for the quarter, and France crossed into positive territory this quarter, albeit slightly. We are still cautiously optimistic about Europe as we head further into 2015, especially in view of the macroeconomic changes being pursued in the region. 
Asia Pacific was up 6.7%, with strong performances from most of our major Asian markets, including China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, with one exception being Hong Kong. Latin America overall was up 3.4% organically. The positive performance in Brazil, which faced difficult comps versus Q1 of last year, as well as Mexico was tempered by continued weakness in Chile. As we mentioned on the last few calls, the decrease in Chile was related to the loss of a significant local client in that market, which we will finish cycling through in the second quarter of 2015. In the Africa and Middle East region, although off a small base, was up 10.6%, led by a strong quarter from our businesses in Qatar, the UAE and South Africa. 
Slide 6 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again was split evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 7.7%, and marketing services overall was up 2.7%. Within marketing services, CRM was up 2.6%. Almost all of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year. Public relations was up 3.1%, and specialty communications is up about 2.6% on the strength of our full-service health care businesses.
On Slide 7, we present our mix of business by industry sector. There were no meaningful changes in this mix during the quarter despite the significant impact of FX, which is a good indication of the diversity of our portfolio of clients. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 8. In the first quarter, we generated $322 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 9, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $126 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend that was approved in the second quarter of 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $25 million. Capital expenditures were $38 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments and net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $32 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan, totaled $256 million. Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May post the termination of the merger, we have spent about $1.25 billion and purchased about 17.4 million shares net. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $156 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. Focusing first on our capital structure. As a reminder, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes at 3.65% during the fourth quarter of 2014. This, coupled with the $75 million adjustment to our debt carrying value, related to the in the money amount of our interest rate swaps as required by U.S. GAAP, increased our total debt to $4.6 billion as of March 31, while our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion. The increase in our net debt of $1.1 billion over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $681 million as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $415 million.
Net debt increased by $891 million compared to year-end as a result of the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances of approximately $140 million, the use of cash in excess of free cash flow for the quarter of $155 million and the typical uses of working capital that historically occur in our first quarter.  Although our net debt has increased, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. And due to both the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9x. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.6%, and return on equity increased to 36.3%.
And finally, on Slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 to Q1 2015, which totaled $10.2 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

But on the other hand, we do have expectations. The expectations are that the trends that we've really seen, I would say, over the past 18 months or so are going to continue. And what that means on balance, we've seen, of course, above-average growth in digital, and that's been driven by premium video, which we see continued increasing interest in. On the TV upfront side, I think we should expect a continuation of the kind of cautious approach that we saw this past year between upfront and short term naturally. Some clients are going to want to secure specific properties, particularly if they have initiatives during the year. But outside of that, we see a somewhat cautious approach. For those of us that have been following the upfront for a long time, I think we're used to the past, where the upfront was really a selling time for the entire year that's at the market. It really has become, I think, the beginning of the annual sales season. And it's an important part of it, but it's the beginning of the sales season."

And I resist the temptation to drill down further on the quarter and I think use the opportunity to ask some sort of bigger-picture questions here. And it seems to me that as we speak with industry players on the advertiser side, the agency side, the media operating side, that the biggest thing they all talk about in terms of technology offering us, and we're really beginning to see it, is kind of more efficient achievement of reaching impressions we target, right? That's part of all this. And in the long run, people really seem to think that advertisers will increase budgets as long as the return on investment is positive. But in the short run, like I'm not so sure. There seems to be such pressure on the multinational public companies with their FX pressures and dealing with shareholders that I don't -- I'm not really sure how much of that efficiency they're reinvesting. And how do you feel about that right now? Do you think clients are redeploying the savings that you're bringing them in terms of the efficiency of reach? Or are they sort of banking it? And how do you see that developing over time?"

They're still supporting their brands, but maybe not to the level that -- of the efficiencies. I think clients start -- each brand starts with targets and goals and objectives that they have to reach. And if we are able to assist them in achieving those targets in a more efficient way, which is the hope, the money doesn't always have to be reinvested back directly into advertising. For the most part, that's not a bad thing for an Omnicom. The principal way that we earn our revenues and profits are really in helping clients navigate through the complexity of this new marketplace and where audiences are, how to reach them, how to obtain quality content so they'll be interested in it. So whereas something which might have been invested in, say, traditional TV in the past, if we found an alternate way to get that audience for less money, our part of that might have increased, whereas the traditional TV seller might not -- might see a decline in their sales."

But as we go into sales season, what we're seeing are real initiatives that are coming from some of the more traditional providers in terms of not just offering up digital video, but offering up, I would say, packages or ideas and concepts that allow us to bridge between -- more aggressively between the conventional sale and the digital capability and the digital products that they now have. And I anticipate that that's going to be an ever more significant part of the conversations going ahead. We've certainly seen coverage over the past few days of, I think, leaders of major media companies, Discovery and the like, talking about that very concept.

I think it's the -- a major part of that formula is going to be the balance between the long-term and short-term strategies that sellers take in this marketplace. I would add, I think that CPMs, of course, are one way to look at the marketplace. I think the general trend here is -- or longer-term trend is more significant and that is that, generally speaking, our clients are moving to -- many clients, at least, are moving to looking at business measures. What do the aggregation of the investments that they're making across media types do to move their business with the data capabilities that we have? And they are somewhat less inclined to focus simply on what might be called process measures, which are the CPMs reaching frequency. It's becoming increasingly an overall ROI discussion with our clients.

Can you just give us an update on whether you're seeing a change there and whether that's something that you think can make this business grow even faster in 2015?"

But if we look at the programmatic business today, there's no question that the great majority of it, as it exists today, is a display-based business. But the client requirements that we're seeing from the plans that we've put together show a great demand for programmatic video. So there's a little question in my mind that the demand is it there. And where there is demand, generally speaking, we'll see supply respond to that. But the availability of, I would say, premium video is not simply a programmatic question. It goes beyond that as our clients look at it both programmatically and as alternatives in the upfront marketplace because content and context are so important to the kind of clients that we have. So there is the -- whether it's the content has the right affinity or whether it's simply just wholesome enough for their brand is key, and access to that kind of premium video is key to growth.

As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a solid first quarter with organic growth of 5.1%, giving us a strong start to the year. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and are on track to meet our internal targets for the full year. As reported in February, the strong U.S. dollar versus other currencies in the world will have a negative impact on our results for 2015.
In the first quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the U.S. FX reduced our non-U.S. revenue by $226 million, representing 13.9% of international revenue and 6.5% of our total revenue. It is important to point out that our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency. As a result, the primary impact of these FX movements is in our dollar reported revenue and earnings. Phil will provide more details about the impact of FX on our results later in the call.
Our operational results, excluding the impact of currencies, were excellent during the quarter. More specifically, looking at organic growth by region, North America was up by 4.8%, primarily driven by brand advertising and more specifically, our media operations. Our U.K. growth was very strong at 9.3%, reflecting solid results across our portfolio of agencies and disciplines. Euro markets showed improvement, and there are signs of stability in most countries in the region. Growth during the quarter was 2.7%.
France had slightly positive growth, Germany continued to be positive, and Spain performed very well, while the Netherlands remain negative. Outside the euro markets, Czech Republic, Russia and Turkey outperformed during the quarter. Although results in the euro markets this quarter are somewhat encouraging, the pace of growth is still somewhat sluggish across the region. We're hopeful that the ECB actions and other structural reforms will be successful and help restore growth in the region. Turning to Asia. It was up 6.7%, with most markets performing very well, including Australia, China, India, Korea, Singapore and Thailand. And Latin America saw a growth of 3.4%, with strong growth in Brazil and Mexico, offset by a client loss in Chile.
Our ability to consistently win more than our fair share of new business has helped us deliver our organic growth. For the quarter, and as we recently announced, we had some very good wins, including the consolidation of Wells Fargo media and digital business at OMD and Organic. TBWA was awarded Thomson Reuters, Travelers and the Royal Caribbean business during the quarter. And just last week, Bacardi announced the global consolidation of their creative and media across all their brands with BBDO and OMD. These are just a few of the key wins, and there are many more throughout the company. I want to congratulate all of our agencies and people for their ongoing success on this front.
Looking at our bottom line. Despite the currency impacts on the U.S. dollar, our net income was up just over 2%, and our average share count was down over 5% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of almost 8% to $0.83 per share for the quarter. Overall, we had solid organic growth, our margins remain strong and in line with our expectations. And we're on track to meet our targets for 2015.
Before turning the call over to Phil, I'd like to make a few comments on what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. As I've discussed in our previous calls, our industry is undergoing a major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge, with media and technology evolving at an accelerating pace. As a result, we're moving from marketing to broad audiences to marketing to people. A recent example of this trend in the U.S. is the direction linear TV is headed. In the last few months, we've seen announcements from Apple, DIRECTV, DISH, HBO, NBC, Sony and others on the launch of some form of web streaming service. These announcements further demonstrate consumers' desire to access content where they want it, on their choice of their device and on their timetable.
Another consequence of the rapid transformation of the industry is the huge amount of data that is being generated from new marketing technologies and platforms. I've said before that an idea is brilliant only if the idea is both brilliantly executed and grounded in a meaningful consumer insight. While the volume of data is important, our ability to drive results through insights is the real value we bring to the table. As marketers, our people fundamentally need to connect brands with consumers using all relevant insights and across all platforms and devices. With the increasing complexity of the marketing landscape, our clients' demand for our services is only increasing. As you know, Omnicom has several core strategies to drive growth in this environment. These strategies are focused around continually improving and developing our talent, enhancing our capabilities in new markets and in driving ideas and creativity through consumer insights. 
In short, we need to ensure our people can understand and apply new technologies in their creative thinking across disciplines, and we need to invest in tools and platforms that enable our people to derive insight and execute marketing programs on behalf of our clients across all mediums. To achieve this, our strategy has been for our agencies to invest in developing digital capabilities from within. For example, our media agencies are reinventing themselves into technology- and analytics-driven businesses. Our creative agencies are building capabilities and using insights to produce new types of creative content. And our PR agencies are now experts in navigating social media channels. We are also continually investing in the reach and functionality of our tools and platforms. All of our agencies, from PR to media to advertising and CRM, have access to analytics -- centralized analytics and technology platforms.
Of course, technology is not enough. You need smart, talented people who know how to use it. It is here that I think Omnicom truly leads our industry. Omnicom University, which is run in partnership with Harvard Business School and is considered one of the foremost executive education programs in our industry, has digital skills training and strategy embedded in all aspects of the curriculum. And at the local level, our networks and agencies do an excellent job of training and development within the context of their specific disciplines. For example, BBDO and Proximity have a practice called Digital Labs, which leverages blogs, white papers, seminars and data hackathons, to keep their people on the leading edge of developments in both digital and interactive marketing. This enables them to apply the latest knowledge in their planning and creative processes.
Similarly, our media network, Omnicom Media Group, has a rigorous program of online and in-person coursework for all their people. Omnicom also cohosts regular training summits for all of our agencies in the United States, Europe and in Asia in partnership with companies such as AOL, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat, where our people are able to experience the latest technologies available in the marketplace. This training is critical. It is our way to ensure that our talent around the globe has the technology know-how and digital insights needed to deliver solutions for our clients.
In summary, we're heading into 2015 from a position of strength. We're on track to meet our full year growth targets and have made great strides against our key strategic objectives. Omnicom continues to be an industry leader embracing new technologies and delivering outstanding creative results. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers. Phil?"

As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.Our organic",2002,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.
Our organic revenue growth for the quarter of 5.1% was above our expectation. While our underlying businesses continue to perform well, the negative impact of FX continues to create a considerable headwind on our revenue. This quarter, the impact of FX reduced revenue by 6.4% or $226 million. And as was the case last quarter, FX was negative across every one of our significant foreign markets. As a result, and inclusive of the slightly positive impact from our net acquisitions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.5 billion, down 0.9% versus Q1 last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
FX also had a negative effect on our EBITDA for the quarter, which decreased $2.1 million to $405 million versus our reported figure of $407 million in Q1 last year. However, because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues and currencies in virtually all markets were down, the negative impact of FX on our operating margin was not significant for the quarter. Additionally, we continue to see the positive impact of our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 11.7%, up 10 basis points versus Q1 2014. And operating income, or EBIT, decreased $5 million to $378 million. And our operating margin of 10.9% was unchanged versus Q1 2014, primarily due to the year-over-year increase in the amortization of our intangible assets, resulting from our recent acquisitions.
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.2 million, down $4.8 million versus Q1 of 2014 and up $4.2 million from the fourth quarter. As compared to Q1 of last year, net interest expense was down $4.8 million, primarily due to the positive impact of a floating interest rate swap we entered into during May and September of 2014 as well as the small increase in interest income from our cash management effort, partially offset by the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes. Versus the fourth quarter, the increase in net interest expense reflected a full quarter's interest on the senior notes issued during October of last year as well as the reduction in interest income earned by our international treasury centers in Q1 when compared to Q4, driven by lower cash and working capital levels, which are typical after year-end.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% is in line with our current tax rate projection for 2015. Earnings from our affiliates were slightly negative during the first quarter, and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased by $1.8 million to $20.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of a minority interest in certain subsidiaries in 2014 as well as FX because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $209.1 million. That's an increase of $3.6 million or 1.8% versus Q1 last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $2.8 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the dividend paying unrestricted shares held by our employees, was $206.3 million, an increase of 2.4% versus last year. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 247.4 million, which is down 5.4% versus last year as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.83 per share, an increase of $0.06 or 7.8% versus Q1 2014.
Turning to Slide 4. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against every one of our major currencies. The decrease in value of the euro had the largest translation impact on our revenue, but all currencies weakened significantly year-over-year versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $226 million or 6.4%. The decline in the value of the euro represented approximately 45% of the total FX impact. Other non-euro currencies in Europe were approximately 15%, and the U.K. pound was another 15% of the total FX impact. 
Looking ahead, considering the steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, if rates continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7.5% during the second quarter and approximately 6.5% for the full year. That being said, with current volatility in currency markets, it is hard to pinpoint what will happen to FX rates over the remaining 8-plus months of the year. Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $14 million, driven by our acquisitions in Latin America, Europe and here in the U.S. over the last 12 months. And finally, organic growth was positive $179 million or 5.1% this quarter.
It was another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major markets with a few exceptions. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses, driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins, the most recent being Wells Fargo and Bacardi early in the second quarter. Our full-service health care businesses and our CRM and PR categories turned in solid performances this quarter; the continuation of the strong performance in the U.K. across most of our businesses; as well as excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Brazil, Mexico, India, Thailand and our Middle Eastern agencies. In the Euro markets, overall organic growth was positive, including France, for the first time in a while. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was strong. 
On Slide 5, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 60% for North America, 10% for the U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East. In North America, in which the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, we had organic revenue growth of 4.8%, again primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our media, full-service health care and PR businesses.
Turning to Europe. The U.K. once again had a very strong quarter. The rest of Europe was up 2.7%, led by our agencies in Germany and Spain as well as the positive performance of our non-euro markets in Europe. The Netherlands and Italy were again negative for the quarter, and France crossed into positive territory this quarter, albeit slightly. We are still cautiously optimistic about Europe as we head further into 2015, especially in view of the macroeconomic changes being pursued in the region. 
Asia Pacific was up 6.7%, with strong performances from most of our major Asian markets, including China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, with one exception being Hong Kong. Latin America overall was up 3.4% organically. The positive performance in Brazil, which faced difficult comps versus Q1 of last year, as well as Mexico was tempered by continued weakness in Chile. As we mentioned on the last few calls, the decrease in Chile was related to the loss of a significant local client in that market, which we will finish cycling through in the second quarter of 2015. In the Africa and Middle East region, although off a small base, was up 10.6%, led by a strong quarter from our businesses in Qatar, the UAE and South Africa. 
Slide 6 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again was split evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 7.7%, and marketing services overall was up 2.7%. Within marketing services, CRM was up 2.6%. Almost all of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year. Public relations was up 3.1%, and specialty communications is up about 2.6% on the strength of our full-service health care businesses.
On Slide 7, we present our mix of business by industry sector. There were no meaningful changes in this mix during the quarter despite the significant impact of FX, which is a good indication of the diversity of our portfolio of clients. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 8. In the first quarter, we generated $322 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 9, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $126 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend that was approved in the second quarter of 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $25 million. Capital expenditures were $38 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments and net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $32 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan, totaled $256 million. Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May post the termination of the merger, we have spent about $1.25 billion and purchased about 17.4 million shares net. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $156 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. Focusing first on our capital structure. As a reminder, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes at 3.65% during the fourth quarter of 2014. This, coupled with the $75 million adjustment to our debt carrying value, related to the in the money amount of our interest rate swaps as required by U.S. GAAP, increased our total debt to $4.6 billion as of March 31, while our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion. The increase in our net debt of $1.1 billion over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $681 million as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $415 million.
Net debt increased by $891 million compared to year-end as a result of the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances of approximately $140 million, the use of cash in excess of free cash flow for the quarter of $155 million and the typical uses of working capital that historically occur in our first quarter. Although our net debt has increased, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. And due to both the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9x. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.6%, and return on equity increased to 36.3%.
And finally, on Slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 to Q1 2015, which totaled $10.2 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

But on the other hand, we do have expectations. The expectations are that the trends that we've really seen, I would say, over the past 18 months or so are going to continue. And what that means on balance, we've seen, of course, above-average growth in digital, and that's been driven by premium video, which we see continued increasing interest in. On the TV upfront side, I think we should expect a continuation of the kind of cautious approach that we saw this past year between upfront and short term naturally. Some clients are going to want to secure specific properties, particularly if they have initiatives during the year. But outside of that, we see a somewhat cautious approach. For those of us that have been following the upfront for a long time, I think we're used to the past, where the upfront was really a selling time for the entire year that's at the market. It really has become, I think, the beginning of the annual sales season. And it's an important part of it, but it's the beginning of the sales season."

And I resist the temptation to drill down further on the quarter and I think use the opportunity to ask some sort of bigger-picture questions here. And it seems to me that as we speak with industry players on the advertiser side, the agency side, the media operating side, that the biggest thing they all talk about in terms of technology offering us, and we're really beginning to see it, is kind of more efficient achievement of reaching impressions we target, right? That's part of all this. And in the long run, people really seem to think that advertisers will increase budgets as long as the return on investment is positive. But in the short run, like I'm not so sure. There seems to be such pressure on the multinational public companies with their FX pressures and dealing with shareholders that I don't -- I'm not really sure how much of that efficiency they're reinvesting. And how do you feel about that right now? Do you think clients are redeploying the savings that you're bringing them in terms of the efficiency of reach? Or are they sort of banking it? And how do you see that developing over time?"

They're still supporting their brands, but maybe not to the level that -- of the efficiencies. I think clients start -- each brand starts with targets and goals and objectives that they have to reach. And if we are able to assist them in achieving those targets in a more efficient way, which is the hope, the money doesn't always have to be reinvested back directly into advertising. For the most part, that's not a bad thing for an Omnicom. The principal way that we earn our revenues and profits are really in helping clients navigate through the complexity of this new marketplace and where audiences are, how to reach them, how to obtain quality content so they'll be interested in it. So whereas something which might have been invested in, say, traditional TV in the past, if we found an alternate way to get that audience for less money, our part of that might have increased, whereas the traditional TV seller might not -- might see a decline in their sales."

But as we go into sales season, what we're seeing are real initiatives that are coming from some of the more traditional providers in terms of not just offering up digital video, but offering up, I would say, packages or ideas and concepts that allow us to bridge between -- more aggressively between the conventional sale and the digital capability and the digital products that they now have. And I anticipate that that's going to be an ever more significant part of the conversations going ahead. We've certainly seen coverage over the past few days of, I think, leaders of major media companies, Discovery and the like, talking about that very concept. And it's something that both our clients and we, as agencies, are very interested in discussing how we extract more value for our clients using that kind of approach."

So I think it's probably safe to say that you shouldn't expect to see the next 12 months in terms of buyback activity to be anywhere similar to the last 12 months. Over the last 12 months, we bought back about $1,250,000,000 of stock. So we had some catching up to do, as we had discussed last May. So I don't think you can expect the activity to be at that level. Certainly, we'll continue to look at it in the context of our free cash flow as far as continuing to pay a dividend. What acquisitions are out there that we do endeavor to do is going to reduce the number. But certainly, the activity prospectively, as we look at the next 12 months, is going to be down relative to the last 12."

I would add, I think that CPMs, of course, are one way to look at the marketplace. I think the general trend here is -- or longer-term trend is more significant and that is that, generally speaking, our clients are moving to -- many clients, at least, are moving to looking at business measures. What do the aggregation of the investments that they're making across media types do to move their business with the data capabilities that we have? And they are somewhat less inclined to focus simply on what might be called process measures, which are the CPMs reaching frequency.

And where there is demand, generally speaking, we'll see supply respond to that. But the availability of, I would say, premium video is not simply a programmatic question. It goes beyond that as our clients look at it both programmatically and as alternatives in the upfront marketplace because content and context are so important to the kind of clients that we have. So there is the -- whether it's the content has the right affinity or whether it's simply just wholesome enough for their brand is key, and access to that kind of premium video is key to growth.

I'm pleased to speak to you this morning about our second quarter 2015 business results. As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter, with organic growth, up 5.3% and EBITA margins increasing 10 basis points. Based on our year-to-date results, we're on track to meet revenue and margin targets for the full year.
As we mentioned, on our year-end 2014 and first quarter 2015 earnings calls, we expected the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies would create headwinds to our 2015 reported revenue and net income. At the same time, it's important to point out that the majority of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged with both revenue and expenses in the same currency.
In the second quarter, the significant change in exchange rates versus the prior period resulted in a 7.1% or $275 million decline in reported revenue. Year-to-date, FX has reduced our revenue by $500 million.
On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased an additional 7% for both the quarter and the year. Phil will provide more details about the impact of foreign exchange by market later on the call. However, at this stage, if rates remain where they are today, the impact will moderate during the remainder of the year.
Turning now to organic revenue growth. North America increased 5.9%. The main drivers were brand advertising, which includes our media operations; specialty health care; and our CRM businesses.
The generated 5.4% growth. The performance in the U.K. was broad-based across our discipline, with the exception of our PR operations, which had difficult comps versus the second quarter of 2014.
Organic revenue growth in our European region was 3.9%. In the Euro Markets, Germany continued to outperform with over 5% growth, France was flat and the Netherlands was negative. Overall though, the euro currency markets were up almost 4%.
Outside Euro Markets, Turkey, Poland and Sweden had above-average results. Russia moderated to low single-digit growth in the quarter.
Looking at Asia Pacific, overall growth was 7.6%. Among our large markets, growth was strong in Australia, China and Singapore. Latin America was down 9.6% for the quarter. A positive performance in Mexico was offset by weaknesses in Brazil and Chile. The decline in Brazil is attributable to tough comps when compared to Q2 2014 World Cup spending and in '15, from sluggish economic conditions.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance and where we stand halfway through this year. 
I'd now like to make a few remarks on the macroeconomic picture in terms of things we're watching in the back half of 2015.
First, in the last few weeks, we've seen another economic crisis play out in Greece. Our Greek businesses are small and are expected to decline. In 2014, annual revenue was about $12 million, so the impact will not be material.
Second, as I mentioned earlier, China is still performing well for us, and we remain bullish on China despite recent setbacks in property and stock markets.
Two other large markets, Brazil and Russia, are projected to have negative GDP growth in 2015 and face inflationary pressures that will take some time to reverse. Brazil should, however, benefit next year as we start to focus on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio.
Lastly, the U.S. continues to improve with moderate GDP growth. Hopefully, anticipated actions by the Fed later this year will not cause any harm to the U.S. recovery or emerging markets.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow generation, they remained very strong, enabling us to navigate and be opportunistic in markets. Our consistent practice for the use of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged as thus our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our credit ratings.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the unprecedented number of media buying and planning assignments that are currently up for review.
There is more media business up for review from large markets at the present time than I personally have ever seen before. We estimate we're about halfway through the agency pitches for these large assignments, and I'm pleased to report we're doing quite well.
We recently added new media assignments from ST Johnson, which is a global win from one of our top competitors, as well as Wells Fargo in the United States and Bacardi globally.
These and a number of other wins brought an annual billings of over $1.4 billion in the first 6 months of 2015. And just last week, we were awarded Unilever's Australia media business following that win of their global search businesses a few months ago.
Throughout this unprecedented area, it's been important to note our current clients are our first priority. Therefore, we've been very selective in choosing which media assignment to pursue and have elected not to participate in many reviews. 21st Century Fox, Citibank, Coke, Cody and L'Oreal.
Looking at the pitches in progress, I classify them in 2 buckets. First, accounts we are defending. On these assignments, we have about $1.2 billion in media buildings, however, in most cases, we share these accounts with competitors, and we estimate there's about $1 billion in upside potential if we are successful in winning all of them.
Next, we're pursuing a few select new assignments, where we have either no relationship or very small one and where the upside is much greater. However, rather than trying to predict the outcome of these reviews, we can confirm that we're in a good position to benefit from any changes this large market has made.
With the abnormally high number of large media assignments, it is an opportune time to look at what is behind many of them. We know the media landscape has become more complex and many of the reviews are strategic reevaluations of agency suppliers.
Technology has radically changed media planning and buying. The rise of digital data and analytics has given marketers the ability to more precisely understand how consumers are using media.
In areas such as programmatic writing and micro targeting, clients want to make sure that they have the right partner with the right resources in the space. We've also seen a number of available media channels increase exponentially in the past several years.
Over the past 12 months in particular, we've seen a rapid growth and transition to online video really take hold. With many more media channels and online video available to consumers on so many devices, advertisers want to make sure they have the right strategies in place.
Giving these areas of focus by our clients, Omnicom is especially well positioned as a result of our investment in analytics and data management platform. Using this platform, our people today are analyzing campaigns on a granular level for hundreds of Omnicom clients around the globe.
These are differentiating efforts for us and are proving to be a competitive advantage. While these data and analytics platforms are more important than ever, it is of course, the talent of our people into putting them to work across all of our disciplines that really make the difference.
At this year's CON, we proved once again we have the best people in the business producing award-winning campaigns for our clients. Here are a few highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our talent.
Over 100 Omnicom agencies won nearly 250 alliance [ph] from approximately 50 different countries across 21 communication categories. CDM, one of the world's leading health care agencies, won the inaugural health care Network of the Year award.
BBDO is the runner-up for Network of the Year and had a record [indiscernible] with 29 agencies winning almost 120 lines. Omnicom Media Group and its flagship agencies, OMD and PHD, won over 60 alliance, including 3 Grand Prix for clients such as McDonald's, Apple, and vehicles.
I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work.
Our investment in comments, technology and partnership are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these growth areas of the marketing environment becomes increasingly complex.
I will now turn it over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"

As John said, our business has continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objective in meeting the needs of their clients.For the second quarter, our organic revenue growth of 5.3% was once again above o",2436,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our business has continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objective in meeting the needs of their clients.
For the second quarter, our organic revenue growth of 5.3% was once again above our expectations as the U.S. maintained its solid performance, and we experienced strong performance in the U.K., Germany and Canada.
While our underlying businesses continue to perform well and we had good balance to our organic growth performance across our disciplines, exchange rates continue to create a considerable headwind on our revenue. This quarter, the negative impact of FX reduced revenue by 7.1% or $275 million.
And as has been the case since the fourth quarter of last year, FX in the quarter was negative in all of our significant foreign markets. Including the small net positive impact from our acquisitions, net of dispositions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.8 billion, down 1.7% versus Q2 last year.
We'll discuss our revenue growth in greater detail in a few minutes.
Turning to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by $8 million to $566 million versus $574 million in Q2 of last year. Exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our EBITA for the quarter.
But since the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on margins was negative but not significant.
And operationally, our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization continue to make positive progress. As a result, the EBITA margin for the quarter of 14.9% was up a bit versus Q2 2014.
Operating income decreased $9 million to $539 million for the quarter, and although FX also negatively impacted operating income for the quarter and the amortization of our intangible assets resulting from our recent acquisitions increased on a year-over-year basis, our total operating margin of 14.2% was flat versus Q2 of 2014.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.6 million, up $900,000 versus Q2 of 2014 and up $400,000 from the first quarter. Versus the first quarter, the increase in net interest expense of $400,000 was a result of increased borrowing on our commercial paper facility fees, partially offset by additional interest income earned overseas.
Versus Q2 of last year, the positive impact of the floating interest rate swaps we entered into during Q2 and Q3 of 2014 effectively offset the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes. However, net interest expense was up $900,000 due to the decrease in interest earned on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers, primarily driven by not negative FX translation as well as additional interest expense from increased U.S. LIBOR rates on our CD borrowings.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% continues to be in line with our current tax rate expectations for 2015. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our quarterly reported tax rate of 31.1% reflected the impact of an $11 million tax benefit we recognized related to merger expenses incurred in 2013, which were required to be capitalized for tax purposes at the time. Upon terminating the merger in May of 2014, we recognize the tax benefit related to those expenses.
So to better understand the year-over-year change on the tax line in our tax rate, in addition to the reported 2014 figures, we're also presenting our 2014 quarter and year-to-date numbers, excluding the impact of this tax benefit.
Earnings from our affiliates of $4 million was flat year-over-year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased $4.4 million to $28.8 million, largely due to the impact of FX because a significant portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.
As a result, net income for the quarter was just below $314 million. That's flat versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 of 2014's results and is down 3.5% or $11.3 million versus our reported Q2 results last year.
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $3.9 million of net income to participating securities, which for us, on the dividend paying unvested restriction shares held by our employees was $310 million.
You can also see there our diluted share count for the quarter was $245.7 million. That's down 4.8% versus last year and was driven by our share buyback program, which we resumed during the second quarter of 2014.
As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.26 per share, up 2.4%, an increase of $0.03 versus Q2 2014 reported EPS or up 5.9%, an increase of $0.07 versus last year, after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 2014 results.
On Slide 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. To save some time, I will just give you a few highlights. Our organic revenue growth was 5.2% during the first 6 months of the year, the significant FX headwind cause revenue to decrease by 6.8%. And after factoring in the impact of acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, revenue decline on a year-to-date basis by 1.3% to just under $7.3 billion.
While FX also negatively impacted EBITDA, which decreased 1.1% to $971 million, both our EBITA and operating margins were unchanged when compared to last year.
Turning to taxes on Page 5, our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% is in line with our expectations. While the reported 2014 tax expense and tax rate reflecting impact of the $11 million tax benefit we recognized in Q2 of 2014 related to merger expenses incurred in 2013, which became deductible after the termination of the merger.
As you can see, similar to the way we presented our Q2 results, the comparative results for the 6-month period are presented both, including and excluding the tax benefit. Excluding the impact of this tax benefit, that tax rate for the 6-month period in 2014 was 33.5%. And our 6-month diluted EPS was $2.09 per share, which is up $0.09 or 4.5% versus 2014's reported figure of $2 per share and up $0.13 or 6.6% versus EPS after excluding the impact of the tax benefit recorded in Q2 of 2014.
Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, this quarter, we saw balanced organic growth across our disciplines, however, the effects of FX more than offset their performance. On a year-over-year basis, in the second quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthened against almost all of our major currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $275 million or 7.1%.
The FX impact was greatest in our European markets. The decline in the value of the euro and the pound represented nearly 60% of the FX decrease during the second quarter.
Looking ahead, considering the steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, the rates continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7% during the third quarter and approximately 6% for the full year.
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $5 million. While we've added businesses both in the U.S. and in Latin America and Europe over the last 12 months, we've also made some strategic dispositions during that period as well in EMEA and the U.S.
And finally, organic growth was positive $204 million or 5.3% this quarter, again, we had another quarter with solid organic growth across most of our major markets except for France and Netherlands and Brazil. And we had good growth across our disciplines, except PR, which was up slightly in the quarter.
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included: continued excellent performance across our media businesses and solid growth in CRM. Our full-service health care businesses, driven by new business wins over the last few quarters, posted double-digit organic growth in the quarter. Our U.K. businesses continue to perform well across most disciplines. We also had excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Mexico, Turkey and our Middle Eastern agencies.
In the Euro Markets, driven by strong performance in Germany and Spain, overall organic growth remain positive. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was once again strong. 
Slide 8 covers our year-to-date revenue performance. The impact of FX reduced revenue by $0.5 billion over the first 6 months of 2015 or 6.8%, while organic growth over that same period was 5.2%. On Slide 9, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split of revenue was 60% from North America, 10% U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe and 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to Slide 10. In North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, and we had organic revenue growth of 5.9%. While the media businesses continued to perform well, this quarter also saw strong growth from our full-service health care businesses and CRM businesses in the region.
Turning to international markets. The U.K. continued its strong performance this quarter, except for our PR discipline, which faced difficult comps versus Q2 last year. The rest of Europe was up 3.9%, led by Germany and Spain, while France was flat and the Netherlands continues to lag negatively.
Our performance in the non-Euro markets in Europe continued to be solid. Before leaving Europe, in Greece, where the economic and political situation is uncertain, we have a very small presence with revenues of less than 1/10 of 1% of our consolidated revenue, so we do not expect much exposure. But given the uncertainty, we would expect the continued decline in our businesses going forward.
The Asia Pacific region was up 7.6%, with most markets performing well, including China, Australia and Singapore. One market that lagged was Latin America, which was down 9.6% organically. The positive performance in Mexico was offset by weakness in Chile and Brazil. In Chile, the decline resulted from a significant local client loss in 2014 that we are now finish cycling through. In Brazil, the decline resulted from both the difficult comp when compared to Q2 of 2014 due to the World Cup and from general softness in that market. 
And finally, the Africa and Middle East region are relatively small in total, it was up 11.9%, led by our businesses in the UAE and South Africa.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter, split equally between advertising services and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, advertising services were up 6.4% or $125 million, and marketing services were up 4.1% or $79 million.
Within marketing services, CRM was up 4.3%. Most of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year. It was only our sales promotion business is down and our field marketing business is close to flat.
Public Relations was up slightly at 0.3% and specialty communications is up about 8% on the strength of the performance of our full-service health care businesses.
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing our year-to-date revenue in 2015 to last year's figures, you can see there were no meaningful changes in this mix. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In the first half of the year, we generated $757 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $251 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend during Q2 of 2014.
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $61 million. Capital expenditures were $107 million, up from last year due to an increase in leasehold improvements related to some recent real estate consolidations.
And acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $65 million. And finally, stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan, totaled $386 million.
Since we restarted our share repurchase program just over 1 year ago, post the termination of the merger, we have spent about $1.38 billion and purchased about 19 million shares. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $113 million during the first 6 months of 2015.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure. Our total debt of $4.57 billion is down about $37 million from the first quarter, mainly due to a decrease in the fair value adjustment to our debt carrying value as required by U.S. GAAP related to the end of money amount of our interest rate swaps.
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of about $690 million over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $254 million as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $402 million using period-end spot rates.
Although our net debt has increased over the past year, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x.
And due to both the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9x.
Turning to Slide 16, we continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions as well as focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 17.6% and return on equity increased to 35.9%.
And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through the second quarter, which totaled $10.5 billion.
And the bars show accumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases. The sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion for accumulative payout ratio of 109%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review.

And August and September, I think many of the things that we've been working on will come to a final decision both on our part and that of the sellers. We're muted in the first half because as we were doing acquisitions, we've also taken a couple of small companies that no longer fit the portfolio and we've divested ourselves. That's why you see the net number affecting our overall revenues. The prices, I would say, are -- the prices are pretty dear. No one is giving anything away. Nothing, certainly, nothing interested in purchasing. But they're not -- we're still very disciplined in the way that we approach it and we have to assure ourselves that we can extract the proper value before we actually finish and close the deal. So I'm hopeful. There's a couple that I've been talking to, which expands our presence in markets outside the United States. And also a couple in the media that I'm hoping that we'll get accomplished in the back half of this year. But I'm not in control of -- without getting reckless about the price, I'm not in control about how the process finishes out. With respect to our capital program, that really remains the same, Peter. First, we plan to utilize our free cash flow really into 3 manners: First, to pay dividends; the second, to pay for and hopefully increase the number of acquisitions we do; and then share buybacks, which turn out to be the fallout of the difference between the amount of cash we generate and taking first of those first 2 items. There's no foreseeable change in terms of our attitude and what we're planning to do."

And we've been, as I said, I think we're about halfway through the reviews that have been called. It's a guess, but we think that will be decided by October. And it would be very interesting to see who would the net winners are in this round. So I'm very confident that with the amount of revenue we've already won and the few losses that we've suffered, we're well ahead of the game. And looking out, there should only be upside opportunity for us. The second part of your question, I'm sorry?"

And it turns out to be a process that ultimately should be beneficial to us on my side of the table, but it's preferably also the very beneficial to the client because they challenge their own media folk. Just say, listen, we've been doing this is way up until now. Should we be changing the way we're planning or executing? And we're seeing clients rethinking their old behavior. So I don't see -- and in terms of the cost of the features, it turns out that at that time the people who are using naturally are our senior people and we're probably just working a little bit harder than we were before all these pictures commenced."

It's hard to gauge the disruption it might have in some of the emerging markets as we reinforce the strength of the dollar versus through the interest rate mechanisms and actions versus other places in the world. So there's a heavy, direct impact on the capital structure is over the ability for advertising industry to function. No, and I think there will be a good long time because I think the Fed hikes, when they come, will be very gradual and take quite a period of time before they become impactful.

I'm pleased to speak to you this morning about our second quarter 2015 business results. As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter with organic growth up 5.3% and EBITA margins increasing 10 basis points. Based on our year-to-date results, we're on track to meet revenue and margin targets for the full year.
As we mentioned on our year-end 2014 and first quarter 2015 earning calls, we expected the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies would create headwinds to our 2015 reported revenue and net income. At the same time, it's important to point out that the majority of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged with both revenue and expenses in the same currency.
In the second quarter, the significant change in exchange rates versus the prior period resulted in a 7.1% or $275 million decline in reported revenue. Year-to-date, FX has reduced our revenue by $500 million.
On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased an additional 7% for both the quarter and the year. Phil will provide more details about the impact of foreign exchange by market later in the call. However at this stage, if rates remain where they are today, the impact will moderate during the remainder of the year.
Turning now to organic revenue growth. North America increased 5.9%. The main drivers were: Brand advertising, which includes our media operations; specialty health care; and our CRM businesses.
The U.K. generated 5.4% growth. The performance in the U.K. was broad-based across our disciplines, with the exception of our PR operations, which had difficult comps versus the second quarter of 2014.
Organic revenue growth in our European region was 3.9%. In the Euro markets, Germany continued to outperform with over 5% growth, France was flat and the Netherlands was negative. Overall though, the euro currency markets were up almost 4%.
Outside Euro market, Turkey, Poland and Sweden had above-average results. Russia moderated to low single-digit growth in the quarter.
Looking at Asia Pacific, overall growth was 7.6%. Among our large markets, growth was strong in Australia, China and Singapore. Latin America was down 9.6% for the quarter. A positive performance in Mexico was offset by weaknesses in Brazil and Chile. The decline in Brazil is attributable to tough comps when compared to Q2 2014 World Cup spending and in '15 from sluggish economic conditions.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance and where we stand halfway through this year. 
I'd now like to make a few remarks on the macroeconomic picture in terms of things we're watching in the back half of 2015.
First, in the last few weeks, we've seen another economic crisis play out in Greece. Our Greek businesses are small and are expected to decline. In 2014, annual revenue was about $12 million, so the impact will not be material.
Second, as I mentioned earlier, China is still performing well for us, and we remain bullish on China despite recent setbacks in property and stock markets.
Two other large markets, Brazil and Russia, are projected to have negative GDP growth in 2015 and face inflationary pressures that will take some time to reverse. Brazil should, however, benefit next year as we start to focus on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio.
Lastly, the U.S. continues to improve with moderate GDP growth. Hopefully, anticipated actions by the Fed later this year will not cause any harm to the U.S. recovery or emerging markets.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow generation. They remained very strong, enabling us to navigate and be opportunistic in these alpha [ph] Markets. Our consistent practice for the use of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged, as thus our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our credit ratings.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the unprecedented number of media buying and planning assignments that are currently up for review. There is more media business up for review from large marketers at the present time than I personally have ever seen before. We estimate we're about halfway through the agency pitches for these large assignments, and I'm pleased to report we're doing quite well.
We recently added new media assignments from SC Johnson, which is a global win from one of our top competitors, as well as Wells Fargo in the United States and Bacardi globally. These and a number of other wins brought in annual billings of over $1.4 billion in the first 6 months of 2015. 
And just last week, we were awarded Unilever's Australia media business, following the win of their global search businesses a few months ago.
Throughout this unprecedented period, it's been important to note our current clients are our first priority. Therefore, we have been very selective in choosing which media assignments to pursue and have elected not to participate in many reviews: 21st Century Fox, Citibank, Coke, COTY and L'Oreal.
Looking at the pitches still in progress, I classify them in 2 buckets. First, accounts we are defending. On these assignments, we have about $1.2 billion in media billings. However, in most cases, we share these accounts with competitors, and we estimate there is about $1 billion in upside potential if we are successful in winning all of them.
Next, we're pursuing a few select new assignments, where we have either no relationship or a very small one and where the upside is much greater. However, rather than trying to predict the outcome of these reviews, we can confirm that we're in a good position to benefit from any changes these large marketers made.
With the abnormally high number of large media assignments, it is an opportune time to look at what is behind many of them. We know the media landscape has become more complex, and many of the reviews are strategic reevaluations of agency suppliers.
Technology has radically changed media planning and buying. The rise of digital data and analytics has given marketers the ability to more precisely understand how consumers are using media. In areas such as programmatic buying and micro targeting, clients want to make sure that they have the right partner with the right resources in this space. 
We've also seen a number of available media channels increase exponentially in the past several years. Over the past 12 months in particular, we've seen the rapid growth and transition to online video really take hold. With many more media channels and online video available to consumers on so many devices, advertisers want to make sure they have the right strategies in place.
Given these areas of focus by our clients, Omnicom is especially well positioned as a result of our investments in analytic and our data management platform. Using this platform, our people today are analyzing campaigns on a granular level for hundreds of Omnicom clients around the globe.
These are differentiating efforts for us and are proving to be a competitive advantage. While these data and analytic platforms are more important than ever, it is of course the talent of our people in putting them to work across all of our disciplines that really make the difference.
At this year's Cannes, we proved once again we have the best people in the business producing award-winning campaigns for our clients. Here are a few highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our talent.
Over 100 Omnicom agencies won nearly 250 Lions from approximately 50 different countries across 21 communication categories. CDM, one of the world's leading health care agencies, won the inaugural Healthcare Network of the Year award.
BBDO is the runner-up for Network of the Year. And had a record Cannes with 29 agencies winning almost 120 Lions. Omnicom Media Group and its flagship agencies, OMD and PHD, won over 60 Lions, including 3 Grand Prix's for clients such as McDonald's, Apple, Under Armor and Harvey Nichols. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work.
Our investment in talent, technology and partnership are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these growth areas as the marketing environment becomes increasingly complex.
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"

As John said, our businesses continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients.For the second quarter, our organic revenue growth of 5.3% was once again above o",2427,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients.
For the second quarter, our organic revenue growth of 5.3% was once again above our expectations as the U.S. maintained its solid performance and we experienced strong performance in the U.K., Germany and Canada.
While our underlying businesses continue to perform well and we had good balance to our organic growth performance across our disciplines, exchange rates continue to create a considerable headwind on our revenue. This quarter, the negative impact of FX reduced revenue by 7.1% or $275 million.
And as has been the case since the fourth quarter of last year, FX in the quarter was negative in all of our significant foreign markets. Including the small net positive impact from our acquisitions net of dispositions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.8 billion, down 1.7% versus Q2 last year.
We'll discuss our revenue growth in greater detail in a few minutes.
Turning to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by $8 million to $566 million versus $574 million in Q2 of last year. 
Exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our EBITA for the quarter, but since the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on margins was negative but not significant.
And operationally, our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization continue to make positive progress. As a result, the EBITA margin for the quarter of 14.9% was up a bit versus Q2 2014.
Operating income decreased $9 million to $539 million for the quarter. And although FX also negatively impacted operating income for the quarter and the amortization of our intangible assets resulting from our recent acquisitions increased on a year-over-year basis, our total operating margin of 14.2% was flat versus Q2 of 2014.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.6 million, up $900,000 versus Q2 of 2014 and up $400,000 from the first quarter. Versus the first quarter, the increase in net interest expense of $400,000 was the result of increased borrowing on our commercial paper facilities partially offset by additional interest income earned overseas.
Versus Q2 of last year, the positive impact of the floating interest rate swaps we entered into during Q2 and Q3 of 2014 effectively offset the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes. However, net interest expense was up $900,000 due to the decrease in interest earned on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers, primarily driven by negative FX translation, as well as additional interest expense from increased U.S. LIBOR rates on our CP borrowings.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% continues to be in line with our current tax rate expectations for 2015. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our quarterly reported tax rate of 31.1% reflected the impact of an $11 million tax benefit we recognized related to merger expenses incurred in 2013 which were required to be capitalized for tax purposes at the time. Upon terminating the merger in May of 2014, we recognized the tax benefit related to those expenses. So to better understand the year-over-year change on the tax line and in our tax rate, in addition to the reported 2014 figures, we are also presenting our 2014 quarter and year-date numbers excluding the impact of this tax benefit.
Earnings from our affiliates of $4 million was flat year-over-year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less-than-fully owned subsidiaries decreased $4.4 million to $28.8 million, largely due to the impact of FX because a significant portion of our less-than-fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.
As a result, net income for the quarter was just below $314 million. That's flat versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 of 2014's results. And it's down 3.5% or $11.3 million versus our reported Q2 results last year.
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $3.9 million of net income to participating securities, which for us, on the dividend-paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $310 million.
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 245.7 million. That's down 4.8% versus last year and was driven by our share buyback program which we resumed during the second quarter of 2014. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.26 per share, up 2.4%, an increase of $0.03 versus Q2 2014 reported EPS or up 5.9%, an increase of $0.07 versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 2014's results.
On Slide 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information to the year-to-date period. To save some time, I will just give you a few highlights. While organic revenue growth was 5.2% during the first 6 months of the year, the significant FX headwind caused revenue to decrease by 6.8%. And after factoring in the impact of acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, revenue declined on a year-to-date basis by 1.3% to just under $7.3 billion.
While FX also negatively impacted EBITA, which decreased 1.1% to $971 million, both our EBITA and operating margins were unchanged when compared to last year.
Turning to taxes on Page 5. Our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% is in line with our expectations. While the reported 2014 tax expense and tax rate reflect the impact of the $11 million tax benefit we recognized in Q2 of 2014 related to merger expenses incurred in 2013, which became deductible after the termination of the merger.
As you can see, similar to the way we presented our Q2 results, the comparative results for the 6-month period are presented both including and excluding the tax benefit. Excluding the impact of this tax benefit, that tax rate for the 6-month period in 2014 was 33.5% and our 6-month diluted EPS was $2.09 per share, which is up $0.09 or 4.5% versus 2014's reported figure of $2 per share and up $0.13 or 6.6% versus EPS after excluding the impact of the tax benefit recorded in Q2 2014.
Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, this quarter, we saw balanced organic growth across our disciplines, however, the effects of FX more than offset their performance. On a year-over-year basis, in the second quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against almost all of our major currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $275 million or 7.1%.
The FX impact was greatest in our European markets. The decline in the value of the euro and the pound represented nearly 60% of the FX decrease during the second quarter.
Looking ahead, considering the steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, if rates continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7% during the third quarter and approximately 6% for the full year.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $5 million. While we've added businesses both in the U.S. and in Latin America and Europe over the last 12 months, we've also made some strategic dispositions during that period as well in EMEA and the U.S.
And finally, organic growth was positive $204 million or 5.3% this quarter, again, we had another quarter with solid organic growth across most of our major markets except for France, the Netherlands and Brazil. And we had good growth across our disciplines except PR, which was up slightly in the quarter.
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses and solid growth in CRM. Our full-service health care businesses, driven by new business wins over the last few quarters, posted double-digit organic growth in the quarter. Our U.K. businesses continued to perform well across most disciplines. We also had excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Mexico, Turkey and our Middle Eastern agencies.
In the Euro markets, driven by strong performance in Germany and Spain, overall organic growth remained positive. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was once again strong. 
Slide 8 covers our year-to-date revenue performance. The impact of FX reduced revenue by $0.5 billion over the first 6 months of 2015 or 6.8% while organic growth over that same period was 5.2%. 
On Slide 9, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, split of revenue was 60% from North America, 10% U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe and 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to Slide 10. In North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances and we had organic revenue growth of 5.9%. While the media businesses continued to perform well, this quarter also saw strong growth from our full-service health care businesses and CRM businesses in the region.
Turning to international markets. The U.K. continued its strong performance this quarter except for our PR discipline, which faced difficult comps versus Q2 last year. The rest of Europe was up 3.9%, led by Germany and Spain, while France was flat and the Netherlands continues to lag negatively.
Our performance in the non-Euro markets in Europe continued to be solid. Before leaving Europe, in Greece, where the economic and political situation is uncertain, we have a very small presence with revenues of less than 0.1% of our consolidated revenue, so we do not expect much exposure. But given the uncertainty, we would expect a continued decline on our businesses going forward.
The Asia Pacific region was up 7.6%, with most markets performing well, including China, Australia and Singapore. 
One market that lagged was Latin America, which was down 9.6% organically. A positive performance in Mexico was offset by weakness in Chile and Brazil. In Chile, the decline resulted from a significant local client loss in 2014 that we are now finished cycling through. In Brazil, decline resulted from both a difficult comp when compared to Q2 of 2014 due to the World Cup and from general softness in that market. 
And finally, the Africa and Middle East region are relatively small in total, was up 11.9%, led by our businesses in the UAE and South Africa.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter, split equally between advertising services and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, advertising services were up 6.4% or $125 million and marketing services were up 4.1% or $79 million.
Within marketing services, CRM was up 4.3%. Most of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year, with only our sales promotion businesses down and our field marketing businesses close to flat. Public relations was up slightly at 0.3%. And specialty communications was up about 8% on the strength of the performance of our full-service health care businesses.
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing our year-to-date revenue in 2015 to last year's figures, you can see there were no meaningful changes in this mix. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In the first half of the year, we generated $757 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $251 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend during Q2 of 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $61 million. Capital expenditures were $107 million, up from last year due to an increase in leasehold improvements related to some recent real estate consolidations. And acquisitions, including earnout payments net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $65 million. And finally, stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $386 million.
Since we restarted our share repurchase program just over a year ago post the termination of the merger, we have spent about $1.38 billion and purchased about 19 million shares. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $113 million during the first 6 months of 2015.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure. Our total debt of $4.57 billion is down about $37 million from the first quarter, mainly due to a decrease in the fair value adjustment to our debt carrying value as required by U.S. GAAP related to the end of money amount of our interest rate swaps.
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of about $690 million over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $254 million as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $402 million using period-end spot rates.
Although our net debt has increased over the past year, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. And due to both the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9x.
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions as well as focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 17.6% and return on equity increased to 35.9%.
And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through the second quarter which totaled $10.5 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review.

And August and September, I think many of the things that we've been working on will come to a final decision both on our part and that of the sellers. We're muted in the first half because as we were doing acquisitions, we've also taken a couple of small companies that no longer fit the portfolio and we've divested ourselves. So that's why you see the net number affecting our overall revenues. The prices, I would say, are -- the prices are pretty dear. No one's giving anything away, nothing -- certainly nothing we're interested in purchasing. But they're not -- we're still very disciplined in the way that we approach it, and we have to assure ourselves that we can extract the proper value before we'll actually finish and close the deal. So I'm hopeful. There's a couple that we've been talking to which expand our presence in markets outside the United States. And also a couple in the media that I'm hoping that we'll get accomplished in the back half of this year. But I'm not in control of -- without getting reckless about the price, I'm not in control about how the process finishes out. With respect to our capital program, that really remains the same, Peter. First, we plan to utilize our free cash flow really in 3 manners: First, to pay dividends; the second, to pay for and hopefully increase the number of acquisitions we do; and then share buybacks turn out to be the fallout of the difference between the amount of cash we generate and taking care of those first 2 items. There is no foreseeable change in terms of our attitude of what we're planning to do."

And I -- despite all the other noise and everything else that's out there in the marketplace, I really do think it's been very consistent that clients are really reevaluating how they've done things in the past and they're reevaluating the teams that they're doing them with. And we have been, as I said -- I think we're about halfway through the reviews that have been called. We're -- it's a guess, but we think that they'll all be decided by October. And it would be very interesting to see who the net winners are in this round. But -- so I'm very confident that with the amount of revenue we've already won and the few losses that we've suffered, we're well ahead of the game. And looking out, there should only be upside opportunity for us. The second part of your question? I'm sorry."

And it's -- it turns out to be a process that ultimately should be beneficial to us on my side of the table, but it's totally also very beneficial to the client because they challenge their own media folk to say, ""Listen, we've been doing this, this way up until now.

So we manage the business for the long term. We're going to continue to make the investments that we think need to be made and find the right balance of growth and profitability and returns. And we're going to take whatever actions we think we need to get there. Some of them are certainly longer term in nature, some of them are shorter term in nature.

So there is a heavy, direct impact on the capital structures over the ability for the advertising industry to function? No. And I think it will be a good, long time because I think the Fed hikes, when they come, will be very gradual and take quite a period of time before they become impactful.

As we mentioned on our year-end 2014 and first quarter 2015 earning calls, we expect that the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies would create headwinds to our 2015 reported revenue and net income. At the same time, it's important to point out that the majority of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged, with both revenue and expenses in the same currency.
In the second quarter, the significant change in exchange rates versus the prior period resulted in a 7.1%, or $275 million, decline in reported revenue. Year-to-date, FX has reduced our revenue by $500 million.
On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased an additional 7% for both the quarter and the year. Phil will provide more details about the impact of foreign exchange by market later in the call. However, at this stage, if rates remain where they are today, the impact will moderate during the remainder of the year.
Turning now to organic revenue growth. North America increased 5.9%. The main drivers were brand advertising, which includes our media operations; specialty health care; and our CRM businesses.
The U.K. generated 5.4% growth. The performance in the U.K. was broad-based across our disciplines, with the exception of our PR operations, which had difficult comps versus the second quarter of 2014.
Organic revenue growth in our European region was 3.9%. In the Euro markets, Germany continued to outperform with over 5% growth, France was flat and the Netherlands was negative. Overall though, the euro currency markets were up almost 4%.
Outside Euro market, Turkey, Poland and Sweden had above-average results. Russia moderated to low single-digit growth in the quarter.
Looking at Asia Pacific, overall growth was 7.6%. Among our large markets, growth was strong in Australia, China and Singapore. Latin America was down 9.6% for the quarter. A positive performance in Mexico was offset by weaknesses in Brazil and Chile. The decline in Brazil is attributable to tough comps when compared to Q2 2014 World Cup spending and in '15, from sluggish economic conditions.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance and where we stand halfway through this year. 
I'd now like to make a few remarks on the macroeconomic picture in terms of things we're watching in the back half of 2015.
First, in the last few weeks, we've seen another economic crisis play out in Greece. Our Greek businesses are small and are expected to decline. In 2014, annual revenue was about $12 million, so the impact will not be material.
Second, as I mentioned earlier, China is still performing well for us, and we remain bullish on China despite recent setbacks in property and stock markets.
Two other large markets, Brazil and Russia, are projected to have negative GDP growth in 2015 and face inflationary pressures that will take some time to reverse. Brazil should, however, benefit next year as we start to focus on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio.
Lastly, the U.S. continues to improve, with moderate GDP growth. Hopefully, anticipated actions by the Fed later this year will not cause any harm to the U.S. recovery or emerging markets.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow generation. They remain very strong, enabling us to navigate and be opportunistic in these [indiscernible] markets. Our consistent practice for the use of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged, as does our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our credit ratings.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the unprecedented number of media buying and planning assignments that are currently up for a review. There is more media business up for review from large marketers at the present time than I personally have ever seen before. We estimate we're about halfway through the agency pitches for these large assignments, and I'm pleased to report we're doing quite well.
We recently added new media assignments from SC Johnson, which is a global win from one of our top competitors, as well as Wells Fargo in the United States and Bacardi globally. These and a number of other wins brought in annual billings of over $1.4 billion in the first 6 months of 2015. 
And just last week, we were awarded Unilever's Australia media business, following the win of their global search businesses a few months ago.
Throughout this unprecedented period, it's been important to note our current clients are our first priority. Therefore, we have been very selective in choosing which media assignments to pursue and have elected not to participate in many reviews: 21st Century Fox, Citibank, Coke, COTY and L'Oreal.
Looking at the pitches still in progress, I would classify them in 2 buckets. First, accounts we are defending. On these assignments, we have about $1.2 billion in media billings. However, in most cases, we share these accounts with competitors, and we estimate there is about $1 billion in upside potential if we are successful in winning all of them.
Next, we're pursuing a few select new assignments where we have either no relationship or a very small one and where the upside is much greater. However, rather than trying to predict the outcome of these reviews, we can confirm that we're in a good position to benefit from any changes these large marketers made.
With the abnormally high number of large media assignments, it is an opportune time to look at what is behind many of them. We know the media landscape has become more complex, and many of the reviews are strategic reevaluations of agency suppliers.
Technology has radically changed media planning and buying. The rise of digital data and analytics has given marketers the ability to more precisely understand how consumers are using media. In areas such as programmatic buying and micro targeting, clients want to make sure that they have the right partner with the right resources in this space. 
We've also seen the number of available media channels increase exponentially in the past several years. Over the past 12 months in particular, we've seen the rapid growth and transition to online video really take hold. With many more media channels and online video available to consumers on so many devices, advertisers want to make sure they have the right strategies in place.
Given these areas of focus by our clients, Omnicom is especially well positioned as a result of our investments in analytic and our data management platform. Using this platform, our people today are analyzing campaigns on a granular level for hundreds of Omnicom clients around the globe.
These are differentiating assets for us and are proving to be a competitive advantage. While these data and analytic platforms are more important than ever, it is of course the talent of our people in putting them to work across all of our disciplines that really make the difference.
At this year's Cannes, we proved once again we have the best people in the business producing award-winning campaigns for our clients. Here are a few highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our talent.
Over 100 Omnicom agencies won nearly 250 Lions from approximately 50 different countries across 21 communication categories. CDM, one of the world's leading health care agencies, won the inaugural Healthcare Network of the Year award.
BBDO is the runner-up for Network of the Year, and had a record Cannes with 29 agencies winning almost 120 Lions. Omnicom Media Group and its flagship agencies, OMD and PHD, won over 60 Lions, including 3 Grand Prix for clients such as McDonald's, Apple, Under Armor and Harvey Nichols. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work.
Our investment in talent, technology and partnership are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these growth areas as the marketing environment becomes increasingly complex.
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"

As John said, our businesses continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives in meeting the needs of their clients.
For the second quarter, our organic revenue growth of 5.3% was once again above our expectations as the U.S. maintained its solid performance and we experienced strong performance in the U.K., Germany and Canada.
While our underlying businesses continue to perform well and we had good balance to our organic growth performance across our disciplines, exchange rates continue to create a considerable headwind on our revenue. This quarter, the negative impact of FX reduced revenue by 7.1%, or $275 million.
And as has been the case since the fourth quarter of last year, FX in the quarter was negative in all of our significant foreign markets. Including the small net positive impact from our acquisitions net of dispositions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.8 billion, down 1.7% versus Q2 last year.
We'll discuss our revenue growth in greater detail in a few minutes.
Turning to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by $8 million to $566 million, versus $574 million in Q2 of last year. 
Exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our EBITA for the quarter, but since the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on margins was negative, but not significant.
And operationally, our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization continue to make positive progress. As a result, the EBITA margin for the quarter of 14.9% was up a bit versus Q2 2014.
Operating income decreased $9 million to $539 million for the quarter. And although FX also negatively impacted operating income for the quarter, and the amortization of our intangible assets resulting from our recent acquisitions increased on a year-over-year basis, our total operating margin of 14.2% was flat versus Q2 of 2014.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.6 million, up $900,000 versus Q2 of 2014 and up $400,000 from the first quarter. Versus the first quarter, the increase in net interest expense of $400,000 was the result of increased borrowing on our commercial paper facilities, partially offset by additional interest income earned overseas.
Versus Q2 of last year, the positive impact of the floating interest rate swaps we entered into during Q2 and Q3 of 2014 effectively offset the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes. However, net interest expense was up $900,000 due to a decrease in interest earned on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers, primarily driven by negative FX translation as well as additional interest expense from increased U.S. LIBOR rates on our CP borrowings.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% continues to be in line with our current tax rate expectations for 2015. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our quarterly reported tax rate of 31.1% reflected the impact of an $11 million tax benefit we recognized related to merger expenses incurred in 2013 which were required to be capitalized for tax purposes at the time. Upon terminating the merger in May of 2014, we recognized the tax benefit related to those expenses. So to better understand the year-over-year change on the tax line and in our tax rate, in addition to the reported 2014 figures, we are also presenting our 2014 quarter and year-to-date numbers excluding the impact of this tax benefit.
Earnings from our affiliates of $4 million was flat year-over-year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $4.4 million to $28.8 million, largely due to the impact of FX, because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.
As a result, net income for the quarter was just below $314 million. That's flat versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 of 2014's results. And it's down 3.5%, or $11.3 million, versus our reported Q2 results last year.
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $3.9 million of net income to participating securities, which for us, on the dividend-paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $310 million.
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 245.7 million. That's down 4.8% versus last year and was driven by our share buyback program, which we resumed during the second quarter of 2014. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.26 per share, up 2.4%, an increase of $0.03 versus Q2 2014 reported EPS or up 5.9%, an increase of $0.07 versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 2014's results.
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. To save some time, I will just give you a few highlights. While organic revenue growth was 5.2% during the first 6 months of the year, the significant FX headwind caused revenue to decrease by 6.8%. And after factoring in the impact of acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, revenue declined on a year-to-date basis by 1.3% to just under $7.3 billion.
While FX also negatively impacted EBITA, which decreased 1.1% to $971 million, both our EBITA and operating margins were unchanged when compared to last year.
Turning to taxes on Page 5. Our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% is in line with our expectations. While the reported 2014 tax expense and tax rate reflect the impact of the $11 million tax benefit we recognized in Q2 of 2014 related to merger expenses incurred in 2013, which became deductible after the termination of the merger.
As you can see, similar to the way we presented our Q2 results, the comparative results for the 6-month period are presented both including and excluding the tax benefit. Excluding the impact of this tax benefit, the tax rate for the 6-month period in 2014 was 33.5% and our 6-month diluted EPS was $2.09 per share, which is up $0.09 or 4.5% versus 2014's reported figure of $2 per share and up $0.13 or 6.6% versus EPS after excluding the impact of the tax benefit recorded in Q2 of 2014.
Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, this quarter, we saw balanced organic growth across our disciplines, however, the effects of FX more than offset their performance. On a year-over-year basis, in the second quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against almost all of our major currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $275 million or 7.1%.
The FX impact was greatest in our European markets. The decline in the value of the euro and the pound represented nearly 60% of the FX decrease during the second quarter.
Looking ahead, considering the steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, if rates continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7% during the third quarter and approximately 6% for the full year.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $5 million. While we've added businesses both in the U.S. and in Latin America and Europe over the last 12 months, we've also made some strategic dispositions during that period as well, in EMEA and the U.S.
And finally, organic growth was positive $204 million or 5.3% this quarter. Again, we had another quarter with solid organic growth across most of our major markets except for France, the Netherlands and Brazil. And we had good growth across our disciplines, except PR, which was up slightly in the quarter.
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses and solid growth in CRM. Our full-service health care businesses, driven by new business wins over the last few quarters, posted double-digit organic growth in the quarter. Our U.K. businesses continued to perform well across most disciplines. We also had excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Mexico, Turkey and our Middle Eastern agencies.
In the Euro markets, driven by strong performance in Germany and Spain, overall organic growth remained positive. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was once again strong. 
Slide 8 covers our year-to-date revenue performance. The impact of FX reduced revenue by $0.5 billion over the first 6 months of 2015, or 6.8%, while organic growth over that same period was 5.2%. 
On Slide 9, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split of revenue was 60% from North America, 10% U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe and 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to Slide 10. In North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, and we had organic revenue growth of 5.9%. While the media businesses continued to perform well, this quarter also saw strong growth from our full-service health care businesses and CRM businesses in the region.
Turning to international markets. The U.K. continued its strong performance this quarter except for our PR discipline, which faced difficult comps versus Q2 last year. The rest of Europe was up 3.9%, led by Germany and Spain, while France was flat and the Netherlands continues to lag negatively.
Our performance in the non-Euro markets in Europe continued to be solid. Before leaving Europe, in Greece, where the economic and political situation is uncertain, we have a very small presence with revenues of less than 0.1% of our consolidated revenues, so we do not expect much exposure. But given the uncertainty, we would expect a continued decline on our businesses going forward.
The Asia Pacific region was up 7.6%, with most markets performing well, including China, Australia and Singapore. 
One market that lagged was Latin America, which was down 9.6% organically. A positive performance in Mexico was offset by weakness in Chile and Brazil. In Chile, the decline resulted from a significant local client loss in 2014 that we are now finished cycling through. In Brazil, the decline resulted from both a difficult comp when compared to Q2 of 2014 due to the World Cup and from general softness in that market. 
And finally, the Africa and Middle East region, while relatively small in total, was up 11.9%, led by our businesses in the UAE and South Africa.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter, split equally between advertising services and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, advertising services were up 6.4% or $125 million and marketing services were up 4.1% or $79 million.
Within marketing services, CRM was up 4.3%. Most of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year, with only our sales promotion businesses down and our field marketing businesses close to flat. Public relations was up slightly at 0.3%. And specialty communications was up about 8% on the strength of the performance of our full-service health care businesses.
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing our year-to-date revenue in 2015 to last year's figures, you can see there were no meaningful changes in this mix. 
Turning to our cash flow performance, on Slide 13. In the first half of the year, we generated $757 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash, on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $251 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend during Q2 of 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $61 million. Capital expenditures were $107 million, up from last year due to an increase in leasehold improvements related to some recent real estate consolidations. And acquisitions, including earnout payments net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $65 million. And finally, stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $386 million.
Since we restarted our share repurchase program just over a year ago post the termination of the merger, we have spent about $1.38 billion and purchased about 19 million shares. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $113 million during the first 6 months of 2015.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of $4.57 billion is down about $37 million from the first quarter, mainly due to a decrease in the fair value adjustment to our debt's carrying value, as required by U.S. GAAP, related to the end of money amount of our interest rate swaps.
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of about $690 million over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $254 million as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $402 million, using period-end spot rates.
Although our net debt has increased over the past year, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. And due to both a decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9x.
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions as well as focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 17.6% and return on equity increased to 35.9%.
And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through the second quarter, which totaled $10.5 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review.

And August and September, I think many of the things that we've been working on will come to a final decision both on our part and that of the sellers. We're muted in the first half because as we were doing acquisitions, we've also taken a couple of small companies that no longer fit the portfolio and we've divested ourselves of those. That's why you see the net number affecting our overall revenues. The prices, I would say, are -- the prices are pretty dear. No one's giving anything away, nothing -- certainly nothing we're interested in purchasing. But they're not -- we're still very disciplined in the way that we approach it, and we have to assure ourselves that we can extract the proper value before we'll actually finish and close a deal. So I'm hopeful. There's a couple that we've been talking to which expand our presence in markets outside the United States. And also a couple in media that I'm hoping that we'll get accomplished in the back half of this year. But I'm not in control of -- without getting reckless about the price, I'm not in control about how the process finishes out. With respect to our capital program, that really remains the same, Peter. First, we plan to utilize our free cash flow really in 3 manners. First, to pay dividends; the second, to pay for and hopefully increase the number of acquisitions we do; and then share buybacks turn out to be the fallout of the difference between the amount of cash we generate in taking care of those first 2 items. There is no foreseeable change in terms of our attitude of what we're planning to do."

Would you say that's sort of the main reason that you're seeing that a lot these reviews are coming into play? And if you were -- and any commentary on possible pressure on margins just in maintaining a relationship. Do you have to give them a better deal to sort of keep that relationship, in your view?"

So we manage the business for the long term. We're going to continue to make the investments that we think need to be made and find the right balance of growth and profitability and returns. And we're going to take whatever actions we think we need to get there. Some of them more certainly longer term in nature, some of them are shorter term in nature.

No. And I think it will be a good, long time because I think the Fed hikes, when they come, will be very gradual and take quite a period of time before they become impactful.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.I'm pleased to speak to you this morning about our second quarter 2015 business results. As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter with organic growth up 5.3% and EB",1399,"Thank you, Shub. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.
I'm pleased to speak to you this morning about our second quarter 2015 business results. As I'm sure you've seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter with organic growth up 5.3% and EBITA margins increasing 10 basis points. Based on our year-to-date results, we're on track to meet revenue and margin targets for the full year.
As we mentioned on our year-end 2014 and first quarter 2015 earning calls, we expect that the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies would create headwinds to our 2015 reported revenue and net income. At the same time, it's important to point out that the majority of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged, with both revenue and expenses in the same currency.
In the second quarter, the significant change in exchange rates versus the prior period resulted in a 7.1% or $275 million, decline in reported revenue. Year-to-date, FX has reduced our revenue by $500 million.
On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased an additional 7% for both the quarter and the year. Phil will provide more details about the impact of foreign exchange by market later in the call. However, at this stage, if rates remain where they are today, the impact will moderate during the remainder of the year.
Turning now to organic revenue growth. North America increased 5.9%. The main drivers were brand advertising, which includes our media operations; specialty health care; and our CRM businesses.
The U.K. generated 5.4% growth. The performance in the U.K. was broad-based across our disciplines, with the exception of our PR operations, which had difficult comps versus the second quarter of 2014.
Organic revenue growth in our European region was 3.9%. In the Euro markets, Germany continued to outperform with over 5% growth, France was flat and the Netherlands was negative. Overall though, the euro currency markets were up almost 4%.
Outside Euro market, Turkey, Poland and Sweden had above-average results. Russia moderated to low single-digit growth in the quarter.
Looking at Asia Pacific, overall growth was 7.6%. Among our large markets, growth was strong in Australia, China and Singapore. Latin America was down 9.6% for the quarter. A positive performance in Mexico was offset by weaknesses in Brazil and Chile. The decline in Brazil is attributable to tough comps when compared to Q2 2014 World Cup spending and in '15, from sluggish economic conditions.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance and where we stand halfway through this year. 
I'd now like to make a few remarks on the macroeconomic picture in terms of things we're watching in the back half of 2015.
First, in the last few weeks, we've seen another economic crisis play out in Greece. Our Greek businesses are small and are expected to decline. In 2014, annual revenue was about $12 million, so the impact will not be material.
Second, as I mentioned earlier, China is still performing well for us, and we remain bullish on China despite recent setbacks in property and stock markets.
Two other large markets, Brazil and Russia, are projected to have negative GDP growth in 2015 and face inflationary pressures that will take some time to reverse. Brazil should, however, benefit next year as we start to focus on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio.
Lastly, the U.S. continues to improve, with moderate GDP growth. Hopefully, anticipated actions by the Fed later this year will not cause any harm to the U.S. recovery or emerging markets.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow generation. They remain very strong, enabling us to navigate and be opportunistic in these [indiscernible] markets. Our consistent practice for the use of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged, as does our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our credit ratings.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the unprecedented number of media buying and planning assignments that are currently up for a review. There is more media business up for review from large marketers at the present time than I personally have ever seen before. We estimate we're about halfway through the agency pitches for these large assignments, and I'm pleased to report we're doing quite well.
We recently added new media assignments from SC Johnson, which is a global win from one of our top competitors as well as Wells Fargo in the United States and Bacardi globally. These and a number of other wins brought in annual billings of over $1.4 billion in the first 6 months of 2015. 
And just last week, we were awarded Unilever's Australia media business, following the win of their global search businesses a few months ago.
Throughout this unprecedented period, it's been important to note our current clients are our first priority. Therefore, we have been very selective in choosing which media assignments to pursue and have elected not to participate in many reviews: 21st Century Fox, Citibank, Coke, COTY and L'Oreal.
Looking at the pitches still in progress, I would classify them in 2 buckets. First, accounts we are defending. On these assignments, we have about $1.2 billion in media billings. However, in most cases, we share these accounts with competitors, and we estimate there is about $1 billion in upside potential if we are successful in winning all of them.
Next, we're pursuing a few select new assignments where we have either no relationship or a very small one and where the upside is much greater. However, rather than trying to predict the outcome of these reviews, we can confirm that we're in a good position to benefit from any changes these large marketers made.
With the abnormally high number of large media assignments, it is an opportune time to look at what is behind many of them. We know the media landscape has become more complex, and many of the reviews are strategic reevaluations of agency suppliers.
Technology has radically changed media planning and buying. The rise of digital data and analytics has given marketers the ability to more precisely understand how consumers are using media. In areas such as programmatic buying and micro targeting, clients want to make sure that they have the right partner with the right resources in this space. 
We've also seen the number of available media channels increase exponentially in the past several years. Over the past 12 months in particular, we've seen the rapid growth and transition to online video really take hold. With many more media channels and online video available to consumers on so many devices, advertisers want to make sure they have the right strategies in place.
Given these areas of focus by our clients, Omnicom is especially well positioned as a result of our investments in analytic and our data management platform. Using this platform, our people today are analyzing campaigns on a granular level for hundreds of Omnicom clients around the globe.
These are differentiating assets for us and are proving to be a competitive advantage. While these data and analytic platforms are more important than ever, it is of course the talent of our people in putting them to work across all of our disciplines that really make the difference.
At this year's Cannes, we proved once again we have the best people in the business producing award-winning campaigns for our clients. Here are a few highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our talent.
Over 100 Omnicom agencies won nearly 250 Lions from approximately 50 different countries across 21 communication categories. CDM, one of the world's leading health care agencies, won the inaugural Healthcare Network of the Year award.
BBDO is the runner-up for Network of the Year, and had a record Cannes with 29 agencies winning almost 120 Lions. Omnicom Media Group and its flagship agencies, OMD and PHD, won over 60 Lions, including 3 Grand Prix for clients such as McDonald's, Apple, Under Armor and Harvey Nichols. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work.
Our investment in talent, technology and partnership are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these growth areas as the marketing environment becomes increasingly complex.
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,306751326,835360,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives in meeting the needs of their clients.For the second quarter, our organic revenue growth of 5.3% was once again above ou",2434,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives in meeting the needs of their clients.
For the second quarter, our organic revenue growth of 5.3% was once again above our expectations as the U.S. maintained its solid performance and we experienced strong performance in the U.K., Germany and Canada.
While our underlying businesses continue to perform well and we had good balance to our organic growth performance across our disciplines, exchange rates continue to create a considerable headwind on our revenue. This quarter, the negative impact of FX reduced revenue by 7.1%, or $275 million.
And as has been the case since the fourth quarter of last year, FX in the quarter was negative in all of our significant foreign markets. Including the small net positive impact from our acquisitions net of dispositions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.8 billion, down 1.7% versus Q2 last year.
We'll discuss our revenue growth in greater detail in a few minutes.
Turning to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by $8 million to $566 million versus $574 million in Q2 of last year. 
Exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our EBITA for the quarter, but since the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on margins was negative but not significant.
And operationally, our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization continue to make positive progress. As a result, the EBITA margin for the quarter of 14.9% was up a bit versus Q2 2014.
Operating income decreased $9 million to $539 million for the quarter. And although FX also negatively impacted operating income for the quarter and the amortization of our intangible assets resulting from our recent acquisitions increased on a year-over-year basis, our total operating margin of 14.2% was flat versus Q2 of 2014.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.6 million, up $900,000 versus Q2 of 2014 and up $400,000 from the first quarter. Versus the first quarter, the increase in net interest expense of $400,000 was the result of increased borrowing on our commercial paper facilities partially offset by additional interest income earned overseas.
Versus Q2 of last year, the positive impact of the floating interest rate swaps we entered into during Q2 and Q3 of 2014 effectively offset the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes. However, net interest expense was up $900,000 due to a decrease in interest earned on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers, primarily driven by negative FX translation as well as additional interest expense from increased U.S. LIBOR rates on our CP borrowings.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% continues to be in line with our current tax rate expectations for 2015. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our quarterly reported tax rate of 31.1% reflected the impact of an $11 million tax benefit we recognized related to merger expenses incurred in 2013 which were required to be capitalized for tax purposes at the time. Upon terminating the merger in May of 2014, we recognized the tax benefit related to those expenses. So to better understand the year-over-year change on the tax line and in our tax rate, in addition to the reported 2014 figures, we are also presenting our 2014 quarter and year-to-date numbers excluding the impact of this tax benefit.
Earnings from our affiliates of $4 million was flat year-over-year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $4.4 million to $28.8 million, largely due to the impact of FX because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.
As a result, net income for the quarter was just below $314 million. That's flat versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 of 2014's results. And it's down 3.5% or $11.3 million versus our reported Q2 results last year.
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $3.9 million of net income to participating securities, which for us, on the dividend-paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $310 million.
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 245.7 million. That's down 4.8% versus last year and was driven by our share buyback program which we resumed during the second quarter of 2014. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.26 per share, up 2.4%, an increase of $0.03 versus Q2 2014 reported EPS or up 5.9%, an increase of $0.07 versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 2014's results.
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. To save some time, I will just give you a few highlights. While organic revenue growth was 5.2% during the first 6 months of the year, the significant FX headwind caused revenue to decrease by 6.8%. And after factoring in the impact of acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, revenue declined on a year-to-date basis by 1.3% to just under $7.3 billion.
While FX also negatively impacted EBITA, which decreased 1.1% to $971 million, both our EBITA and operating margins were unchanged when compared to last year.
Turning to taxes on Page 5. Our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% is in line with our expectations. While the reported 2014 tax expense and tax rate reflect the impact of the $11 million tax benefit we recognized in Q2 of 2014 related to merger expenses incurred in 2013, which became deductible after the termination of the merger.
As you can see, similar to the way we presented our Q2 results, the comparative results for the 6-month period are presented both including and excluding the tax benefit. Excluding the impact of this tax benefit, the tax rate for the 6-month period in 2014 was 33.5% and our 6-month diluted EPS was $2.09 per share, which is up $0.09 or 4.5% versus 2014's reported figure of $2 per share and up $0.13 or 6.6% versus EPS after excluding the impact of the tax benefit recorded in Q2 of 2014.
Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, this quarter, we saw balanced organic growth across our disciplines, however, the effects of FX more than offset their performance. On a year-over-year basis, in the second quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against almost all of our major currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $275 million or 7.1%.
The FX impact was greatest in our European markets. The decline in the value of the euro and the pound represented nearly 60% of the FX decrease during the second quarter.
Looking ahead, considering the steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, if rates continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7% during the third quarter and approximately 6% for the full year.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $5 million. While we've added businesses both in the U.S. and in Latin America and Europe over the last 12 months, we've also made some strategic dispositions during that period as well in EMEA and the U.S.
And finally, organic growth was positive $204 million or 5.3% this quarter. Again, we had another quarter with solid organic growth across most of our major markets except for France, the Netherlands and Brazil. And we had good growth across our disciplines except PR, which was up slightly in the quarter.
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses and solid growth in CRM. Our full-service health care businesses, driven by new business wins over the last few quarters, posted double-digit organic growth in the quarter. Our U.K. businesses continued to perform well across most disciplines. We also had excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Mexico, Turkey and our Middle Eastern agencies.
In the Euro markets, driven by strong performance in Germany and Spain, overall organic growth remained positive. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was once again strong. 
Slide 8 covers our year-to-date revenue performance. The impact of FX reduced revenue by $0.5 billion over the first 6 months of 2015 or 6.8% while organic growth over that same period was 5.2%. 
On Slide 9, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split of revenue was 60% from North America, 10% U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe and 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to Slide 10. In North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, and we had organic revenue growth of 5.9%. While the media businesses continued to perform well, this quarter also saw strong growth from our full-service health care businesses and CRM businesses in the region.
Turning to international markets. The U.K. continued its strong performance this quarter except for our PR discipline, which faced difficult comps versus Q2 last year. The rest of Europe was up 3.9%, led by Germany and Spain, while France was flat and the Netherlands continues to lag negatively.
Our performance in the non-Euro markets in Europe continued to be solid. Before leaving Europe, in Greece, where the economic and political situation is uncertain, we have a very small presence with revenues of less than 0.1% of our consolidated revenues, so we do not expect much exposure. But given the uncertainty, we would expect a continued decline on our businesses going forward.
The Asia Pacific region was up 7.6%, with most markets performing well, including China, Australia and Singapore. 
One market that lagged was Latin America, which was down 9.6% organically. A positive performance in Mexico was offset by weakness in Chile and Brazil. In Chile, the decline resulted from a significant local client loss in 2014 that we are now finished cycling through. In Brazil, the decline resulted from both a difficult comp when compared to Q2 of 2014 due to the World Cup and from general softness in that market. 
And finally, the Africa and Middle East region, while relatively small in total, was up 11.9%, led by our businesses in the UAE and South Africa.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter, split equally between advertising services and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, advertising services were up 6.4% or $125 million and marketing services were up 4.1% or $79 million.
Within marketing services, CRM was up 4.3%. Most of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year, with only our sales promotion businesses down and our field marketing businesses close to flat. Public relations was up slightly at 0.3%. And specialty communications was up about 8% on the strength of the performance of our full-service health care businesses.
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing our year-to-date revenue in 2015 to last year's figures, you can see there were no meaningful changes in this mix. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In the first half of the year, we generated $757 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $251 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend during Q2 of 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $61 million. Capital expenditures were $107 million, up from last year due to an increase in leasehold improvements related to some recent real estate consolidations. And acquisitions, including earnout payments net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $65 million. And finally, stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $386 million.
Since we restarted our share repurchase program just over a year ago post the termination of the merger, we have spent about $1.38 billion and purchased about 19 million shares. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $113 million during the first 6 months of 2015.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of $4.57 billion is down about $37 million from the first quarter, mainly due to a decrease in the fair value adjustment to our debt's carrying value as required by U.S. GAAP related to the end of money amount of our interest rate swaps.
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of about $690 million over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $254 million as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $402 million using period-end spot rates.
Although our net debt has increased over the past year, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. And due to both a decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9x.
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions as well as focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 17.6% and return on equity increased to 35.9%.
And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through the second quarter which totaled $10.5 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review.

And August and September, I think many of the things that we've been working on will come to a final decision both on our part and that of the sellers. We're muted in the first half because as we were doing acquisitions, we've also taken a couple of small companies that no longer fit the portfolio and we've divested ourselves of those. That's why you see the net number affecting our overall revenues. The prices, I would say, are -- the prices are pretty dear. No one's giving anything away, nothing -- certainly nothing we're interested in purchasing. But they're not -- we're still very disciplined in the way that we approach it, and we have to assure ourselves that we can extract the proper value before we'll actually finish and close a deal. So I'm hopeful. There's a couple that we've been talking to which expand our presence in markets outside the United States. And also a couple in media that I'm hoping that we'll get accomplished in the back half of this year. But I'm not in control of -- without getting reckless about the price, I'm not in control about how the process finishes out. With respect to our capital program, that really remains the same, Peter. First, we plan to utilize our free cash flow really in 3 manners. First, to pay dividends; the second, to pay for and hopefully increase the number of acquisitions we do; and then share buybacks turn out to be the fallout of the difference between the amount of cash we generate in taking care of those first 2 items. There is no foreseeable change in terms of our attitude of what we're planning to do."

So does it have a direct impact on the capital structures or the ability for the advertising industry to function? No. And I think it will be a good, long time because I think the Fed hikes, when they come, will be very gradual and take quite a period of time before they become impactful.

Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statement and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations, and that actual events or results may differ materially.

As I'm sure you have seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter with organic growth up 6.1%, ahead of our expectations",1712,"Thank you, Shub. Good morning, and thanks for joining us this morning. I'm please to speak to you about our third quarter 2015 business results. As I'm sure you have seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter with organic growth up 6.1%, ahead of our expectations. Margins and net income were in line with our expectations and overall, our operations continue to show steady progress in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions and volatile markets.
As we had anticipated, we continue to face significant currency headwinds in the quarter. FX reduced our revenues by 7% or $272 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the strong U.S. dollar versus other currencies reduced our revenue by 7% or $773 million. EPS for the quarter was $0.97, up from $0.95 in the prior year-over-year or about 2%. On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased by approximately an additional 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year.
Looking forward, we expect currency effects to moderate in the fourth quarter and into next year. Phil will provide more details about the impact of foreign exchange by market and on our future results later in the call.
Turning now to organic revenue growth. North America increased in excess of 6%, reflecting strong performances in brand advertising, media and our specialty health care business. The U.K. was up 9%, which was broad-based across our operations. Our U.K. business has consistently performed well, which reflects the high caliber and diverse group of agencies we have in that market. Overall growth in Continental Europe was 4.5%. In the Euro markets, Germany was up mid-single digits. Spain also outperformed, while France and the Netherlands weighed on our results. Outside the Euro countries, Russia and Poland performed well and most other markets were positive.
Moving to Asia Pacific. Organic growth was in excess of 8%, with solid performance throughout the region. While our operations in China slowed a bit to mid-single digits, we remain bullish and see a long runway of growth ahead. We continue to see strong marketing spend in such categories as telecommunications, travel and personal care.
Latin America was our most difficult region in the quarter, with organic revenue declining almost 7%. Mexico and Argentina had double-digit growth, but this growth was offset by Brazil, which is our largest market in the region. Brazil's performance was affected by both the economy as well as difficult year-over-year comps.
While the current political and economic situation in Brazil is concerning, there are opportunities to invest and grow. The 2016 Summer Olympics should mitigate some of the risks in the short term. Our performance this quarter and to the year is reflective of the strategies we have in place to drive our growth. These strategies help us meet rapidly changing needs of our clients by giving them access to the best people and the latest technologies when and where they need them. 
First, is attracting, retaining and developing top talent. Next, is expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas. Third, is leveraging our data and analytic capabilities. Finally, we continue to deliver breakthrough creative ideas and solutions based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing disciplines and communications.
This morning, I'd like to discuss our progress against these strategies and also provide some updates to provide an update on the media reviews and address recent industry concerns on topics of availability and fraud in online advertising and transparency.
At Omnicom, we've always strive to be a great place for great people to work. It's been a priority to attract and retain the best talent and make sure they are continuously learning and being challenged. Our agencies and networks do an excellent job of training and developing our people within the context of their specific disciplines. And Omnicom for the support [indiscernible] through advanced management programs at Omnicom University.
We just completed the 21st year of Omnicom University in the United States and have expanded the program to China and Europe. This summer, for the first time, we hosted a joint education session with one of our large multinational client, which was a huge success.
Another aspect of achieving our talent development goals is creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. Diversity at Omnicom in backgrounds, experiences and perspectives is critical to ensuring we have the best talent. It's not just a word or concept to us, we have put diversity into action by creating groups, programs, scholarships that promote diversity and inclusion.
One barometer we used to measure our success is our performance in award shows. Once again, our agencies and networks continue their tradition of being the most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me just mention a few highlights from the Spikes Advertising Festival held recently in Singapore, which is considered the CON of Asia.
BBDO receives top honor, winning Network of the Year for the second year in a row. DDB placed third. BBDO and DDB have finished in top 3 networks for 7 consecutive years. BBDO won Agency of the Year. All [indiscernible] 40 [ph] agencies in 12 countries contributed to nearly 150 Spike awards. I want to congratulate all of our people for their outstanding work.
During the quarter, we continue to expand our capabilities through internal investments in our agencies and service platforms, specifically in the areas of production, technology and content development. Today's market complexity demands our agencies to produce ever more creative content that can be distributed equally across different devices, channels and markets.
To meet the increasing needs of our clients, you may recall last year, Omnicom formed eg+ Worldwide, a global implementation and production agency. And since then, it has expanded capabilities in various markets. With over 1,400 employees in 14 countries, EG plus has become the leader in leveraging the latest technologies to help global brands implement and localize creative content across video, digital and print media channels. The result is a broader and deeper service offering that fuses the best talent and the latest technologies and our efforts in this area will continue to expand and provide value to our clients.
Turning to the media accounts and review. Most of the high-profile reviews should be decided by Thanksgiving. As I discussed on our last call, we've been very selective in choosing, which media assignments to pursue and elected not to participate in several reviews, including Citibank, Coke, Cody and L'Oreal.
In terms of our progress, we have done pretty well. We've added new media business from well-known advertisers such as SC Johnson and Bacardi Globally, Wells Fargo in the United States. We've also successfully defended a number of accounts such as JCPenney and GlaxoSmithKline, adding significant assignments from the [indiscernible].
These and a number of other wins brought in billings of over $1.4 billion so far. At this point, we still have an opportunity to gain additional business as the remaining pitches come to a conclusion.
Annalect played a key role in each of our wins. As a result of our investments early on in Annalect and data management platform, we picked up a significant share of the new business in digital, specifically around data and analytics. Annalect is embedded in our account teams and is truly differentiating asset for us.
Turning now to look at some of the issues facing our industry. The growing scale of the programmatic and online video advertising has led to valid concerns over fraud and availability of online apps. In other words, how much of an ad is seen by an actual consumer and for how long. One key factor in this area is independent verification. Marketers and agencies are pushing and rightfully so to prove that ads are being seen by real people and are effective in driving sales. We believe that third-party verification is a fundamental requirement. Publishers should not grade their own homework. For our part, since 2013, we've been providing third-party verification services in the U.S. on our clients programmatic and digital network buys. This has been invaluable in giving us the data and visibility we need to adjust publisher pricing based upon rates and to ensure that our clients receive the value they expect. 
We recognize that digital publishers face a complex environment due to the varied nature of their content or the device it's being delivered on. In light of this, our digital video leadership active on joint industry efforts such as IAC and TAG to shape measurement standards. This is especially important for ads delivered on mobile devices where standards are only now being discussed. In some, the system is complex but the goal is simple, to make sure advertisers get what they pay for and we're working towards practical solutions to help move the entire industry forward. 
Finally, I also want to touch on a subject from earlier this year, the joint task force of the ANA [indiscernible] to create U.S. media transparency standards. We've been actively involved in this work over the past month and we're pleased with the progress in terms of collaboration and understanding between the advertiser and agency members. We expect principles will be issued shortly and we support any constructive steps that increase advertising confidence across our industry, while encouraging competition and innovation. 
In our conversations with our clients, advertisers are seeking more choices today in terms of service or performance requirements, but this only underscores the industry's obligation to strict contract compliance, which includes the return of any media rebates in the United States and disclosure of all of our services in various equity interest we may have. 
From a Omnicom standpoint, this is a fundamental to the essential trust between client and agency that our business is built on. Before concluding my prepared remarks, I'd like to say that while I'm pleased with our strategic and financial performance, the remainder of 2015 has numerous political and economic challenges. From Brazil to China and the Middle East, as well as the potential actions by the Federal Reserves and other Central Bank. With 1 quarter left to the year, I'm confident that we are on track to achieve our revenue and margin targets for the full year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Phil to take a closer look at the quarter's results. Phil?"
96161,314100900,877975,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. John said our business has continued to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients.

John said our business has continued to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients. For the third quarter, our organic revenue growth of 6.1% once again exceeded our expectations as the U.S. continued its strong performance, and we experienced solid growth in the U.K. and Canada and across most of our Asia Pacific markets as well as in several other European markets. While our underlying business has continued a solid performance, exchange rates continue to create a considerable headwind on our international revenue. Again this quarter, FX was negative in all of our significant foreign markets, reducing our total revenue by 7.2% or $272 million. When accounting for the small net positive impact from our acquisitions net of dispositions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.7 billion, down 1.1% versus Q3 of last year. We will go over our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Turning to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for the third quarter of 2015 decreased by $6 million to $455 million versus $461 million in Q3 of last year. As you would expect, exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our total EBITA for the quarter and more significant than in the first 6 months of the year.
While the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenue, essentially serving as a natural hedge, in a few of our higher margin markets, including Canada, Australia and Brazil, FX had a larger negative impact this quarter than earlier in the year and through the first 9 months of 2015, FX reduced our overall EBITA margin by roughly 18 basis points.
However, helping to offset the FX headwinds on EBITA has been our focus on maintaining flexibility on our cost structure and our continued efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization. Our initiatives have had a positive impact, and we expect they will continue to make our operations more efficient as we extend them throughout the organization. As a result, for the third quarter, our EBITA margin of 12.3% was unchanged versus Q3 of 2014.
Moving to operating income. It decreased by $5 million to $428 million for the quarter as results were negatively impacted by FX. Our operating margin of 11.6% remains flat as compared to Q3 2014, similar to our EBITA margin.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $35.9 million, up $4.5 million versus Q3 of 2014 and was relatively flat, up about $1.3 million from the second quarter of this year. Versus Q3 of last year, the additional interest expense related to the issuance of last October of $750 million of our 10-year senior notes was partially offset by the benefit of the floating interest rate swaps we entered into during Q3 of 2014. 
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased primarily, driven by negative FX translation. And versus the previous quarter, the increase in net interest expense of $1.3 million was the result of a decrease in the interest benefit from a floating interest rate swap as well as a reduction in interest income. 
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% continues to be in line with our current tax rate expectations for 2015. Earnings from our affiliates of $3.2 million is down $2.6 million this quarter related to a reduction in the contribution of certain international affiliates, which were negatively impacted by FX. The allocation of earnings for the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $2.4 million to $27.4 million, also due to the impact of FX, which is a significant portion of our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.
In general, excluding the impact of FX, the underlying performance of these businesses remains strong. As a result, net income for the quarter was $239 million, that's down 1.8% or $4.5 million versus our Q3 results last year. Now turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $2.5 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the dividend paying unvested shares held by our employees, was 236.8 million. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 244.4 million shares. That's down 3.2% versus last year, driven by our share buyback activity in prior periods. The resulting diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.97 per share, an increase of $0.02 or 2.1% versus Q3 of 2014.
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. The brief highlights are: Organic revenue growth was 5.5% during the first 9 months of the year; the FX headwind was even larger, decreasing revenue by 7%; net of the impact of our recent acquisitions and dispositions of $20 million, revenue declined on a year-to-date basis by 1.3% to just under $11 billion. While FX also negatively impacted EBITA, which decreased 1.1% to $1.425 billion, our year-to-date EBITA margin of 13% was unchanged when compared to last year. 
Turning to taxes on Page 5, our effective tax rate for 2015 was 32.8%. It's in line with our current expectations for our annualized rate and reflects the impact of the legal restructuring of our European entities, which was largely completed earlier this year. Keep in mind that the reported 2014 tax expense and tax rate reflect the impact of the $11 million tax benefit we recognized in Q2 of 2014 related to merger expenses that were incurred with 2013 and which became deductible after the termination of the venture. Because of this, we have sent to the prior year's 9 months results both including and excluding the tax benefits. And on Page 6, you can see our 9-month diluted EPS was $3.06 per share, which is up $0.11 or 3.7% versus 2014's reported figure of $2.95 per share and up $0.15 or 5.2% versus EPS when excluding the impact of the tax benefit that was recorded in Q2 of 2014.
On Slide 7, we turn the discussion to our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, this quarter, we continue to see organic growth across most of our regions and service offerings, however, the effects of FX continue to more than offset the performance of our businesses. On a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against everyone of our major currency. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $272 million or 7.2%. The decline in the value of the euro represented approximately 1/3 of the overall FX impact. But during the third quarter, we also saw significant decreases through the declines in the pound, the Australian and Canadian dollar and both the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble declined by approximately 40% versus the third quarter of last year. This latest cycle of currency is weakening against the U.S. dollar started to impact us on the latter part of 2014. So as we cycle past the 1-year mark, if currency stay where they currently are, the FX headwinds may begin to subside. Based on our recent projections, FX could negatively impact our revenue by approximately 4.5% during the fourth quarter, which will bring that full year reduction to a little under $1 billion or approximately 6.3%. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue marginally. While we've recently added businesses both domestically and internationally, we've made some strategic dispositions over the past year as well. 
And finally, organic growth was a positive $228 million or 6.1% this quarter. Much as we experienced in the second quarter, we had another quarter with solid organic growth across most of our major markets with a notable exception being France and Netherlands, which continue to struggle; and Brazil, which is facing a difficult economic environment and difficult comps. And we again add good growth across our disciplines, most notably health care, with the exception being PR, which was down for the quarter but remains up for the year. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included our media and brand advertising businesses, which have strong performances this quarter; our full-service health care businesses, which continue to see positive impact of the new business wins over the past year or so; the continued outstanding performance of our U.K. operations; recovery in Southern Europe markets, driven by Germany and Spain, the performance for emerging markets this quarter, including strong results in South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand; and despite the recent market turbulence in China, we also posted positive organic growth there.
Slide 8 covers our year-to-date revenue performance. The impact of FX reduced revenue by over it $750 million over the first 3 quarters of 2015  or 7%, while organic growth over that same period was 5.5%. On Slide 9, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split of revenue was 60% from North America, 11% from the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe and 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining revenue coming from our Latin America and Africa and the Middle East region. 
Turning to Slide 10, in North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, and we had organic revenue growth of 6.3%. Turning to international. As I just mentioned, the U.K. had another strong performance this quarter. The rest of Europe was up 4.5%, led by Germany and Spain. Our businesses in France continue to face challenges with negative organic growth, while the Netherlands also continues to lag behind. As we mentioned during the Q2 call, our presence in Greece is very small, accounting for less than 1/10 of 1% of our consolidated revenue. So while our businesses in the market declined this quarter as we had anticipated, the impact overall was negligible.
The Asia Pacific region was up 8.6%, with most markets performing well, including Australia, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The 1 reason that lagged was Latin America, which was down 6.9% organically. While Mexico had another positive quarter, it was overshadowed by the reduction in Brazil. In Brazil, the decline resulted from the weakening of the overall economy as well as difficult comps when compared to the fairly strong performance we had in Q3 of 2014. And finally, our Africa and Middle East region was up marginally in the quarter.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter. Once again, just about split equally between advertising services and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, advertising services were up 9.9% or $183 million. Marketing services were up 2.3% or $44 million. Within marketing services, CRM was up 2.8%, maintaining year-to-date growth of over 3%. The trend for the quarter for the vast majority of our sub categories within the CRM discipline is up year-over-year with the exception being our sales promotion business. 
PR was down 1.5% in the quarter but it's still positive year-to-date. And specialty communications was up about 5.4%, with nearly double-digit organic growth in our full-service health care businesses, which was partially offset by a decrease in our other specialty agencies. 
Year-to-date, our health care business is up about 8% organically, driven primarily by new business wins. On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing our year-to-date revenue in 2015 to last year's figures, you can see there were no meaningful changes in this mix by industry. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In the first 9 months of the year, we generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders of $374 million were up when compared to last year, as a result of the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend during 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $87 million. Capital expenditures were $146 million. As we've mentioned previously, CapEx is up from last year due to the increase in leasehold improvements related to the some recent real estate consolidations initiatives. 
Acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investment, totaled $86 million. And the stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $474 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $55 million for the first 9 months of this year.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of $4.6 billion is up about $48 million from the second quarter. The increase is entirely due to the change in the fair value for our debt carrying value related to the end of money amount of our interest rate swaps as required under U.S. GAAP. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter of $3.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of about $224 million over the past 12 months using period-end spot rates was driven primarily by the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances over the last 12 months of approximately $373 million. The impact of the fair value adjustment to our debt-carrying value related to our flowing rate swaps, which totaled $86 [ph] million, the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $42 million and miscellaneous other items, which was partially offset by a positive contribution from operating capital of $315 million. 
Although our net debt has increased over the past year, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. In our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.6x. 
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisition and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 17.9% and our return on equity increased to 39.6%. And finally, on Slide 17, we track our accumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through the third quarter, which totaled $10.8 billion. And the bar show the commodity return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases. The sum of which during the same period totaled $11.6 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 107%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But that this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

As I've said earlier, the year-to-date impact on FX is about 18 basis points. But in the third quarter, which again is a relatively small quarter, FX impacted us in excess of about 30 basis points. So we're a little surprised by that, but it's really just the math of where the FX impacts. We've got a lot of corporate costs primarily the U.S. and some of our high-margin markets outside the U.S. were impacted a little bit more heavily by FX this quarter as an overall percentage or proportion of the total pie. So we think we've done a pretty good job to get back to the margins we delivered overall for the third quarter, which was where our internal targets were coming out. But FX certainly has been a big challenge for us this year on the top line and I think in the third quarter, had a little bit higher-than-expected impact on our overall operating costs and our operating margins. So I think we're comfortable with the performance. I think we look at the fourth quarter if FX rates stay where they are now, we expect revenues to be down about 4.5%. FX have started to come, say, late September, early October of '14, that's when the dollar really started to strengthen significantly. But the euro and pound actually didn't start to weaken relative to the dollar on a reported basis until early in 2015. So we expect to see some of the weakness in the fourth quarter relative to the euro and the pound, which are our biggest international markets. And yes, I think from a margin perspective, our expectation is the same. We're going to continue to internally drive towards maintaining margins and overcoming whatever FX has in store for us in the fourth quarter."

So some of our higher-margin markets, Canada, Australia, Brazil and actually, Russia, although Brazil and Russia given the currency impacts are much smaller than they were last year. When we have high-margin markets that are impacted significantly by FX, we have less revenue and less EBIT. The less EBIT over what is a large U.S. dollar-driven denominator ends up having slightly lower margins because there is less EBIT from those markets, where the currency negative was larger than the proportion of the total. So hopefully that clarifies it for you. But it's back to -- it's kind of -- it's not always intuitive. It's not always in a straight line how FX impact each of our international operations."

It's an ongoing battle. People don't have to sit there and suffer things that are of not interest to them. So it has come upon us to improve the product. And the battle though has gone on, some high-quality publishers are already requiring users to disable their ad blockers in order to gain access to their content.

I am pleased to speak to you about our third quarter 2015 business results. 
As I am sure you have seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter with organic growth up 6.1%, ahead of our expectations. Margins and net income were in line with our expectations. And overall, our operations continue to show steady progress in a phase of challenging macroeconomic conditions and volatile markets.
As we had anticipated, we continued to face significant currency headwinds in the quarter. FX reduced our revenues by 7% or $272 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the strong U.S. dollar versus other currencies reduced our revenue by 7% or $773 million. 
EPS for the quarter was $0.97, up from $0.95 in the prior year or about 2%. On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased by approximately an additional 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year.  Looking forward, we expect currency effects to moderate in the fourth quarter and into next year. Phil will provide more details about the impact of foreign exchange by market and on our future results later in the call.
Turning now to organic revenue growth. North America increased in excess of 6%, reflecting strong performances in brand advertising, media and our specialty health care business. The U.K. was up 9%, which was broad-based across our operations. Our U.K. business has consistently performed well, which reflects the high caliber and diverse group of agencies we have in that market. Overall growth in Continental Europe was 4.5%. In the Euro markets, Germany was up mid-single digits, Spain also outperformed, while France and the Netherlands weighed on our results. Outside the Euro countries, Russia and Poland performed well and most other markets were positive.
Moving to Asia Pacific. Organic growth was in excess of 8%, with solid performance throughout the region. While our operations in China slowed a bit to mid-single digits, we remain bullish and see a long runway of growth ahead. We continue to see strong marketing spend in such categories as telecommunications, travel and personal care.
Latin America was our most difficult region in the quarter, with organic revenue declining almost 7%. Mexico and Argentina had double-digit growth, but this growth was offset by Brazil, which is our largest market in the region. Brazil's performance was affected by both the economy as well as difficult year-over-year comps.  While the current political and economic situation in Brazil is concerning, there are opportunities to invest and grow. 
The 2016 Summer Olympics should mitigate some of the risks in the short term. Our performance this quarter and for the year is reflective of the strategies we have in place to drive our growth. These strategies help us meet rapidly changing needs of our clients by giving them access to the best people and the latest technologies when and where they need them.  First is attracting, retaining and developing top talent. Next is expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas. Third is leveraging our data and analytic capabilities. Finally, we continue to deliver breakthrough creative ideas and solutions based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing disciplines and communications.
This morning, I'd like to discuss our progress against these strategies and also provide some updates to provide an update on the media reviews and address recent industry concerns on topics of viewability and fraud in online advertising and transparency.
At Omnicom, we have always strive to be a great place for great people to work. It's been a priority to attract and retain the best talent and make sure they are continuously learning and being challenged. Our agencies and networks do an excellent job of training and developing our people within the context of their specific disciplines, and Omnicom further supports this through advanced management programs at Omnicom University.
We've just completed the 21st year of Omnicom University in the United States and have expanded the program to China and Europe. This summer, for the first time, we hosted a joint education session with one of our large multinational clients, which was a huge success.
Another aspect of achieving our talent development goals is creating a diverse and an inclusive workforce. Diversity at Omnicom in backgrounds, experiences and perspectives is critical to ensuring we have the best talent. It's not just a word or concept to us. We have put diversity into action by creating groups, programs, scholarships that promote diversity and inclusion.
One barometer we used to measure our success is our performance in award shows. Once again, our agencies and networks continue their tradition of being the most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me just mention a few highlights from the Spikes Advertising Festival held recently in Singapore, which is considered the Con of Asia [ph].
BBDO received top honor, winning Network of the Year for the second year in a row. DDB placed third. BBDO and DDB have finished in top 3 networks for 7 consecutive years. Colenso BBDO won Agency of the Year. All totaled, 40 agencies in 12 countries contributed to nearly 150 Spike awards. I want to congratulate all of our people for their outstanding work.
During the quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities through internal investments in our agencies and service platforms, specifically in the areas of production, technology and content development. Today's market complexity demands our agencies produce ever more creative content that can be distributed quickly across different devices, channels and markets.
To meet the increasing needs of our clients, you may recall last year, Omnicom formed eg+ Worldwide, a global implementation and production agency, and since then it has expanded capabilities in various markets. With over 1,400 employees in 14 countries, eg+ has become a leader in leveraging the latest technologies to help global brands implement and localize creative content across video, digital and print media channels. The result is a broader and deeper service offering that fuses the best talent and the latest technologies, and our efforts in this area will continue to expand and provide value to our clients.
Turning to the media accounts and review. Most of the high-profile reviews should be decided by Thanksgiving. As I discussed on our last call, we've been very selective in choosing which media assignments to pursue and have elected not to participate in several reviews, including Citibank, Coke, Cody and L'Oreal.
In terms of our progress, we have done pretty well. We've added new media business from well-known advertisers, such as SC Johnson and Bacardi globally, Wells Fargo in the United States. We've also successfully defended a number of accounts, such as JCPenney and GlaxoSmithKline, adding significant assignments from the Novartis.
These and a number of other wins brought in billings of over $1.4 billion so far. At this point, we still have an opportunity to gain additional business as the remaining pitches come to a conclusion.
Annalect played a key role in each of our wins. As a result of our investments, early on, in Annalect and its data management platform, we picked up a significant share of the new business in digital, specifically around data and analytics. Annalect is embedded in our account teams and is truly differentiating asset for us.
Turning now to look at some of the issues facing our industry. The growing scale of the programmatic and online video advertising has led to valid concerns over fraud and viewability of online ads; in other words, how much of an ad is seen by an actual consumer and for how long. One key factor in this area is independent verification. Marketers and agencies are pushing publishers and rightly so to prove that ads are being seen by real people and are effective in driving sales. We believe that third-party verification is a fundamental requirement. Publishers should not grade their own homework. For our part, since 2013, we've been providing third-party verification services in the U.S. on our clients' programmatic and digital network buys. This has been invaluable in giving us the data and visibility we need to adjust publisher pricing based upon viewability rates and to ensure that our clients receive the value they expect. 
We recognize that digital publishers face a complex environment due to the varied nature of their content or the device it's being delivered on. In light of this, our digital media leadership is active on joint industry efforts, such as IAC and TAG, to shape measurement standards. This is especially important for ads delivered on mobile devices, where standards are only now being discussed. In sum, the ecosystem is complex but the goal is simple, to make sure advertisers get what they pay for, and we are working towards practical solutions to help move the entire industry forward.
Finally, I also want to touch on a subject from earlier this year, the joint task force of the ANA and AAAA to create U.S. media transparency standards. We've been actively involved in this work over the past months, and we're pleased with the progress in terms of collaboration and understanding between the advertiser and agency members. We expect principles will be issued shortly and we support any constructive steps that increase advertiser confidence across our industry while encouraging competition and innovation. 
In our conversations with our clients, advertisers are seeking more choices today in terms of service or performance requirements, but this only underscores the industry's obligation to strict contract compliance, which includes the return of any media rebates in the United States and disclosure of all of our services and various equity interests we may have.  From a Omnicom standpoint, this is a fundamental to the essential trust between client and agency that our business is built on. 
Before concluding my prepared remarks, I'd like to say that while I'm pleased with our strategic and financial performance, the remainder of 2015 has numerous economic and political challenges, from Brazil to China and the Middle East as well as the potential actions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. With one quarter left to the year, I'm confident that we are on track to achieve our revenue and margin targets for the full year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Phil to take a closer look at the quarter's results. Phil?"
96161,314100900,878134,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. John said our business has continued to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients.

John said our business has continued to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients. For the third quarter, our organic revenue growth of 6.1% once again exceeded our expectations, as the U.S. continued its strong performance and we experienced solid growth in the U.K. and Canada and across most of our Asia Pacific markets as well as in several other European markets. 
While our underlying business has continued as solid performance, exchange rates continue to create a considerable headwind on our international revenue. Again this quarter, FX was negative in all of our significant foreign markets, reducing our total revenue by 7.2% or $272 million. When accounting for the small net positive impact from our acquisitions, net of dispositions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.7 billion, down 1.1% versus Q3 of last year. We will go over our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Turning to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for the third quarter of 2015 decreased by $6 million to $455 million versus $461 million in Q3 of last year. As you would expect, exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our total EBITA for the quarter and more significant than in the first 6 months of the year.  While the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, essentially serving as a natural hedge, in a few of our higher-margin markets, including Canada, Australia and Brazil, FX had a larger negative impact this quarter than earlier in the year. And through the first 9 months of 2015, FX reduced our overall EBITA margin by roughly 18 basis points.
However, helping to offset the FX headwinds on EBITA has been our focus on maintaining flexibility on our cost structure and our continued efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization. Our initiatives have had a positive impact, and we expect they will continue to make our operations more efficient as we extend them throughout the organization. As a result, for the third quarter, our EBITA margin of 12.3% was unchanged versus Q3 of 2014.
Moving to operating income. It decreased by $5 million to $428 million for the quarter, and results were negatively impacted by FX. Our operating margin of 11.6% remained flat as compared to Q3 2014, similar to our EBITA margin.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $35.9 million, up $4.5 million versus Q3 of 2014, was relatively flat, up about $1.3 million from the second quarter of this year. Versus Q3 of last year, the additional interest expense related to the issuance, last October, of $750 million of our 10-year senior notes was partially offset by the benefit of the floating interest rate swaps we entered into during Q3 of 2014.
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased, primarily driven by negative FX translation. And versus the previous quarter, the increase in net interest expense of $1.3 million was the result of a decrease in the interest benefit from a floating interest rate swap as well as a reduction in interest income. 
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% continue to be in line with our current tax rate expectations for 2015. 
Earnings from our affiliates of $3.2 million is down $2.6 million this quarter, related to a reduction in the contribution of certain international affiliates, which were negatively impacted by FX. The allocation of earnings for the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $2.4 million to $27.4 million, also due to the impact of FX, which is a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.  In general, excluding the impact of FX, the underlying performance of these businesses remained strong. 
As a result, net income for the quarter was $239 million. That's down 1.8% or $4.5 million versus our Q3 results last year. 
Now turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter, after the allocation of $2.5 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the dividend paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was 236.8 million. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 244.4 million shares. That's down 3.2% versus last year, driven by our share buyback activity in prior periods. The resulting diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.97 per share, an increase of $0.02 or 2.1% versus Q3 of 2014.
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. The brief highlights are: Organic revenue growth was 5.5% during the first 9 months of the year. The FX headwind was even larger, decreasing revenue by 7%. Net of the impact of our recent acquisitions and dispositions of $20 million, revenue declined on a year-to-date basis by 1.3% to just under $11 billion. While FX also negatively impacted EBITA, which decreased 1.1% to $1.425 billion, our year-to-date EBITA margin of 13% was unchanged when compared to last year. 
Turning to taxes on Page 5, our effective tax rate for 2015 was 32.8%, is in line with our current expectations for our annualized rate and reflects the impact of the legal restructuring of our European entities, which was largely completed earlier this year. Keep in mind that the reported 2014 tax expense and tax rate reflect the impact of the $11 million tax benefit we recognized in Q2 of 2014 related to merger expenses that were incurred with 2013 and which became deductible after the termination of the merger. Because of this, we have presented the prior year's 9-month results both including and excluding the tax benefit. 
And on Page 6, you can see our 9-month diluted EPS was $3.06 per share, which is up $0.11 or 3.7% versus 2014's reported figure of $2.95 per share, and up $0.15 or 5.2% versus EPS, when excluding the impact of the tax benefit that was recorded in Q2 of 2014.
On Slide 7, we turn the discussion to our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, this quarter, we continue to see organic growth across most of our regions and service offerings. However, the effects of FX continue to more than offset the performance of our businesses. On a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $272 million or 7.2%. The decline in the value of the euro represented approximately 1/3 of the overall FX impact. But during the third quarter, we also saw significant decreases through the declines in the pound, the Australian and Canadian dollars and both the Brazilian reais and the Russian ruble declined by approximately 40% versus the third quarter of last year. This latest cycle of currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar started to impact us in the latter part of 2014. So as we cycle-pass the 1-year mark, if currencies stay where they currently are, the FX headwinds may begin to subside. Based on our recent projections, FX could negatively impact our revenue by approximately 4.5% during the fourth quarter, which will bring that full year reduction to a little under $1 billion or approximately 6.3%. 
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue marginally. While we've recently added businesses both domestically and internationally, we've made some strategic dispositions over the past year as well.
And finally, organic growth was a positive $228 million or 6.1% this quarter. Much as we experienced in the second quarter, we had another quarter with solid organic growth across most of our major markets, with the notable exceptions being France and Netherlands, which continue to struggle, and Brazil, which is facing a difficult economic environment and difficult comps. 
And we again add good growth across our disciplines, most notably healthcare, with the exception being PR, which was down for the quarter but remains up for the year. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter include: our media and brand advertising businesses, which had strong performances this quarter; our full-service healthcare businesses, which continue to see the positive impact of their new business wins over the past year or so; the continued outstanding performance of our U.K. operations; recovery in certain Europe markets driven by Germany and Spain; the performance for our emerging markets this quarter, including strong results in South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand; and despite the recent market turbulence in China, we also posted positive organic growth there.
Slide 8 covers our year-to-date revenue performance. The impact of FX reduced revenue by over it $750 million over the first 3 quarters of 2015  or 7%, while organic growth over that same period was 5.5%. 
On Slide 9, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split of revenue was 60% from North America, 11% from the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe and 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining revenue coming from our Latin America and Africa and the Middle East regions. 
Turning to Slide 10. In North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, and we had organic revenue growth of 6.3%. 
Turning to international. As I just mentioned, the U.K. had another strong performance this quarter. The rest of Europe was up 4.5%, led by Germany and Spain. Our businesses in France continue to face challenges with negative organic growth, while the Netherlands also continues to lag behind. As we mentioned during the Q2 call, our presence in Greece is very small, accounting for less than 0.001% of our consolidated revenue. So while our businesses in the market declined this quarter as we had anticipated, the impact overall was negligible.
The Asia Pacific region was up 8.6%, with most markets performing well, including Australia, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The one region that lagged was Latin America, which was down 6.9% organically. While Mexico had another positive quarter, it was overshadowed by reduction in Brazil. In Brazil, the decline resulted from the weakening of the overall economy as well as difficult comp when compared to the fairly strong performance we had in Q3 of 2014. And finally, our Africa and Middle East region was up marginally in the quarter.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter. Once again, they are just about split equally between advertising services and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, advertising services were up 9.9% or $183 million, marketing services were up 2.3% or $44 million. Within marketing services, CRM was up 2.8%, maintaining year-to-date growth of over 3%. The trend for the quarter for the vast majority of our subcategories within the CRM discipline is up year-over-year, with the exception being our sales promotion business. 
PR was down 1.5% in the quarter but is still positive year-to-date. And specialty communications was up about 5.4%, with nearly double-digit organic growth in our full-service healthcare businesses, which was partially offset by a decrease in our other specialty agencies.  Year-to-date, our healthcare business was up about 8% organically, driven primarily by new business wins. 
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing our year-to-date revenue in 2015 to last year's figures, you can see there were no meaningful changes in this mix by industry. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In the first 9 months of the year, we generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders of $374 million were up when compared to last year as a result of the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend during 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $87 million. Capital expenditures were $146 million. As we've mentioned previously, CapEx was up from last year due to the increase in leasehold improvements related to the some recent real estate consolidations initiatives. 
Acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $86 million. And the stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employees' share plans, totaled $474 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $55 million for the first 9 months of this year.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of $4.6 billion is up about $48 million from the second quarter. The increase was entirely due to the change in the fair value for our debt's carrying value related to the in-the-money amount of our interest rate swaps, as required under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of about $224 million over the past 12 months using period-end spot rates was driven primarily by the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances over the last 12 months of approximately $373 million; the impact of the fair value adjustment to our debt's carrying value related to our flowing rate swaps, which totaled $86 million; the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $42 million and miscellaneous other items, which was partially offset by a positive contribution from operating capital of $315 million.  
Although our net debt has increased over the past year, our ratios remained very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x, and our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.6x. 
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 17.9% and our return on equity increased to 39.6%. 
And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through the third quarter, which totaled $10.8 billion. And the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.6 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 107%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But that this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

The growth year-over-year for the quarter was a little bit less than the second quarter. Third quarter is typically a smaller quarter than the second and/or the fourth. The rate of growth has slowed a bit versus last year. In the third quarter, I think the number was about $40 million. We expect, given Accuen has been around for just about 2 years now, we expect that as the numbers get bigger in the base, the rate of growth was going to slow a little bit.

As I've said earlier, the year-to-date impact on FX is about 18 basis points. But in the third quarter, which again is a relatively small quarter, FX impacted us by, in excess of about 30 basis points. So we're a little surprised by that, but it's really just the math of where the FX impacts us. We've got a lot of corporate costs, primarily in the U.S. and some of our high-margin markets outside the U.S. were impacted a little bit more heavily by FX this quarter as an overall percentage or proportion of the total pie. So we think we've done a pretty good job to get back to the margins we delivered overall for the third quarter, which was where our internal targets were coming out but FX certainly has been a big challenge for us this year, on the top line and I think in the third quarter it had a little bit higher-than-expected impact on our overall operating costs and our operating margins. So I think we're comfortable with the performance. I think we look at the fourth quarter. If FX rates stay where they are now, we'd expect revenues to be down about 4.5%. FX have started to come down say, late September, early October of '14, that's when the dollar really started to strengthen significantly but the euro and pound actually didn't start to weaken relative to the dollar on a reported basis until early in 2014 and 2015. So we expect to see some of the weakness in the fourth quarter relative to the euro and the pound, which are our biggest international markets. And yes, I think from a margin perspective our expectation is the same. We're going to continue to internally drive towards maintaining margins and overcoming whatever FX has in store for us in the fourth quarter."

So some of our higher-margin markets Canada, Australia, Brazil and actually, Russia, although Brazil and Russia, given the currency impacts are much smaller than they were last year. When we have high-margin markets that are impacted significantly by FX, we have less revenue and less EBIT. The less EBIT over what is a large U.S. dollar-driven denominator ends up having slightly lower margins because there is less EBIT from those markets where the currency negative was larger than the proportion of the total.

So salary and service, we expect they're more valuable and flexible than our office and general costs and we'd expect them to grow a bit as our revenue grows. I think in this year, we found through 9 30, our headcount numbers are up a bit, primarily in the U.S., a little bit in the U.K. So the number we expect to kind of grow with our revenues, office in general, which are more fixed in nature, we expect them to, as a percentage of revenue, which is how we look at the numbers, we'd expect them to decline over time. And given some of the initiatives we have, especially in the area of real estate, we'd expect to continue to pursue those opportunities to reduce those cost and keep them as low as possible. I think the trend is what we would expect to see. Yes, I think we're on right about the time that the market is going to open. So I think we could do one more question."

So I tend to agree with some CMOs, which've basically said, if we focus on great work, that consumers will be interested in, will pass -- we'll get past the ad blocking concerns that are in the marketplace. It's an ongoing battle. People don't have to sit there and suffer things that are of not interest to them and so it coming upon us to improve the product and the battle though is going on, some high-quality publishers are already requiring users to disable their ad-blockers in order to gain access to their content. We'll see what happens in that battle. So everybody is front and center. We're certainly addressing ourselves to it by focusing on the work and the content that we provide to the consumer."

I am pleased to speak to you about our third quarter 2015 business results. 
As I am sure you have seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter with organic growth up 6.1%, ahead of our expectations. Margins and net income were in line with our expectations. And overall, our operations continue to show steady progress in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions and volatile markets.
As we had anticipated, we continued to face significant currency headwinds in the quarter. FX reduced our revenues by 7% or $272 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the strong U.S. dollar versus other currencies reduced our revenue by 7% or $773 million. 
EPS for the quarter was $0.97, up from $0.95 in the prior year or about 2%. On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased by approximately an additional 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year.  Looking forward, we expect currency effects to moderate in the fourth quarter and into next year. Phil will provide more details about the impact of foreign exchange by market and on our future results later in the call.
Turning now to organic revenue growth. North America increased in excess of 6%, reflecting strong performances in brand advertising, media and our specialty health care business. The U.K. was up 9%, which was broad-based across our operations. Our U.K. business has consistently performed well, which reflects the high caliber and diverse group of agencies we have in that market. Overall growth in Continental Europe was 4.5%. In the Euro markets, Germany was up mid-single digits, Spain also outperformed, while France and the Netherlands weighed on our results. Outside the Euro countries, Russia and Poland performed well and most other markets were positive.
Moving to Asia Pacific. Organic growth was in excess of 8%, with solid performance throughout the region. While our operations in China slowed a bit to mid-single digits, we remain bullish and see a long runway of growth ahead. We continue to see strong marketing spend in such categories as telecommunications, travel and personal care.
Latin America was our most difficult region in the quarter, with organic revenue declining almost 7%. Mexico and Argentina had double-digit growth, but this growth was offset by Brazil, which is our largest market in the region. Brazil's performance was affected by both the economy as well as difficult year-over-year comps.  While the current political and economic situation in Brazil is concerning, there are opportunities to invest and grow. 
The 2016 Summer Olympics should mitigate some of the risks in the short term. Our performance this quarter and for the year is reflective of the strategies we have in place to drive our growth. These strategies help us meet rapidly changing needs of our clients by giving them access to the best people and the latest technologies when and where they need them.  First is attracting, retaining and developing top talent. Next is expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas. Third is leveraging our data and analytic capabilities. Finally, we continue to deliver breakthrough creative ideas and solutions based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing disciplines and communications.
This morning, I'd like to discuss our progress against these strategies and also provide some updates to provide an update on the media reviews and address recent industry concerns on topics of viewability and fraud in online advertising and transparency.
At Omnicom, we have always strived to be a great place for great people to work. It's been a priority to attract and retain the best talent and make sure they are continuously learning and being challenged. Our agencies and networks do an excellent job of training and developing our people within the context of their specific disciplines, and Omnicom further supports this through advanced management programs at Omnicom University.
We've just completed the 21st year of Omnicom University in the United States and have expanded the program to China and Europe. This summer, for the first time, we hosted a joint education session with one of our large multinational clients, which was a huge success.
Another aspect of achieving our talent development goals is creating a diverse and an inclusive workforce. Diversity at Omnicom in backgrounds, experiences and perspectives is critical to ensuring we have the best talent. It's not just a word or concept to us. We have put diversity into action by creating groups, programs, scholarships that promote diversity and inclusion.
One barometer we use to measure our success is our performance in award shows. Once again, our agencies and networks continue their tradition of being the most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me just mention a few highlights from the Spikes Advertising Festival held recently in Singapore, which is considered the Cannes [ph] of Asia. 
BBDO received top honor, winning Network of the Year for the second year in a row. DDB placed third. BBDO and DDB have finished in top 3 networks for 7 consecutive years. Colenso BBDO won Agency of the Year. All told, 40 agencies in 12 countries contributed to nearly 150 Spike awards. I want to congratulate all of our people for their outstanding work.
During the quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities through internal investments in our agencies and service platforms, specifically in the areas of production, technology and content development. Today's market complexity demands our agencies produce ever more creative content that can be distributed quickly across different devices, channels and markets.
To meet the increasing needs of our clients, you may recall last year Omnicom formed eg+ Worldwide, a global implementation and production agency, and since then it has expanded capabilities in various markets. With over 1,400 employees in 14 countries, eg+ has become a leader in leveraging the latest technologies to help global brands implement and localize creative content across video, digital and print media channels. The result is a broader and deeper service offering that fuses the best talent and the latest technologies, and our efforts in this area will continue to expand and provide value to our clients.
Turning to the media accounts in review. Most of the high-profile reviews should be decided by Thanksgiving. As I discussed on our last call, we've been very selective in choosing which media assignments to pursue and have elected not to participate in several reviews, including Citibank, Coke, COTY and L'Oreal.
In terms of our progress, we have done pretty well. We've added new media business from well-known advertisers, such as SC Johnson and Bacardi globally, Wells Fargo in the United States. We've also successfully defended a number of accounts, such as JCPenney and GlaxoSmithKline, adding significant assignments from Novartis. These and a number of other wins brought in billings of over $1.4 billion so far. At this point, we still have an opportunity to gain additional business as the remaining pitches come to a conclusion.
Annalect played a key role in each of our wins. As a result of our investment early on, in Annalect and its data management platform, we picked up a significant share of the new business in digital, specifically around data and analytics. Annalect is embedded in our account teams and is truly a differentiating asset for us.
Turning now to look at some of the issues facing our industry. The growing scale of programmatic and online video advertising has led to valid concerns over fraud and the viewability of online ads: in other words, how much of an ad is seen by an actual consumer and for how long. One key factor in this area is independent verification. Marketers and agencies are pushing publishers, and rightly so, to prove that ads are being seen by real people and are effective in driving sales. We believe that third-party verification is a fundamental requirement. Publishers should not grade their own homework. For our part, since 2013, we've been providing third-party verification services in the U.S. on our clients' programmatic and digital network buys. This has been invaluable in giving us the data and visibility we need to adjust publisher pricing based upon viewability rates and to ensure that our clients receive the value they expect. 
We recognize that digital publishers face a complex environment due to the varied nature of their content or the device it's being delivered on. In light of this, our digital media leadership is active on joint industry efforts, such as IAC and TAG, to shape measurement standards. This is especially important for ads delivered on mobile devices, where standards are only now being discussed. In sum, the ecosystem is complex but the goal is simple, to make sure advertisers get what they pay for, and we are working towards practical solutions to help move the entire industry forward.
Finally, I also want to touch on a subject from earlier this year, the joint task force of the ANA and AAAA to create U.S. media transparency standards. We've been actively involved in this work over the past months, and we're pleased with the progress in terms of collaboration and understanding between the advertiser and agency members. We expect principles will be issued shortly, and we support any constructive steps that increase advertiser confidence across our industry while encouraging competition and innovation. 
In our conversations with our clients, advertisers are seeking more choices today in terms of service or performance requirements, but this only underscores the industry's obligation to strict contract compliance, which includes the return of any media rebates in the United States and disclosure of all of our services and various equity interests we may have. From an Omnicom standpoint, this is a fundamental to the essential trust between client and agency that our business is built on. 
Before concluding my prepared remarks, I'd like to say that while I'm pleased with our strategic and financial performance, the remainder of 2015 has numerous economic and political challenges, from Brazil to China and the Middle East as well as the potential actions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. With one quarter left to the year, I'm confident that we are on track to achieve our revenue and margin targets for the full year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Phil, and he'll take a closer look at the quarter's results. Phil?"
96161,314100900,878206,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients. For the third quarter, our organic revenue growth of 6.1% once again exceeded our",2439,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses continue to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients. For the third quarter, our organic revenue growth of 6.1% once again exceeded our expectations, as the U.S. continued its strong performance and we experienced solid growth in the U.K. and Canada and across most of our Asia Pacific markets as well as in several other European markets. 
While our underlying businesses continue their solid performance, exchange rates continue to create a considerable headwind on our international revenue. Again this quarter, FX was negative in all of our significant foreign markets, reducing our total revenue by 7.2% or $272 million. When accounting for the small net positive impact from our acquisitions, net of dispositions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.7 billion, down 1.1% versus Q3 of last year. We will go over our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Turning to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for the third quarter of 2015 decreased by $6 million to $455 million versus $461 million in Q3 of last year. As you would expect, exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our total EBITA for the quarter and more significant than in the first 6 months of the year. While the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, essentially serving as a natural hedge, in a few of our higher-margin markets, including Canada, Australia and Brazil, FX had a larger negative impact this quarter than earlier in the year. And through the first 9 months of 2015, FX reduced our overall EBITA margin by roughly 18 basis points.
However, helping to offset the FX headwinds on EBITA has been our focus on maintaining flexibility on our cost structure and our continued efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization. Our initiatives have had a positive impact, and we expect they will continue to make our operations more efficient as we extend them throughout the organization. As a result, for the third quarter, our EBITA margin of 12.3% was unchanged versus Q3 of 2014.
Moving to operating income. It decreased by $5 million to $428 million for the quarter and was also negatively impacted by FX. Our operating margin of 11.6% remained flat as compared to Q3 2014, similar to our EBITA margin.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $35.9 million, up $4.5 million versus Q3 of 2014; was relatively flat, up about $1.3 million from the second quarter of this year. Versus Q3 of last year, the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of our 10-year senior notes was partially offset by the benefit of the floating interest rate swaps we entered into during Q3 of 2014.
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased, primarily driven by negative FX translation. And versus the previous quarter, the increase in net interest expense of $1.3 million was the result of a decrease in the interest benefit from a floating interest rate swap as well as a reduction in interest income. 
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% continues to be in line with our current tax rate expectations for 2015. 
Earnings from our affiliates of $3.2 million is down $2.6 million this quarter, related to a reduction in the contribution of certain international affiliates, which were negatively impacted by FX. The allocation of earnings for the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $2.4 million to $27.4 million, also due to the impact of FX because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. In general, excluding the impact of FX, the underlying performance of these businesses remained strong. 
As a result, net income for the quarter was $239 million. That's down 1.8% or $4.5 million versus our Q3 results last year. 
Now turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter, after the allocation of $2.5 million of net income to participating securities, which for us was a dividend paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $236.8 million. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 244.4 million shares. That's down 3.2% versus last year, driven by our share buyback activity in prior periods. The resulting diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.97 per share, an increase of $0.02 or 2.1% versus Q3 of 2014.
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. The brief highlights are: Organic revenue growth was 5.5% during the first 9 months of the year. The FX headwind was even larger, decreasing revenue by 7%. Net of the impact of our recent acquisitions and dispositions of $20 million, revenue declined on a year-to-date basis by 1.3% to just under $11 billion. While FX also negatively impacted EBITA, which decreased 1.1% to $1.425 billion, our year-to-date EBITA margin of 13% was unchanged when compared to last year. 
Turning to taxes on Page 5, our effective tax rate for 2015, 32.8%, is in line with our current expectations for our annualized rate and reflects the impact of the legal restructuring of our European entities, which was largely completed earlier this year. Keep in mind that the reported 2014 tax expense and tax rate reflect the impact of the $11 million tax benefit we recognized in Q2 of 2014 related to merger expenses that were incurred in 2013 and which became deductible after the termination of the merger. Because of this, we have presented the prior year's 9-month results both including and excluding the tax benefit. 
And on Page 6, you can see our 9-month diluted EPS was $3.06 per share, which is up $0.11 or 3.7% versus 2014's reported figure of $2.95 per share, and up $0.15 or 5.2% versus EPS, when excluding the impact of the tax benefit that was recorded in Q2 of 2014.
On Slide 7, we turn the discussion to our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, this quarter, we continue to see organic growth across most of our regions and service offerings. However, the effects of FX continue to more than offset the performance of our businesses. On a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $272 million or 7.2%. The decline in the value of the euro represented approximately 1/3 of the overall FX impact. But during the third quarter, we also saw significant decreases due to declines in the pound, the Australian and Canadian dollars, and both the Brazilian reais and the Russian ruble declined by approximately 40% versus the third quarter of last year. This latest cycle of currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar started to impact us in the latter part of 2014. So as we cycle past the 1-year mark, if currencies stay where they currently are, the FX headwinds may begin to subside. Based on our recent projections, FX could negatively impact our revenue by approximately 4.5% during the fourth quarter, which would bring the full year reduction to a little under $1 billion or approximately 6.3%. 
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue marginally. While we've recently added businesses both domestically and internationally, we've made some strategic dispositions over the past year as well.
And finally, organic growth was a positive $228 million or 6.1% this quarter. Much as we experienced in the second quarter, we had another quarter with solid organic growth across most of our major markets, with the notable exceptions being France and the Netherlands, which continue to struggle, and Brazil, which is facing a difficult economic environment and difficult comps. 
And we again had good growth across our disciplines, most notably health care, with the exception being PR, which was down for the quarter but remains up for the year. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included our media and brand advertising businesses, which had strong performances this quarter; our full-service health care businesses, which continue to see the positive impact of their new business wins over the past year or so; the continued outstanding performance of our U.K. operations; recovery in certain Europe markets, driven by Germany and Spain; the performance of our emerging markets this quarter, including strong results in South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand; and despite the recent market turbulence in China, we also posted positive organic growth there.
Slide 8 covers our year-to-date revenue performance. The impact of FX reduced revenue by over $750 million over the first 3 quarters of 2015  or 7%, while organic growth over that same period was 5.5%. 
On Slide 9, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split of revenue was 60% from North America, 11% from the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe and 10% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining revenue coming from our Latin America and Africa and the Middle East regions. 
Turning to Slide 10. In North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, and we had organic revenue growth of 6.3%. 
Turning to international. As I just mentioned, the U.K. had another strong performance this quarter. The rest of Europe was up 4.5%, led by Germany and Spain. Our businesses in France continue to face challenges with negative organic growth, while the Netherlands also continues to lag behind. As we mentioned during the Q2 call, our presence in Greece is very small, accounting for less than 0.1% of our consolidated revenue. While our businesses in the market declined this quarter as we had anticipated, the impact overall was negligible.
The Asia Pacific region was up 8.6%, with most markets performing well, including Australia, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The one region that lagged was Latin America, which was down 6.9% organically. While Mexico had another positive quarter, it was overshadowed by a reduction in Brazil. In Brazil, the decline resulted from the weakening of the overall economy as well as difficult comp when compared to the fairly strong performance we had in Q3 of 2014. And finally, our Africa and Middle East region was up marginally in the quarter.
Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter. Once again, they are just about split equally between advertising services and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, advertising services were up 9.9% or $183 million, marketing services were up 2.3% or $44 million. Within marketing services, CRM was up 2.8%, maintaining year-to-date growth of over 3%. The trend for the quarter for the vast majority of our subcategories within the CRM discipline is up year-over-year, with the exception being our sales promotion business. 
PR was down 1.5% in the quarter but is still positive year-to-date. And specialty communications was up about 5.4%, with nearly double-digit organic growth in our full-service health care businesses, which was partially offset by a decrease in our other specialty agencies. Year-to-date, our health care business was up about 8% organically, driven primarily by new business wins. 
On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing our year-to-date revenue in 2015 to last year's figures, you can see there were no meaningful changes in this mix by industry. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. In the first 9 months of the year, we generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders of $374 million were up when compared to last year as a result of the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend during 2014. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $87 million. Capital expenditures were $146 million. As we've mentioned previously, CapEx was up from last year due to the increase in leasehold improvements related to some recent real estate consolidations initiatives. 
Acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $86 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan, totaled $474 million. All in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $55 million for the first 9 months of this year.
Turning to Slide 15. Focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of $4.6 billion is up about $48 million from the second quarter. The increase is entirely due to the change in the fair value of our debt's carrying value related to the in-the-money amount of our interest rate swaps, as required under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of about $224 million over the past 12 months using period-end spot rates was driven primarily by the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances over the last 12 months of approximately $373 million; the impact of the fair value adjustment to our debt's carrying value related to our floating rate swaps, which totaled $86 million; the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $42 million and miscellaneous other items, which was partially offset by a positive contribution from operating capital of $315 million.  
Although our net debt has increased over the past year, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x, and our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.6x. 
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 17.9% and our return on equity increased to 39.6%. 
And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through the third quarter, which totaled $10.8 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.6 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 107%.

As I had said earlier, the year-to-date impact of FX is about 18 basis points. But in the third quarter, which again is a relatively small quarter, FX impacted us by, in excess of about 30 basis points. So we're a little surprised by that, but it's really just the math of where the FX impacts us. We've got a lot of corporate costs, primarily in the U.S., and some of our higher-margin markets outside the U.S. were impacted a little bit more heavily by FX this quarter as an overall percentage or proportion of the total pie. So we think we've done a pretty good job to get back to the margins we delivered overall for the third quarter, which was where our internal targets were coming out, but FX certainly has been a big challenge for us this year, on the top line and I think in the third quarter it had a little bit higher-than-expected impact on our overall operating costs and our operating margins. So I think we're comfortable with the performance. I think we look at the fourth quarter. If FX rates stay where they are now, we expect revenues to be down about 4.5%. FX have started to come down, say, late September, early October of '14. That's when the dollar really started to strengthen significantly. But the euro and pound actually didn't start to weaken relative to the dollar on a reported basis until early in 2015. So we expect to see some of the weakness in the fourth quarter relative to the euro and the pound, which are our biggest international markets. And yes, I think from a margin perspective our expectation is the same. We're going to continue to internally drive towards maintaining margins and overcoming whatever FX has in store for us in the fourth quarter."

We probably have a couple of exceptions here and there, it's not necessarily a region that's an exception as far as our revenue and cost being denominated in the same local currency. It's really just a matter of mix. So some of our higher-margin markets, Canada, Australia, Brazil and actually, Russia, although Brazil and Russia, given the currency impacts, are much smaller than they were last year. When we have higher-margin markets that are impacted significantly by FX, we have less revenue and less EBIT. The less EBIT over what is a large U.S. dollar-driven denominator ends up having slightly lower margins because there is less EBIT from those markets where the currency negative was larger than the proportion of the total. So hopefully that clarifies it for you. But it's back to -- it's kind of -- it's not always intuitive. It's not always in a straight line how FX impacts each of our international operations."

And in terms of the verification services that I mentioned, what -- we paid for those, we haven't -- they have been embedded in our performance, Accuen type of revenue associated with clients where we promise a result. And to make sure that our result is accurate, we've been -- we've gone out since 2013 and hired third-party verification people to come in and tell us, gee, what is the viewability? Where is the audience coming from? You look like you're reaching enough people, but are they really out of the market? Are they coming in from India or someplace that you don't even sell your product? So we've gone through that exercise to legitimize our efforts in this area, and it expands all the time. We believe that the time has come to agree industry standards and select third-party verification firms that clients are comfortable with and the providers are comfortable with. And make them part of the normal practices that occur between client and agencies who perform these duties. The firms that you mentioned, Nielsen has got a fabulous business and it can do all sorts of wonderful things. I don't know specifically what it's working on in this area, especially mobile. And comScore and Rentrak is a great firm. We have relationships with them and we get certain data and information from them as well, irrespective of the fact that WPP owns 20% of them. But -- so this is a process, but I think the time has come, because of the amount of spending that clients are directing towards digital channels, to really agree these areas.

John, a year ago, a little over a year ago, at ad week, you announced a pretty big Facebook partnership. I just was curious if you could give us kind of at the 12-month mark, how that's going, if you're integrating Atlas as you expected, any surprises, positive or negative? And then, kind of related, hopefully related, for Phil. If you look at your salary and services margin as a percent of revenue, I think since 2012, it's been going up about 50 bps a year. You talked about currency this year. I'm guessing digital is a factor there as well. I'm just wondering if there anything we're missing that might be driving that up as a percent of revs that we don't talk about. And as we think about going forward, whether that's something you expect to continue or any visibility on what's happening there beyond currency would be really helpful."

We find them extremely cooperative and we utilize their services; we've had growth in our spending with Facebook. It's not limited to Facebook; we also have very strong relationships with the other major players: Google, we've experienced a lot of growth, and Twitter. Our relationship with Twitter has expanded recently. And so we are growing with them in most instances, and our relationships are solid across the board, I think."

So salary and service, we expect they're more variable and flexible than our office and general costs, and we'd expect them to grow a bit as our revenue grows. I think in this year, we found through 9/30, our headcount numbers are up a bit, primarily probably in the U.S., a little bit in the U.K. So the number we expect to kind of grow with our revenues, office in general, which are more fixed in nature, we expect them to, as a percentage of revenue, which is how we look at the numbers, we'd expect them to decline over time. And given some of the initiatives we have, especially in the area of real estate, we'd expect to continue to pursue those opportunities to reduce those costs and keep them as low as possible. I think the trend is what we would expect to see. Yes, I think we're on right about the time that the market is going to open. So I think if we could do one more question."

We're taking the view, although we watch it, that if you -- the consumer is in control. It's never been more evident than it is today. And consumers will embrace an ad-supported content model when they understand what it is we're trying to communicate and the quality of the creative. So I tend to agree with some CMOs, which have basically said, if we focus on great work that consumers will be interested in, we'll pass -- we'll get past the ad-blocking concerns that are in the marketplace. It's an ongoing battle. People don't have to sit there and suffer things that are not of interest to them, and so it comes upon us to improve the product. And the battle though is going on. Some high-quality publishers are already requiring users to disable their ad-blockers in order to gain access to their content. We'll see what happens in that battle. So everybody is front and center. We're certainly addressing ourselves to it by focusing on the work and the content that we provide to the consumer."
