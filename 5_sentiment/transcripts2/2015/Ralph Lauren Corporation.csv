The third quarter results we're reporting today demonstrate the disciplined operational management of our teams through a competitive holiday season and against the backdrop of an unusually volatile macro environment. The 3% constant currency revenue we achieved in the quarter was below our expectations, largely due to external forces. As the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against several major currencies and geopolitical tensions remained elevated, there was a sustained negative impact on global tourism and, in certain instances, local customer demand. The U.S. marketplace was more conservative with greater promotional activity across all distribution channels. We gained share early in the holiday shopping period, which positioned us well as the environment became more competitive in the 3 weeks before Christmas. I'm proud to report that we navigated these challenges in a brand-appropriate way, controlling the controllable and delivering operating profitability at the high end of our outlook. We aggressively managed expenses even as we continue to invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives. As both the company and the brand, Ralph Lauren has always taken a long view, and this quarter was no exception. 
Now let me turn the product highlights of the fall holiday season and begin with our luxury brands. Both men's Purple Label and the Women's Collection performed well in the quarter despite challenging traffic trends at our retail stores. Not only do these lines represent the purest expression of Ralph's design vision, but they exemplify the quality craftsmanship and attention to detail that the true luxury customer appreciates. Sportswear and outerwear were particularly strong categories, where our distinctive aesthetic proved especially compelling. 
As you know, we recently launched Polo for women, the high awareness and broad appeal of the Polo brand has translated well to the women's offering, and customers around the world are embracing it. Momentum is growing with each new delivery, as the distinct fashion sensibility of the brand continues to resonate with the younger customer across retail and wholesale channels. The distinctive lifestyle positioning and retail presentation of our Denim & Supply brand has created real differentiation in the marketplace. It's appeal along among millennials has led to a strong performance of both the foundational denim component of the line as well as the more directional fashion elements. 
From a category perspective, dresses continue to be a standout performer across all of our distribution channels, and we've expanded the assortment to fully represent day, cocktail and formal occasion needs. Handbags and footwear also experienced strong growth in the quarter, with terrific consumer response to both iconic silhouettes and new styles. 
Finally, the distinctive point of view and emphasis on fashion drove strong growth for our Club Monaco brand across women's apparel, men's apparel and footwear. 
I'd like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region since there were some very interesting differences during the quarter. Importantly, we achieved constant currency revenue growth in each of the 3 major operating regions of the Americas, Europe and Asia. This is despite lower sales to important tourist customers, especially those from Russia and the Middle East, who have been most impacted by the volatility in currency and commodity markets. 
International performance was especially strong, growing double digits in currency, with Greater China and Europe registering the strongest gains. This is encouraging not only in the context of difficult geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions but also because growing our international revenues is one of our most important strategic objective. And in the year-to-date period, international revenues represented 1/3 of our total revenues. 
Our European revenues rose double digits in constant currency during the third quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and reflecting broad-based momentum throughout the region. Generally speaking, we continue to see the best trends in Northern Europe, recovery in the southern part of the continent and more steady expansion in Central Europe. 
We achieved high single-digit constant currency growth in Asia, led by our freestanding store network with trends varying by country. Sales in Japan were quite good and continued the momentum we had last quarter. Korean sales remain challenging for the apparel sector, especially in department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Double-digit constant currency revenue growth in Greater China largely reflects the investment we have made in new distribution. While Hong Kong was disrupted by prolonged political protests, we are encouraged by the performance of our recently opened Lee Gardens flagship. This is an important market for luxury brands, and we believe the store appropriately positions the Ralph Lauren brand to this customer. 
We achieved modest growth in the Americas where lower customer traffic to brick-and-mortar stores was a formidable headwind. A planned shift in seasonal customer receipt plans for certain merchandise categories impacted our wholesale shipments during the quarter. Our North American e-commerce business grew at a double-digit rate in the third quarter in both our retail and wholesale channels. 
To expand on e-commerce, since that's another important area of strategic focus, our global e-commerce revenues grew 17% in the third quarter, supported by double-digit expansion in each region. Traffic to our e-commerce sites increased significantly, with over 40% growth in mobile traffic alone. We experienced equally strong momentum for our wholesale e-commerce business. We were well-prepared for this year is kick off to the holiday season during the Thanksgiving, Black Friday week, which now extends through the increasingly important Cyber Monday. The strength of our retail e-commerce was due in part to a number of site enhancements we've made over the last several months. These include more impactful visuals, redesigned product detail pages, enhanced quick shop capabilities and a more streamlined checkout process. We added pre-order to the capabilities for our Women's Collection line, which is an important feature for the luxury customer who wants to shop the runway. We've also developed more robust omni-channel capabilities, leveraging technology to share inventory across our retail formats. This enables us to enhance our customer service and maximize sales, while improving the productivity of our inventory. 
The investments we are making in e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities beautifully showcase the Ralph Lauren lifestyle, while offering the product focus and clear call to action that this customer expects. These efforts will be enhanced even further in the next 2 to 3 years with our new e-commerce platform. This investment will ensure that Ralph Lauren.com is the most robust and expansive expression of the Ralph Lauren brand and will support what we believe can be $1 billion in sales. 
I'd also like to highlight the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. Over the years, our sourcing and logistics teams have navigated through not only the growing scope of our global operations across regions, channels and product categories, but also dynamic changes in input cost and all the while meeting the company's extremely high standards, quality and innovation. The benefits of our decision to design a global supply chain organization were especially apparent during the third quarter, as we contended with U.S. coast board situation. The end-to-end visibility from product sourcing to customer delivery enabled our team to develop and execute robust contingency plans, minimizing risk, controlling costs and maintaining business continuity. I'm delighted to report that our service levels to customers had been maintained despite the 3- to 10-day extended transit time that the disruption has created for the industry, and I want to extend my thanks to this remarkable team for their extraordinary work. 
The global supply chain team has also made excellent product -- progress, sorry, on a number of critical strategic initiative designed to continuously improved our productivity. Some of the most compelling areas of opportunity have come from improved supply and demand visibility. This has allowed us to better leverage our volume growth and to be more disciplined with respect to managing product minimum, reducing product lead times and consolidating shipment. We believe that there are still more opportunity, and this will continue to remain an area of focus. 
The unexpected challenge we faced in the third quarter followed better-than-expected sales and profit trends in the first half of the year. We are proud of our progress against the company's long-term growth objectives, and with our ability to consistently invest in these areas while still executing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards. We were able to do this as a result of the strategic diversity of our operating model, the power of our brand portfolio, the desirability of our products and the high level of operational control we have over business. 
In November, I mentioned the next exciting endeavor for our Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport. Beginning with the introduction of men's and boys for the Fall '15 season. Across the globe, the feedback on this product has been strong and seen as a natural fit with the spirit and sensibility of Polo. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate, and we believe there's a significant long-term market share opportunity for Polo. 
I also want to mention the most delicious extension of our Polo brand, our new restaurant in New York. The Polo Bar officially opened on January 9, and the response has been sensational. From the food, to the service, to the decor, Ralph has bought something special and unique to the Manhattan dining scene and we are overwhelmed by the enthusiasm people have to experience the brand in this way. 
Based on the continued uncertainty of the global macroeconomic environment, we are planning the fourth quarter and next year cautiously and responsibly. This included a comprehensive look at our operating model. Chris will take you through some of our plans to move to a global brand management structure, with new systems and processes to support the stronger sales and profit growth we expect over the next 5 years. As challenging as the macro environment is, I believe we are operating from a position of strength and that our company is mobilized to manage through it. We have a long-term plan, a clear strategic road map to help us realize that plan, the managerial talent to navigate that road map and $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet to support our efforts. The board shares our confidence in both our future growth plans and our financial condition, as evidenced by the increase in the quarterly dividend payment that was announced today. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris."

I'd like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusting for FX headwinds, revenues increased 3%, which was achieved on top of a 9%",1883,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. 
Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusting for FX headwinds, revenues increased 3%, which was achieved on top of a 9% gain on the prior year period, led by the retail segment and driven by our strategic focus on e-commerce and new store development. Every geographic region grew in constant currency during the quarter, with the international business up double digits. 
Reported revenues actualized below our outlook of 3% to 5% growth due to negative foreign exchange and weaker-than-expected trends at our retail stores, which were impacted by a decline in traffic, especially among important tourist customers and a more promotional holiday period in the U.S. Gross profit margin of 57% was 120 basis points below the prior year period. The anticipated decline in gross profit margin was due to mix impacts, the more promotional U.S. marketplace and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. 
Operating margin of 15.5% was 110 basis points below the prior year, entirely attributable to the lower gross profit margins. This was at the high end of the outlook we provided in November due to strong and proactive expense management throughout the organization and despite incremental investments and new store openings, marketing and infrastructure projects. Net income of $215 million was 9% below the prior year, and net income per diluted share declined 6% to $2.41. 
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 2% in constant currency, which was achieved on top of a 14% gain on the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $837 million were in line with the prior year. Growth in European wholesale shipments was offset by lower shipments in the Americas due to the cadence of seasonal receipt plans and unfavorable foreign exchange. Wholesale operating margin of 24.7% was 120 basis points below the prior year due to product mix impacts. Retail sales rose 5% in constant currency and were up 2% to $1.1 billion on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and included double-digit growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were in line with the prior year on constant currency and declined 2% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance and positive growth internationally that was offset by a decline in comps in the Americas, which continued to experience challenging traffic trends at brick-and-mortar stores. Retail operating margin was 16.9%, 260 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting the more promotional U.S. marketplace and costs associated with the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts. Licensing revenues increased 6% and operating margin rose 7% in the third quarter due to higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren products around the world. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings. We spent approximately $124 million on capital expenditures in the third quarter, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. The company also repurchased about 550,000 shares of its common stock, utilizing $100 million of its authorization and bringing year-to-date repurchase activity to $350 million. At the end of the quarter, $230 million remained available for future buybacks, and we had $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. 
At this point, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of the year and provide some preliminary perspective on fiscal '16. For the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid-single digit rate in constant currency, which is an acceleration from the third quarter and year-to-date results. Based on current foreign exchange rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 550 basis points. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be 250 to 300 basis points below the prior year, with relatively equal pressure on gross margin and operating expenses. The decline in operating margin reflects unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, investments in the company's strategic growth objectives and a cautious view of the global environment, which we believe is prudent at this time. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 31% to 32%. 
For the full year fiscal '15 period, revenues are expected to increase about 4% in constant currency, and we now anticipate a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. This compares to our prior outlook of 5% to 7%. The full year fiscal '15 operating margin is now estimated to be 170 to 190 basis points below the prior year's level and compares to our prior expectation of 100 to 125 basis point decline. The change in operating margin guidance is driven by the lower sales outlook and foreign exchange. As a reminder, the primary drivers of the year-over-year contraction in operating margin are the incremental investments we're making to expand our global store network, strengthen the company's infrastructure and increase advertising and marketing. The fiscal 2015 tax rate continues to be estimated at 30%. 
As we look to the future, we remain committed to investing in the growth initiatives that we believe will provide us with a more robust platform for future sales and profit growth. While we have not yet completed our fiscal 2016 budget, I want to provide some qualitative insight into how we're approaching next fiscal year. The context in which we are operating has changed. In addition to political and economic challenges around the world, we are experiencing significant headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Based on current exchange rates, FX will have about a 550 basis point negative impact on fiscal '16 revenue growth. The combination of translational and transactional currency effects is estimated to reduce our full year operating income by approximately $185 million. This is the most significant currency impact the company has experienced in a fiscal year. To deal with these external realities, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate their impact. First, we intend to raise prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including the Japan, Canada and Europe. Second, our supply chain organization is negotiating lower prices across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material cost and oil prices as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. Finally, we intend to reduce operating cost by restructuring the organization, something I'll come back to later. With that as a backdrop, we are currently planning mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth in fiscal '16, supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives on which we've invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new store development and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to expanded square footage and continued momentum in e-commerce. On a constant dollar basis, we expect operating margin from continuing operations to improve from fiscal 2015's level due to gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We intend to reinvest that improvement in 2 main areas, the buildout of the new global e-commerce platform and global store development, including the renovation of several existing stores. Over the next 2 years, we expect to remerchandise several existing locations to our Ralph Lauren or Polo concepts in order to refine brand positioning, streamline assortments and better service the customer. On a reported basis, we expect operating margin to be down due to the foreign exchange impact I mentioned earlier. We will provide more specifics on our fiscal '16 operating margin expectations in May after we completed the budget process. 
Let me now turn to the operating model change that Jacki referred to a few minutes ago. For a number of reasons, we decided that the time was right to transform the way in which our organization is structured, how we design and manage our processes and how we make decisions. This is a significant change to position the company for stronger future performance. About 15 years ago, the company embarked on a long-range plan to assume direct control over strategically important regions and merchandise categories. This began with the acquisition of the European business in 2000. Over the next decade, the company acquired more than a dozen previously licensed businesses. These actions allowed us to maximize the sales and profit potential of each of these businesses, while elevating the presentation of the brands. The result, however, was a complex operating model. To address this, we first turned to infrastructure, upgrading systems in order to integrate what was a highly fragmented channel and regional structure. Next, we began to globalize several critical corporate functions, such as finance, IT, supply chain and merchandising. Today, we are taking the next step to simplify our operating model. Over the next several months, we will commence plans to move from a decentralized channel and regional structure to a fully integrated, global, brand-based organization structure. We have always believed that our brands are our greatest assets and a significant competitive advantage. Our strength as a company stems from the vitality and desirability of our brands. In this new structure, we will create global brand groups that will not only define the strategy from the design and merchandising to retail concepts and marketing but will also have accountability for financial performance around the world. Importantly, we will continue to have regional, channel and functional teams that not only provide critical expertise and insight to the global brand groups but also operate the business on a day-to-day basis. We believe this will strengthen the connectivity from the design vision to the consumer impressions and ensure greater clarity and consistency of brand expression. While each of our brands enjoys high awareness and regard today, we believe this new organization design will further enhance brand equity. We see this next step as a critical milestone to realizing our vision of operating as a truly global business, maximizing our growth potential and realizing significant operating efficiencies. 
Let me give just one example. Now that we have completed the SAP rollout across design and global manufacturing, we have visibility for the first time into our SKU development, adoption and performance. We now know that last year, we designed 130,000 SKUs across the company, with a commonality rate by brand in like locations around the world that is very low. The new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to lower inventory levels, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings. Our goal, once the new structure is fully implemented, is to achieve over $100 million in annual expense savings. Only a modest amount will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings in fiscal '17 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring charge as a result of this reorganization, and we are currently working through the details of the plan. We will provide more insight in May. 
We are very excited about the company's growth prospects. We are investing in the business and making the right strategic decisions in order to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time. 
With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us."

First, let me just describe the FX impact a little bit and then I'll come back to the underlying. So I think, as we mentioned, we expect FX at current rates to have about a negative 550 basis point impact on the top line. A lot of our cost structure is in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Hong Kong dollars because that's where we have our big centers of operation from an SG&A standpoint from overhead. And of course, a lot of our manufacturing base is in currencies that have not depreciated as much as the euro, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. So when you look at the FX impact on the top line of 5.5%, the flow-through of that to the bottom line is a little bit over 40% in terms of the impact that it has, which is what leads to be $185 million headwind because our cost structure is not denominated in local currency. On the underlying basis, back to your question, I think that we expect our operating margin on the underlying basis to be up versus this year, and that's because some of the investments that we've been making in terms of our infrastructure, in terms of the retail store development and in terms of the increased marketing and advertising, we're seeing positive trends from those that are driving growth and operating margin on an underlying basis. The 2 headwinds that we have next year, which we expect to offset the underlying increase in operating margin, are the e-commerce platform, which will be a bigger investment next year than this year but we believe is strategically the right thing for us to do, as we've talked about in the past; and the continuation of our retail store development effort, particularly where we're looking to remerchandise many of our stores from the world of Ralph Lauren concept into distinctive Ralph Lauren luxury stores or Polo stores, which we think are clear to the consumer."

And then when you go to the brick-and-mortar retail business, I think that -- we think that the brick-and-mortar retail business, we had strong performance internationally and a little bit of a slowdown and performance in the U.S. that was below our expectations, primarily driven by traffic trends. We saw traffic trends in the quarter at the factory outlet channel that were down mid-single digits, and that's what really affected us relative to the expectations we had going into the quarter."

From a retail standpoint, we are anticipating a bigger impact on retail, primarily due to new store openings. So baked into our constant dollar comp guidance is not a big expectation for a constant dollar comp increase. It's more around the acceleration work we see in the wholesale business as well as the full impact of our retail store development activity. And of course, we're continuing to view the e-commerce business as operating very successfully, which we have been doing."

So we do hedge our inventory purchases, a portion of our inventory purchases, and we typically hedge sort of 6 to 9 months out.

So we do hedge our inventory purchases, a portion of our inventory purchases, and we typically hedge sort of 6 to 9 months out. So we're not hedged for the full fiscal year next year, and we're not hedged at a 100% rate. We typically hedge at sort of a 70% of our exposure rate. So there is a significant impact from currency in that guidance for next year that's inventory related. But there also will be an additional flow-through in the following year from the portion of inventory next year where we do have a hedge on if you think forward to fiscal '17. With regard to the fourth quarter, there certainly is a foreign exchange impact on the bottom line and on the operating margin in the fourth quarter, and in fact, it's fairly significant. And the reason for that is that when you think about the flow-through that I talked about earlier, if the FX drag on the top line is flowing through next year at a little bit over 40% rate, we're also seeing a similar type of impact in the fourth quarter. And with the 550 basis points drag from foreign exchange on the top line in the fourth quarter, that's creating a operating margin pressure in the fourth quarter, which is a big part of the reason for our guidance change on operating margin not just for the fourth quarter but also for the fiscal year, the current fiscal year. And then on raw material and oil costs, we have some visibility to that. And so when we saw the drop in commodities and we saw the strength of the dollar and we saw the drop in oil prices, we immediately began working with our global manufacturing and supply chain teams who have at this point gone over and met with a number of our manufacturers in Asia and begun to work on getting cost reduction. We don't have full visibility to the cost reduction that we're going to get, but we are certainly confident that we're going to get some cost reduction as part of this. And that's part of the detailed work that we have in finalizing the budget ahead of us over the next couple of months. There is a timing lag in terms of when that flows through because typically, the seasons that we're negotiating are 6 months out or so from the time that we begin that negotiation process."

It's still a large business. It's still a very profitable business for us, but we believe that with the growth of the e-commerce business, which has become particularly large in the U.S. that, that starting to cannibalize a little bit into that channel. Also, as some of the brick-and-mortar stores that are closer in to the urban areas have gotten more competitive on pricing, it's reduced the consumer desire to drive to get to the outlet center. And so we're factoring into our plans as we go forward because we expect that trend, although you can never predict, but we certainly think the consumer is going to continue to shop more and more online. And as that happens, we think that's going to continue to put pressure on brick-and-mortar."

And then we saw a little bit of a drop in sort of the consumer purchase behavior in that period between the Thanksgiving, the end of the Thanksgiving shopping period and the first couple of weeks of December. And as a result of that, what we saw was that a lot of the competitors ratchet up their promotional intensity in terms of what -- in terms of trying to deal the inventory that they have on the floor, and so we reacted to that not to ensure that we stayed competitive during the period. And I think that's what we were alluding to in our commentary. And again, that was really a U.S. phenomenon, not so much international."

So on the quarter on gross margin, really, there were 3 things that impacted the 120 basis points. Certainly, currency had a significant impact as we mentioned, the more from additional U.S. marketplace, and then we had a mix impact as well. And part",476,"Yes. So on the quarter on gross margin, really, there were 3 things that impacted the 120 basis points. Certainly, currency had a significant impact as we mentioned, the more from additional U.S. marketplace, and then we had a mix impact as well. And part of that was due to the cadence of our wholesale shipments. The cadence of our wholesale shipments in the quarter, we wound up shipping more women's product in the third quarter than we did men's product in the third quarter from a growth rate standpoint. And the men's business operates at a significantly higher gross margin for us than the women's business, and so we saw a mix impact that was due to the men's versus women's growth mix. If you look at those 3 aspects, I would say that the 3 aspects were relatively equal in nature. There was not one that was overwhelming relative to the other aspects on gross margin during the quarter. We did have to airfreight more product during the quarter. We also wound up routing a lot of product via water routing, so we shifted around the U.S. and received it in the East Coast ports. And what that did, as Jacki alluded to, was that that allowed us to avoid some of the issues in the West Coast port situation, but it takes more time to ship it to the East Coast that we then had to accelerate once the product was unloaded in the East Coast receipt into our Greensboro distribution center and staff in our Greensboro distribution center to turn that inventory around faster. So we did see an impact from the West Coast port strike, but I would say that, that impact was relatively minor because of the strong management of our supply chain teams. And with regard to next year, on an underlying basis, we do believe gross margin is going to be up as we've gone through the initial stages of the budget process, and I think there's a couple of reasons for that. One is, we expect the retail segment to grow faster than wholesale, and of course, our retail segment has higher gross margins than wholesale. Two, we expect the accessories business to grow at a faster rate than the balance of the business, and that also tends to be a gross margin sweetener. And then third, at least in constant currency, the international business is projected to grow at a faster rate. And of course, we have higher gross margins in the international business than we do in the U.S. And so when you look at those 3 elements, I think all of that is driving us to -- underlying gross margin that's improving in next year's forecast versus this year. Thank you very much for attending, and as always, we'll be available for follow-up calls."

The third quarter results we're reporting today demonstrate the disciplined operational management of our teams through a competitive holiday season and against the backdrop of an unusually volatile macro environment. The 3% constant currency revenue we achieved in the quarter was below our expectations, largely due to external forces. As the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against several major currencies and geopolitical tensions remained elevated, there was a sustained negative impact on global tourism and in certain instances local customer demand.
The U.S. marketplace was more conservative with greater promotional activity across all distribution channels. We gained share early in the holiday shopping period, which positioned us well as the environment became more competitive in the 3 weeks before Christmas. I'm proud to report that we navigated these challenges in a brand-appropriate way, controlling the controllable and delivering operating profitability at the high end of our outlook. We aggressively managed expenses even as we continue to invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives. As both the company and the brand, Ralph Lauren has always taken a long view, and this quarter was no exception. 
Now let me turn to product highlights of the fall holiday season and begin with our luxury brands. Both men's Purple Label and women's collection performed well in the quarter despite challenging traffic trends at our retail stores. Not only do these lines represent the purest expression of Ralph's design vision, but they exemplify the quality craftsmanship and attention to detail that the true luxury customer appreciates. Sportswear and outerwear were particularly strong categories, where our distinctive aesthetic proved especially compelling. 
As you know, we recently launched Polo for women, the high awareness and broad appeal of the Polo brand has translated well to the women's offering, and customers around the world are embracing it. Momentum is growing with each new delivery, as the distinct fashion sensibility of the brand continues to resonate with the younger customer across retail and wholesale channels. 
The distinctive lifestyle positioning and retail presentation of our Denim & Supply brand has created real differentiation in the marketplace. It's appeal along among millennials has led to a strong performance of both the foundational denim component of the line as well as the more directional fashion elements. 
From a category perspective, dresses continue to be a standout performer across all of our distribution channels, and we've expanded the assortment to fully represent day, cocktail and formal occasion needs. Handbags and footwear also experienced strong growth in the quarter, with terrific consumer response to both iconic silhouettes and new styles. 
Finally, the distinctive point of view and emphasis on fashion drove strong growth for our Club Monaco brand across women's apparel, men's apparel and footwear. 
I'd like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region since there were some very interesting differences during the quarter. Importantly, we achieved constant currency revenue growth in each of the 3 major operating regions of the Americas, Europe and Asia. This is despite lower sales to important tourist customers, especially those from Russia and the Middle East, who have been most impacted by the volatility in currency and commodity markets. 
International performance was especially strong, growing double digits in currency, with Greater China and Europe registering the strongest gains. This is encouraging not only in the context of difficult geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, but also because growing our international revenues is one of our most important strategic objective. And in the year-to-date period, international revenues represented 1/3 of our total revenues. 
Our European revenues rose double digits in constant currency during the third quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and reflecting broad-based momentum throughout the region. Generally speaking, we continue to see the best trends in Northern Europe, recovery in the southern part of the continent and more steady expansion in Central Europe. 
We achieved high single-digit constant currency growth in Asia, led by our freestanding store network, with trends varying by country. Sales in Japan were quite good and continued the momentum we had last quarter. Korean sales remained challenging for the apparel sector, especially in department stores, which represents the majority of our distribution. Double-digit constant currency revenue growth in Greater China largely reflects the investment we have made in new distribution. While Hong Kong was disrupted by prolonged political protests, we are encouraged by the performance of our recently opened Lee Gardens flagship. This is an important market for luxury brands, and we believe the store appropriately positions the Ralph Lauren brand to this customer. 
We achieved modest growth in the Americas, where lower customer traffic to brick-and-mortar stores was a formidable headwind. A planned shift in seasonal customer receipt plans for certain merchandise categories impacted our wholesale shipments during the quarter. Our North American e-commerce business grew at a double-digit rate in the third quarter in both our retail and wholesale channels. 
To expand on e-commerce, since that's another important area of strategic focus, our global e-commerce revenues grew 17% in the third quarter, supported by double-digit expansion in each region. Traffic to our e-commerce sites increased significantly, with over 40% growth in mobile traffic alone. We experienced equally strong momentum for our wholesale e-commerce business. We were well-prepared for this year is kick off to the holiday season during the Thanksgiving/Black Friday week, which now extends through the increasingly important Cyber Monday.
The strength of our retail e-commerce was due in part to a number of site enhancements we've made over the last several months. These include more impactful visuals, redesigned product detail pages, enhanced quick shop capabilities and a more streamlined checkout process. We added pre-order to the capabilities for our women's collection line, which is an important feature for the luxury customer who wants to shop the runway. We've also developed more robust omni-channel capabilities, leveraging technology to share inventory across our retail formats. This enables us to enhance our customer service and maximize sales, while improving the productivity of our inventory. 
The investments we are making in e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities beautifully showcase the Ralph Lauren lifestyle, while offering the product focus and clear call to action that this customer expects. These efforts will be enhanced even further in the next 2 to 3 years with our new e-commerce platform. This investment will ensure that RalphLauren.com is the most robust and expansive expression of the Ralph Lauren brand and will support what we believe can be $1 billion in sales. 
I'd also like to highlight the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. Over the years, our sourcing and logistics teams have navigated through not only the growing scope of our global operations across regions, channels and product categories, but also dynamic changes in input cost and all the while meeting the company's extremely high standards, quality and innovation. The benefits of our decision to design a global supply chain organization were especially apparent during the third quarter, as we contended with the West Coast port situation. The end-to-end visibility from product sourcing to customer delivery enabled our team to develop and execute robust contingency plans, minimizing risk, controlling costs and maintaining business continuity. I'm delighted to report that our service levels to customers have been maintained despite the 3- to 10-day extended transit time that the disruption has created for the industry, and I want to extend my thanks to this remarkable team for their extraordinary work. 
The global supply chain team has also made excellent product on -- not product, progress, sorry, on a number of critical strategic initiatives designed to continuously improve our productivity. Some of the most compelling areas of opportunity have come from improved supply and demand visibility. This has allowed us to better leverage our volume growth and to be more disciplined with respect to managing product minimum, reducing product lead times and consolidating shipments. We believe that there are still more opportunity, and this will continue to remain an area of focus. 
The unexpected challenges we faced in the third quarter followed better-than-expected sales and profit trends in the first half of the year. We are proud of our progress against the company's long-term growth objectives, and with our ability to consistently invest in these areas while still executing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards. We were able to do this as a result of the strategic diversity of our operating model, the power of our brand portfolio, the desirability of our products and the high level of operational control we have over business. 
In November, I mentioned the next exciting endeavor for our Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport. Beginning with the introduction of men's and boys for the fall '15 season. Across the globe, the feedback on this product has been strong and seen as a natural fit with the spirit and sensibility of Polo. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate, and we believe there's a significant long-term market share opportunity for Polo. 
I also want to mention the most delicious extension of our Polo brand, our new restaurant in New York. The Polo Bar officially opened on January 9, and the response has been sensational. From the food to the service, to the decor, Ralph has brought something special and unique to the Manhattan dining scene, and we are overwhelmed by the enthusiasm people have to experience the brand in this way. 
Based on the continued uncertainty of the global macroeconomic environment, we are planning the fourth quarter and next year cautiously and responsibly. This included a comprehensive look at our operating model. Chris will take you through some of our plans to move to a global brand management structure, with new systems and processes to support the stronger sales and profit growth we expect over the next 5 years. As challenging as the macro environment is, I believe we are operating from a position of strength and that our company is mobilized to manage through it.
We have a long-term plan, a clear strategic road map to help us realize that plan, the managerial talent to navigate that road map and $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet to support our efforts. The board shares our confidence in both our future growth plans and our financial condition, as evidenced by the increase in the quarterly dividend payment that was announced today. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris."

I'd like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusting for FX headwinds, revenues increased 3%, which was achieved on top of a 9%",1884,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. 
Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusting for FX headwinds, revenues increased 3%, which was achieved on top of a 9% gain on the prior year period, led by the retail segment and driven by our strategic focus on e-commerce and new store development. Every geographic region grew in constant currency during the quarter, with the international business up double digits. 
Reported revenues actualized below our outlook of 3% to 5% growth due to negative foreign exchange and weaker-than-expected trends at our retail stores, which were impacted by a decline in traffic especially among important tourist customers and a more promotional holiday period in the U.S. Gross profit margin of 57% was 120 basis points below the prior year period. The anticipated decline in gross profit margin was due to mix impacts, the more promotional U.S. marketplace and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. 
Operating margin of 15.5% was 110 basis points below the prior year, entirely attributable to the lower gross profit margin. This was at the high end of the outlook we provided in November due to strong and proactive expense management throughout the organization and despite incremental investments in new store openings, marketing and infrastructure projects. Net income of $215 million was 9% below the prior year, and net income per diluted share declined 6% to $2.41. 
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 2% in constant currency, which was achieved on top of a 14% gain on the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $837 million were in line with the prior year. Growth in European wholesale shipments was offset by lower shipments in the Americas due to the cadence of seasonal receipt plans and unfavorable foreign exchange. Wholesale operating margin of 24.7% was 120 basis points below the prior year due to product mix impacts. 
Retail sales rose 5% in constant currency and were up 2% to $1.1 billion on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and included double-digit growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were in line with the prior year on constant currency and declined 2% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance and positive growth internationally that was offset by a decline in comps in the Americas, which continued to experience challenging traffic trends at brick-and-mortar stores.
Retail operating margin was 16.9%, 260 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting the more promotional U.S. marketplace and costs associated with the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts. Licensing revenues increased 6% and operating margin rose 7% in the third quarter due to higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren products around the world. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings.
We spent approximately $124 million on capital expenditures in the third quarter, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. The company also repurchased about 550,000 shares of its common stock, utilizing $100 million of its authorization and bringing year-to-date repurchase activity to $350 million. At the end of the quarter, $230 million remained available for future buybacks, and we had $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. 
At this point, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of the year and provide some preliminary perspective on fiscal '16. For the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid-single digit rate in constant currency, which is an acceleration from the third quarter and year-to-date results. Based on current foreign exchange rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 550 basis points. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be 250 to 300 basis points below the prior year, with relatively equal pressure on gross margin and operating expenses. The decline in operating margin reflects unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, investments in the company's strategic growth objectives and a cautious view of the global environment, which we believe is prudent at this time. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 31% to 32%. 
For the full year fiscal '15 period, revenues are expected to increase about 4% in constant currency, and we now anticipate a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. This compares to our prior outlook of 5% to 7%. The full year fiscal '15 operating margin is now estimated to be 170 to 190 basis points below the prior year's level and compares to our prior expectation of 100 to 125 basis point decline. The change in operating margin guidance is driven by the lower sales outlook and foreign exchange. As a reminder, the primary drivers of the year-over-year contraction in operating margin are the incremental investments we're making to expand our global store network, strengthen the company's infrastructure and increase advertising and marketing. The fiscal 2015 tax rate continues to be estimated at 30%. 
As we look to the future, we remain committed to investing in the growth initiatives that we believe will provide us with a more robust platform for future sales and profit growth. While we have not yet completed our fiscal 2016 budget, I want to provide some qualitative insight into how we're approaching next fiscal year. 
The context in which we are operating has changed. In addition to political and economic challenges around the world, we are experiencing significant headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Based on current exchange rates, FX will have about a 550 basis point negative impact on fiscal '16 revenue growth. The combination of translational and transactional currency effects is estimated to reduce our full year operating income by approximately $185 million. This is the most significant currency impact the company has experienced in a fiscal year.
To deal with these external realities, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate their impact. First, we intend to raise prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada and Europe. Second, our supply chain organization is negotiating lower prices across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material cost and oil prices as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. Finally we intend to reduce operating cost by restructuring the organization, something I'll come back to later.
With that as a backdrop, we are currently planning mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth in fiscal '16, supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we've invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new store development and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to expanded square footage and continued momentum in e-commerce.
On a constant dollar basis, we expect operating margin from continuing operations to improve from fiscal 2015's level due to gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We intend to reinvest that improvement in 2 main areas, the build-out of the new global e-commerce platform and the global store development, including the renovation of several existing stores. Over the next 2 years, we expect to remerchandise several existing locations to our Ralph Lauren or Polo concepts in order to refine brand positioning, streamline assortments and better service the customer.
On a reported basis, we expect operating margin to be down due to the foreign exchange impact I mentioned earlier. We will provide more specifics on our fiscal '16 operating margin expectations in May after we have completed the budget process. 
Let me now turn to the operating model change that Jacki referred to a few minutes ago. For a number of reasons, we decided that the time was right to transform the way in which our organization is structured, how we design and manage our processes and how we make decisions. This is a significant change to position the company for stronger future performance.
About 15 years ago, the company embarked on a long-range plan to assume direct control over strategically important regions and merchandise categories. This began with the acquisition of the European business in 2000. Over the next decade, the company acquired more than a dozen previously licensed businesses. These actions allowed us to maximize the sales and profit potential of each of these businesses, while elevating the presentation of the brands. The result, however, was a complex operating model. To address this, we first turned to infrastructure, upgrading systems in order to integrate what was a highly fragmented channel and regional structure. Next, we began to globalize several critical corporate functions, such as finance, IT, supply chain and merchandising.
Today, we are taking the next step to simplify our operating model. Over the next several months, we will commence plans to move from a decentralized channel and regional structure to a fully integrated, global, brand-based organization structure. We have always believed that our brands are our greatest assets and a significant competitive advantage. Our strength as a company stems from the vitality and desirability of our brands. In this new structure, we will create global brand groups that will not only define the strategy from the design and merchandising to retail concepts and marketing, but will also have accountability for financial performance around the world.
Importantly, we will continue to have regional, channel and functional teams that not only provide critical expertise and insight to the global brand groups, but also operate the business on a day-to-day basis. We believe this will strengthen the connectivity from the design vision to the consumer impression and ensure greater clarity and consistency of brand expression. While each of our brands enjoys high awareness and regard today, we believe this new organization design will further enhance brand equity. We see this next step as a critical milestone to realizing our vision of operating as a truly global business, maximizing our growth potential and realizing significant operating efficiencies. 
Let me give just one example. Now that we have completed the SAP rollout across design and global manufacturing, we have visibility for the first time into our SKU development, adoption and performance. We now know that last year, we designed 130,000 SKUs across the company, with a commonality rate by brand in like locations around the world that is very low. The new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to lower inventory levels, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings. Our goal, once the new structure is fully implemented, is to achieve over $100 million in annual expense savings. Only a modest amount will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings in fiscal '17 and beyond. We expect to incur a restructuring charge as a result of this reorganization, and we are currently working through the details of the plan. We will provide more insight in May. 
We are very excited about the company's growth prospects. We are investing in the business and making the right strategic decisions in order to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time. 
With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us?"

And so we think now is the right time, because of a lot of this groundwork that we've laid over the past couple of years, to really set the stage for the new organization model. And we think that this creates a platform for future sales and revenue growth acceleration, because what it's going to enable us to do is be more focused on a by-brand basis and really integrate the work of design, merchandising, marketing, retail store concepts around the world. And so if you think about the way we're operating today, because of the way we've acquired licenses, we're really operating with many different groups around the world that are performing similar activities. And we believe that this new construct will allow us to enhance the brand clarity and consistency around the world, while driving operating efficiencies at the same time.

First, let me just describe the FX impact a little bit, and then I'll come back to the underlying. So I think, as we mentioned, we expect FX at current rates to have about a negative 550 basis point impact on the top line. A lot of our cost structure is in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Hong Kong dollars because that's where we have our big centers of operation from an SG&A standpoint from overhead. And of course, a lot of our manufacturing base is in currencies that have not depreciated as much as the euro, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. So when we look at the FX impact on the top line of 5.5%, the flow-through of that to the bottom line is a little bit over 40% in terms of the impact that it has, which is what leads to the $185 million headwind, because our cost structure is not denominated in local currency. On the underlying basis, back to your question, I think that we expect our operating margin on the underlying basis to be up versus this year, and that's because some of the investments that we've been making in terms of our infrastructure, in terms of the retail store development and in terms of the increased marketing and advertising, we're seeing positive trends from those that are driving growth and operating margin on an underlying basis. The 2 headwinds that we have next year, which we expect to offset the underlying increase in operating margin, are the e-commerce platform, which will be a bigger investment next year than this year, but we believe is strategically the right thing for us to do, as we've talked about in the past; and the continuation of our retail store development effort, particularly where we're looking to remerchandise many of our stores from the World of Ralph Lauren concept into distinctive Ralph Lauren luxury stores or Polo stores, which we think are clear to the consumer."

And so we think we can grow a couple of points faster, which would position us at sort of a low- to mid-single-digit growth rate in the wholesale business going forward. The retail business, we believe, we can grow faster, both driven by the e-commerce business where we had high-teens growth in the current quarter. And we think that the e-commerce business is going to continue to grow at an accelerated rate, which is why we're investing behind the e-commerce business. And then when you go to the brick-and-mortar retail business, I think that -- we think that the brick-and-mortar retail business, we had strong performance internationally and a little bit of a slowdown and performance in the U.S. that was below our expectations, primarily driven by traffic trends.

So we're not hedged for the full fiscal year next year, and we're not hedged at a 100% rate. We typically hedge at sort of a 70% of our exposure rate. So there is a significant impact from currency in that guidance for next year that's inventory related. But there also will be an additional flow-through in the following year from the portion of inventory next year where we do have a hedge on, if you think forward to fiscal '17. With regard to the fourth quarter, there certainly is a foreign exchange impact on the bottom line and on the operating margin in the fourth quarter. And in fact, it's fairly significant. And the reason for that is that when you think about the flow-through that I talked about earlier, if the FX drag on the top line is flowing through next year at a little bit over 40% rate, we're also seeing a similar type of impact in the fourth quarter. And with the 550 basis point drag from foreign exchange on the top line in the fourth quarter, that's creating a operating margin pressure on the fourth quarter, which is a big part of the reason for our guidance change on operating margin, not just for the fourth quarter but also for the fiscal year, the current fiscal year. And then on raw material and oil costs, we have some visibility to that. And so when we saw the drop in commodities and we saw the strength of the dollar and we saw the drop in oil prices, we immediately began working with our global manufacturing and supply chain teams who have at this point gone over and met with a number of our manufacturers in Asia and begun to work on getting cost reduction. We don't have full visibility to the cost reduction that we're going to get, but we are certainly confident that we're going to get some cost reduction as part of this. And that's part of the detailed work that we have in finalizing the budget ahead of us over the next couple of months. There is a timing lag in terms of when that flows through because typically, the seasons that we're negotiating are 6 months out or so from the time that we begin that negotiation process."

It's still a large business and still a very profitable business for us, but we believe that with the growth of the e-commerce business, which has become particularly large in the U.S., that that's starting to cannibalize a little bit into that channel. Also, as some of the brick-and-mortar stores that are closer in to the urban areas have gotten more competitive on pricing, it's reduced the consumer desire to drive to get to the outlet center. And so we're factoring into our plans as we go forward because we expect that trend, although you can never predict, but we certainly think the consumer is going to continue to shop more and more online.

So I think what we saw was that as we entered -- and I think Jacki sort of talked about this in the prepared remarks, but as we entered the holiday season, we got off to a pretty strong start over the Thanksgiving period, the week before Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, and then we saw a little bit of a drop in sort of the consumer purchase behavior in that period between the Thanksgiving -- the end of the Thanksgiving shopping period and the first couple of weeks of December. And as a result of that, what we saw was that a lot of the competitors ratcheted up the promotional intensity in terms of what -- in terms of trying to deal the inventory that they have on the floor. And so we reacted to that not in a -- to ensure that we stayed competitive during the period, and I think that's what we were alluding to in our commentary. And again, that was really a U.S. phenomenon, not so much international."

Certainly, currency had a significant impact, as we mentioned, the more promotional U.S. marketplace and then we had a mix impact as well. And part of",483,"Yes. So on the quarter, on gross margin, really, there were 3 things that impacted the 120 basis points. Certainly, currency had a significant impact, as we mentioned, the more promotional U.S. marketplace and then we had a mix impact as well. And part of that was due to the cadence of our wholesale shipments. The cadence of our wholesale shipments in the quarter, we wound up shipping more women's product in the third quarter than we did men's product in the third quarter from a growth rate standpoint. And the men's business operates at a significantly higher gross margin for us than the women's business, and so we saw a mix impact that was due to the men's versus women's growth mix. If you look at those 3 aspects, I would say that the 3 aspects were relatively equal in nature. There was not one that was overwhelming relative to the other aspects on gross margin during the quarter. We did have to airfreight more product during the quarter. We also wound up routing a lot of product via water routing, so we shipped it around the U.S. and received it in the East Coast ports. And what that did, as Jacki alluded to, was that allowed us to avoid some of the issues in the West Coast port situation, but it takes more time to ship it to the East Coast that we then had to accelerate, once the product was unloaded in the East Coast, receipt into our Greensboro distribution center and staff in our Greensboro distribution center to turn that inventory around faster. So we did see an impact from the West Coast port strike, but I would say that, that impact was relatively minor because of the strong management of our supply chain teams. And with regard to next year, on an underlying basis, we do believe gross margin is going to be up as we looked at -- as we've gone through the initial stages of the budget process, and I think there's a couple of reasons for that. One is, we expect the retail segment to grow faster than wholesale. And of course, our retail segment has higher gross margins than wholesale. Two, we expect the accessories business to grow at a faster rate than the balance of the business, and that also tends to be a gross margin sweetener. And then third, the -- at least in constant currency, the international business is projected to grow at a faster rate. And of course, we have higher gross margins in the international business than we do in the U.S. And so when you look at those 3 elements, I think all of that is driving us to an underlying gross margin that's improving in next year's forecast versus this year.

The third quarter results we're reporting today demonstrate the disciplined operational management of our teams through a competitive holiday season and against the backdrop of an unusually volatile macro environment. The 3% constant currency revenue we achieved in the quarter was below our expectations, largely due to external forces. As the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against several major currencies and geopolitical tensions remained elevated, there was a sustained negative impact on global tourism and in certain instances local customer demand.
The U.S. marketplace was more competitive, with greater promotional activity across all distribution channels. We gained share early in the holiday shopping period, which positioned us well as the environment became more competitive in the 3 weeks before Christmas. I'm proud to report that we navigated these challenges in a brand-appropriate way, controlling the controllable and delivering operating profitability at the high end of our outlook. We aggressively managed expenses even as we continued to invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives. As both a company and the brand, Ralph Lauren has always taken a long view, and this quarter was no exception. 
Now let me turn to product highlights of the fall holiday season and begin with our luxury brands. Both men's Purple Label and women's collection performed well in the quarter despite challenging traffic trends at our retail stores. Not only do these lines represent the purest expression of Ralph's design vision, but they exemplify the quality craftsmanship and attention to detail that the true luxury customer appreciates. Sportswear and outerwear were particularly strong categories, where our distinctive aesthetic proved especially compelling. 
As you know, we recently launched Polo for women. The high awareness and broad appeal of the Polo brand has translated well to the women's offering, and customers around the world are embracing it. Momentum is growing with each new delivery, as the distinct fashion sensibility of the brand continues to resonate with the younger customer across retail and wholesale channels. The distinctive lifestyle positioning and retail presentation of our Denim & Supply brand has created real differentiation in the marketplace. Its appeal along among millennials has led to a strong performance of both the foundational denim component of the line as well as the more directional fashion elements. 
From a category perspective, dresses continue to be a standout performer across all of our distribution channels, and we've expanded the assortment to fully represent day, cocktail and formal occasion needs. Handbags and footwear also experienced strong growth in the quarter, with terrific consumer response to both iconic silhouettes and new styles. Finally, the distinctive point of view and emphasis on fashion drove strong growth for our Club Monaco brand across women's apparel, men's apparel and footwear. 
I'd like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region since there were some very interesting differences during the quarter. Importantly, we achieved constant currently (sic) [currency] revenue growth in each of the 3 major operating regions of the Americas, Europe and Asia. This is despite lower sales to important tourist customers, especially those from Russia and the Middle East, who have been most impacted by the volatility in currency and commodity markets. 
International performance was especially strong, growing double digits in currency, with Greater China and Europe registering the strongest gains. This is encouraging not only in the context of difficult geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, but also because growing our international revenues is one of our most important strategic objectives. And in the year-to-date period, international revenues represented 1/3 of our total revenues. Our European revenues rose double digits in constant currency during the third quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and reflecting broad-based momentum throughout the region. Generally speaking, we continue to see the best trends in Northern Europe, recovery in the southern part of the continent and more steady expansion in Central Europe. 
We achieved high single-digit constant currency growth in Asia, led by our freestanding store network, with trends varying by country. Sales in Japan were quite good and continued the momentum we had last quarter. Korean sales remained challenging for the apparel sector, especially in department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Double-digit constant currency revenue growth in Greater China largely reflects the investment we have made in new distribution. While Hong Kong was disrupted by prolonged political protests, we are encouraged by the performance of our recently opened Lee Gardens flagship. This is an important market for luxury brands, and we believe the store appropriately positions the Ralph Lauren brand to this customer. 
We achieved modest growth in the Americas, where lower customer traffic to brick-and-mortar stores was a formidable headwind. A planned shift in seasonal customer receipt plans for certain merchandise categories impacted our wholesale shipments during the quarter. Our North American e-commerce business grew at a double-digit rate in the third quarter in both our retail and wholesale channels. 
To expand on e-commerce, since that's another important area of strategic focus, our global e-commerce revenues grew 17% in the third quarter, supported by double-digit expansion in each region. Traffic to our e-commerce sites increased significantly, with over 40% growth in mobile traffic alone. We experienced equally strong momentum for our wholesale e-commerce business. We were well-prepared for this year's kick off to the holiday season during the Thanksgiving/Black Friday week, which now extends through the increasingly important Cyber Monday.
The strength of our retail e-commerce was due in part to a number of site enhancements we've made over the last several months. These include more impactful visuals, redesigned product detail pages, enhanced quick shop capabilities and a more streamlined checkout process. We added pre-order to the capabilities for our women's collection line, which is an important feature for the luxury customer who wants to shop the runway. We've also developed more robust omni-channel capabilities, leveraging technology to share inventory across our retail formats. This enables us to enhance our customer service and maximize sales, while improving the productivity of our inventory. 
The investments we are making in e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities beautifully showcase the Ralph Lauren lifestyle, while offering the product focus and clear call to action that this customer expects. These efforts will be enhanced even further in the next 2 to 3 years with our new e-commerce platform. This investment will ensure that RalphLauren.com is the most robust and expansive expression of the Ralph Lauren brand and will support what we believe can be $1 billion in sales. 
I'd also like to highlight the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. Over the years, our sourcing and logistics teams have navigated through not only the growing scope of our global operations across regions, channels and product categories, but also dynamic changes in input costs and all the while meeting the company's extremely high standards, quality and innovation. The benefits of our decision to design a global supply chain organization were especially apparent during the third quarter, as we contended with the West Coast port situation. The end-to-end visibility from product sourcing to customer delivery enabled our team to develop and execute robust contingency plans, minimizing risk, controlling costs and maintaining business continuity. I'm delighted to report that our service levels to customers have been maintained despite the 3- to 10-day extended transit time that the disruption has created for the industry, and I want to extend my thanks to this remarkable team for their extraordinary work. 
The global supply chain team has also made excellent product on -- progress, sorry, on a number of critical strategic initiatives designed to continuously improve our productivity. Some of the most compelling areas of opportunity have come from improved supply and demand visibility. This has allowed us to better leverage our volume growth and to be more disciplined with respect to managing product minimums, reducing product lead times and consolidating shipments. We believe that there are still more opportunity, and this will continue to remain an area of focus. 
The unexpected challenges we faced in the third quarter followed better-than-expected sales and profit trends in the first half of the year. We are proud of our progress against the company's long-term growth objectives, and with our ability to consistently invest in these areas while still executing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards. We are able to do this as a result of the strategic diversity of our operating model, the power of our brand portfolio, the desirability of our products and the high level of operational control we have over business. 
In November, I mentioned the next exciting endeavor for our Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport, beginning with the introduction of men's and boys for the fall '15 season. Across the globe, the feedback on this product has been strong and seen as a natural fit with the spirit and sensibility of Polo. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate, and we believe there's a significant long-term market share opportunity for Polo. 
I also want to mention the most delicious extension of our Polo brand, our new restaurant in New York. The Polo Bar officially opened on January 9, and the response has been sensational. From the food to the service, to the decor, Ralph has brought something special and unique to the Manhattan dining scene, and we are overwhelmed by the enthusiasm people have to experience the brand in this way. 
Based on the continued uncertainty of the global macroeconomic environment, we are planning the fourth quarter and next year cautiously and responsibly. This included a comprehensive look at our operating model. Chris will take you through some of our plans to move to a global brand management structure, with new systems and processes to support the stronger sales and profit growth we expect over the next 5 years. As challenging as the macro environment is, I believe we are operating from a position of strength and that our company is mobilized to manage through it. We have a long-term plan, a clear strategic road map to help us realize that plan, the managerial talent to navigate that road map and $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet to support our efforts. The board shares our confidence in both our future growth plans and our financial condition, as evidenced by the increase in the quarterly dividend payment that was announced today. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris."

I'd like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusting for FX headwinds, revenues increased 3%, which was achieved on top of a 9%",1882,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. 
Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusting for FX headwinds, revenues increased 3%, which was achieved on top of a 9% gain on the prior year period, led by the retail segment and driven by our strategic focus on e-commerce and new store development. Every geographic region grew in constant currency during the quarter, with the international business up double digits. 
Reported revenues actualized below our outlook of 3% to 5% growth due to negative foreign exchange and weaker-than-expected trends at our retail stores, which were impacted by a decline in traffic especially among important tourist customers and a more promotional holiday period in the U.S. Gross profit margin of 57% was 120 basis points below the prior year period. The anticipated decline in gross profit margin was due to mix impacts, the more promotional U.S. marketplace and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. 
Operating margin of 15.5% was 110 basis points below the prior year, entirely attributable to the lower gross profit margin. This was at the high end of the outlook we provided in November due to strong and proactive expense management throughout the organization and despite incremental investments in new store openings, marketing and infrastructure projects. Net income of $215 million was 9% below the prior year, and net income per diluted share declined 6% to $2.41. 
Moving onto segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 2% in constant currency, which was achieved on top of a 14% gain on the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $837 million were in line with the prior year. Growth in European wholesale shipments was offset by lower shipments in the Americas due to the cadence of seasonal receipt plans and unfavorable foreign exchange. Wholesale operating margin of 24.7% was 120 basis points below the prior year due to product mix impacts. 
Retail sales rose 5% in constant currency and were up 2% to $1.1 billion on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and included double-digit growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were in line with the prior year on constant currency and declined 2% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance and positive growth internationally that was offset by a decline in comps in the Americas, which continued to experience challenging traffic trends at brick-and-mortar stores.
Retail operating margin was 16.9%, 260 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting the more promotional U.S. marketplace and costs associated with the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts. Licensing revenues increased 6% and operating margin rose 7% in the third quarter due to higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren products around the world. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings.
We spent approximately $124 million on capital expenditures in the third quarter, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. The company also repurchased about 550,000 shares of its common stock, utilizing $100 million of its authorization and bringing year-to-date repurchase activity to $350 million. At the end of the quarter, $230 million remained available for future buybacks, and we had $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. 
At this point, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of the year and provide some preliminary perspective on fiscal '16. For the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid-single digit rate in constant currency, which is an acceleration from the third quarter and year-to-date results. Based on current foreign exchange rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 550 basis points. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be 250 to 300 basis points below the prior year, with relatively equal pressure on gross margin and operating expenses. The decline in operating margin reflects unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, investments in the company's strategic growth objectives and a cautious view of the global environment, which we believe is prudent at this time. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 31% to 32%. 
For the full year fiscal '15 period, revenues are expected to increase about 4% in constant currency, and we now anticipate a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. This compares to our prior outlook of 5% to 7%. The full year fiscal '15 operating margin is now estimated to be 170 to 190 basis points below the prior year's level, which compares to our prior expectation of a 100 to 125 basis point decline. The change in operating margin guidance is driven by the lower sales outlook and foreign exchange. As a reminder, the primary drivers of the year-over-year contraction in operating margin are the incremental investments we're making to expand our global store network, strengthen the company's infrastructure and increase advertising and marketing. The fiscal 2015 tax rate continues to be estimated at 30%. 
As we look to the future, we remain committed to investing in the growth initiatives that we believe will provide us with a more robust platform for future sales and profit growth. While we have not yet completed our fiscal 2016 budget, I want to provide some qualitative insight into how we're approaching next fiscal year. 
The context in which we are operating has changed. In addition to political and economic challenges around the world, we are experiencing significant headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Based on current exchange rates, FX will have about a 550 basis point negative impact on fiscal '16 revenue growth. The combination of translational and transactional currency effects is estimated to reduce our full year operating income by approximately $185 million. This is the most significant currency impact the company has experienced in a fiscal year.
To deal with these external realities, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate their impact. First, we intend to raise prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada and Europe. Second, our supply chain organization is negotiating lower prices across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material cost and oil prices as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. Finally we intend to reduce operating cost by restructuring the organization, something I'll come back to later.
With that as a backdrop, we are currently planning mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth in fiscal '16, supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we've invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new store development and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to expanded square footage and continued momentum in e-commerce.
On a constant dollar basis, we expect operating margin from continuing operations to improve from fiscal 2015's level due to gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We intend to reinvest that improvement in 2 main areas: the build-out of the new global e-commerce platform and the global store development, including the renovation of several existing stores. Over the next 2 years, we expect to remerchandise several existing locations to our Ralph Lauren or Polo concepts in order to refine brand positioning, streamline assortments and better service the customer. On a reported basis, we expect operating margin to be down due to the foreign exchange impact I mentioned earlier. We will provide more specifics on our fiscal '16 operating margin expectations in May after we have completed the budget process. 
Let me now turn to the operating model change that Jacki referred to a few minutes ago. For a number of reasons, we decided that the time was right to transform the way in which our organization is structured, how we design and manage our processes and how we make decisions. This is a significant change to position the company for stronger future performance.
About 15 years ago, the company embarked on a long-range plan to assume direct control over strategically important regions and merchandise categories. This began with the acquisition of the European business in 2000. Over the next decade, the company acquired more than a dozen previously licensed businesses. These actions allowed us to maximize the sales and profit potential of each of these businesses, while elevating the presentation of the brands. The result, however, was a complex operating model. To address this, we first turned to infrastructure, upgrading systems in order to integrate what was a highly fragmented channel and regional structure. Next, we began to globalize several critical corporate functions, such as finance, IT, supply chain and merchandising.
Today, we are taking the next step to simplify our operating model. Over the next several months, we will commence plans to move from a decentralized channel and regional structure to a fully integrated, global, brand-based organization structure. We have always believed that our brands are our greatest assets and a significant competitive advantage. Our strength as a company stems from the vitality and desirability of our brands. In this new structure, we will create global brand groups that will not only define the strategy from design and merchandising to retail concepts and marketing, but will also have accountability for financial performance around the world.
Importantly, we will continue to have regional, channel and functional teams that not only provide critical expertise and insight to the global brand groups, but also operate the business on a day-to-day basis. We believe this will strengthen the connectivity from the design vision to the consumer impression and ensure greater clarity and consistency of brand expression. While each of our brands enjoys high awareness and regard today, we believe this new organization design will further enhance brand equity. We see this next step as a critical milestone to realizing our vision of operating as a truly global business, maximizing our growth potential and realizing significant operating efficiencies. 
Let me give just one example. Now that we have completed the SAP rollout across design and global manufacturing, we have visibility for the first time into our SKU development, adoption and performance. We now know that last year, we designed 130,000 SKUs across the company, with a commonality rate by brand in like locations around the world that is very low. The new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to lower inventory levels, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings. Our goal, once the new structure is fully implemented, is to achieve over $100 million in annual expense savings. Only a modest amount will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings in fiscal '17 and beyond. We expect to incur a restructuring charge as a result of this reorganization, and we are currently working through the details of the plan. We will provide more insight in May. 
We are very excited about the company's growth prospects. We are investing in the business and making the right strategic decisions in order to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time. 
With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist?"

And so we think now is the right time, because of a lot of this groundwork that we've laid over the past couple of years, to really set the stage for the new organization model. And we think that this creates a platform for future sales and revenue growth acceleration, because what it's going to enable us to do is be more focused on a by-brand basis and really integrate the work of design, merchandising, marketing, retail store concepts around the world. And so if you think about the way we're operating today, because of the way we've acquired licenses, we're really operating with many different groups around the world that are performing similar activities. And we believe that this new construct will allow us to enhance the brand clarity and consistency around the world, while driving operating efficiencies at the same time.

First, let me just describe the FX impact a little bit, and then I'll come back to the underlying. So I think, as we mentioned, we expect FX at current rates to have about a negative 550 basis point impact on the top line. A lot of our cost structure is in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Hong Kong dollars because that's where we have our big centers of operation from an SG&A standpoint from overhead. And of course, a lot of our manufacturing base is in currencies that have not depreciated as much as the euro, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. So when we look at the FX impact on the top line of 5.5%, the flow-through of that to the bottom line is a little bit over 40% in terms of the impact that it has, which is what leads to the $185 million headwind, because our cost structure is not denominated in local currency. On the underlying basis, back to your question, I think that we expect our operating margin on the underlying basis to be up versus this year, and that's because some of the investments that we've been making in terms of our infrastructure, in terms of the retail store development and in terms of the increased marketing and advertising, we're seeing positive trends from those that are driving growth in operating margin on an underlying basis. The 2 headwinds that we have next year, which we expect to offset the underlying increase in operating margin, are the e-commerce platform, which will be a bigger investment next year than this year, but we believe is strategically the right thing for us to do, as we've talked about in the past; and the continuation of our retail store development effort, particularly where we're looking to remerchandise many of our stores from the World of Ralph Lauren concept into distinctive Ralph Lauren luxury stores or Polo stores, which we think are clear to the consumer."

And so we think we can grow a couple of points faster, which would position us at sort of a low- to mid-single-digit growth rate in the wholesale business going forward. The retail business, we believe, we can grow faster, both driven by the e-commerce business where we had high-teens growth in the current quarter. And we think that the e-commerce business is going to continue to grow at an accelerated rate, which is why we're investing behind the e-commerce business. And then when you go to the brick-and-mortar retail business, I think that -- we think that the brick-and-mortar retail business, we had strong performance internationally and a little bit of a slowdown and performance in the U.S. that was below our expectations, primarily driven by traffic trends. We saw traffic trends in the quarter at the factory outlet channel that were down mid-single digits, and that's what really affected us relative to the expectations we had going into the quarter."

From a retail standpoint, we are anticipating a bigger impact on retail, primarily due to new store openings. So baked into our constant dollar comp guidance is not a big expectation for a constant dollar comp increase. It's more around the acceleration work we see in the wholesale business as well as the full impact of our retail store development activity. And of course, we're continuing to view the e-commerce business as operating very successfully, which we have been doing."

So we do hedge our inventory purchases, a portion of our inventory purchases, and we typically hedge sort of 6 to 9 months out. So we're not hedged for the full fiscal year next year, and we're not hedged at a 100% rate. We typically hedge at sort of a 70% of our exposure rate. So there is a significant impact from currency in that guidance for next year that's inventory related. But there also will be an additional flow-through in the following year from the portion of inventory next year where we do have a hedge on, if you think forward to fiscal '17. With regard to the fourth quarter, there certainly is a foreign exchange impact on the bottom line and on the operating margin in the fourth quarter. And in fact, it's fairly significant. And the reason for that is that when you think about the flow-through that I talked about earlier, if the FX drag on the top line is flowing through next year at a little bit over a 40% rate, we're also seeing a similar type of impact in the fourth quarter. And with the 550 basis point drag from foreign exchange on the top line in the fourth quarter, that's creating a operating margin pressure in the fourth quarter, which is a big part of the reason for our guidance change on operating margin, not just for the fourth quarter but also for the fiscal year, the current fiscal year. And then on raw material and oil cost, we have some visibility to that. And so when we saw the drop in commodities and we saw the strength of the dollar and we saw the drop in oil prices, we immediately began working with our global manufacturing and supply chain teams who have at this point gone over and met with a number of our manufacturers in Asia and begun to work on getting cost reduction. We don't have full visibility to the cost reduction that we're going to get, but we are certainly confident that we're going to get some cost reduction as part of this. And that's part of the detailed work that we have in finalizing the budget ahead of us over the next couple of months. There is a timing lag in terms of when that flows through because typically, the seasons that we're negotiating are 6 months out or so from the time that we begin that negotiation process."

It's still a large business and still a very profitable business for us, but we believe that with the growth of the e-commerce business, which has become particularly large in the U.S., that that's starting to cannibalize a little bit into that channel. Also, as some of the brick-and-mortar stores that are closer in to the urban areas have gotten more competitive on pricing, it's reduced the consumer desire to drive to get to the outlet center. And so we're factoring that into our plans as we go forward because we expect that trend, although you can never predict, but we certainly think the consumer is going to continue to shop more and more online. And as that happens, we think that's going to continue to put pressure on brick and mortar."

And as a result of that, what we saw was that a lot of the competitors ratcheted up the promotional intensity in terms of what -- in terms of trying to deal the inventory that they have on the floor.

So on the quarter, on gross margin, really, there were 3 things that impacted the 120 basis points. Certainly, currency had a significant impact, as we mentioned, the more promotional U.S. marketplace and then we had a mix impact as well. And part of that was due to the cadence of our wholesale shipments. The cadence of our wholesale shipments in the quarter, we wound up shipping more women's product in the third quarter than we did men's product in the third quarter from a growth rate standpoint. And the men's business operates at a significantly higher gross margin for us than the women's business, and so we saw a mix impact that was due to the men's versus women's growth mix. If you look at those 3 aspects, I would say that the 3 aspects were relatively equal in nature. There was not one that was overwhelming relative to the other aspects on gross margin during the quarter. We did have to airfreight more product during the quarter. We also wound up routing a lot of product via all water routing, so we shipped it around the U.S. and received it in the East Coast ports. And what that did, as Jacki alluded to, was that allowed us to avoid some of the issues in the West Coast port situation, but it takes more time to ship it to the East Coast that we then had to accelerate, once the product was unloaded in the East Coast, receipt into our Greensboro distribution center and staff in our Greensboro distribution center to turn that inventory around faster. So we did see an impact from the West Coast port strike, but I would say that, that impact was relatively minor because of the strong management of our supply chain teams. And with regard to next year, on an underlying basis, we do believe gross margin is going to be up as we looked at -- as we've gone through the initial stages of the budget process, and I think there's a couple of reasons for that. One is, we expect the retail segment to grow faster than wholesale. And of course, our retail segment has higher gross margins than wholesale. Two, we expect the accessories business to grow at a faster rate than the balance of the business, and that also tends to be a gross margin sweetener. And then third, the -- at least in constant currency, the international business is projected to grow at a faster rate. And of course, we have higher gross margins in the international business than we do in the U.S. And so when you look at those 3 elements, I think all of that is driving us to an underlying gross margin that's improving in next year's forecast versus this year.
Okay. Thank you very much for attending. And as always, we'll be available for follow-up calls."

Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign currency headwinds in the back half of the year. I'm pleased to report that our fourth q",1567,"Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign currency headwinds in the back half of the year. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectation driven by strong demand in North America Wholesale and global e-commerce. While we continue to experience the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and lower tourist traffic, our product across core and emerging categories was well-received and we achieved strong sell-through in most regions.
Revenue growth of 7% in constant currency in the fourth quarter was ahead of our guidance. We delivered profits above expectations, driven by better top line performance and the attention to disciplined operational and expense management by our team.
Now let me turn to some highlights for the quarter. Our North America Wholesale business was the standout performer in the fourth quarter and achieved record sales and profitability. Our 3 largest and most developed businesses, men's, women's and children, were all up, which speaks to the appeal of our branded product. Our design and merchandising teams continue to produce fresh, compelling assortments that resonate with both new and existing customers. 
In terms of product category highlights, our dress, accessories and footwear offerings and the Denim & Supply brand delivered strong growth in stores and online, driven by door expansion and positive consumer response to our unique voice.
We grew market share for the full year in a competitive retail environment, which we believe is due not only to our product, but also our steady investment in shop environments and marketing that express the distinction of our brands. Global e-commerce revenues grew in the high-teens for the fourth quarter, representing strong momentum for one of our most important areas of strategic focus.
Traffic to our website in all regions increased significantly, including a 48% increase in mobile traffic in North America. Additionally, enhanced site search functionality has led to higher conversion. We are on track with the design and architecture of our new e-commerce platform and are confident its capabilities will enable us to achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in this channel.
Another highlight in the quarter was our luxury business, where we saw strong performance in our men's and women's lines. We saw higher conversion rate in our retail stores and believe that they are the result of terrific product, as well as a sharp focus on store level execution and new approaches to educating our sales associates. This offset some of the challenging traffic trends due to a decline in global travel by the luxury tourist customer. We're also seeing the positive impact of our SKU reduction initiatives with sales up on 1/3 fewer SKUs in our Women's business.
Looking to our luxury product highlights in the quarter. The newest addition to our Ricky handbag portfolio, the Drawstring Ricky, is already enjoying nice success. The launch of this new silhouette supported by a strong advertising and marketing campaign on it a great deal of editorial attention in the fashion press and on social media. And that has translated to an encouraging consumer response. 
Our new lightweight Cashmere scarf collection was introduced in limited palette and was expanded to offer spectacular assortment of bright colors for which Ralph Lauren brand is so well-known. We remain committed to the growth of all of our accessory categories and expect to see their higher purchase frequency bring customers into the store and online more frequently.
Finally, we made the decision to merge our luxury lines in both men's and women's into a single label: Ralph Lauren Collection for Women and Ralph Lauren Purple label for Men. We believe this will clarify our luxury message driving consistent global brand presentation and marketing synergies. Response to the change from our retail partners and sales associates has been extremely positive, and we are optimistic that this will not only drive strong performance, but will also reduce expenses by maximizing productivity and creating focused assortments. We expect to transition these businesses for the pre-spring 2016 season. Now I'd like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region. 
In the Americas, our largest region, revenues grew 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter. This was led by double-digit growth in our North America Wholesale business and mid-teen growth in our U.S. e-commerce business. Retail sales continue to be impacted by lower tourist traffic due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Our European revenues rose 5% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and an increase in reorders. Our men's apparel business saw especially strong demand at wholesale. In our own retail stores, we continue to be impacted by lower tourist traffic, especially those coming from Russia and the Middle East, who has been most severely impacted by the volatility in both currency and commodity market.
Generally speaking, we saw the best trends in North and in Central Europe with a negative impact of the terrorist -- while the negative impact of the terrorist attacks has continued to challenge France, and the Middle East is, of course, affected by lower oil prices and a decline in Russian tourist. 
In Asia, we achieved 1% constant currency revenue growth with trends varying by country. Korean sales remained challenging for the apparel sector, especially in department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Hong Kong store traffic remained pressured and South East Asia was soft due to travel concerns.
In Greater China, double-digit constant currency revenue growth largely reflects the investment we've made in new distribution. Highlights in the region included strong sell-throughs on spring product and the continued positive response to Women's Polo.
I'd like to mention the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. This team has done an outstanding job navigating through the extended West Coast port situations and maintaining business continuity with limited incremental expense. This is a significant achievement given the breadth and scale of our product portfolio and distribution. During this time, the team also supported record wholesale shipment volume in the fourth quarter while continuing to manage expenses.
I want to extend my thanks for their extraordinary work. On our last call, I spoke about the next exciting endeavor for our iconic Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport. Beginning with the introduction of men's and boys lines to the Fall '15 season, the product will be available for pre-order on RalphLauren.com in June and available in our retail stores and wholesale partners around the world in August.
Latter timing coincides with the dedicated advertising campaign featuring distinctive imagery that will position Polo Sport as authentic, modern active wear. Across the globe, feedback on this product has been terrific and Polo Sport is seen as a perfect fit with the athletic spirit and sensitivity that have always been an important element of the Polo brand. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate, and both we and our wholesale partners believe this is a significant long-term market share opportunity.
Finally, I'd like to update you on our progress with the new global brand management structure we first spoke about on our last call. At that time, I spoke briefly about the factors and opportunities that led us to make the decision to shift from a more decentralized regional and channel structure to a centralized global brand management model. Today, I want to provide more detail.
Over the nearly 48 years since the company began, we have grown significantly, with the last dozen years realizing accelerated growth due to the acquisition of the majority of our product licenses and geographic territories. This give us greater control of our brand, but led to a tremendous organizational complexity.
Our new operating model and processes will allow us to fully leverage the power of each of our brands to ensure the greatest consistency of expression around the world and drive growth. We have always believed that our brands are our greatest assets, and that will now be reflected in the structure of the company. We are not changing who we are, we are changing how we work, and the opportunities associated with this transformation are very exciting.
As the first step of the transition to the new operating model, last month, we announced changes to our executive leadership. Most notably, the promotion of Chris Peterson to President of Global Brands. We will continue to share updates on future calls and expect to drive significant operating and cost efficiencies that will help support the strong sales and profit growth we expect over the next 5 years. Chris will take you through the details of the financial impact of our actions around the reorganization to fiscal 2016 and beyond.
I'm very proud of our ability to focus on and invest in the company's long-term growth objectives while managing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards and most recently, engage in the discussion and analysis required to set our future structure up for great success. This speaks to the talent and the experience of our senior leaders, the dedication of our teams across every area, our rigorous attention to operational and expense management, and of course, the desirability of our products and the power of our brands.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris."

Last month, we named Bob Chief Financial Officer of the company reporting to me. You'll all have a chance to meet Bob over the next several months, and I know he's looking forward to it. Now I'd like to turn to a brief recap of the quarter.
On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 7%, better than the mid single-digit growth rates we guided to in February driven by strength in the wholesale segment and global e-commerce. Importantly, this growth was achieved on top of a 14% gain in the prior year period. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was 550 basis points, in line with our expectations.
Every geographic region grew in constant currency during the quarter. On a reported basis, net revenues rose 1% to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year fiscal 2015 period, net revenues grew 4% in constant currency and 2% on a reported basis to $7.6 billion.
Gross profit margin of 55.4% in the fourth quarter was 80 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects and mixed shift impacts. Operating margin of 10.1% in the fourth quarter was 190 basis points below the prior year, attributable to the negative impact of foreign exchange and incremental investments in the company's long-term growth initiatives. Operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of 250 to 300 basis point decrease. The outperformance was driven by better-than-expected revenues and disciplined expense management throughout the organization.
For the full year 2015 period, operating margin declined 160 basis points to 13.6%, due to investments we made to strengthen the company's infrastructure and global store network expansion initiatives, as well as negative foreign exchange impacts.
Net income for the fourth quarter was $124 million or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, earnings per share was $1.69 for the fourth quarter, essentially in line with the $1.68 we reported in the prior year period. For the full year 2015, net income was $702 million or $7.88 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, the EPS was $8.19 for fiscal 2015 compared to $8.43 in fiscal 2014.
The effective tax rate of 28% in the fourth quarter was lower-than-expected due to one-time discrete items when compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period. Moving onto segment performance.
Wholesale revenues increased 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, which was achieved on top of a 24% gain in the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $1 billion were 2% above the prior year period. North America posted double-digit increases and Europe grew mid single-digits in constant currency as we gained market share in both regions.
Growth was driven in part by accelerated demand for spring merchandise by our customers, as Easter was 2 weeks earlier than last year, and strong reorders in Europe. Wholesale operating margin of 30.7% in the fourth quarter was 60 basis points above the prior year period due to improved profitability of core operations, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts.
Retail sales rose to 6% in constant currency to $841 million, more roughly in line with last year on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and high-teens growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were up 1% in constant currency and declined 4% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange impacts. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance that was somewhat offset by challenging traffic trends of brick-and-mortar stores, especially in markets where currency movements impacted towards traffic.
By region, constant currency comps increased in the Americas and Europe, while Asia was slightly down. Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, 270 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting investments in new store development and lower profitability in core operations.
Licensing revenue declined 5% and operating income was down 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to negative foreign currency effects and the anniversary of the launch of Polo Red fragrance in the prior year period
Consolidated inventory was $1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 2% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth and new store openings. We spent $391 million on capital expenditures during the year, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. The company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal 2015 at a cost of $500 million and returned an additional $158 million to shareholders via dividend payments.
In total, the company returned approximately $658 million to shareholders during the year, which represents an almost 6% effective yield. Yesterday, the company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $500 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $80 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $580 million. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet.
Overall, we are pleased with the better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful foreign exchange and environmental headwinds. Now I'd like to turn to fiscal 2016.
We expect fiscal 2016 to be a year of significant transformation for the company. We will move to the new brand management organization structure, make important infrastructure investments, continue retail store development and take decisive action to mitigate foreign currency pressures. Let me take these each in turn.
As Jacki spoke about, we have made meaningful progress on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure. The most important aspect of this new operating model is that it brings together the formally desperate functions of design, merchandising, planning, creative and marketing to form dedicated brand groups. We are creating 6 global brand groups, each run by a brand President. These brand groups will define global design merchandising and marketing strategies and be accountable for the global financial performance of the business.
Brand and business strategies will be developed in concert with the leaders of the regions and channels, who understand the critical dynamics and nuances of these specialized areas. These brand groups will also rely on the strong knowledge and capabilities of our shared services teams. 
The new model processes and single view visibility to each brand will allow us to be more nimble and responsive to the marketplace and operate as a truly global business. This will enable us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operating and financial efficiencies. For example, the new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to better inventory turns, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings.
From a timing standpoint, it will take several months to transition to the new operating model. Overall, we are on track to achieve over $100 million of annual expense savings from this initiative. Only a modest the month of this will be realized in fiscal '16 with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond.
We expect to incur restructuring and other one-time-related charges of approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization. From a timing perspective, we expect these charges to be heavily weighted in the first half of the year. This charge encompasses 2 elements. First is the cost of separation associated with employee headcount reduction. We expect to reduce our full-time workforce by approximately 5%.
The second element is the cost of store and shop repositioning related to providing more clarity across our different brand presentations, including the merging of our luxury labels. We are very excited about the move to the new structure as we believe it will create a platform for profitable growth by allowing us to both improve our global brand equities and drive operating efficiency over time.
Moving to store development. We plan to open approximately 40 to 50 directly operated stores in fiscal 2016 on a global basis. We expect that our new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal 2016 as our accelerated store opening pace is now in our base.
On infrastructure investments. Our e-commerce replatform initiative will begin to wrap up in fiscal 2016. This is a multiyear initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the online customer shopping experience. Our SAP implementation is substantially complete in North America, and we began SAP limitation for Europe this year. We expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the e-commerce replatforming initiative.
Moving to foreign exchange. We have taken decisive actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. First, we are raising prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid to high single-digit range and will be effective in the back half of the fiscal year. 
Second, our supply chain organization has negotiated lower cost across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material and oil prices, as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. These lower-cost will also become effective in the back half of the fiscal year.
Finally, we will reduce operating costs by restructuring the organization. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to review our detailed outlook for fiscal 2016.
We continue to expect mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year similar to the view we shared with you in February. The growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we've invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new stores and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to new store development and continued momentum in e-commerce.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal 2016 revenue growth.
Moving on to operating income. On a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2016, which we intend to reinvest in our infrastructure build-out, primarily the new global e-commerce replatforming and ongoing SAP implementation. 
On a reported basis, we expect our full year fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 180 to 230 basis points below fiscal 2015's level due entirely to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes restructuring and other one-time related charges associated with our global brand organization -- reorganization. 
We continue to expect the negative impact of FX on operating income to approximate $185 million, similar to what we projected in February based on current exchange rates. In terms of the sensitivity of our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a change of about a nickel in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by approximately $20 million on a full year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%.
We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be flat in constant currency, as retail segment growth is offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, which is impacted by our customers receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the first quarter to be 600 basis points.
Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 600 to 650 basis points below the prior year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, the quarterly revenue growth profile and timing of expense savings initiatives. First quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%.
We are very excited about the company's potential for future growth. We are organizing the company to drive the power of brands, investing in key infrastructure projects and making strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
With that, we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

From a systems perspective, let me provide a little bit more color on that as well. I think we feel very good where we are from a systems standpoint, although there are still more work to do. The SAP implementation that we've done is now complete with regard to our global manufacturing and supply chain system and complete in the North America order to cash for wholesale. And what that has allowed us to do is have global visibility to our style count, our SKU count, and it's allowed us to get to a point where we now have global financial data by brand, which we've just been able to implement, which of course, is one of the key enablers in moving to the global brand structure. So I think there's more work to do as we move into the new model. But I feel good about where we are and we're very happy from the system standpoint.

And so the change in the expected revenue impact from 550 basis points on the top line to 450 was really due to a sharpening of our exposure model. As we looked at the bottom line impact, the bottom line impact was in line with what we thought at the last time. So I think it was more a function of finalizing the budgets and updating the exposure model with regard to the change and the slight change in the FX guidance for fiscal '16. On the second question in terms of what does that mean for fiscal '17? I think that there's going to be a couple of couple different things in fiscal '17, and it's premature to give guidance that far out. But obviously, we would expect to see full year impact of the pricing action that we're taking, which would be a positive. We would expect to see a full year impact of the cost reductions that we're taking, which would be a positive. And we would expect to see a ramp-up of the restructuring savings, which would be a positive. And so all of those with me to a better operating margin outlook in '17. On the negative side, we have hedged our FX exposure. And so, as a those hedges roll off, we will have a year-on-year hedge FX hurt continuing into fiscal '17 from the portion of the business that was hedged in fiscal '16. Pretty mature to talk about how those net against each other, but I think those are the underlying trends. And I think to your question about sort of the infrastructure investments being at the highest level, I do expect that fiscal '16 will likely be the highest level of investments on the infrastructure investments in total."

Too soon to tell how those pricing actions are going to play out because obviously, it's going to depend on how competitors respond as well in these markets. But our view is that with the significant impact of foreign currency in these markets, all of the competitors that source products from similar countries should be seeing a similar transactional impact. And what we're trying to do is price per transactional foreign exchange, but not for translational foreign change. And that's how we came to the price increases that we're looking at here."

Yes, I think the way to think about this is that the seasons that we operate in don't match up with our fiscal quarter reporting periods. And because of that, sometimes our seasonal flow of inventory from a shipment standpoint isn't really indicative of the underlying trend. I think we felt like for the entire fiscal year, when you look at the fall season and the crews holiday season and into the spring season, that we had plants that were growing market share in the U.S. wholesale business pretty consistently but sometimes that growth in market share, which has as growing a couple of points faster than the U.S. wholesale industry, doesn't necessarily show up in terms of the shipment pattern because of the way the customer receipt plans fall within our fiscal quarters.

So we're seeing door growth. We're seeing great sales growth, and we see that strengthening. As I said, we're also very optimistic about the -- our Polo women's business, which was new to us starting with last fall. And we're seeing door growth there as well.

We also saw continued very strong comp store growth in our e-commerce business that was in the high double digits. The one channel that was under a little bit of pressure during the quarter was the full-price retail stores. And that was really a function of the slowdown in international tourist traffic as we talked about primarily the Russian, Middle East and Brazilian consumers, which were impacted. But overall, an improvement in comp store sales trends in the Americas, as well as in the wholesale shipments business."

And I think Central Europe, France and others have been a little bit more under pressure. The biggest impact in Europe that we've seen is the traffic drop from the Russian and Middle Eastern tourist.

I think the other thing that we've been working on is developing and launching, as part of the Women's Polo business, a more significant accessories offering under the Women's Polo line, which we're very excited about and is coming in the not-too-distant future.

Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign currency headwinds in the back half of the year. I'm pleased to report that our fourth q",1571,"Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign currency headwinds in the back half of the year. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectation driven by strong demand in North America Wholesale and global e-commerce. While we continue to experience the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and lower tourist traffic, our product across core and emerging categories was well received and we achieved strong sell-through in most regions.  Revenue growth of 7% in constant currency in the fourth quarter was ahead of our guidance. We delivered profits above expectations, driven by better top line performance and the attention to disciplined operational and expense management by our team.
Now let me turn to some highlights for the quarter. Our North America wholesale business was the standout performer in the fourth quarter and achieved record sales and profitability. Our 3 largest and most developed businesses, men's, women's and childs, were all up, which speaks to the appeal of our brand and product. Our design and merchandising teams continue to produce fresh, compelling assortments that resonate with both new and existing customers. In terms of product category highlights, our dress, accessories and footwear offerings and the Denim & Supply brand delivered strong growth in stores and online, driven by door expansion and positive consumer response to our unique voice.
We grew market share for the full year in a competitive retail environment, which we believe is due not only to our product, but also our steady investment in shop environments and marketing that express the distinction of our brands. Global e-commerce revenues grew in the high-teens for the fourth quarter, representing strong momentum for one of our most important areas of strategic focus.
Traffic to our website in all regions increased significantly, including a 48% increase in mobile traffic in North America. Additionally, enhanced site search functionality has led to higher conversion. We are on track with the design and architecture of our new e-commerce platform and are confident its capabilities will enable us to achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in this channel.
Another highlight in the quarter was our luxury business, where we saw strong performance in our men's and women's lines. We saw a higher conversion rate in our retail stores and believe that they are the result of terrific product as well as a sharp focus on store level execution and new approaches to educating our sales associates. This offsets some of the challenging traffic trends due to a decline in global travel by the luxury tourist customer. We are also seeing the positive impact of our SKU reduction initiatives with sales up on 1/3 fewer SKUs in our women's business.
Peaking to our luxury product highlights in the quarter. The newest addition to our Ricky handbag portfolio, the Drawstring Ricky, is already enjoying nice success. The launch of this new silhouette supported by a strong advertising and marketing campaign garnered a great deal of editorial attention in the fashion press and on social media. And that has translated to an encouraging consumer response. 
Our new lightweight cashmere scarf collection was introduced in limited palette and was expanded to offer spectacular assortment of bright colors for which Ralph Lauren brand is so well-known. We remain committed to the growth of all of our accessory categories and expect to see their higher purchase frequency bring customers into the store and online more frequently.
Finally, we made the decision to merge our luxury lines in both men's and women's into a single label: Ralph Lauren Collection for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. We believe this will clarify our luxury message driving consistent global brand presentation and marketing synergies. Response to the change from our retail partners and sales associates has been extremely positive, and we are optimistic that this will not only drive strong performance, but will also reduce expenses by maximizing productivity and creating focused assortments. We expect to transition these businesses for the pre-spring 2016 season.
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region. In the Americas, our largest region, revenues grew 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter. This was led by double-digit growth in our North America wholesale business and mid-teen growth in our U.S. e-commerce business. Retail sales continued to be impacted by lower tourist traffic due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Our European revenues rose 5% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and an increase in reorders. Our men's apparel business saw a specially strong demand at wholesale. In our own retail stores, we continued to be impacted by lower tourist traffic, especially those coming from Russia and the Middle East, who have been most severely impacted by the volatility in both currency and commodity markets.
Generally speaking, we saw the best trends in North and in Central Europe where the negative impact of the terrorist -- while the negative impact of the terrorist attacks has continued to challenge France, and the Middle East is, of course, affected by lower oil prices and a decline in Russian tourist. 
In Asia, we achieved 1% constant currency revenue growth with trends varying by country. Korean sales remained challenging for the apparel sector, especially in department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Hong Kong store traffic remained pressured and South East Asia was soft due to travel concerns. In Greater China, double-digit constant currency revenue growth largely reflects the investment we've made in new distribution. Highlights in the region included strong sell-throughs on spring product and the continued positive response to Women's Polo.
I'd like to mention the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. This team has done an outstanding job navigating through the extended West Coast port situation and maintaining business continuity with limited incremental expense. This is a significant achievement given the breadth and scale of our product portfolio and distribution. During this time, the team also supported record wholesale shipment volume in the fourth quarter while continuing to manage expenses. I want to extend my thanks for their extraordinary work. 
On our last call, I spoke about the next exciting endeavor for our iconic Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport. Beginning with the introduction of men's and boys lines to the Fall '15 season, the product will be available for pre-order on RalphLauren.com in June and available in our retail stores and wholesale partners around the world in August.
The latter timing coincides with the dedicated advertising campaign featuring distinctive imagery that will position Polo Sport as authentic, modern active wear. Across the globe, feedback on this product has been terrific and Polo Sport is seen as a perfect fit with the athletic spirit and sensibility that have always been an important element of the Polo brand. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate and both we and our wholesale partners believe this is a significant long-term market share opportunity.
Finally, I'd like to update you on our progress with the new global brand management structure we first spoke about on our last call. At that time, I spoke briefly about the factors and opportunities that led us to make the decision to shift from a more decentralized regional and channel structure to a centralized global brand management model. Today, I want to provide more detail.
Over the nearly 48 years since the company began, we have grown significantly, with the last dozen years realizing accelerated growth due to the acquisition of the majority of our product licenses and geographic territories. This gave us greater control of our brand, but led to tremendous organizational complexity.
Our new operating model and processes will allow us to fully leverage the power of each of our brands to ensure the greatest consistency of expression around the world and drive growth. We have always believed that our brands are our greatest assets, and that will now be reflected in the structure of the company. We are not changing who we are, we are changing how we work, and the opportunities associated with this transformation are very exciting.
As the first step in the transition to the new operating model, last month, we announced changes to our executive leadership, most notably, the promotion of Chris Peterson to President of Global Brands. We will continue to share updates on future calls and expect to drive significant operating and cost efficiencies that will help support the strong sales and profit growth we expect over the next 5 years. Chris will take you through the details of the financial impact of our actions around the reorganization to fiscal 2016 and beyond.
I'm very proud of our ability to focus on and invest in the company's long-term growth objectives while managing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards and most recently, engage in the discussion and analysis required to set our future structure up for great success. This speaks to the talent and the experience of our senior leaders, the dedication of our teams across every area, our rigorous attention to operational and expense management and of course, the desirability of our products and the power of our brands.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris."

Last month, we named Bob Chief Financial Officer of the company reporting to me. You'll all have a chance to meet Bob over the next several months, and I know he is looking forward to it. Now I'd like to turn to a brief recap of the quarter.
On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 7%, better than the mid-single-digit growth rate we guided to in February driven by strength in the wholesale segment and global e-commerce. Importantly, this growth was achieved on top of a 14% gain in the prior year period. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was 550 basis points, in line with our expectations. Every geographic region grew in constant currency during the quarter. On a reported basis, net revenues rose 1% to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year fiscal 2015 period, net revenues grew 4% in constant currency and 2% on a reported basis to $7.6 billion.
Gross profit margin of 55.4% in the fourth quarter was 80 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects and mixed shift impacts. Operating margin of 10.1% in the fourth quarter was 190 basis points below the prior year, attributable to the negative impact of foreign exchange and incremental investments in the company's long-term growth initiatives. Operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of 250 to 300 basis point decrease. The outperformance was driven by better-than-expected revenues and disciplined expense management throughout the organization.
For the full year 2015 period, operating margin declined 160 basis points to 13.6%, due to investments we made to strengthen the company's infrastructure and global store network expansion initiatives, as well as negative foreign exchange impacts. Net income for the fourth quarter was $124 million or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, earnings per share was $1.69 for the fourth quarter, essentially in line with the $1.68 we reported in the prior year period. For the full year 2015, net income was $702 million or $7.88 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, EPS was $8.19 for fiscal 2015 compared to $8.43 in fiscal 2014. The effective tax rate of 28% in the fourth quarter was lower than expected due to onetime discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period. 
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, which was achieved on top of a 24% gain in the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $1 billion were 2% above the prior year period. North America posted double-digit increases and Europe grew mid-single digits in constant currency as we gained market share in both regions.
Growth was driven in part by accelerated demand for spring merchandise by our customers, as Easter was 2 weeks earlier than last year, and strong reorders in Europe. Wholesale operating margin of 30.7% in the fourth quarter was 60 basis points above the prior year period due to improved profitability of core operations, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts.
Retail sales rose 6% in constant currency to $841 million, and more roughly in line with last year on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and high-teens growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were up 1% in constant currency and declined 4% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange impacts. Constant dollar comp trends reflects strong e-commerce performance that was somewhat offset by challenging traffic trends at brick-and-mortar stores, especially in markets where currency movements impacted tourist traffic.
By region, constant currency comps increased in the Americas and Europe, while Asia was slightly down. Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, 270 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting investments in new store development and lower profitability in core operations. Licensing revenue declined 5% and operating income was down 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to negative foreign currency effects and the anniversary of the launch of Polo Red fragrance in the prior year period
Consolidated inventory was $1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 2% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth and new store openings. We spent $391 million on capital expenditures during the year, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. The company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal 2015 at a cost of $500 million and returned an additional $158 million to shareholders via dividend payments. In total, the company returned approximately $658 million to shareholders during the year, which represents an almost 6% effective yield. 
Yesterday, the company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $500 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $80 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $580 million. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Overall, we are pleased with the better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful foreign exchange and environmental headwinds. 
Now I'd like to turn to fiscal 2016. We expect fiscal 2016 to be a year of significant transformation for the company. We will move to the new brand management organization structure, make important infrastructure investments, continue retail store development and take decisive action to mitigate foreign currency pressures. Let me take these each in turn.
As Jacki spoke about, we have made meaningful progress on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure. The most important aspect of this new operating model is that it brings together the formally disparate functions of design, merchandising, planning, creative and marketing to form dedicated brand groups. We are creating 6 global brand groups, each run by a brand President. These brand groups will define global design merchandising and marketing strategies, and be accountable for the global financial performance of the business.
Brand and business strategies will be developed in concert with the leaders of the regions and channels, who understand the critical dynamics and nuances of these specialized areas. These brand groups will also rely on the strong knowledge and capabilities of our shared services teams. The new model processes and single-view visibility to each brand will allow us to be more nimble and responsive to the marketplace and operate as a truly global business. This will enable us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operating and financial efficiencies. For example, the new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to better inventory turns, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings.
From a timing standpoint, it will take several months to transition to the new operating model. Overall, we are on track to achieve over $100 million of annual expense savings from this initiative. Only a modest amount of this will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring and other onetime related charges of approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization. 
From a timing perspective, we expect these charges to be heavily weighted in the first half of the year. This charge encompasses 2 elements: First is the cost of separation associated with employee headcount reduction. We expect to reduce our full-time workforce by approximately 5%. The second element is the cost of store and shop repositioning related to providing more clarity across our different brand presentations, including the merging of our luxury labels. We are very excited about the move to the new structure as we believe it will create a platform for profitable growth by allowing us to both improve our global brand equities and drive operating efficiency over time.
Moving to store development. We plan to open approximately 40 to 50 directly operated stores in fiscal 2016 on a global basis. We expect that our new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal 2016 as our accelerated store opening pace is now in our base.
On infrastructure investments. Our e-commerce re-platform initiative will begin to ramp-up in fiscal 2016. This is a multiyear initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the online customer shopping experience. Our SAP implementation is substantially complete in North America, and we began SAP implementation for Europe this year. We expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the e-commerce re-platforming initiative.
Moving to foreign exchange. We have taken decisive actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. First, we are raising prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid- to high-single digit range and will be effective in the back half of the fiscal year. Second, our supply chain organization has negotiated lower cost across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material and oil prices, as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. These lower-cost will also become effective in the back half of the fiscal year. Finally, we will reduce operating costs by restructuring the organization. 
With that as a backdrop, I'd like to review our detailed outlook for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year, similar to the view we shared with you in February. The growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we've invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new stores and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to new store development and continued momentum in e-commerce.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal 2016 revenue growth.
Moving on to operating income. On a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2016, which we intend to reinvest in our infrastructure build-out, primarily the new global e-commerce re-platforming and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis, we expect our full year fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 180 to 230 basis points below fiscal 2015's level, due entirely to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes restructuring and other onetime related charges associated with our global brand organization -- reorganization. 
We continue to expect the negative impact of FX on operating income to approximate $185 million, similar to what we projected in February based on current exchange rates. In terms of the sensitivity of our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a change of about $0.05 in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by approximately $20 million on a full year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be flat in constant currency, as retail segment growth is offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, which is impacted by our customers receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the first quarter to be 600 basis points.
Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 600 to 650 basis points below the prior year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, the quarterly revenue growth profile and timing of expense savings initiatives. The first quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. 
We are very excited about the company's potential for future growth. We are organizing the company to drive the power brands, investing in key infrastructure projects and making strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
With that, we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

The 6 brand groups that we're talking about are one that's going to be focused on our luxury business, which will include the Ralph Lauren brand and the RRL brand, which Valérie Hermann will lead as the brand President.

We will have a brand group that's focused on the Ralph Lauren Home business. And finally, Club Monaco will be the sixth brand group. And that's how we're organizing the brand groups. Each of the brand groups will have a brand President and a dedicated leadership team to run the business. We believe that this is going to lead to a simplification, over time, of many of the sub-brands in terms of how we go-to-market from a consumer standpoint. Because we think that what this is going to allow us to do is focus our resources and our consumer communication more at the master brand level than at the sub-brands. The only sub-brand that we have announced that we're merging at this point is the -- on the luxury side of the business with the Black Label and the Purple Label and Women's collection and Black Label business."

From a systems perspective, let me provide a little bit more color on that as well. I think we feel very good about where we are from a systems standpoint, although there are still more work to do. The SAP implementation that we've done is now complete with regard to our global manufacturing and supply chain system and complete in the North America order to cash for wholesale. And what that has allowed us to do is have global visibility to our style count, our SKU count, and it's allowed us to get to a point where we now have global financial data by brand, which we've just been able to implement, which of course, is one of the key enablers to moving to the global brand structure. So I think there's more work to do as we move into the new model, but I feel good about where we are and where we're headed from a system standpoint. And finally, from a transition timing standpoint, I think we expect to form the brand groups over the next month or 2. But of course, as we form the new brand groups, it will take them some time to come up to speed.

First off, I guess the first question would be, will you just help me clarify the guidance a little bit. It looks like the revenue impact from FX improved by 100 basis points, but the implied operating margin dollars you talked about stayed the same. I think that leaves the underlying operating margin a little lower than what you mentioned in February and the Swiss dollar got a little better, I think. So maybe you could just tell us about what changed through the February update. And then a little bit longer term on -- fiscal '17 margins is a big focus for the stock recently, as we talk, you seemed confident that fiscal '17 would be the year when the investment bucket that we've talked about with you for a while now, would start to lift off.

So the first question on the update on the FX impact to fiscal '16. I think, when we gave our guidance in February, it was before we had finalized our budgets and we had given an estimate in terms of the foreign exchange impact to the top line and bottom line. As we finalized our budgets, we also updated our exposure model. And so the change in the expected revenue impact from 550 basis points on the top line to 450, was really due to a sharpening of our exposure model. As we looked at the bottom line impact, the bottom line impact was in line with what we thought at the last time. So I think it was more a function of finalizing the budgets and updating the exposure model with regard to the change in the -- the slight change in the FX guidance for fiscal '16. On the second question in terms of what does it mean for fiscal '17? I think that there's going to be a couple of couple different things happening in fiscal '17, and it's premature to give guidance that far out. But obviously, we would expect to see a full year impact of the pricing action that we're taking, which would be a positive. We would expect to see a full year impact of the cost reductions that we're taking, which would be a positive. And we would expect to see a ramp-up of the restructuring savings, which would be a positive. And so all of those would lead to a better operating margin outlook in '17. On the negative side, we have hedged our FX exposure. And so as a those hedges roll off, we will have a year-on-year hedge FX hurt continuing into fiscal '17 from the portion of the business that was hedged in fiscal '16. Pretty mature to talk about how those net against each other, but I think those are the underlying trends. And I think to your question about sort of the infrastructure investments being at the highest level, I do expect that fiscal '16 will likely be the highest level of investment on the infrastructure investments in total."

But our view is that with the significant impact of foreign currency in these markets, all of the competitors that source products from similar countries should be seeing a similar transactional impact. And what we're trying to do is price per transactional foreign exchange, but not for translational foreign change. And that's how we came to the price increases that we're looking at here."

Yes, I think the way to think about this is that the seasons that we operate in don't match up with our fiscal quarter reporting periods. And because of that, sometimes our seasonal flow of inventory from a shipment standpoint isn't really indicative of the underlying trend. I think we felt like for the entire fiscal year, when you look at the fall season and the cruise holiday season and into the spring season, that we had plans that were growing market share in the U.S. wholesale business pretty consistently. And sometimes that growth in market share, which has us growing a couple of points faster than the U.S. wholesale industry, doesn't necessarily show up in terms of the shipment pattern because of the way the customer receipt plans fall within our fiscal quarters. So our underlying view of the business continues to be very positive in terms of the market growth that -- or the market share gains that we've experienced in that channel."

As Chris spoke to, we also look very carefully at how we are tracking against every key competitor, every key department store. And as I said, we are very pleased with our results. All of our core businesses have been quite strong. And we saw a nice acceleration within the spring season. Many of the products that are smaller parts of our company have started to gain nice acceleration, our footwear business, our accessory business, our Denim & Supply business, the dress business has been very strong. And of course, our core businesses continue as the backbone. So we're seeing door growth, we're seeing great sales growth and we see that strengthening. As I said, we're also very optimistic about the -- our Polo women's business, which was new to us starting with last fall. And we're seeing door growth there as well. And then, of course, we're about to launch our new Polo Sport business, where there's tremendous enthusiasm about that opportunity because that really puts us solidly into a new area of opportunity. And we believe that with the credibility that we have in the athletic area with our relationship with the U.S. Open, the Olympics, Wimbledon, et cetera, USGA, that we have a tremendous amount of credibility with the consumer that we've really never tapped into. So this really gives us the opportunity to put our great foot forward in a new area of opportunity for the company. And of course, we're a couple of months away from that launch which we're excited about."

And I think that the outlet channel and the U.S. comp improved versus what we were seeing previously, and that was both a function of traffic trends getting a little bit better than what we saw in the third quarter, as well as improvement in conversion rate that we drove during the quarter in the outlet channel. We also saw a continued very strong comp store growth in our e-commerce business that was in the high double digits. The one channel that was under a little bit of pressure during the quarter was the full-price retail stores, and that was really a function of the slowdown in international tourist traffic as we talked about primarily the Russian, Middle East and Brazilian consumers, which were impacted. But overall, an improvement in comp store sales trends in the Americas as well as in the wholesale shipments business."

And I think Central Europe, France and others have been a little bit more under pressure. The biggest impact in Europe that we've seen is the traffic drop from the Russian and Middle Eastern tourist. And really, the Russian tourist has dropped off more precipitously than the Middle Eastern tourist during that period. But we continue to see strong influx of Chinese tourists into the region, and so that's sort of what we're seeing.

What happens is we actually have less than 10% of common styles  that are represented in our presentations around the world.

We've been growing accessories consistently faster than the balance of the business, and it has been increasing as a penetration of the total company's revenue. I think there's a number of things that we're trying to do in the accessory space to try to drive that. Notably, during the past few months, we launched the Drawstring bag, as Jacki talked about, under the Ricky franchise in the luxury part of accessories business, which is off a very strong start. I think the other thing that we've been working on is developing and launching, as part of the Women's Polo business, a more significant accessories offering under the Women's Polo line, which we're very excited about and is coming in the not-too-distant future. And then I think we continue to be encouraged by the strong results we've seen in the Lauren accessories business.

Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign currency headwinds in the back half of the year. I'm pleased to report that our fourth q",1571,"Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign currency headwinds in the back half of the year. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter result exceeded our expectation driven by strong demand in North America Wholesale and global e-commerce. While we continue to experience the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and lower tourist traffic, our product across core and emerging categories was well received and we achieved strong sell-through in most regions.  Revenue growth of 7% in constant currency in the fourth quarter was ahead of our guidance. We delivered profits above expectations, driven by better top line performance and the attention to disciplined operational and expense management by our team.
Now let me turn to some highlights for the quarter. Our North America wholesale business was the standout performer in the fourth quarter and achieved record sales and profitability. Our 3 largest and most developed businesses, men's, women's and children's, were all up, which speaks to the appeal of our brand and product. Our design and merchandising teams continued to produce fresh, compelling assortments that resonate with both new and existing customers. In terms of product category highlights, our dress, accessories and footwear offerings and the Denim & Supply brand delivered strong growth in stores and online, driven by door expansion and positive consumer response to our unique voice.
We grew market share for the full year in a competitive retail environment, which we believe is due not only to our product, but also our steady investment in shop environments and marketing that express the distinction of our brands. Global e-commerce revenues grew in the high-teens for the fourth quarter, representing strong momentum for one of our most important areas of strategic focus.
Traffic to our website in all regions increased significantly, including a 48% increase in mobile traffic in North America. Additionally, enhanced site search functionality has led to higher conversion. We are on track with the design and architecture of our new e-commerce platform and are confident its capabilities will enable us to achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in this channel.
Another highlight in the quarter was our luxury business, where we saw strong performance in our men's and women's lines. We saw higher conversion rates in our retail stores and believe that they are the result of terrific product as well as a sharp focus on store level execution and new approaches to educating our sales associates. This offsets some of the challenging traffic trends due to a decline in global travel by the luxury tourist customer. We are also seeing the positive impact of our SKU reduction initiatives with sales up on 1/3 fewer SKUs in our women's business.
Speaking to our luxury product highlights in the quarter. The newest addition to our Ricky handbag portfolio, the Drawstring Ricky, is already enjoying nice success. The launch of this new silhouette supported by a strong advertising and marketing campaign garnered a great deal of editorial attention in the fashion press and on social media. And that has translated to an encouraging consumer response. 
Our new lightweight cashmere scarf collection was introduced in limited palette and was expanded to offer a spectacular assortment of bright colors for which Ralph Lauren's brand is so well-known. We remain committed to the growth of all of our accessory categories and expect to see their higher purchase frequency bring customers into the store and online more frequently.
Finally, we made the decision to merge our luxury lines in both men's and women's into a single label: Ralph Lauren Collection for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. We believe this will clarify our luxury message driving consistent global brand presentation and marketing synergies. Response to the change from our retail partners and sales associates has been extremely positive, and we are optimistic that this will not only drive strong sales performance, but will also reduce expenses by maximizing productivity and creating focused assortments. We expect to transition these businesses for the pre-spring 2016 season.
          Now I'd like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region. In the Americas, our largest region, revenues grew 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter. This was led by double-digit growth in our North America wholesale business and mid-teen growth in our U.S. e-commerce business. Retail sales continued to be impacted by lower tourist traffic due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Our European revenues rose 5% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and an increase in reorders. Our men's apparel business saw especially strong demand at wholesale. In our own retail stores, we continued to be impacted by lower tourist traffic, especially those coming from Russia and the Middle East, who have been most severely impacted by the volatility in both currency and commodity markets.
Generally speaking, we saw the best trends in Northern and in Central Europe where the negative impact of the terrorist -- while the negative impact of the terrorist attacks has continued to challenge France, and the Middle East is, of course, affected by lower oil prices and a decline in Russian tourists. 
In Asia, we achieved 1% constant currency revenue growth with trends varying by country. Korean sales remain challenging for the apparel sector, especially in department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Hong Kong store traffic remained pressured and South East Asia was soft due to travel concerns. In Greater China, double-digit constant currency revenue growth largely reflects the investment we've made in new distribution. Highlights in the region included strong sell-throughs on spring product and the continued positive response to Women's Polo.
I'd like to mention the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. This team has done an outstanding job navigating through the extended West Coast port situation and maintaining business continuity with limited incremental expense. This is a significant achievement given the breadth and scale of our product portfolio and distribution. During this time, the team also supported record wholesale shipment volume in the fourth quarter while continuing to manage expenses. I want to extend my thanks for their extraordinary work. 
          On our last call, I spoke about the next exciting endeavor for our iconic Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport. Beginning with the introduction of men's and boys lines for the Fall '15 season, the product will be available for pre-order on RalphLauren.com in June and available in our retail stores and wholesale partners around the world in August.
The latter timing coincides with the dedicated advertising campaign featuring distinctive imagery that will position Polo Sport as authentic, modern active wear. Across the globe, feedback on this product has been terrific and Polo Sport is seen as a perfect fit with the athletic spirit and sensibility that have always been an important element of the Polo brand. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate and both we and our wholesale partners believe this is a significant long-term market share opportunity.
Finally, I'd like to update you on our progress with the new global brand management structure we first spoke about on our last call. At that time, I spoke briefly about the factors and opportunities that led us to make the decision to shift from a more decentralized regional and channel structure to a centralized global brand management model. Today, I want to provide more detail.
Over the nearly 48 years since the company began, we have grown significantly, with the last dozen years realizing accelerated growth due to the acquisition of the majority of our product licenses and geographic territories. This gave us greater control of our brand, but led to tremendous organizational complexity.
Our new operating model and processes will allow us to fully leverage the power of each of our brands to ensure the greatest consistency of expression around the world and drive growth. We have always believed that our brands are our greatest assets, and that will now be reflected in the structure of the company. We are not changing who we are, we are changing how we work, and the opportunities associated with this transformation are very exciting.
As the first step in the transition to the new operating model, last month, we announced changes to our executive leadership, most notably, the promotion of Chris Peterson to President of Global Brands. We will continue to share updates on future calls and expect to drive significant operating and cost efficiencies that will help support the strong sales and profit growth we expect over the next 5 years. Chris will take you through the details of the financial impact of our actions around the reorganization to fiscal 2016 and beyond.
I'm very proud of our ability to focus on and invest in the company's long-term growth objectives while managing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards and most recently, engage in the discussion and analysis required to set our future structure up for great success. This speaks to the talent and the experience of our senior leaders, the dedication of our teams across every area, our rigorous attention to operational and expense management and of course, the desirability of our products and the power of our brands.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris."

Last month, we named Bob Chief Financial Officer of the company reporting to me. You'll all have a chance to meet Bob over the next several months, and I know he is looking forward to it. Now I'd like to turn to a brief recap of the quarter.
On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 7%, better than the mid-single-digit growth rate we guided to in February driven by strength in the wholesale segment and global e-commerce. Importantly, this growth was achieved on top of a 14% gain in the prior year period. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was 550 basis points, in line with our expectations. Every geographic region grew in constant currency during the quarter. On a reported basis, net revenues rose 1% to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year fiscal 2015 period, net revenues grew 4% in constant currency and 2% on a reported basis to $7.6 billion.
Gross profit margin of 55.4% in the fourth quarter was 80 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects and mix shift impacts. Operating margin of 10.1% in the fourth quarter was 190 basis points below the prior year, attributable to the negative impact of foreign exchange and incremental investments in the company's long-term growth initiatives. Operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of 250 to 300 basis point decrease. The outperformance was driven by better-than-expected revenues and disciplined expense management throughout the organization.
For the full year 2015 period, operating margin declined 160 basis points to 13.6%, due to investments we made to strengthen the company's infrastructure and global store network expansion initiatives, as well as negative foreign exchange impacts. Net income for the fourth quarter was $124 million or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, earnings per share was $1.69 for the fourth quarter, essentially in line with the $1.68 we reported in the prior year period. For the full year 2015, net income was $702 million or $7.88 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, EPS was $8.19 for fiscal 2015 compared to $8.43 in fiscal 2014. The effective tax rate of 28% in the fourth quarter was lower than expected due to onetime discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period. 
          Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, which was achieved on top of a 24% gain in the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $1 billion were 2% above the prior year period. North America posted double-digit increases and Europe grew mid-single digits in constant currency as we gained market share in both regions.
Growth was driven in part by accelerated demand for spring merchandise by our customers, as Easter was 2 weeks earlier than last year, and strong reorders in Europe. Wholesale operating margin of 30.7% in the fourth quarter was 60 basis points above the prior year period due to improved profitability of core operations, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts.
Retail sales rose 6% in constant currency to $841 million, more roughly in line with last year on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and high-teens growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were up 1% in constant currency and declined 4% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange impacts. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance that was somewhat offset by challenging traffic trends at brick-and-mortar stores, especially in markets where currency movements impacted tourist traffic.
By region, constant currency comps increased in the Americas and Europe, while Asia was slightly down. Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, 270 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting investments in new store development and lower profitability in core operations. Licensing revenue declined 5% and operating income was down 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to negative foreign currency effects and the anniversary of the launch of Polo Red fragrance in the prior year period
Consolidated inventory was $1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 2% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth and new store openings. We spent $391 million on capital expenditures during the year, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. The company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal 2015 at a cost of $500 million and returned an additional $158 million to shareholders via dividend payments. In total, the company returned approximately $658 million to shareholders during the year, which represents an almost 6% effective yield. 
          Yesterday, the company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $500 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $80 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $580 million. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Overall, we are pleased with the better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful foreign exchange and environmental headwinds. 
          Now I'd like to turn to fiscal 2016. We expect fiscal 2016 to be a year of significant transformation for the company. We will move to the new brand management organization structure, make important infrastructure investments, continue retail store development and take decisive action to mitigate foreign currency pressures. Let me take these each in turn.
As Jacki spoke about, we have made meaningful progress on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure. The most important aspect of this new operating model is that it brings together the formally disparate functions of design, merchandising, planning, creative and marketing to form dedicated brand groups. We are creating 6 global brand groups, each run by a brand President. These brand groups will define global design, merchandising and marketing strategies, and be accountable for the global financial performance of the business.
Brand and business strategies will be developed in concert with the leaders of the regions and channels, who understand the critical dynamics and nuances of these specialized areas. These brand groups will also rely on the strong knowledge and capabilities of our shared services teams. The new model, processes and single-view visibility to each brand will allow us to be more nimble and responsive to the marketplace and operate as a truly global business. This will enable us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operating and financial efficiencies. For example, the new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to better inventory turns, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings.
From a timing standpoint, it will take several months to transition to the new operating model. Overall, we are on track to achieve over $100 million of annual expense savings from this initiative. Only a modest amount of this will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring and other onetime related charges of approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization. 
          From a timing perspective, we expect these charges to be heavily weighted in the first half of the year. This charge encompasses 2 elements: First is the cost of separation associated with employee headcount reduction. We expect to reduce our full-time workforce by approximately 5%. The second element is the cost of store and shop repositioning related to providing more clarity across our different brand presentations, including the merging of our luxury labels. We are very excited about the move to the new structure as we believe it will create a platform for profitable growth by allowing us to both improve our global brand equities and drive operating efficiency over time.
Moving to store development. We plan to open approximately 40 to 50 directly operated stores in fiscal 2016 on a global basis. We expect that our new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal 2016 as our accelerated store opening pace is now in our base.
On infrastructure investments. Our e-commerce re-platform initiative will begin to ramp-up in fiscal 2016. This is a multiyear initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the online customer shopping experience. Our SAP implementation is substantially complete in North America, and we began SAP implementation for Europe this year. We expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the e-commerce re-platforming initiative.
Moving to foreign exchange. We have taken decisive actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. First, we are raising prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid- to high-single digit range and will be effective in the back half of the fiscal year. Second, our supply chain organization has negotiated lower costs across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material and oil prices, as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. These lower-costs will also become effective in the back half of the fiscal year. Finally, we will reduce operating costs by restructuring the organization. 
          
          With that as a backdrop, I'd like to review our detailed outlook for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year, similar to the view we shared with you in February. The growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we've invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new stores and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to new store development and continued momentum in e-commerce.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal 2016 revenue growth.
Moving on to operating income. On a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2016, which we intend to reinvest in our infrastructure build-out, primarily the new global e-commerce re-platforming and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis, we expect our full year fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 180 to 230 basis points below fiscal 2015's level, due entirely to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes restructuring and other onetime related charges associated with our global brand organization -- reorganization. 
We continue to expect the negative impact of FX on operating income to approximate $185 million, similar to what we projected in February based on current exchange rates. In terms of the sensitivity of our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a change of about $0.05 in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by approximately $20 million on a full year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be flat in constant currency, as retail segment growth is offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, which is impacted by our customers' receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the first quarter to be 600 basis points.
Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 600 to 650 basis points below the prior year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, the quarterly revenue growth profile and timing of expense savings initiatives. The first quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. 
          We are very excited about the company's potential for future growth. We are organizing the company to drive the power brands, investing in key infrastructure projects and making strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
With that, we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

And then, I guess, lastly, within that, as we think about all the changes going on at the company this year, I think you said a year of transformation, Chris, how should we -- how do we get comfortable with the kind of underlying organic revenue growth rate [ph] you have planned for mid-single digits this year, especially since comps have been a little bit sluggish in North America?"

So let's start on the reorganization. So I think we've provided a little bit more color. The 6 brand groups that we're talking about are one that's going to be focused on our luxury business, which will include the Ralph Lauren brand and the RRL brand, which Valérie Hermann will lead as the brand President. We will have a brand group focused on Polo. We'll have a brand group focused on Denim & Supply. We'll have a brand group focused on Lauren, Chaps and American Living as a group. We will have a brand group that's focused on the Ralph Lauren Home business. And finally, Club Monaco will be the sixth brand group. And that's how we're organizing the brand groups. Each of the brand groups will have a brand President and a dedicated leadership team to run the business. We believe that this is going to lead to a simplification, over time, of many of the sub-brands in terms of how we go-to-market from a consumer standpoint. Because we think that what this is going to allow us to do is focus our resources and our consumer communication more at the master brand level than at the sub-brands. The only sub-brand that we have announced that we're merging at this point is the -- on the luxury side of the business with the Black Label and the Purple Label and Women's collection and Black Label business."

From a systems perspective, let me provide a little bit more color on that as well. I think we feel very good about where we are from a systems standpoint, although there are still more work to do. The SAP implementation that we've done is now complete with regard to our global manufacturing and supply chain system and complete in the North America order to cash for wholesale. And what that has allowed us to do is have global visibility to our style count, our SKU count, and it's allowed us to get to a point where we now have global financial data by brand, which we've just been able to implement, which of course, is one of the key enablers to moving to the global brand structure. So I think there's more work to do as we move into the new model, but I feel good about where we are and where we're headed from a systems standpoint. And finally, from a transition timing standpoint, I think we expect to form the brand groups over the next month or 2. But of course, as we form the new brand groups, it will take them some time to come up to speed. And then the first seasons that they will begin to impact, because of our development cycle, will be probably 12 to 18 months from now."

First off, I guess the first question would be, if you just help me clarify the guidance a little bit. It looks like the revenue impact from FX improved by 100 basis points, but the implied operating margin dollars you talked about stayed the same. I think that leaves the underlying operating margin a little lower than what you mentioned in February and the Swiss dollar got a little better, I think. So maybe you could just tell us about what changed from the February update. And then a little bit longer term on -- fiscal '17 margins is a big focus for the stock recently, as we talk, you seem confident that fiscal '17 would be the year when the investment bucket that we've talked about with you for a while now, would start to lift off. And as you add in the organizational changes that you talked about today and sharpen your strategy around that, are you comfortable at this point talking to us about how you see the long-term margin trajectory beyond the guidance you gave us for '16 at this point?"

So the first question on the update on the FX impact to fiscal '16. I think, when we gave our guidance in February, it was before we had finalized our budgets and we had given an estimate in terms of the foreign exchange impact to the top line and bottom line. As we finalized our budgets, we also updated our exposure model. And so the change in the expected revenue impact from 550 basis points on the top line to 450, was really due to a sharpening of our exposure model. As we looked at the bottom line impact, the bottom line impact was in line with what we thought at the last time. So I think it was more a function of finalizing the budgets and updating the exposure model with regard to the change in the -- the slight change in the FX guidance for fiscal '16. On the second question in terms of what does it mean for fiscal '17? I think that there's going to be a couple of couple different things happening in fiscal '17, and it's premature to give guidance that far out. But obviously, we would expect to see a full year impact of the pricing action that we're taking, which would be a positive. We would expect to see a full year impact of the cost reductions that we're taking, which would be a positive. And we would expect to see a ramp-up of the restructuring savings, which would be a positive. And so all of those would lead to a better operating margin outlook in '17. On the negative side, we have hedged our FX exposure. And so as a those hedges roll off, we will have a year-on-year hedge FX hurt continuing into fiscal '17 from the portion of the business that was hedged in fiscal '16. Premature to talk about how those net against each other, but I think those are the underlying trends. And I think to your question about sort of the infrastructure investments being at the highest level, I do expect that fiscal '16 will likely be the highest level of investment on the infrastructure investments in total."

Too soon to tell how those pricing actions are going to play out because, obviously, it's going to depend on how competitors respond as well in these markets. But our view is that with the significant impact of foreign currency in these markets, all of the competitors that source products from similar countries should be seeing a similar transactional impact. And what we're trying to do is price for transactional foreign exchange, but not for translational foreign change. And that's how we came to the price increases that we're looking at here."

I think we felt like for the entire fiscal year, when you look at the fall season and the cruise holiday season and into the spring season, that we had plans that were growing market share in the U.S. wholesale business pretty consistently. And sometimes that growth in market share, which has us growing a couple of points faster than the U.S. wholesale industry, doesn't necessarily show up in terms of the shipment pattern because of the way the customer receipt plans fall within our fiscal quarters.

I think we talked about the wholesale business having very strong shipment growth. If you looked at the retail business though, the retail business on a constant currency basis also improved. And I think that the outlet channel in the U.S. comp improved versus what we were seeing previously, and that was both a function of traffic trends getting a little bit better than what we saw in the third quarter, as well as improvement in conversion rate that we drove during the quarter in the outlet channel. We also saw a continued very strong comp store growth in our e-commerce business that was in the high double digits. The one channel that was under a little bit of pressure during the quarter was the full-price retail stores, and that was really a function of the slowdown in international tourist traffic as we talked about primarily the Russian, Middle East and Brazilian consumers, which were impacted. But overall, an improvement in comp store sales trends in the Americas as well as in the wholesale shipment business."

And I think Central Europe, France and others have been a little bit more under pressure. The biggest impact in Europe that we've seen is the traffic drop from the Russian and Middle Eastern tourist. And really, the Russian tourist has dropped off more precipitously than the Middle Eastern tourist during that period. But we continue to see strong influx of Chinese tourists into the region, and so that's sort of what we're seeing.

Today, because of the SKU proliferation and the style proliferation that we have. What happens is we actually have less than 10% of common styles  that are represented in our presentations around the world. And what we want to do is have that closer to 60% to 70% so that the customer, which has a world view today between how they're traveling and where they're shopping and the online experience, we want that to be the same experience.

We've been growing accessories consistently faster than the balance of the business, and it has been increasing as a penetration of the total company's revenue. I think there's a number of things that we're trying to do in the accessory space to try to drive that. Notably, during the past few months, we launched the Drawstring bag, as Jacki talked about, under the Ricky franchise in the luxury part of accessories business, which is off to a very strong start. I think the other thing that we've been working on is developing and launching, as part of the Women's Polo business, a more significant accessories offering under the Women's Polo line, which we're very excited about and is coming in the not-too-distant future. And then I think we continue to be encouraged by the strong results we've seen in the Lauren accessories business.

Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign currency headwinds in the back half of the year.

Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign currency headwinds in the back half of the year. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter result exceeded our expectation driven by strong demand in North America Wholesale and global e-commerce. While we continue to experience the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and lower tourist traffic, our product across core and emerging categories was well received and we achieved strong sell-through in most regions.  Revenue growth of 7% in constant currency in the fourth quarter was ahead of our guidance. We delivered profits above expectations, driven by better top line performance and the attention to disciplined operational and expense management by our team.
Now let me turn to some highlights for the quarter. Our North America wholesale business was the standout performer in the fourth quarter and achieved record sales and profitability. Our 3 largest and most developed businesses, men's, women's and children's, were all up, which speaks to the appeal of our brand and product. Our design and merchandising teams continued to produce fresh, compelling assortments that resonate with both new and existing customers. In terms of product category highlights, our dress, accessories and footwear offerings and the Denim & Supply brand delivered strong growth in stores and online, driven by door expansion and positive consumer response to our unique voice.
We grew market share for the full year in a competitive retail environment, which we believe is due not only to our product, but also our steady investment in shop environments and marketing that express the distinction of our brands. Global e-commerce revenues grew in the high-teens for the fourth quarter, representing strong momentum for one of our most important areas of strategic focus.
Traffic to our website in all regions increased significantly, including a 48% increase in mobile traffic in North America. Additionally, enhanced site search functionality has led to higher conversion. We are on track with the design and architecture of our new e-commerce platform and are confident its capabilities will enable us to achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in this channel.
Another highlight in the quarter was our luxury business, where we saw strong performance in our men's and women's lines. We saw higher conversion rates in our retail stores and believe that they are the result of terrific product as well as a sharp focus on store level execution and new approaches to educating our sales associates. This offsets some of the challenging traffic trends due to a decline in global travel by the luxury tourist customer. We are also seeing the positive impact of our SKU reduction initiatives with sales up on 1/3 fewer SKUs in our women's business.
Speaking to our luxury product highlights in the quarter. The newest addition to our Ricky handbag portfolio, the Drawstring Ricky, is already enjoying nice success. The launch of this new silhouette supported by a strong advertising and marketing campaign garnered a great deal of editorial attention in the fashion press and on social media. And that has translated to an encouraging consumer response. 
Our new lightweight cashmere scarf collection was introduced in limited palette and was expanded to offer a spectacular assortment of bright colors for which Ralph Lauren's brand is so well-known. We remain committed to the growth of all of our accessory categories and expect to see their higher purchase frequency bring customers into the store and online more frequently.
Finally, we made the decision to merge our luxury lines in both men's and women's into a single label: Ralph Lauren Collection for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. We believe this will clarify our luxury message driving consistent global brand presentation and marketing synergies. Response to the change from our retail partners and sales associates has been extremely positive, and we are optimistic that this will not only drive strong sales performance, but will also reduce expenses by maximizing productivity and creating focused assortments. We expect to transition these businesses for the pre-spring 2016 season.
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region. In the Americas, our largest region, revenues grew 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter. This was led by double-digit growth in our North America wholesale business and mid-teen growth in our U.S. e-commerce business. Retail sales continued to be impacted by lower tourist traffic due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Our European revenues rose 5% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and an increase in reorders. Our men's apparel business saw especially strong demand at wholesale. In our own retail stores, we continued to be impacted by lower tourist traffic, especially those coming from Russia and the Middle East, who have been most severely impacted by the volatility in both currency and commodity markets.
Generally speaking, we saw the best trends in Northern and in Central Europe where the negative impact of the terrorist -- while the negative impact of the terrorist attacks has continued to challenge France, and the Middle East is, of course, affected by lower oil prices and a decline in Russian tourists. 
In Asia, we achieved 1% constant currency revenue growth with trends varying by country. Korean sales remain challenging for the apparel sector, especially in department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Hong Kong store traffic remained pressured and South East Asia was soft due to travel concerns. In Greater China, double-digit constant currency revenue growth largely reflects the investment we've made in new distribution. Highlights in the region included strong sell-throughs on spring product and the continued positive response to Women's Polo.
I'd like to mention the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. This team has done an outstanding job navigating through the extended West Coast port situation and maintaining business continuity with limited incremental expense. This is a significant achievement given the breadth and scale of our product portfolio and distribution. During this time, the team also supported record wholesale shipment volume in the fourth quarter while continuing to manage expenses. I want to extend my thanks for their extraordinary work. 
On our last call, I spoke about the next exciting endeavor for our iconic Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport. Beginning with the introduction of men's and boys’ lines for the Fall '15 season, the product will be available for pre-order on RalphLauren.com in June and available in our retail stores and wholesale partners around the world in August.
The latter timing coincides with the dedicated advertising campaign featuring distinctive imagery that will position Polo Sport as authentic, modern active wear. Across the globe, feedback on this product has been terrific and Polo Sport is seen as a perfect fit with the athletic spirit and sensibility that have always been an important element of the Polo brand. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate and both we and our wholesale partners believe this is a significant long-term market share opportunity.
Finally, I'd like to update you on our progress with the new global brand management structure we first spoke about on our last call. At that time, I spoke briefly about the factors and opportunities that led us to make the decision to shift from a more decentralized regional and channel structure to a centralized global brand management model. Today, I want to provide more detail.
Over the nearly 48 years since the company began, we have grown significantly, with the last dozen years realizing accelerated growth due to the acquisition of the majority of our product licenses and geographic territories. This gave us greater control of our brand, but led to tremendous organizational complexity.
Our new operating model and processes will allow us to fully leverage the power of each of our brands to ensure the greatest consistency of expression around the world and drive growth. We have always believed that our brands are our greatest assets, and that will now be reflected in the structure of the company. We are not changing who we are, we are changing how we work, and the opportunities associated with this transformation are very exciting.
As the first step in the transition to the new operating model, last month, we announced changes to our executive leadership, most notably, the promotion of Chris Peterson to President of Global Brands. We will continue to share updates on future calls and expect to drive significant operating and cost efficiencies that will help support the strong sales and profit growth we expect over the next 5 years. Chris will take you through the details of the financial impact of our actions around the reorganization to fiscal 2016 and beyond.
I'm very proud of our ability to focus on and invest in the company's long-term growth objectives while managing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards and most recently, engage in the discussion and analysis required to set our future structure up for great success. This speaks to the talent and the experience of our senior leaders, the dedication of our teams across every area, our rigorous attention to operational and expense management and of course, the desirability of our products and the power of our brands.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris."

Last month, we named Bob Chief Financial Officer of the company reporting to me. You'll all have a chance to meet Bob over the next several months, and I know he is looking forward to it. Now I'd like to turn to a brief recap of the quarter.
On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 7%, better than the mid-single-digit growth rate we guided to in February driven by strength in the wholesale segment and global e-commerce. Importantly, this growth was achieved on top of a 14% gain in the prior year period. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was 550 basis points, in line with our expectations. Every geographic region grew in constant currency during the quarter. On a reported basis, net revenues rose 1% to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year fiscal 2015 period, net revenues grew 4% in constant currency and 2% on a reported basis to $7.6 billion.
Gross profit margin of 55.4% in the fourth quarter was 80 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects and mix shift impacts. Operating margin of 10.1% in the fourth quarter was 190 basis points below the prior year, attributable to the negative impact of foreign exchange and incremental investments in the company's long-term growth initiatives. Operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of 250 to 300 basis point decrease. The outperformance was driven by better-than-expected revenues and disciplined expense management throughout the organization.
For the full year 2015 period, operating margin declined 160 basis points to 13.6%, due to investments we made to strengthen the company's infrastructure and global store network expansion initiatives, as well as negative foreign exchange impacts. Net income for the fourth quarter was $124 million or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, earnings per share was $1.69 for the fourth quarter, essentially in line with the $1.68 we reported in the prior year period. For the full year 2015, net income was $702 million or $7.88 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, EPS was $8.19 for fiscal 2015 compared to $8.43 in fiscal 2014. The effective tax rate of 28% in the fourth quarter was lower than expected due to onetime discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period. 
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, which was achieved on top of a 24% gain in the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $1 billion were 2% above the prior year period. North America posted double-digit increases and Europe grew mid-single digits in constant currency as we gained market share in both regions.
Growth was driven in part by accelerated demand for spring merchandise by our customers, as Easter was 2 weeks earlier than last year, and strong reorders in Europe. Wholesale operating margin of 30.7% in the fourth quarter was 60 basis points above the prior year period due to improved profitability of core operations, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts.
Retail sales rose 6% in constant currency to $841 million, more roughly in line with last year on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and high-teens growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were up 1% in constant currency and declined 4% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange impacts. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance that was somewhat offset by challenging traffic trends at brick-and-mortar stores, especially in markets where currency movements impacted tourist traffic.
By region, constant currency comps increased in the Americas and Europe, while Asia was slightly down. Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, 270 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting investments in new store development and lower profitability in core operations. Licensing revenue declined 5% and operating income was down 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to negative foreign currency effects and the anniversary of the launch of Polo Red fragrance in the prior year period
Consolidated inventory was $1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 2% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth and new store openings. We spent $391 million on capital expenditures during the year, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. The company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal 2015 at a cost of $500 million and returned an additional $158 million to shareholders via dividend payments. In total, the company returned approximately $658 million to shareholders during the year, which represents an almost 6% effective yield. 
Yesterday, the company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $500 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $80 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $580 million. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Overall, we are pleased with the better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful foreign exchange and environmental headwinds. 
Now I'd like to turn to fiscal 2016. We expect fiscal 2016 to be a year of significant transformation for the company. We will move to the new brand management organization structure, make important infrastructure investments, continue retail store development and take decisive action to mitigate foreign currency pressures. Let me take these each in turn.
As Jacki spoke about, we have made meaningful progress on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure. The most important aspect of this new operating model is that it brings together the formally disparate functions of design, merchandising, planning, creative and marketing to form dedicated brand groups. We are creating 6 global brand groups, each run by a brand President. These brand groups will define global design, merchandising and marketing strategies, and be accountable for the global financial performance of the business.
Brand and business strategies will be developed in concert with the leaders of the regions and channels, who understand the critical dynamics and nuances of these specialized areas. These brand groups will also rely on the strong knowledge and capabilities of our shared services teams. The new model, processes and single-view visibility to each brand will allow us to be more nimble and responsive to the marketplace and operate as a truly global business. This will enable us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operating and financial efficiencies. For example, the new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to better inventory turns, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings.
From a timing standpoint, it will take several months to transition to the new operating model. Overall, we are on track to achieve over $100 million of annual expense savings from this initiative. Only a modest amount of this will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring and other onetime related charges of approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization. 
From a timing perspective, we expect these charges to be heavily weighted in the first half of the year. This charge encompasses 2 elements: First is the cost of separation associated with employee headcount reduction. We expect to reduce our full-time workforce by approximately 5%. The second element is the cost of store and shop repositioning related to providing more clarity across our different brand presentations, including the merging of our luxury labels. We are very excited about the move to the new structure as we believe it will create a platform for profitable growth by allowing us to both improve our global brand equities and drive operating efficiency over time.
Moving to store development. We plan to open approximately 40 to 50 directly operated stores in fiscal 2016 on a global basis. We expect that our new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal 2016 as our accelerated store opening pace is now in our base.
On infrastructure investments. Our e-commerce re-platform initiative will begin to ramp-up in fiscal 2016. This is a multiyear initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the online customer shopping experience. Our SAP implementation is substantially complete in North America, and we began SAP implementation for Europe this year. We expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the e-commerce re-platforming initiative.
Moving to foreign exchange. We have taken decisive actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. First, we are raising prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid- to high-single digit range and will be effective in the back half of the fiscal year. Second, our supply chain organization has negotiated lower costs across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material and oil prices, as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. These lower-costs will also become effective in the back half of the fiscal year. Finally, we will reduce operating costs by restructuring the organization. 
With that as a backdrop, I'd like to review our detailed outlook for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year, similar to the view we shared with you in February. The growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we've invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new stores and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to new store development and continued momentum in e-commerce.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal 2016 revenue growth.
Moving on to operating income. On a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2016, which we intend to reinvest in our infrastructure build-out, primarily the new global e-commerce re-platforming and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis, we expect our full year fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 180 to 230 basis points below fiscal 2015's level, due entirely to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes restructuring and other onetime related charges associated with our global brand organization -- reorganization. 
We continue to expect the negative impact of FX on operating income to approximate $185 million, similar to what we projected in February based on current exchange rates. In terms of the sensitivity of our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a change of about $0.05 in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by approximately $20 million on a full year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be flat in constant currency, as retail segment growth is offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, which is impacted by our customers' receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the first quarter to be 600 basis points.
Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 600 to 650 basis points below the prior year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, the quarterly revenue growth profile and timing of expense savings initiatives. The first quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. 
We are very excited about the company's potential for future growth. We are organizing the company to drive the power brands, investing in key infrastructure projects and making strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
With that, we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

And then, I guess, lastly, within that, as we think about all the changes going on at the company this year, I think you said a year of transformation, Chris, how should we -- how do we get comfortable with the kind of underlying organic revenue growth rate [ph] you have planned for mid-single digits this year, especially since comps have been a little bit sluggish in North America?"

The 6 brand groups that we're talking about are one that's going to be focused on our luxury business, which will include the Ralph Lauren brand and the RRL brand, which Valérie Hermann will lead as the brand President. We will have a brand group focused on Polo. We'll have a brand group focused on Denim & Supply. We'll have a brand group focused on Lauren, Chaps and American Living as a group. We will have a brand group that's focused on the Ralph Lauren Home business. And finally, Club Monaco will be the sixth brand group. And that's how we're organizing the brand groups. Each of the brand groups will have a brand President and a dedicated leadership team to run the business. We believe that this is going to lead to a simplification, over time, of many of the sub-brands in terms of how we go-to-market from a consumer standpoint. Because we think that what this is going to allow us to do is focus our resources and our consumer communication more at the master brand level than at the sub-brands. The only sub-brand that we have announced that we're merging at this point is the -- on the luxury side of the business with the Black Label and the Purple Label and Women's collection and Black Label business."

From a systems perspective, let me provide a little bit more color on that as well. I think we feel very good about where we are from a systems standpoint, although there are still more work to do. The SAP implementation that we've done is now complete with regard to our global manufacturing and supply chain system and complete in the North America order to cash for wholesale. And what that has allowed us to do is have global visibility to our style count, our SKU count, and it's allowed us to get to a point where we now have global financial data by brand, which we've just been able to implement, which of course, is one of the key enablers to moving to the global brand structure. So I think there's more work to do as we move into the new model, but I feel good about where we are and where we're headed from a systems standpoint. And finally, from a transition timing standpoint, I think we expect to form the brand groups over the next month or 2. But of course, as we form the new brand groups, it will take them some time to come up to speed. And then the first seasons that they will begin to impact, because of our development cycle, will be probably 12 to 18 months from now."

First off, I guess the first question would be, if you just help me clarify the guidance a little bit. It looks like the revenue impact from FX improved by 100 basis points, but the implied operating margin dollars you talked about stayed the same. I think that leaves the underlying operating margin a little lower than what you mentioned in February and the Swiss dollar got a little better, I think. So maybe you could just tell us about what changed from the February update. And then a little bit longer term on -- fiscal '17 margins is a big focus for the stock recently, as we talk, you seem confident that fiscal '17 would be the year when the investment bucket that we've talked about with you for a while now, would start to lift off. And as you add in the organizational changes that you talked about today and sharpen your strategy around that, are you comfortable at this point talking to us about how you see the long-term margin trajectory beyond the guidance you gave us for '16 at this point?"

So the first question on the update on the FX impact to fiscal '16. I think, when we gave our guidance in February, it was before we had finalized our budgets and we had given an estimate in terms of the foreign exchange impact to the top line and bottom line. As we finalized our budgets, we also updated our exposure model. And so the change in the expected revenue impact from 550 basis points on the top line to 450, was really due to a sharpening of our exposure model. As we looked at the bottom line impact, the bottom line impact was in line with what we thought at the last time. So I think it was more a function of finalizing the budgets and updating the exposure model with regard to the change in the -- the slight change in the FX guidance for fiscal '16. On the second question in terms of what does it mean for fiscal '17? I think that there's going to be a couple of couple different things happening in fiscal '17, and it's premature to give guidance that far out. But obviously, we would expect to see a full year impact of the pricing action that we're taking, which would be a positive. We would expect to see a full year impact of the cost reductions that we're taking, which would be a positive. And we would expect to see a ramp-up of the restructuring savings, which would be a positive. And so all of those would lead to a better operating margin outlook in '17. On the negative side, we have hedged our FX exposure. And so as a those hedges roll off, we will have a year-on-year hedge FX hurt continuing into fiscal '17 from the portion of the business that was hedged in fiscal '16. Premature to talk about how those net against each other, but I think those are the underlying trends. And I think to your question about sort of the infrastructure investments being at the highest level, I do expect that fiscal '16 will likely be the highest level of investment on the infrastructure investments in total."

And because of that, sometimes our seasonal flow of inventory from a shipment standpoint isn't really indicative of the underlying trend. I think we felt like for the entire fiscal year, when you look at the fall season and the cruise holiday season and into the spring season, that we had plans that were growing market share in the U.S. wholesale business pretty consistently. And sometimes that growth in market share, which has us growing a couple of points faster than the U.S. wholesale industry, doesn't necessarily show up in terms of the shipment pattern because of the way the customer receipt plans fall within our fiscal quarters.

And then, of course, we're about to launch our new Polo Sport business, where there's tremendous enthusiasm about that opportunity because that really puts us solidly into a new area of opportunity.

We also saw a continued very strong comp store growth in our e-commerce business that was in the high double digits.

We continue to drive mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth trends, both in the wholesale business and in the retail business during the quarter. I think we continue to see the trends being the strongest in Northern Europe, both the U.K. and Scandinavia. We see Southern Europe importantly stabilizing and beginning to get back to a period where we think we can grow from. And I think Central Europe, France and others have been a little bit more under pressure. The biggest impact in Europe that we've seen is the traffic drop from the Russian and Middle Eastern tourist. And really, the Russian tourist has dropped off more precipitously than the Middle Eastern tourist during that period. But we continue to see strong influx of Chinese tourists into the region, and so that's sort of what we're seeing. I think, given our penetration in Europe, we continue to believe that Europe will be a growth market for us for some time to come."

So accessories remains an area that we expect to grow faster than the balance of the business. We've been growing accessories consistently faster than the balance of the business, and it has been increasing as a penetration of the total company's revenue. I think there's a number of things that we're trying to do in the accessory space to try to drive that. Notably, during the past few months, we launched the Drawstring bag, as Jacki talked about, under the Ricky franchise in the luxury part of accessories business, which is off to a very strong start. I think the other thing that we've been working on is developing and launching, as part of the Women's Polo business, a more significant accessories offering under the Women's Polo line, which we're very excited about and is coming in the not-too-distant future. And then I think we continue to be encouraged by the strong results we've seen in the Lauren accessories business. And so I think we've got a multitiered strategy to go after the accessories business that I think we're confident will allow us to grow that business at an accelerated pace for the foreseeable future.

In the first quarter of our new fiscal year, we delivered revenues in line with our guidance and profits that were better than our expectations. This was driven by the company's attention to careful discipline",1514,"Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of our new fiscal year, we delivered revenues in line with our guidance and profits that were better than our expectations. This was driven by the company's attention to careful disciplined operational and expense management. We are pleased with these results in the context of the environment in which we operate, and we are on track to deliver our plan for the fiscal year. We see the year developing as one of steady quarter-by-quarter improvement. 
Looking at the first half, we are negatively impacted by the Easter calendar, significant foreign exchange pressure and our infrastructure investments. In the second half, we expect to see both sales and profits improvement, due to the launch of Polo Sport and the opening of our new stores, the impact of the product cost savings and pricing actions and the benefit of our restructuring activities. In addition, the foreign exchange pressure will lessen as the year progresses. 
Now let me turn to the quarter. There are several factors impacting our results. First, the shift in global tourist traffic patterns around the world; second, but related to the first point, the changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the increasingly promotional U.S. Retail environment.
We are taking a decisive action to most effectively operate in this changing environment. We always take a long-term view to protect both our brands and our profitability. While our infrastructure investments have pressured our operating margin in the short term, we believe these are the right investments that will pay off in the future.
Let me give you more texture on each of these topics. In the first quarter, the impact of currency movements on global tourism was especially pronounced. We saw significant increases in traffic in Europe and Japan and a decline in the U.S. We see that the customers more stoop than ever and adjust travel and purchasing plans to make the smartest spending decisions. Our business was up double digits in Europe and Japan, where the local currencies have weakened and tourism has increased. 
In Japan, an increasing traffic from Chinese tourists and more domestic consumption from the Japanese as they traveled less overseas due to their weaker currency drove the business.
We also have a specific merchandising and marketing initiatives implemented by our teams that were quite successful. 
Europe experienced similar strengths as tourist traffic increased with the weaker euro, and demand was especially strong in wholesale.
In the U.S., the impact was disproportionate for us as our distributions skewed to the largest cities that have experienced the most significant slowdowns in traffic and spending from the foreign tourists. Roughly half of our U.S. Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores are in major gateway cities such as New York, Miami and San Francisco. Many of our largest points of wholesale distributions are also in major gateway cities. And finally, our factory outlet presence is heavily skewed to centers that tend to attract more foreign tourists.
In the balance of our distribution across the rest of the country, our performance has been on or above plan, which tells us that the strength of our brands and appeal of our products remain high. 
Now let me turn to the retail environment in the U.S. The industry saw a late start to the spring season due to issues related to the Westport -- West Coast port delays and an unseasonably cold weather pattern as well as the lower tourist traffic I spoke about earlier. These conditions created an excess of inventory and, therefore, more promotional environment in North America. We made the decision to be less promotional than the landscape, because we believe it's critical to protect our brand.
Looking at comp growth across some of our largest customers. We are in line or better than their stores' average performance. 
For our Retail business, we have revenue was up 3% in constant currency in the first quarter. Global same-store sales were down 2%, due to a slowdown in e-commerce. E-commerce revenue was up 2%, which was a softer than prior quarters. As I referenced earlier, the environment in North America was highly promotional in the quarter, and this was more pronounced online. And again, we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape and achieved a higher average unit retail over the prior year period as a result. While we knew this decision could slow our revenue growth, we believed it was the right thing to do for our brand. We have seen a pickup in sales at the beginning of the second quarter. However, we remain cautious as most of the quarter remains ahead of us.
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on international sales trends. As I mentioned, Europe had a strong quarter, with revenue up 10% in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong, with robust sellthroughs and reorders, and all brands across the portfolio are performing well. By region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best.
In Asia, revenue was up 9% in constant currency. Japan, which is our largest business in Asia, had a strong quarter, with double-digit revenue growth in constant currency, driven by successful merchandising and marketing initiatives as well as the increase in traffic from Chinese tourists that I previously mentioned.
In Korea, we experienced a strong trend until the MERS outbreak in June, which negatively impacted traffic. China was a strong once again with double-digit comp growth. Hong Kong and Macau traffic remained pressured, but we saw improvement in our conversion rate.
We continued to see strong performance of Women's Polo and the expansion of the Lauren brand through new distribution in Japan and Korea, which represents an additional opportunity for growth.
Turning to some of the product highlights. Let me begin with luxury. I spoke on our last call about the merging of our luxury labels to create a singular Ralph Lauren Collection label for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. I'm delighted to report that this is on track for the spring 2016 season, with positive feedback from both the retail and editorial communities, who immediately understood the clarity of our offering.
For the first time in many years, Ralph Lauren participated in Milan's Men's Fashion Week, with an elegant and exclusive presentation of the spring 2016 Purple Label collection. This took place at the Ralph Lauren palazzo in the heart of Milan that beautifully represents the aesthetic and sensibility of Ralph Lauren luxury. 
Within the accessories part of the luxury business, we are continuing to expand the signature Ricky handbag line with the newest style, the Drawstring Ricky that was featured in our most recent advertising campaign. We will continue to grow our luxury accessories assortment and broaden the price tearing of our product offering.
Turning to the Polo brand. We unveiled our new Polo Sport line in mid-June on RalphLauren.com in the U.S. and have seen strong interest through our pre-order capability. Starting with men's and boys' products, this performance-oriented collection not only brings forward an important aspect of the Polo heritage in D&A, but also speaks to the performance-inspired active trend. Polo Sport will be available in our own stores and select department stores worldwide later this month and will be introduced at Dick's Sporting Goods in late fall.
Our Polo texture, which combines the aesthetic of Polo Sport and industry-leading advancements in wearable technology, will also be available for purchase later this month. This high-performance shirt it will be supported by an interactive Polo tech app that will feature exclusive video content that allows the wearer to optimize training performance.
We presented our spring 2016 collections for Polo Sport square Polo Clothing and Polo Sport as part of the first-ever New York Men's Fashion Week last month, and the reception across the board was very strong, with a tremendous amount of favorable commentary on the evolution of the brand.
Turning to the women's component of our Polo brand. As we entered the second year, we will be broadening the product line to address additional dimensions of our customers' lifestyle. Denim & Supply continues to see strong growth in both men's and women's. Both Polo for Women and Denim & Supply feature product that spoke to some of the season's biggest trends, such as bohemian look and French details, which are core to our DNA.
And across all brands, we had a terrific consumer response to our denim offerings. Our dress business, Lauren footwear and Lauren accessories are also performing well. In our license businesses, men's Polo furnishings, Lord & Taylor clothing and Home continue to grow and gain market share in the department store channel.
We remain focused on managing the business and the brand for the long term. We continue to be disciplined about expense management, especially given the challenging macro operating environment in order to allow us to thoughtfully invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
I would like to recognize the talent, experience and dedication of our senior leaders and their teams. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

This is in line with the gu",757,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with a brief recap of the quarter.
On a constant currency basis, revenues were in line with the prior year, driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally. This is in line with the guidance we provided in May. Negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, which is slightly better than we anticipated, as the euro performed slightly better against the U.S. dollar. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 5% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter.
Gross profit margin was 59.8% in the first quarter, excluding restructuring-related noncash charges of $3 million. This was 120 basis points below the prior year period. Decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating margin in the first quarter was 8.8%, excluding restructuring and related noncash charges. This was 550 basis points below the prior year, however, better than the outlook we provided in May of 600 to 650 basis point decrease. The operating margin came in better than our guidance, due to disciplined operational management across the organization.
The lower operating margin was attributable to the timing of revenue receipts in our wholesale business, incremental investments in infrastructure and negative foreign currency effects. Net income for the first quarter was $99 million or $1.09 per diluted share, excluded restructuring and related noncash charges. On a reported basis, net income was $64 million or $0.73 per diluted share.
The effective tax rate of 30% in the first quarter on an adjusted basis was in line with our guidance and compared to an effective tax rate of 31% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues declined 6% in constant currency during the first quarter. Wholesale revenue was negatively impacted by our customers' receipt plans to an earlier Easter this year, which was partially offset by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe. 
Combining 2 quarters, let's take a more holistical view of the spring/summer season, global wholesale revenues were up approximately 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $642 million were 9% below the prior year period.
Wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 21.8%, excluding restructuring-related noncash charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior year period, due to the change in customer receipt plans.
Retail sales increased 3% in constant currency to $935 million. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and e-commerce expansion. Comparable store sales declined 2% in constant currency and declined 8% on a reported basis. 
In Europe and Asia, same-store sales growth was positive, with particular strength in Japan and China. In North America, the strong U.S. dollar pressured towards traffic in the overall retail environment.
As Jacki mentioned, comps in brick-and-mortar stores were similar to last quarter in the range of down 2% to 3%. However, e-commerce growth was softer than prior quarters at up 2%.
Again, the online environment in North America became highly promotional in the quarter, and we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape. We achieved a higher average unit retail and higher average order value over the prior period as a result.
Excluding restructuring-related noncash charges, retail operating margin in the first quarter was 12.6%, which was 490 points below the prior year period, reflecting fixed expense to leverage and negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 6% in constant currency during the first quarter, and licensing operating income was in line with the prior year period.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support new store openings, the launch of Polo Sport and increased shipments of Polo Women's as well as a change in the timing of receipt plans. In addition, we spent $68 million on capital expenditures compared to $85 million in the prior year period.
The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter at a cost of $150 million. And at the end of the first quarter, approximately $430 million remained available for future share repurchases.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet.
Overall, we're pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to give you an update on our global brand reorganization effort and guidance for fiscal 2016."

I'm excited to share an update on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure we spoke about on our last call, as we have made significant progress. In the last 90 days, we established",1149,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share an update on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure we spoke about on our last call, as we have made significant progress. In the last 90 days, we established 6 global brand groups, and I'm pleased to report that we have filled all of the global brand president roles. These presidents reflect an equal balance of Ralph Lauren veterans with significant experience inside our organization and outside talent with critical category expertise.
In addition to the 6 brand presidents, we have also begun to identify the design, merchandising, marketing and finance leads for their respective teams and are pleased with the way these groups are forming.
A key element of our new operating model is the introduction of a global line planning process. This is the end-to-end process by which we design, merchandise and plan our assortments. We have kicked it off in our Polo Men's business as a pilot for the fall 2016 season. We will use learnings from this pilot to inform its rollout across the other brands in spring 2017 and beyond. We expect this new process to improve brand equity and revenue growth by creating better assortments and more consistent brand messaging and drive operating efficiencies at the same time.
New organization structure and its accompanying processes will lead to a significant reduction in SKUs as well as sample and design costs, which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins and meaningful SG&A cost savings. We expect to see the benefits from the global line planning process in the next 18 to 24 months as it rolls out across the portfolio.
We also implemented the headcount reduction that we spoke about on our last call. These were difficult-but-necessary decisions, and we are on track to realize the $100 million in annual expense savings we spoke about previously, driven by the move to the new organizational model. Only a modest amount of the benefits will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring and other onetime-related charges for approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization, and we've recognized $45 million of this expected charge in the first quarter.
This charge encompasses the cost of separation associated with our workforce reduction as well as the cost of store and shop adjustments to provide greater clarity of brand presentation. We are very encouraged by the early stages of our transition and pleased to report that it has gone smoothly. We now field even more confident that it will allow us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operational and financial efficiencies.
Before I turn to guidance for fiscal '16, I wanted to give an update on some of our key initiatives around new store development, infrastructure investments and our efforts to mitigate foreign exchange impacts. 
In the first quarter, we opened 6 directly operated and 15 license stores around the world. We are on track to open 40 to 50 stores, directly operated stores in fiscal '16. We continue to expect that these new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal '16, as the accelerated store opening pace is now in our base.
Regarding Infrastructure Investments. Our e-commerce re-platform is on schedule and ramping up as planned. This is a multi-year initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the customers' shopping experience. Our SAP implementation in Europe is also on track. We continue to expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the critical e-commerce re-platforming investment.
Moving to foreign exchange. Let me give you an update on our previously announced actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. We have raised prices for crews and spring seasons in those markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid- to high single-digit range. Our retail partners have been very receptive to the price increases, and we believe our competitors are implementing pricing actions as well.
We expect to see the benefits on our income statement in the back half of the fiscal year. In addition, we continue to expect lower product cost in the back half of the fiscal year from lower raw material and oil prices. 
With that as backdrop, I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. We are maintaining our outlook for the fiscal year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year. This will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we have invested over the last several years. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale. And based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal '16 revenue growth.
Moving to operating income. On a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal '16, intend to reinvest this improvement in our infrastructure build-out, primarily the new global e-commerce platform and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year '16 operating margin to be approximately 180 to 230 basis points below fiscal '15's level, due to the unfavorable currency impact.
This guidance excludes restructuring and other onetime-related charges associated with our global brand reorganizations.
In terms of the sensitivity on our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a charge of -- a change of about a nickel in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by about $20 million on a full year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%.
We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal '16 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. For the second quarter of fiscal '16, we expected net revenues to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the second quarter to be 550 basis points. Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 275 to 325 basis points below the prior year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, infrastructure investments and timing of expense savings initiatives. The second quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%.
We are confident in the company's potential for future growth.

So let me start with sort of the comp trends. It was really a mixed environment that we were operating in around the world, with a lot of different factors. So I would start by saying that about 20% of our sales are driven by foreign tourists global",407,"Sure. So let me start with sort of the comp trends. It was really a mixed environment that we were operating in around the world, with a lot of different factors. So I would start by saying that about 20% of our sales are driven by foreign tourists globally in our retail stores. And you correctly mentioned that if you look at the International business, our retail comps were positive. So we were up internationally in our retail comps, both in Europe and in Asia. Part of that was driven by strong acceptance of the product. Part of that was driven by increased traffic flows from foreign tourists, particularly in Japan and Europe. In the U.S., business was under a little bit more pressure, and that was largely driven by the foreign tourists trend. And so I think that's been one of the biggest drivers as we spoke about previously. With regard to the e-commerce impact, it was a little bit of a different dynamic. So in the e-commerce comps, we saw strong double-digit growth in e-commerce comps in the International business, where we continued to operate in a somewhat less promotional environment. In the U.S., as we saw the promotional environment escalating, we chose to stay focused on driving full price sell-through and increasing the brand equity, and so we chose not to go down the promotional game. And we saw, as a result of that, that our average unit retails were up versus a year ago. Our average transaction size was up versus a year ago, but we did see a slowdown in the revenue growth as a result. And that's really what held back the overall e-commerce comp growth in the quarter, but we think it was the right move from a long-term perspective in terms of protecting the brand equity. The Polo Fifth Avenue store, I think we continue to be very encouraged about the Polo Fifth Avenue store in terms of what the job that it's doing at showcasing the brand aesthetic and brand sensibility. We're continuing to learn in that store based on the consumer response, and we're continuing to adjust the product assortment to, not only showcase the direction that the brand is moving with new product, but also getting the product assortments right for the consumer that's walking into the store. So I think we continue to feel very good about where we are with that store. Thank you."

There's the restructuring savings if you could comment on how much of that you think would flow through to margin because it follow with that, that will be obviously very impactful to the earnings and maybe help us context that.

So I guess, I think you've got the 3 big elements that you mentioned in the question. But maybe I'll start with FX. So for FX, I think we said on the last call that we expected FX to be a hurt of about $185 million to operating income this year, which effectively accounts for most of the, or if not all of the margin decline in operating margin this year. If you look at that FX impact this year, about half of that is translational and half of that is transactional. The translational impact of currency rates stay where they are today. We would not have a continuing into next fiscal year, because we would have fully anniversary-ed it by the time we get to next fiscal year. We do expect if FX rates stay where they are today that we will have a lagging transactional hurt from FX that goes into next year, but we expect the magnitude of that transactional hurt to be slightly smaller than the transactional hurt that we're experiencing this year, because of the timing of when our hedges roll off. On the infrastructure investments piece of that, I expect that the e-commerce re-platforming investment is likely to ramp up this year versus this year as we get closer to a presentation, and so we're expecting to be spending more money on the e-commerce re-platforming project next year. But on the SAP project, we expect that investment to ramp down year-over-year. And so when you look at the infrastructure investments in total, too soon to say exactly how we net out, but probably will be in a similar place in fiscal '17 in total when you look at the 2 projects together is where we are this year. And then, let's see, the third part of the question was on restructuring. And on restructuring savings, I think we've said that we expect to have a portion of the savings this year and a much more significant portion of the savings next year. So I do expect restructuring savings to be a help to operating margin next year in a meaningful way. But obviously, how that nets out against the currency impact I think it's still premature for us to say."

So if you look at the wholesale business between Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, you put those 2 together, the wholesale business globally would have been up 2% in constant currency. And if you look at the wholesale business just in Q1, without the Easter shift, the wholesale business would have been up marginally even in the first quarter on a stand-alone basis without that Easter shift impact. The Easter shift really accounted for the -- all of the margin compression effectively in the wholesale business. So we don't think that there's an underlying trend issue with regard to margin compression in wholesale that we're seeing. If you look back to your -- the first quarter question, which is around the retail comp trend, I think the margin compression that we're seeing this year is really a function of foreign exchange more than a function of retail comps. And so I don't think we've got an issue that we're relying on significant retail comp growth in order to drive operating leverage going forward. I think we believe we can drive operating leverage going forward even in a environment of relatively muted retail comp growth. That being said, we're not -- we're shooting to try to improve our retail comp figures going forward, and we think that the global brand structure is going to play a key role in that process."

Starting off with items like our cable cashmere sweater in the spring season, we do a cotton version. Those categories have performed extremely well. We have a great Polo shirt business that is consistent and strong in women's. We do similar to men's and expanded woven shirt business that we are really known for. And that Chris shirt, whether it's a white shirt or multiple stripes and checks and so forth, also are as valuable in women's to us as they are in men's. And then, of course, we have key bottoms. It's not the chino pants, but for us, the DNA is around our offer, which continues to perform extremely well as well as our cargo pants, another key thing that we are known for that have been extremely important and powerful as key bottoms statement. So while the women's business is driven certainly by fashion, we're able to augment that with these key strategies, our signature blazer also is part of that core strategy. So in women's, it's more of a balance, but we have multiple Staples that travels through our Polo women's business that is important to us."

In the first quarter of our new fiscal year, we delivered revenues in line with our guidance and profits that were better than our expectations. This was driven by the company's attention to careful, disciplined operational and expense management. We are pleased with these results in the context of the environment in which we operate, and we are on track to deliver our plan for the fiscal year. We see the year developing as one of steady quarter-by-quarter improvement. 
Looking at the first half, we are negatively impacted by the Easter calendar, significant foreign exchange pressure and our infrastructure investments. In the second half, we expect to see both sales and profit improvement due to the launch of Polo Sport and the opening of our new stores, the impact of product cost savings and pricing actions, and the benefit of our restructuring activities. In addition, the foreign exchange pressure will lessen as the year progresses. 
Now let me turn to the quarter. There are several factors impacting our results. First, the shift in global tourist traffic patterns around the world; second, but related to the first point, the changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the increasingly promotional U.S. Retail environment.
We are taking decisive actions to most effectively operate in this changing environment. We always take a long-term view to protect both our brands and our profitability. While our infrastructure investments have pressured our operating margin in the short term, we believe these are the right investments that will pay off in the future.  Let me give you more texture on each of these topics. 
In the first quarter, the impact of currency movements on global tourism was especially pronounced. We saw significant increases in traffic in Europe and Japan and a decline in the U.S. We see that the customers more astute than ever and adjust travel and purchasing plans to make the smartest spending decisions. Our business was up double digits in Europe and Japan, where the local currencies have weakened and tourism has increased. 
In Japan, an increase in traffic from Chinese tourists and more domestic consumption from the Japanese as they traveled less overseas due to their weaker currency, drove the business.  We also had specific merchandising and marketing initiatives implemented by our teams that were quite successful. 
Europe experienced similar strengths as tourist traffic increased with the weaker euro, and demand was especially strong in wholesale.
In the U.S., the impact was disproportionate for us as our distributions skewed to the largest cities that have experienced the most significant slowdowns in traffic and spending from the foreign tourists. Roughly half of our U.S. Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores are in major gateway cities such as New York, Miami and San Francisco. Many of our largest points of wholesale distributions are also in major gateway cities. And finally, our factory outlet presence is heavily skewed to centers that tend to attract more foreign tourists.
In the balance of our distribution across the rest of the country, our performance has been on or above plan, which tells us that the strength of our brands and appeal of our products remain high. 
Now let me turn to the retail environment in the U.S. The industry saw a late start to the spring season due to issues related to the west port -- West Coast port delays and an unseasonably cold weather pattern, as well as the lower tourist traffic I spoke about earlier. These conditions created an excess of inventory and, therefore, more promotional environment in North America. We made the decision to be less promotional than the landscape because we believe it's critical to protect our brand.
Looking at comp growth across some of our largest customers. We are in line or better than their stores' average performance. 
For our retail business, we have -- revenue was up 3% in constant currency in the first quarter. Global same-store sales were down 2%, due to a slowdown in e-commerce. E-commerce revenue was up 2%, which was softer than prior quarters. As I referenced earlier, the environment in North America was highly promotional in the quarter, and this was more pronounced online. And again, we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape and achieved a higher average unit retail over the prior-year period as a result. While we knew this decision could slow our revenue growth, we believed it was the right thing to do for our brand. We have seen a pickup in sales at the beginning of the second quarter. However, we remain cautious as most of the quarter remains ahead of us.
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on international sales trends. As I mentioned, Europe had a strong quarter, with revenue up 10% in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong, with robust sell-throughs and reorders, and all brands across the portfolio are performing well. By region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best.
In Asia, revenue was up 9% in constant currency. Japan, which is our largest business in Asia, had a strong quarter, with double-digit revenue growth in constant currency, driven by successful merchandising and marketing initiatives, as well as the increase in traffic from Chinese tourists that I previously mentioned.
In Korea, we experienced a strong trend until the MERS outbreak in June, which negatively impacted traffic. China was a strong once again with double-digit comp growth. Hong Kong and Macau traffic remained pressured, but we saw improvement in our conversion rate.
We continued to see strong performance of Women's Polo and the expansion of the Lauren brand through new distribution in Japan and Korea, which represents an additional opportunity for growth.
Turning to some of the product highlights. Let me begin with luxury. I spoke on our last call about the merging of our luxury labels to create a singular Ralph Lauren Collection label for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. I'm delighted to report that this is on track for the spring 2016 season, with positive feedback from both the retail and editorial communities, who immediately understood the clarity of our offering.
For the first time in many years, Ralph Lauren participated in Milan Men's Fashion Week, with an elegant and exclusive presentation of the spring 2016 Purple Label collection. This took place at the Ralph Lauren palazzo in the heart of Milan that beautifully represents the aesthetic and sensibility of Ralph Lauren luxury. 
Within the accessories part of the luxury business, we are continuing to expand the signature Ricky handbag line with the newest style, the Drawstring Ricky that was featured in our most recent advertising campaign. We will continue to grow our luxury accessories assortment and broaden the price tiering of our product offering.
Turning to the Polo brand. We unveiled our new Polo Sport line in mid-June on RalphLauren.com in the U.S. and have seen strong interest through our pre-order capability. Starting with men's and boys' product, this performance-oriented collection not only brings forward an important aspect of the Polo heritage and DNA, but it also speaks to the performance-inspired active trend. Polo Sport will be available in our own stores and select department stores worldwide later this month and will be introduced at Dick's Sporting Goods in late fall.
Our Polo texture, which combines the aesthetic of Polo Sport and industry-leading advancements in wearable technology, will also be available for purchase later this month. This high-performance shirt will be supported by an interactive Polo Tech app that will feature exclusive video content that allows the wearer to optimize training performance.
We presented our spring 2016 collections for Polo sportswear, Polo tailored clothing and Polo Sport as part of the first-ever New York Men's Fashion Week last month, and the reception across the board was very strong, with a tremendous amount of favorable commentary on the evolution of the brand.
Turning to the women's component of our Polo brand. As we enter the second year, we will be broadening the product line to address additional dimensions of our customers' lifestyle. Denim & Supply continues to see strong growth in both men's and women's. Both Polo for Women and Denim & Supply feature product that spoke to some of the season's biggest trends, such as bohemian look and fringe details, which are core to our DNA.  And across all brands, we had a terrific consumer response to our denim offerings. Our dress business, Lauren footwear and Lauren accessories are also performing well. In our license businesses, men's Polo furnishings, Lauren tailored clothing and Home continue to grow and gain market share in the department store channel.
We remain focused on managing the business and the brands for the long term. We continue to be disciplined about expense management, especially given the challenging macro operating environment in order to allow us to thoughtfully invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives.  I would like to recognize the talent, experience and dedication of our senior leaders and their teams. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

On a constant currency basis, revenues were in line with the prior year, driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally. This is in line with the guidance we provided in May. Negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, which is slightly better than we anticipated, as the euro performed slightly better against the U.S. dollar. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 5% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter.
Gross profit margin was 59.8% in the first quarter, excluding restructuring-related noncash charges of $3 million. This was 120 basis points below the prior-year period. Decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating margin in the first quarter was 8.8%, excluding restructuring and related noncash charges. This was 550 basis points below the prior year, however, better than the outlook we provided in May of 600 to 650 basis point decrease. The operating margin came in better than our guidance, due to disciplined operational management across the organization.
The lower operating margin was attributable to the timing of revenue receipts in our wholesale business, incremental investments in infrastructure and negative foreign currency effects. Net income for the first quarter was $95 million or $1.09 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and related noncash charges. On a reported basis, net income was $64 million or $0.73 per diluted share.
The effective tax rate of 30% in the first quarter on an adjusted basis was in line with our guidance and compared to an effective tax rate of 31% in the prior-year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues declined 6% in constant currency during the first quarter. Wholesale revenue was negatively impacted by our customers' receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year, which was partially offset by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe. 
Combining 2 quarters, let's take a more holistic view of the spring/summer season. Global wholesale revenues were up approximately 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $642 million were 9% below the prior-year period.
Wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 21.8%, excluding restructuring-related noncash charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior-year period, due to the change in customer receipt plans.
Retail sales increased 3% in constant currency to $935 million. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and e-commerce expansion. Comparable store sales declined 2% in constant currency and declined 8% on a reported basis. 
In Europe and Asia, same-store sales growth was positive, with particular strength in Japan and China. In North America, the strong U.S. dollar pressured towards traffic in the overall retail environment.
As Jacki mentioned, comps in brick-and-mortar stores were similar to last quarter in the range of down 2% to 3%. However, e-commerce growth was softer than prior quarters at up 2%.
Again, the online environment in North America became highly promotional in the quarter, and we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape. We achieved a higher average unit retail and higher average order value over the prior period as a result.
Excluding restructuring-related noncash charges, retail operating margin in the first quarter was 12.6%, which was 490 points below the prior-year period, reflecting fixed expense to leverage and negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 6% in constant currency during the first quarter, and licensing operating income was in line with the prior-year period.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support new store openings, the launch of Polo Sport and increased shipments of Polo Women's as well as a change in the timing of receipt plans. In addition, we spent $68 million on capital expenditures compared to $85 million in the prior-year period.
The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter at a cost of $150 million. And at the end of the first quarter, approximately $430 million remained available for future share repurchases.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet.
Overall, we're pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to give you an update on our global brand reorganization effort and guidance for fiscal 2016."

I'm excited to share an update on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure we spoke about on our last call, as we have made significant progress. In the last 90 days, we established",1148,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share an update on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure we spoke about on our last call, as we have made significant progress. In the last 90 days, we established 6 global brand groups, and I'm pleased to report that we have filled all of the global brand president roles. Each president reflect an equal balance of Ralph Lauren veterans, with significant experience inside our organization and outside talent with critical category expertise.
In addition to the 6 brand presidents, we have also begun to identify the design, merchandising, marketing and finance leads for their respective teams and are pleased with the way these groups are forming.
A key element of our new operating model is the introduction of a global line planning process. This is the end-to-end process by which we design, merchandise and plan our assortments. We have kicked it off in our Polo Men's business as a pilot for the fall 2016 season. We will use learnings from this pilot to inform its rollout across the other brands in spring 2017 and beyond. We expect this new process to improve brand equity and revenue growth by creating better assortments and more consistent brand messaging and drive operating efficiencies at the same time.
New organization structure and its accompanying processes will lead to a significant reduction in SKUs, as well as sample and design costs, which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins and meaningful SG&A cost savings. We expect to see the benefits from the global line planning process in the next 18 to 24 months as it rolls out across the portfolio.
We also implemented the headcount reduction that we spoke about on our last call. These were difficult but necessary decisions, and we are on track to realize $100 million in annual expense savings we spoke about previously, driven by the move to the new organization model. Only a modest amount of the benefits will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring and other onetime-related charges for approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization, and we've recognized $45 million of this expected charge in the first quarter.
This charge encompasses the cost of separation associated with our workforce reduction, as well as the cost of store and shop adjustments to provide greater clarity of brand presentation. We are very encouraged by the early stages of our transition and pleased to report that it has gone smoothly. We now feel even more confident that it will allow us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operational and financial efficiencies.
Before I turn to guidance for fiscal '16, I wanted to give an update on some of our key initiatives around new store development, infrastructure investments and our efforts to mitigate foreign exchange impacts. 
In the first quarter, we opened 6 directly operated and 15 license stores around the world. We are on track to open 40 to 50 stores, directly operated stores in fiscal '16. We continue to expect that these new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal '16, as the accelerated store opening pace is now in our base.
Regarding infrastructure investments, our e-commerce re-platform is on schedule and ramping up as planned. This is a multi-year initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the customers' shopping experience. Our SAP implementation in Europe is also on track. We continue to expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the critical e-commerce re-platforming investment.
Moving to foreign exchange. Let me give you an update on our previously announced actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. We have raised prices for cruise and spring seasons in those markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Our retail partners have been very receptive to the price increases, and we believe our competitors are implementing pricing actions as well.  We expect to see the benefits on our income statement in the back half of the fiscal year.  In addition, we continue to expect lower product cost in the back half of the fiscal year from lower raw material and oil prices. 
With that as backdrop, I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. 
We are maintaining our outlook for the fiscal year. We continue to expect mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year. This will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we have invested over the last several years. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale. And based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal '16 revenue growth.
Moving to operating income. On a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal '16. We intend to reinvest this improvement in our infrastructure buildout, primarily the new global e-commerce platform and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year '16 operating margin to be approximately 180 to 230 basis points below fiscal '15's level, due to the unfavorable currency impact.  This guidance excludes restructuring and other onetime-related charges associated with our global brand reorganizations.
In terms of the sensitivity on our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a charge of -- a change of about $0.05 in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by about $20 million on a full-year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%.
We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal '16 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. For the second quarter of fiscal '16, we expected net revenues to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the second quarter to be 550 basis points. Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 275 to 325 basis points below the prior-year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, infrastructure investments and timing of expense savings initiative. The second quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%.
We are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

It was really a mixed environment that we were operating in around the world, with a lot of different factors. So I would start by saying that about 20% of our sales are driven by foreign tourists globally in our retail stores. And you correctly mentioned that if you look at the International business, our retail comps were positive. So we were up internationally in our retail comps, both in Europe and in Asia. Part of that was driven by strong acceptance of the product. Part of that was driven by increased traffic flows from foreign tourists, particularly in Japan and Europe. In the U.S., business was under a little bit more pressure, and that was largely driven by the foreign tourists trend. And so I think that's been one of the biggest drivers, as we spoke about previously. With regard to the e-commerce impact, it was a little bit of a different dynamic. So in the e-commerce comps, we saw strong double-digit growth in e-commerce comps in the International business, where we continued to operate in a somewhat less promotional environment. In the U.S., as we saw the promotional environment escalating, we chose to stay focused on driving full price sell-through and increasing the brand equity, and so we chose not to go down the promotional game. And we saw, as a result of that, that our average unit retails were up versus year ago. Our average transaction size was up versus year ago. But we did see a slowdown in the revenue growth as a result, and that's really what held back the overall e-commerce comp growth in the quarter. But we think it was the right move, from a long-term perspective, in terms of protecting the brand equity. The Polo Fifth Avenue store, I think we continue to be very encouraged about the Polo Fifth Avenue store in terms of what the job that it's doing at showcasing the brand aesthetic and brand sensibility. We're continuing to learn in that store based on the consumer response, and we're continuing to adjust the product assortment to not only showcase the direction that the brand is moving with new product, but also getting the product assortments right for that consumer that's walking into the store. So I think we continue to feel very good about where we are with that store."

I know it's been a topic of intense discussion, but fiscal 2017, as we look to our longer-term models, particularly on the margins, you guys have a lot of projects going on with varying durations. And as we look at next year, you guys have been commenting with us all inter-quarter on a lot of these things. Maybe just an update on a few of the buckets. I think you said e-commerce and SAP are going to peak out in dollar terms this year, maybe not decline next year, but no longer inflationary. There's the restructuring savings. If you could comment on how much of that you think would flow through to margin, because if all of it did, that would be, obviously, very impactful to earnings. So I wonder, maybe help us context that. And then currency, I know most of the competitors now are starting to talk about the lagging impact of hedges rolling off next year. Maybe you could just help contextualize that. As we look at next year, will FX be bigger or smaller impact for the margins versus this year?"

So I guess, I think you've got the 3 big elements that you mentioned in the question. But maybe I'll start with FX.

So I guess, I think you've got the 3 big elements that you mentioned in the question. But maybe I'll start with FX. So for FX, I think we said on the last call that we expected FX to be a hurt of about $185 million to operating income this year, which effectively accounts for most of the, or if not all, of the margin decline in operating margin this year. If you look at that FX impact this year, about half of that is translational and half of that is transactional. The translational impact of currency rates stay where they are today. We would not have continuing into next fiscal year, because we would've fully anniversary-ed it by the time we get to next fiscal year. We do expect, if FX rates stay where they are today, that we will have a lagging transactional hurt from FX that goes into next year, but we expect the magnitude of that transactional hurt to be slightly smaller than the transactional hurt that we're experiencing this year because of the timing of when our hedges roll off. On the infrastructure investments piece of that, I expect that the e-commerce re-platforming investment is likely to ramp up next year versus this year as we get closer to implementation, and so we're expecting to be spending more money on the e-commerce re-platforming project next year. But on the SAP project, we expect that investment to ramp down year-over-year. And so when you look at the infrastructure investments in total, too soon to say exactly how we net out, but probably, we'll be in a similar place in fiscal '17 in total when you look at the 2 projects together as where we are this year. And then, let's see, the third part of the question was on restructuring. And on restructuring savings, I think we've said that we expect to have a portion of the savings this year and a much more significant portion of the savings next year. So I do expect the restructuring savings to be a help to operating margin next year in a meaningful way. But obviously, how that nets out against the currency impact, I think, it's still premature for us to say."

So what we're talking about here is, really, the U.S. business and the U.S. retail and wholesale environment. And I think as Jacki mentioned in the prepared remarks, what we saw was with the West Coast port slowdown with the cold, unseasonably cold winter, there was an overhang, generally, of product in the industry that resulted in a desire to clear some of that inventory across the industry. And that led to a number of our wholesale partners, as well as a number of our branded competitors going deeper and more frequent in their promotional cadence than what they had done a year ago. And so I think we felt good about the way that we navigated through that, because we try to navigate through that in a way that both protected our brand equity and dealt with the market realities from a competitive environment.

We're seeing strength in both handbags and footwear, and our international full-price sell-throughs have been extremely strong, both in men's, women's and across footwear and accessories. So we're seeing great traction in the world of Ricky. We had double-digit sales growth this year in that category, so we're really continuing to fuel that opportunity. And we're expanding that line through new colors, silhouettes and materials. With the introduction of the Ricky Drawstring, we've had great success with that and are expanding that as well. In the U.S. wholesale business, I think the low- to mid-single is something that we're comfortable with, and we continue to perform at/or better than the customers. So I think that particularly with some of our new introductions in our Polo Sport opportunity, that we're just in the beginning stages of this month, the continuation of Polo women's. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us in terms of some of these new introductions. The Denim & Supply business has been extremely strong. Denim, as a foundation of that business, has continued to grow and strengthen, and we're feeling that in the sort of the undercurrents of that business and we played strongly in that category across Polo, across our women's business, in Polo women's, in particular, our Lauren brand and -- so that category -- in Polo Men's as well.

So one of the reasons that we've moved into this model was that as we looked at our previous operating model, as we started to take back licenses from the different geographies and license partners around the world, what we found was that we had different merchandise assortments around the world, and like locations, we had a fragmented marketing -- set of marketing campaigns because of that disparate assortments around the world. And we think by moving to this global brand structure with the global line planning process, we're going to be able to drive a more consistent look and feel of the brand, more consistent marketing campaigns.

So the Easter shift accounted for about $50 million or so of revenue shift between Q4 and Q1. So if you looked at the wholesale business between Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, you put those 2 together, the wholesale business globally would've been up 2% in constant currency. And if you look at the wholesale business just in Q1, without the Easter shift, the wholesale business would've been up marginally even in the first quarter on a stand-alone basis without that Easter shift impact. The Easter shift really accounted for the -- all of the margin compression effectively in the wholesale business. So we don't think that there's an underlying trend issue with regard to margin compression in wholesale that we're seeing. If you look back to your -- the first part of your question, which is around the retail comp trend, I think the margin compression that we're seeing this year is really a function of foreign exchange more than a function of retail comps. And so I don't think we've got an issue that we're relying on significant retail comp growth in order to drive operating leverage going forward. I think we believe we can drive operating leverage going forward even in a environment of relatively muted retail comp growth. That being said, we're not -- we're shooting to try to improve our retail comp figures going forward, and we think that the global brand structure is going to play a key role in that process."

We have a great Polo shirt business that is consistent and strong in women's. We do, similar to men's, an expanded woven shirt business that we are really known for. And that crisp shirt, whether it's the white shirt or multiple stripes and checks and so forth, also are as valuable in women's to us as they are in men's. And then, of course, we have key bottoms. It's not the chino pants, but for us, the DNA is around our jogger, which continues to perform extremely well, as well as our cargo pants, another key thing that we are known for that have been extremely important and powerful as key bottoms statement.

In the first quarter of our new fiscal year, we delivered revenues in line with our guidance and profits that were better than our expectations. This was driven by the company's attention to careful, disciplined operational and expense management. We are pleased with these results in the context of the environment in which we operate, and we are on track to deliver our plan for the fiscal year. We see the year developing as one of steady quarter-by-quarter improvement. 
Looking at the first half, we are negatively impacted by the Easter calendar, significant foreign exchange pressure and our infrastructure investments. In the second half, we expect to see both sales and profit improvement due to the launch of Polo Sport and the opening of our new stores, the impact of product cost savings and pricing actions, and the benefit of our restructuring activities. In addition, the foreign exchange pressure will lessen as the year progresses. 
Now let me turn to the quarter. There are several factors impacting our results. First, the shift in global tourist traffic patterns around the world; second, but related to the first point, the changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the increasingly promotional U.S. retail environment.
We are taking decisive actions to most effectively operate in this changing environment. We always take a long-term view to protect both our brands and our profitability. While our infrastructure investments have pressured our operating margin in the short term, we believe these are the right investments that will pay off in the future.  Let me give you more texture on each of these topics. 
In the first quarter, the impact of currency movements on global tourism was especially pronounced. We saw significant increases in traffic in Europe and Japan and a decline in the U.S. We see that the customer is more astute than ever and adjust travel and purchasing plans to make the smartest spending decisions. Our business was up double digits in Europe and Japan, where the local currencies have weakened and tourism has increased. 
In Japan, an increase in traffic from Chinese tourists and more domestic consumption from the Japanese as they traveled less overseas due to their weaker currency, drove the business. We also had specific merchandising and marketing initiatives implemented by our teams that were quite successful. 
Europe experienced similar strengths as tourist traffic increased with the weaker euro, and demand was especially strong in wholesale.
In the U.S., the impact was disproportionate for us as our distribution skews to the largest cities that have experienced the most significant slowdowns in traffic and spending from the foreign tourists. Roughly half of our U.S. Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores are in major gateway cities such as New York, Miami and San Francisco. Many of our largest points of wholesale distribution are also in major gateway cities. And finally, our factory outlet presence is heavily skewed to centers that tend to attract more foreign tourists.
In the balance of our distribution across the rest of the country, our performance has been on or above plan, which tells us that the strength of our brands and appeal of our products remain high. 
Now let me turn to the retail environment in the U.S. The industry saw a late start to the spring season due to issues related to the west port -- West Coast port delays and an unseasonably cold weather pattern, as well as the lower tourist traffic I spoke about earlier. These conditions created an excess of inventory, and therefore, more promotional environment in North America. We made the decision to be less promotional than the landscape because we believe it's critical to protect our brand.
Looking at comp growth across some of our largest customers, we are in line or better than their stores' average performance. 
For our retail business, we had -- revenue was up 3% in constant currency in the first quarter. Global same-store sales were down 2%, due to a slowdown in e-commerce. E-commerce revenue was up 2%, which was softer than prior quarters. As I referenced earlier, the environment in North America was highly promotional in the quarter, and this was more pronounced online. And again, we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape and achieved a higher average unit retail over the prior-year period as a result. While we knew this decision could slow our revenue growth, we believed it was the right thing to do for our brand. We have seen a pickup in sales at the beginning of the second quarter. However, we remain cautious as most of the quarter remains ahead of us.
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on international sales trends. As I mentioned, Europe had a strong quarter, with revenue up 10% in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong, with robust sell-throughs and reorders, and all brands across the portfolio are performing well. By region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best.
In Asia, revenue was up 9% in constant currency. Japan, which is our largest business in Asia, had a strong quarter, with double-digit revenue growth in constant currency, driven by successful merchandising and marketing initiatives, as well as the increase in traffic from Chinese tourists that I previously mentioned.
In Korea, we experienced a strong trend until the MERS outbreak in June, which negatively impacted traffic. China was strong once again with double-digit comp growth. Hong Kong and Macau traffic remained pressured, but we saw improvement in our conversion rate.
We continued to see strong performance of Women's Polo and the expansion of the Lauren brand through new distribution in Japan and Korea, which represents an additional opportunity for growth.
Turning to some of the product highlights. Let me begin with luxury. I spoke on our last call about the merging of our luxury labels to create a singular Ralph Lauren Collection label for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. I'm delighted to report that this is on track for the spring 2016 season, with positive feedback from both the retail and editorial communities, who immediately understood the clarity of our offering.
For the first time in many years, Ralph Lauren participated in Milan's Men's Fashion Week, with an elegant and exclusive presentation of the spring 2016 Purple Label collection. This took place at the Ralph Lauren Palazzo in the heart of Milan that beautifully represents the aesthetic and sensibility of Ralph Lauren luxury. 
Within the accessories part of the luxury business, we are continuing to expand the signature Ricky handbag line with the newest style, the Drawstring Ricky, that was featured in our most recent advertising campaign. We will continue to grow our luxury accessories assortment and broaden the price tiering of our product offering.
Turning to the Polo brand. We unveiled our new Polo Sport line in mid-June on RalphLauren.com in the U.S. and have seen strong interest through our pre-order capability. Starting with men's and boys' product, this performance-oriented collection not only brings forward an important aspect of the Polo heritage and DNA, but it also speaks to the performance-inspired active trend. Polo Sport will be available in our own stores and select department stores worldwide later this month and will be introduced at Dick's Sporting Goods in late fall.
Our PoloTech Shirt, which combines the aesthetic of Polo Sport and industry-leading advancements in wearable technology, will also be available for purchase later this month. This high-performance shirt will be supported by an interactive PoloTech app that will feature exclusive video content that allows the wearer to optimize training performance.
We presented our spring 2016 collections for Polo sportswear, Polo tailored clothing and Polo Sport as part of the first-ever New York Men's Fashion Week last month, and the reception across the board was very strong, with a tremendous amount of favorable commentary on the evolution of the brand.
Turning to the women's component of our Polo brand. As we enter its second year, we will be broadening the product line to address additional dimensions of our customers' lifestyle. Denim & Supply continues to see strong growth in both men's and women's. Both Polo for Women and Denim & Supply feature product that spoke to some of the season's biggest trends, such as bohemian look and fringe details, which are core to our DNA. And across all brands, we had terrific consumer response to our denim offerings. Our dress business, Lauren footwear and Lauren accessories are also performing well. In our license businesses, men's Polo furnishings, Lauren tailored clothing and Home continue to grow and gain market share in the department store channel.
We remain focused on managing the business and the brands for the long term. We continue to be disciplined about expense management, especially given the challenging macro operating environment, in order to allow us to thoughtfully invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives. I would like to recognize the talent, experience and dedication of our senior leaders and their teams. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

On a constant currency basis, revenues were in line with the prior year, driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally. This is in line with the guidance we provided in May. Negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, which is slightly better than we anticipated, as the euro performed slightly better against the U.S. dollar. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 5% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter.
Gross profit margin was 59.8% in the first quarter, excluding restructuring-related noncash charges of $3 million. This was 120 basis points below the prior-year period. Decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating margin in the first quarter was 8.8%, excluding restructuring and related noncash charges. This was 550 basis points below the prior year, however, better than the outlook we provided in May of 600 to 650 basis point decrease. The operating margin came in better than our guidance, due to disciplined operational management across the organization.
The lower operating margin was attributable to the timing of revenue receipts in our wholesale business, incremental investments in infrastructure and negative foreign currency effects. Net income for the first quarter was $95 million or $1.09 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and related noncash charges. On a reported basis, net income was $64 million or $0.73 per diluted share.
The effective tax rate of 30% in the first quarter on an adjusted basis was in line with our guidance and compared to an effective tax rate of 31% in the prior-year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues declined 6% in constant currency during the first quarter. Wholesale revenue was negatively impacted by our customers' receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year, which was partially offset by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe. 
Combining 2 quarters, to take a more holistic view of the spring/summer season, global wholesale revenues were up approximately 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $642 million were 9% below the prior-year period.
Wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 21.8%, excluding restructuring-related noncash charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior-year period, due to the change in customer receipt plans.
Retail sales increased 3% in constant currency to $935 million. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and e-commerce expansion. Comparable store sales declined 2% in constant currency and declined 8% on a reported basis. 
In Europe and Asia, same-store sales growth was positive, with particular strength in Japan and China. In North America, the strong U.S. dollar pressured tourist traffic in the overall retail environment.
As Jacki mentioned, comps in brick-and-mortar stores were similar to last quarter in the range of down 2% to 3%. However, e-commerce growth was softer than prior quarters at up 2%.
Again, the online environment in North America became highly promotional in the quarter, and we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape. We achieved a higher average unit retail and higher average order value over the prior period as a result.
Excluding restructuring-related noncash charges, retail operating margin in the first quarter was 12.6%, which was 490 points below the prior-year period, reflecting fixed expense to leverage and negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 6% in constant currency during the first quarter, and licensing operating income was in line with the prior-year period.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support new store openings, the launch of Polo Sport and increased shipments of Polo women's, as well as a change in the timing of receipt plans. In addition, we spent $68 million on capital expenditures, compared to $85 million in the prior-year period.
The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter at a cost of $150 million. And at the end of the first quarter, approximately $430 million remained available for future share repurchases.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet.
Overall, we're pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to give you an update on our global brand reorganization effort and guidance for fiscal 2016."
362220,306893268,849538,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share an update on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure we spoke about on our last call, as we have made significant progress. In the last 90 days, we established",1150,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share an update on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure we spoke about on our last call, as we have made significant progress. In the last 90 days, we established 6 global brand groups, and I'm pleased to report that we have filled all of the global brand president roles. These presidents reflect an equal balance of Ralph Lauren veterans, with significant experience inside our organization, and outside talent with critical category expertise.
In addition to the 6 brand presidents, we have also begun to identify the design, merchandising, marketing and finance leads for their respective teams and are pleased with the way these groups are forming.
A key element of our new operating model is the introduction of a global line planning process. This is the end-to-end process by which we design, merchandise and plan our assortments. We have kicked it off in our Polo Men's business as a pilot for the fall 2016 season. We will use learnings from this pilot to inform its rollout across the other brands in spring 2017 and beyond. We expect this new process to improve brand equity and revenue growth by creating better assortments and more consistent brand messaging and drive operating efficiencies at the same time.
The new organization structure and its accompanying processes will lead to a significant reduction in SKUs, as well as sample and design costs, which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins and meaningful SG&A cost savings. We expect to see the benefits from the global line planning process in the next 18 to 24 months as it rolls out across the portfolio.
We also implemented the headcount reduction that we spoke about on our last call. These were difficult but necessary decisions, and we are on track to realize the $100 million in annual expense savings we spoke about previously, driven by the move to the new organization model. Only a modest amount of the benefits will be realized in fiscal '16, with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring and other onetime-related charges for approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization, and we've recognized $45 million of this expected charge in the first quarter.
This charge encompasses the cost of separation associated with our workforce reduction, as well as the cost of store and shop adjustments to provide greater clarity of brand presentation. We are very encouraged by the early stages of our transition and pleased to report that it has gone smoothly. We now feel even more confident that it will allow us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operational and financial efficiencies.
Before I turn to guidance for fiscal '16, I wanted to give an update on some of our key initiatives around new store development, infrastructure investments and our efforts to mitigate foreign exchange impacts. 
In the first quarter, we opened 6 directly operated and 15 licensed stores around the world. We are on track to open 40 to 50 stores, directly operated stores, in fiscal '16. We continue to expect that these new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal '16, as the accelerated store opening pace is now in our base.
Regarding infrastructure investments, our e-commerce re-platform is on schedule and ramping up as planned. This is a multi-year initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the customers' shopping experience. Our SAP implementation in Europe is also on track. We continue to expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the critical e-commerce re-platforming investment.
Moving to foreign exchange. Let me give you an update on our previously announced actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. We have raised prices for cruise and spring seasons in those markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Our retail partners have been very receptive to the price increases, and we believe our competitors are implementing pricing actions as well. We expect to see the benefits on our income statement in the back half of the fiscal year. In addition, we continue to expect lower product cost in the back half of the fiscal year from lower raw material and oil prices. 
With that as backdrop, I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. 
We are maintaining our outlook for the fiscal year. We continue to expect mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year. This will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we have invested over the last several years. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale. And based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal '16 revenue growth.
Moving to operating income. On a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal '16. We intend to reinvest this improvement in our infrastructure buildout, primarily the new global e-commerce platform and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year '16 operating margin to be approximately 180 to 230 basis points below fiscal '15's level, due to the unfavorable currency impact. This guidance excludes restructuring and other onetime-related charges associated with our global brand reorganizations.
In terms of the sensitivity on our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a charge of -- a change of about $0.05 in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by about $20 million on a full-year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%.
We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal '16 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. For the second quarter of fiscal '16, we expected net revenues to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the second quarter to be 550 basis points. Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 275 to 325 basis points below the prior-year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, infrastructure investments and timing of expense savings initiatives. The second quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%.
We are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

It was really a mixed environment that we were operating in around the world, with a lot of different factors. So I would start by saying that about 20% of our sales are driven by foreign tourists globally in our retail stores. And you correctly mentioned that if you look at the international business, our retail comps were positive. So we were up internationally in our retail comps, both in Europe and in Asia. Part of that was driven by strong acceptance of the product. Part of that was driven by increased traffic flows from foreign tourists, particularly in Japan and Europe. In the U.S., business was under a little bit more pressure, and that was largely driven by the foreign tourist trend. And so I think that's been one of the biggest drivers, as we spoke about previously. With regard to the e-commerce impact, it was a little bit of a different dynamic. So in the e-commerce comps, we saw strong double-digit growth in e-commerce comps in the international business, where we continue to operate in a somewhat less promotional environment. In the U.S., as we saw the promotional environment escalating, we chose to stay focused on driving full-price sell-through and increasing the brand equity, and so we chose not to go down the promotional game. And we saw, as a result of that, that our average unit retails were up versus year ago. Our average transaction size was up versus year ago. But we did see a slowdown in the revenue growth as a result, and that's really what held back the overall e-commerce comp growth in the quarter. But we think it was the right move, from a long-term perspective, in terms of protecting the brand equity. The Polo Fifth Avenue store, I think we continue to be very encouraged about the Polo Fifth Avenue store in terms of what -- the job that it's doing at showcasing the brand aesthetic and brand sensibility. We're continuing to learn in that store based on the consumer response, and we're continuing to adjust the product assortment to not only showcase the direction that the brand is moving with new product, but also getting the product assortments right for that consumer that's walking into the store. So I think we continue to feel very good about where we are with that store."

I know it's been a topic of intense discussion, but fiscal 2017, as we look to our longer-term models, particularly on the margin, you guys have a lot of projects going on, with varying durations. And as we look at next year, you guys have been commenting with us all intra-quarter on a lot of these things. Maybe just an update on a few of the buckets. I think you said e-commerce and SAP are going to peak out in dollar terms this year, maybe not decline next year, but no longer inflationary. There's the restructuring savings. If you could comment on how much of that you think would flow through to margin, because if all of it did, that would be, obviously, very impactful to earnings. So I wondered maybe help us context that. And then currency, I know most of the competitors now are starting to talk about the lagging impact of hedges rolling off next year. Maybe you could just help us contextualize that. As we look at next year, will FX be bigger or smaller impact on the margins versus this year?"

So I guess, I think you've got the 3 big elements that you mentioned in the question. But maybe I'll start with FX. So for FX, I think we said on the last call that we expected FX to be a hurt of about $185 million to operating income this year",376,"Yes, sure. So I guess, I think you've got the 3 big elements that you mentioned in the question. But maybe I'll start with FX. So for FX, I think we said on the last call that we expected FX to be a hurt of about $185 million to operating income this year, which effectively accounts for most of the, or if not all, of the margin decline in operating margin this year. If you look at that FX impact this year, about half of that is translational and half of that is transactional. The translational impact, if currency rates stay where they are today, we would not have continuing into next fiscal year, because we would've fully anniversary-ed it by the time we get to next fiscal year. We do expect, if FX rates stay where they are today, that we will have a lagging transactional hurt from FX that goes into next year, but we expect the magnitude of that transactional hurt to be slightly smaller than the transactional hurt that we're experiencing this year because of the timing of when our hedges roll off. On the infrastructure investments piece of that, I expect that the e-commerce re-platforming investment is likely to ramp up next year versus this year as we get closer to implementation, and so we're expecting to be spending more money on the e-commerce re-platforming project next year. But on the SAP project, we expect that investment to ramp down year-over-year. And so when you look at the infrastructure investments in total, too soon to say exactly how we net out, but probably, we'll be in a similar place in fiscal '17 in total when you look at the 2 projects together as where we are this year. And then, let's see, the third part of the question was on restructuring. And on restructuring savings, I think we've said that we expect to have a portion of the savings this year and a much more significant portion of the savings next year. So I do expect the restructuring savings to be a help to operating margin next year in a meaningful way. But obviously, how that nets out against the currency impact, I think, it's still premature for us to say."

And that led to a number of our wholesale partners, as well as a number of our branded competitors, going deeper and more frequent in their promotional cadence than what they had done a year ago. And so I think we felt good about the way that we navigated through that, because we try to navigate through that in a way that both protected our brand equity and dealt with the market realities from a competitive environment.

So we're seeing great traction in the world of Ricky. We had double-digit sales growth this year in that category, so we're really continuing to fuel that opportunity. And we're expanding that line through new colors, silhouettes and materials. With the introduction of the Ricky Drawstring, we've had great success with that and are expanding that as well. In the U.S. wholesale business, I think the low- to mid-single is something that we're comfortable with, and we continue to perform at or better than the customers. So I think that, particularly with some of our new introductions in our Polo Sport opportunity that we're just in the beginning stages of this month, the continuation of Polo women's. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us in terms of some of these new introductions. The Denim & Supply business has been extremely strong. Denim, as a foundation of that business, has continued to grow and strengthen, and we're feeling that in the sort of the undercurrents of that business and we play strongly in that category across Polo, across our women's business, in Polo women's, in particular, our Lauren brand and -- so that category -- in Polo Men's as well. So I think that category we see as an increasing strong part of our opportunity going forward as well."

But we don't yet have the benefit, which we expect to start getting in the back half of the year, of the pricing actions that we've taken to offset the foreign exchange cost reductions that we've negotiated with our manufacturing and sourcing partners, which flow more directly into the back half of the year; the beginning of the restructuring savings, which we expect to flow more in the back half of the year; as well as the benefit of new store openings, which we expect to be more pronounced in the back half of the year. We also expect the foreign exchange impact to be smaller in the fourth quarter.

I think we believe that this is going to be very positive for the brands as we move into the new structure, because effectively, what we're doing is we're going to be focused in creating organizations that are single-mindedly focused by brand at driving the brand equity and brand consistency around the world. So one of the reasons that we've moved into this model was that as we looked at our previous operating model, as we started to take back licenses from the different geographies and license partners around the world, what we found was that we had different merchandise assortments around the world, and like locations, we had a fragmented marketing -- set of marketing campaigns because of that disparate assortments around the world. And we think by moving to this global brand structure with the global line planning process, we're going to be able to drive a more consistent look and feel of the brand, more consistent marketing campaigns.

So the Easter shift accounted for about $50 million or so of revenue shift between Q4 and Q1. So if you looked at the wholesale business between Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, you put those 2 together, the wholesale business globally would've been up 2% in constant currency. And if you look at the wholesale business just in Q1, without the Easter shift, the wholesale business would've been up marginally, even in the first quarter on a standalone basis without that Easter shift impact. The Easter shift really accounted for the -- all of the margin compression effectively in the wholesale business. So we don't think that there's an underlying trend issue with regard to margin compression in wholesale that we're seeing. If you look back to your -- the first part of your question, which is around the retail comp trend, I think the margin compression that we're seeing this year is really a function of foreign exchange more than a function of retail comps. And so I don't think we've got an issue that we're relying on significant retail comp growth in order to drive operating leverage going forward. I think we believe we can drive operating leverage going forward even in a environment of relatively muted retail comp growth. That being said, we're not -- we're shooting to try to improve our retail comp figures going forward, and we think that the global brand structure is going to play a key role in that process."

We have a great Polo shirt business that is consistent and strong in women's. We do, similar to men's, an expanded woven shirt business that we are really known for. And that crisp shirt, whether it's the white shirt or multiple stripes and checks and so forth, also are as valuable in women's to us as they are in men's. And then, of course, we have key bottoms. It's not the chino pant, but for us, the DNA is around our jodhpur, which continues to perform extremely well, as well as our cargo pants, another key thing that we are known for that have been extremely important and powerful as key bottoms statement.

We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected second quarter results this morning.

We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected second quarter results this morning. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% and diluted earnings per share was up 13% versus year ago, excluding one-time charges. Profits were significantly better than our expectations entering the quarter, driven by stronger-than-expected operating margins. This was driven by both gross margin and SG&A improvement. 
On gross margins, we are beginning to benefit from the initial phases of the SKU and style rationalization, lower negotiated sourcing cost, increased full price sell-throughs and mix benefit. SG&A was also significantly better than forecast due to earlier-than-expected cost savings from the global brand reorganization and disciplined expense management. We are pleased to see margin benefits from these initiatives already and expect to see top line benefit as well as the new global line planning process is implemented.
Now let me provide an overview of the quarter. We continue to see the impact of currency movements on foreign tourist traffic around the world. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced foreign tourist traffic in the U.S, while the weaker euro and Japanese yen had the opposite effect in those markets. In Europe, our revenue was up double digits in constant currency, similar to the first quarter. Growth was driven by increased sales to both local customers and tourists.
Wholesale demand was particularly strong with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. All brands across the portfolio performed well, and by region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best. In Asia, second quarter revenue was up 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in Japan, China, Southeast Asia and Australia. We are successfully elevating our brand in these markets through targeted merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives.
Full price selling is up year-over-year, driving better sales and margins. We are achieving market share gains through success with local customers, as well as increased tourist traffic. Korea, Hong Kong and Macau all were negatively impacted by reduced tourist traffic, and Korea trends started to improve as the lingering effect of the MERS outbreak diminish.
In the Americas, net revenue was up 2% in constant currency. Sales trends were impacted by the continued decline of traffic to both our retail stores and department stores, driven by lower foreign tourist traffic and an unseasonably warm start to the fall season. Within our retail store network, we were able to partially offset the traffic declines by driving increased conversion through successful merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives.
Our global e-commerce sales were up 10% in the second quarter, driven by our international business. In North America e-commerce, we saw improved trends compared to the first quarter. We made several enhancements in our omnichannel capabilities, including the launch of buy online, ship from store and hold online, pickup in store, and a new feature where customers can be added to a waitlist if we are sold out of a size or color.
We also added product videos that are driving a higher average order value. Within the global factory outlet channel, results were mixed. Europe saw increased traffic and conversion rates leading to strong comp store sales growth. The U.S. continue to see traffic declines due to fewer foreign tourists. Importantly, in the U.S, in locations where domestic customers represents more of the traffic, we achieved positive comps driven by improved conversion rates that were the result of successful marketing and in-store initiatives.
As we plan the second half of fiscal 2016, we are taking a prudent approach given the slow start to fall in the U.S., fueled by unseasonably warm weather and continued declines in foreign tourist traffic. We believe inventory in the North America department store channel is elevated. And as a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. Bob will share more details on our second half guidance. 
Now let me provide an update on our key strategic initiatives, starting with the transition to our new global brand management structure. We made excellent progress in the quarter with all 6 brand presidents and their leadership teams now in place, our new global line planning process well underway and the clarification of decision rights across brands, regions and channels. The global line planning process is one of the most important elements of the new operating model as it impacts the way we design, merchandise and plan our assortments.
The men's polo brand successfully piloted this new process as the team plan for the fall 2016 season. The team began with input from the regions and channels and a view of the successes and opportunities of the prior season. This led into category and classification strategies to start the design process. When the new line was completed several weeks ago, the positive impact of the process was evident, yielding significant product innovation, greater global brand consistency and style and SKU reductions.
For example, for Fall 2016, Polo will feature lighter weight fabrics in a more wear now sensibility for warm weather stores and early deliveries in northern climates stores. There will also be more elevated product, including more sport coats and dress furnishings, as these elements have seen strong sales in our retail stores. We expect a double-digit reduction in SKUs compared to the same season last year, and this is on top of the reduction we achieved in fall 2015. So we are very encouraged by this progress.
We will be rolling out the global line planning process to other brands over the coming weeks as we kick off the design and development process for the spring 2017 season, and we believe there will be tremendous benefit across our portfolio. The success of the Men's Polo pilot has led to enthusiasm and confidence among the brand teams as to the benefits this new way of working will have on the strength of our assortments and the efficiency of our operation.
We continue to expect a significant reduction in SKUs and sample and design costs, which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins and meaningful SG&A cost savings across the brand portfolio over the next 18 to 24 months.
We've also initiated a new global brand strategic planning process that will be completed over the next few months. This will be the first time we will have a holistic strategic view by brand across all geographies and channels of distribution. We are raising our estimate for annual expense savings associated with the restructure to $110 million from $100 million, given the progress we have made in the global brand restructuring effort, as well as incremental store closures we have identified. As a result, we expect the higher restructuring charge of $120 million to $150 million versus our previous estimate of $70 million to $100 million. This increase also includes the impact of recent management changes and one-time charges primarily related to litigation settlements.
Turning to our direct-to-consumer growth strategy. We are expanding our reach through new store openings and elevating our presentation through renovation activity in our existing fleet. In the second quarter, we renovated our Ralph Lauren store in South Coast Plaza, which will reopen shortly, and we will be starting renovations at our Beverly Hills flagship store. These activities will reinforce our luxury presence and elevate our positioning in the Los Angeles market.
For Polo, we opened 5 new directly operated stores in the quarter, including 2 in the U.S. and 3 in Asia. We also made progress with repositioning select stores to either Ralph Lauren Luxury or the Polo concept in North America. We expected this effort to drive better alignment and clarity by brand, as well as improved store productivity and efficiency.
Across all brands and concepts, we opened 14 directly operated stores in the second quarter, as well as several license locations and concessions. This brings us to a total of 20 new directly operated stores for the first half of the year, and we are on track to open 40 to 50 new stores for fiscal 2016, which will provide mid single-digit square footage growth taking into account planned store closings.
Let me turn to some product highlights for the quarter. We previously announced the clarification of our luxury product offering through the merging of Women's and Men's Black Label into Ralph Lauren Collection and Purple Label. The first season of the merge line is delivering now and the reception is very positive. We are already seeing the efficiencies of this strategy through a reduction in product development and sample costs, and we expect a strong selling season.
In our Accessories business, we continue to gain momentum with our iconic Ricky collection in both existing and new silhouettes and styles. We also saw double-digit comp growth in scarves, jewelry and belts and are continuing to focus on these categories for disproportionate growth.
Now let me turn to Polo Sport, which launched in our retail stores and select department stores worldwide in August and was followed in October by a launch in 75 top Dick Sporting Good stores and on dicksportinggoods.com. We kicked off with the launch with the introduction of the Polo texture at the U.S. Open tennis tournament. The shirt, which features industry-leading advancements in wearable technology, has already generated more than 3.1 billion media impressions and continues to receive strong editorial attention. This was followed by powerful video content leveraged across all distribution channels. 
The early read on Polo Sport is positive, and we have already incorporated initial learning from this first season in the go forward development. We believe Polo Sport will be a significant business for us as consumer's growing desire for performance and leisure product fits perfectly with the D&A of the Polo brand. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made this year, and we are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make thoughtful strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me say that we are all excited to have Stefan joining us as our new CEO. And on behalf of Ralph, myself and the entire senior management team, we would like to recognize and thank Jacki Nemerov for all her contributions over the past 11 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I'd like to begin with a brief recap of the quarter. Second quarter net revenues were up 4% to the prior year on a constant currency basis, driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally, as well as the contribution of new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. This is in line with the guidance we provided of 3% to 5% constant currency growth in August. 
The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, largely in line with the expectations. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 1% to $2 billion in the second quarter. Gross profit margin was 56.5% in the second quarter. This was 30 basis points below the prior-year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. On a constant currency basis, gross margin was up 90 basis points compared to the prior year, due to lower negotiated sourcing costs, benefit from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, increased full price selling and mix benefits.
Operating margin in the second quarter was 13.5%, excluding one-time charges, 90 basis points below the prior year. This is significantly better than the outlook we provided of a 275 to 325 basis point decline in August. The operating margin was favorable to our guidance due to better-than-expected gross margin, cost savings from the global brand organization plan and disciplined expense management. The lower operating margin to the prior year was attributable to negative foreign currency effects and incremental investments and infrastructure. 
Net income for the second quarter was $184 million or $2.13 per diluted share, excluding one-time charges. Earnings per share grew 13% to the prior year period, excluding foreign currency impacts and one-time charges. On a reported basis, net income was $160 million or $1.86 per diluted share in the second quarter. The effective tax rate of 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis was slightly below our guidance of 30% due to discrete tax items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. Wholesale revenue was supported by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe with strength across all brands. On a reported basis, Wholesale revenues of $927 million were 2% below the prior year period. Wholesale operating margins in the second quarter was 26.8%, excluding one-time charges. This was 60 basis points above the prior year period driven by gross margin improvement and disciplined expense management.
Retail sales increased 5% in constant currency to $996 million in the second quarter. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. Comparable-store sales declined 1% in constant currency and declined 6% on a reported basis.
International same-store sales were positive with particular strength in Europe, Japan, China and Australia with comps declined in North America as traffic was pressured by the strong U.S. dollar in the overall retail environment. Our e-commerce trend improved somewhat from last quarter, but was offset by our brick-and-mortar comp, which was down 2% to 3% similar to last quarter. 
Within e-commerce, our international business continued to post strong double-digit gains. Excluding one-time charges, retail operating margins in the second quarter was 12.8%, which was 80 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting fixed expense deleverage and negative foreign currency effects.
Licensing revenues increased 7% in constant currency in the second quarter and licensing operating income was in line with the prior year period. Moving on to the balance sheet. 
Consolidated inventory was $1.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new store openings and increased shipments of Polo Sport and Polo Women's. At the end of the second quarter we had 32 more directly operated stores and 82 more concessions in the chain in a year ago, which is contributing to the growth.
We feel comfortable with our inventory levels and the quality of our inventory. Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $134 million in the second quarter compared to $91 million in the prior year period. The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter at a cost of $130 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $280 million.
At the end of the second quarter, approximately $300 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $727 million of total debt. This reflects the new $300 million senior note offering we completed in August.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. As Chris mentioned, we are taking a prudent approach to planning the balance of the fiscal year. As a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect reported revenues to be approximately flat for the year, driven by a 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth and 400 basis points of negative impact form foreign currency based on current exchange rates.
The constant currency growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives, which we have invested in over the last several years, as well as the actions we are taking to mitigate negative currency impacts, including raising pricing for the Spring 2016 season in Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia.
Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than Wholesale. As a reminder, we have a 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Moving on to operating income. On a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 100 to 230 basis points below fiscal year '15's level due to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes one-time charges that were primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization. We expect these one-time charges to approximate $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016, of which $38 million was recognized in the second quarter and $83 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. This is higher than the estimate we shared previously of $70 million to $100 million, due to including of additional charges associated with a recently announced management changes and additional restructuring activities. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to grow 0% to 2% [ph] on a reported basis. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the third quarter to be 250 basis points. Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be 200 to 250 basis points below the prior year period, due to negative foreign currency effects and infrastructure investments.
Our third quarter tax rate is estimated at 31%. Overall, we are pleased with the better-than-expected second quarter results. Disciplined planning and rigorous attention to the day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds in addition to driving our strategic initiatives forward.

And then as a follow-up, you've had as focus on some investment buckets for the past few years. You've commented e-commerce and peaking to this year. I think you have less intensity and flagship openings next year, so maybe the retail investment isn't quite as intense. But maybe if we start adding up of those buckets again. Can you give us early thoughts based on the components as you see them today for the ability to leverage margins for fiscal '17?"

And really about we beat the operating margin expectation that we have by",620,"Sure. So let me take the first part of that first. So I think the results obviously came in significantly better than we expected this quarter when we gave guidance on the quarter. And really about we beat the operating margin expectation that we have by about 200 basis points. And if you look at that beat, about half of it was due to gross margin and half of it was due to SG&A. And it was really a function of a number of items. On the gross margin side, we did see benefits from the SKU and style rationalization. And you're right that we tackle that when we started the global merchandising group about 1 year or 2 ago in a manual way. We were just scratching the surface of that, I would say, at this point, because of the systemic approach to the style and SKU rationalization is really what's coming in the global line planning process, which is going to, which was going to kick in 12 to 18 months from now. So I would say if you looked at Men's Polo for fall of 2015, we might have been down a low double-digit percentage of styles and SKUs. And then when you look at Fall 2016, we're expecting again, even versus that lower base, another improvement of equal magnitude. And I think on many of the other brands, we've had an initial, a little bit of a progress, but I think there's more progress ahead of us going forward as we move into the line planning process. We also, on the gross margin side, though, benefited from the lower negotiated sourcing costs. If you recall, when we took the big foreign exchange hurt back earlier this calendar year, we commissioned our manufacturing and sourcing group to go back to our sourcing and supply chain base. And that sourcing discussion and cost discussion has resulted in average unit cost reductions that came a little bit bigger then we expected and faster. And then we also benefited from improved full price sell-throughs during the quarter. So all of that kind of went into the positive direction, which led to the gross margin improvement. Relative to next fiscal year, I think we are just about to kick off the budgeting process. So it's premature to give guidance on next fiscal year. We'll provide qualitative perspective at our next call. But your comment is accurate in that certainly, from an infrastructure standpoint, we expect the e-commerce re-platforming spend to be higher next year as we ramp up the work on moving to the new e-commerce platform. But we do expect the SAP spending to moderate, though. I expect infrastructure in total to not be a significant year-over-year driver. The retail investment also, I don't expect to be a year-over-year driver because we're at about the rate of new store openings that we anticipate going forward. I do think that we're going to see foreign exchange impact next year continuing primarily on the transactional side because the hedging program that we had in place this year will roll off over the next 9 to 12 months. So we'll see a transactional hit, although the transformational impact should be small to nonexisting at current rate. But then we're going to start to see some of the benefits from all of the restructuring work that we've done, both from the global brand restructuring, from the line planning and from the pricing actions that we put in place that should start to roll in over the next 12 months. So we'll provide more specifics on how all of that nets against each under the next call, but that's where we stand at the moment."

So when we look at our inventory, the currency of our inventory is very well-positioned from a current season and future season basis versus a prior season inventory. The inventory growth that we've had in our inventory versus year ago is really to support new store activity and new product introductions, like Polo Sport, around the world. When we look at the U.S. department store channel, I think that's the place where we see a little bit of elevated inventory across the channel that is not just in our business, but in -- broadly defined in many of the competitors. And I think it's a function of the foreign tourist traffic being down in the U.S., as well as of the unseasonably warm start to the fall season. And so, as we approach the holiday selling period, which is obviously the biggest selling period of the year for our industry, we felt like it was in the right thing to take a prudent approach to that given where we're headed. We've got a long history of navigating through this in a very strong way. And we've got real expertise within the company to help us do this. And what we're trying to do is keep our inventory fresh and current, exit the season in a positive way as we transition to the next season, but do that in a way that protects the brand equity and the consumer size.

And so we're d are seeing real strength in the wholesale channel in Europe, and we're chasing the catch-up with the reorder rate there. In the U.S, I think we're being cautious, given the environment that we're facing.

The Polo Women's business, we launched, I guess, about, a year ago. And we've seen what I would say as good results to date. The business has been stronger internationally than it has in the U.S. as we've started off. In the international markets, in Europe and in Asia, we largely replace the Blue label business that was discontinued, and we took many of the locations that were Blue label locations and converted them to Women's Polo locations. And that business, the Women's Polo business, is now, not only surpassed the size of the Blue Label business, but at price points that are below where Blue Label was. So the unit velocity of the Blue Label, of the Polo women's business internationally is more than double the unit velocity rate of the Blue Label business. And we see significant expansion opportunities for distribution of Women's Polo around the world. In the U.S, where we didn't have a very well-developed Blue Label business, we launched Women's Polo in incremental spaces into the marketplace. I think we're off to a good start in that business. We see it as a critical element of the company's future growth strategy. And we're working to take learnings from the initial seasons and develop them into the line as part of the line planning process that we're kicking off for Women's Polo as we go forward. So I think we're encouraged by the start that we've had, but there's more to do. And certainly, a lot more opportunity ahead of us because, as you know, the women's fashion apparel business is bigger than men's. And with the strength of the Polo brand and the strength of Polo Men's, we continue to see a big opportunity in Polo Women's."

So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we started with a pilot of the line planning process on the Men's Polo line, which is our biggest line for fall of 2016, and we've now largely completed that pilot process. And it's interesting because the way that we did the pilot process is we started with a high and citing approach at looking at prior seasons, we also then engaged all of the region and channel leaders around the world to bring in consumer input and feedback into develop, which we used to develop category and classification strategies and develop specific targets for price points, margins, SKUs by category and classification, which then led to an architecture that we handed off to the design community. And I have to say the design community did an outstanding job of using that feedback and designing a line that is very compelling. So that lie that was designed has now been shared back with the regions and the channel teams. And the response from the region and channel teams has been terrific to the design community's progress in terms of product innovation. I'm not going to talk about all of the product innovation at this point because I don't want to give away too much of our secrets. But I referenced a couple of the items that you're going to see as we move into the fall of '16 Men's Polo line. We are going to see us having lighter weight fabrics, a more wear now sensibility. About half of the Polo distribution is in warm weather climate locations. And we felt like we have a big opportunity to design into that so that both, for the early part of the fall season and the northern climates stores and the majority of the fall season in the warm climate source, we had product that was more compelling, more innovative and more attractive for those target locations. And I think we've delivered on that. There's a series of themes like that, that you're going to see as we go through that. So that's where we are really for the fall process on the line planning process. we're really kicking off of the line planning process for the spring 2017 season for the majority of the balance of the brands and categories. And so I expect that we'll see similar results for the spring 2017 season as we get through the process on the other brands."

And then, secondly, just a question on e-commerce margins because it's managed by partners right now, but as you go live with your own websites in the coming years, what kind of margin upticks should we expect from bringing it in-house?"

And this compared to the 2% increase we had in the first choir. So we were encouraged by the acceleration of revenue growth in the e-commerce channel. I think that we continue to stay true to our promotional cadence, where, as I mentioned on the last call, we decided to pull back a little bit in terms of the amount of business that we were doing on sale. But what we have this quarter were some omni-channel initiatives like buy online, ship from store, hold online pickup in-store, the new weightless functionality and product videos that drove higher average order value. And the combination of those you on the channel initiatives, I think of is what drove the return to stronger growth. And that was true both internationally, but also true in the North America e-commerce business. Relative to the profitability, today, we pay eBay Enterprises or the formally GSI, 1% of revenue for the service that they're providing. That's a percent of e-commerce revenue. In addition to that, we're incurring charges associated with in sourcing the platform. Once we convert off of the GSI platform to our in-sourced platform, that GSI fee will go to 0. And so we're effectively double paying, if you will, today for both in-house and outsourced capability. We expect to convert off of the eBay GSI platform over the next 12 to 18 months. So I think you'll see us double paying for a 12 to 18-month period, and then you'll see us start to generate the benefit after that. The other point I would make is we expect the in-sourced capability and cost to be lower than that GSI fee that we are paying. So it's not just that we're getting more capability, but we're getting more capability at a lower going cost structure."

So I think it's a little bit early to talk about the consumer reaction to the price increase. But I'll give you a little bit of what we are seeing and it's encouraging because we did see, and as you know, we took a sort of mid- to high single-digit price increases in the -- to respond to the currency devaluation in Europe, in Canada, in Japan and in Australia, which were the markets that were the most affected by the evaluation. In Europe, which is the largest market that we take in price increases in, we still haven't got the product on the floor in front of consumers. But we have gone through a wholesale market with the higher prices. And what we've seen from that market from wholesale orders is that the wholesale orders have been actually in line with our previous growth rate in terms of unit volume. And so the pricing has come on top of the unit volume. And so we're encouraged by that from a sell-in perspective. We're seeing that the pricing isn't a barrier to a strong sell in the wholesale channel. We're also hearing that many of the competitors are taking pricing in the market as well, but we don't yet have the consumer read of what is the consumer reaction when that product shows up on the retail and wholesale force. I expect that will get some early indication of that over the next 3 months or so. And then, on the question on longer-term margins. Certainly, we're very encouraged by the line planning work that we've done, the SKU reduction opportunity, the global brand reorganization from a cost savings, and from a efficiency of operation. I think it's a little bit too soon to say what that means for longer-term margins. But certainly, we believe all of these things can contribute to a margin improvement story over the next 3 to 5 years. And so we are very much shooting for an operating margin story over that time period as many of these initiatives begin to take hold."

I do think if you look at Europe and the U.S. combined from a wholesale perspective, I think our view is that, that channel is going to grow at sort of a low single-digit rate. We continue to believe that we can grow market share in that channel by entering new product categories and innovating on our product lines. So we think we might be able to grow a couple of points faster than the channel as we gain market share, which we are greeted consistently that over the last 5 to 10 years. And then I think our direct consumer strategy of e-commerce and retail expansion is likely to remain a disproportionate growth driver for us going forward."

We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected second quarter results this morning. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% and diluted earnings per share was up 13% versus year ago, excluding one",1752,"Thanks, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected second quarter results this morning. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% and diluted earnings per share was up 13% versus year ago, excluding onetime charges. Profits were significantly better than our expectations entering the quarter, driven by stronger-than-expected operating margins. This was driven by both gross margin and SG&A improvement. 
On gross margins, we are beginning to benefit from the initial phases of the SKU and style rationalization, lower negotiated sourcing cost, increased full price sell-throughs and mix benefit. SG&A was also significantly better than forecast due to earlier-than-expected cost savings from the global brand reorganization and disciplined expense management. We are pleased to see margin benefits from these initiatives already and expect to see top line benefits as well as the new global line planning process is implemented.
Now let me provide an overview of the quarter. We continue to see the impact of currency movements on foreign tourist traffic around the world. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced foreign tourist traffic in the U.S., while the weaker euro and Japanese yen had the opposite effect in those markets. In Europe, our revenue was up double digits in constant currency, similar to the first quarter. Growth was driven by increased sales to both local customers and tourists.
Wholesale demand was particularly strong with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. All brands across the portfolio performed well, and by region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best. In Asia, second quarter revenue was up 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in Japan, China, Southeast Asia and Australia. We are successfully elevating our brand in these markets through targeted merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives.
Full price selling is up year-over-year, driving better sales and margins. We are achieving market share gains through success with local customers, as well as increased tourist traffic. Korea, Hong Kong and Macau all were negatively impacted by reduced tourist traffic, and Korea trends started to improve as the lingering effect of the MERS outbreak diminished.
In the Americas, net revenue was up 2% in constant currency. Sales trends were impacted by the continued decline of traffic to both our retail stores and department stores, driven by lower foreign tourist traffic and an unseasonably warm start to the fall season. Within our retail store network, we were able to partially offset the traffic declines by driving increased conversion through successful merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives.
Our global e-commerce sales were up 10% in the second quarter, driven by our international business. In North America e-commerce, we saw improved trends compared to the first quarter. We made several enhancements in our omni-channel capabilities, including the launch of buy online, ship from store; and hold online, pickup in store; and a new feature where customers can be added to a waitlist if we are sold out of a size or color.
We also added product videos that are driving a higher average order value. Within the global factory outlet channel, results were mixed. Europe saw increased traffic and conversion rates leading to strong comp store sales growth. The U.S. continued to see traffic declines due to fewer foreign tourists. Importantly, in the U.S., in locations where domestic customers represent more of the traffic, we achieved positive comps driven by improved conversion rates that were the result of successful marketing and in-store initiative.
As we plan the second half of fiscal 2016, we are taking a prudent approach given the slow start to fall in the U.S., fueled by unseasonably warm weather and continued declines in foreign tourist traffic. We believe inventory in the North America department store channel is elevated. And as a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. Bob will share more details on our second half guidance. 
Now let me provide an update on our key strategic initiatives, starting with the transition to our new global brand management structure. We made excellent progress in the quarter with all 6 brand presidents and their leadership teams now in place, our new global line planning process well underway and the clarification of decision rights across brands, regions and channels. The global line planning process is one of the most important elements of the new operating model as it impacts the way we design, merchandise and plan our assortments.
The men's Polo brand successfully piloted this new process as the team planned for the fall 2016 season. The team began with input from the regions and channels, and a view of the successes and opportunities of the prior season. This led into category and classification strategies to start the design process. When the new line was completed several weeks ago, the positive impact of the process was evident, yielding significant product innovation, greater global brand consistency, and style and SKU reductions.
For example, for Fall 2016, Polo will feature lighter weight fabrics in a more wear now sensibility for warm weather stores and early deliveries in northern climate stores. There will also be more elevated product, including more sport coats and dress furnishings, as these elements have seen strong sales in our retail stores. We expect a double-digit reduction in SKUs compared to the same season last year, and this is on top of the reduction we achieved in fall 2015. So we are very encouraged by this progress.
We will be rolling out the global line planning process to other brands over the coming weeks as we kick off the design and development process for the spring 2017 season, and we believe there will be tremendous benefit across our portfolio. The success of the men's Polo pilot has led to enthusiasm and confidence among the brand teams as to the benefits this new way of working will have on the strength of our assortments and the efficiency of our operation.
We continue to expect a significant reduction in SKUs and sample and design cost, which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins and meaningful SG&A cost savings across the brand portfolio over the next 18 to 24 months.
We have also initiated a new global brand strategic planning process that will be completed over the next few months. This will be the first time we will have a holistic strategic view by brand across all geographies and channels of distribution. We are raising our estimate for annual expense savings associated with the restructure to $110 million from $100 million, given the progress we have made in the global brand restructuring effort as well as incremental store closures we have identified. As a result, we expect a higher restructuring charge of $120 million to $150 million versus our previous estimate of $70 million to $100 million. This increase also includes the impact of recent management changes and onetime charges primarily related to litigation settlements.
Turning to our direct-to-consumer growth strategy. We are expanding our reach through new store openings and elevating our presentation through renovation activity in our existing fleet. In the second quarter, we renovated our Ralph Lauren store in South Coast Plaza, which will reopen shortly, and we will be starting renovations at our Beverly Hills flagship store. These activities will reinforce our luxury presence and elevate our positioning in the Los Angeles market.
For Polo, we opened 5 new directly operated stores in the quarter, including 2 in the U.S. and 3 in Asia. We also made progress with repositioning select stores to either Ralph Lauren Luxury or the Polo concept in North America. We expect this effort to drive better alignment and clarity by brand as well as improved store productivity and efficiency.
Across all brands and concepts, we opened 14 directly operated stores in the second quarter as well as several licensed locations and concessions. This brings us to a total of 20 new directly operated stores for the first half of the year, and we are on track to open 40 to 50 new stores for fiscal 2016, which will provide mid single-digit square footage growth taking into account planned store closings.
Let me turn to some product highlights for the quarter. We previously announced the clarification of our luxury product offering through the merging of women's and men's Black Label into Ralph Lauren Collection and Purple Label. The first season of the merge line is delivering now and the reception is very positive. We are already seeing the efficiencies of this strategy through a reduction in product development and sample costs, and we expect a strong selling season.
In our accessories business, we continue to gain momentum with our iconic Ricky collection in both existing and new silhouettes and styles. We also saw double-digit comp growth in scarves, jewelry and belts, and are continuing to focus on these categories for disproportionate growth.
Now let me turn to Polo Sport, which launched in our retail stores and select department stores worldwide in August and was followed in October by a launch in 75 top DICK'S Sporting Good stores and on dickssportinggoods.com. We kicked off the launch with the introduction of the Polo texture at the US Open tennis tournament. The shirt, which features industry-leading advancements in wearable technology, has already generated more than 3.1 billion media impressions and continues to receive strong editorial attention. This was followed by powerful video content leveraged across all distribution channels. 
The early read on Polo Sport is positive, and we have already incorporated initial learning from this first season in the go-forward development. We believe Polo Sport will be a significant business for us as consumer's growing desire for performance and as leisure product fits perfectly with the DNA of the Polo brand. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made this year, and we are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make thoughtful strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me say that we are all excited to have Stefan joining as our new CEO. And on behalf of Ralph, myself and the entire senior management team, we would like to recognize and thank Jacki Nemerov for all of her contributions over the past 11 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Gross profit margin was 56.5% in the second quarter. This was 30 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. On a constant currency basis, gross margin was up 90 basis points compared to the prior year due to lower negotiated sourcing costs, benefit from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, increased full price selling and mix benefits.
Operating margin in the second quarter was 13.5%, excluding onetime charges, 90 basis points below the prior year. This is significantly better than the outlook we provided of a 275 to 325 basis point decline in August. The operating margin was favorable to our guidance due to better-than-expected gross margin, cost savings from the global brand organization plan and disciplined expense management. The lower operating margin to the prior year was attributable to negative foreign currency effects and incremental investments and infrastructure. 
Net income for the second quarter was $184 million or $2.13 per diluted share, excluding onetime charges. Earnings per share grew 13% to the prior year period, excluding foreign currency impacts and onetime charges. On a reported basis, net income was $160 million or $1.86 per diluted share in the second quarter. The effective tax rate of 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis was slightly below our guidance of 30% due to discrete tax items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. Wholesale revenue was supported by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe with strength across all brands. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $927 million were 2% below the prior year period. Wholesale operating margins in the second quarter was 26.8%, excluding onetime charges. This was 60 basis points above the prior year period driven by gross margin improvement and disciplined expense management.
Retail sales increased 5% in constant currency to $996 million in the second quarter. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. Comparable-store sales declined 1% in constant currency and declined 6% on a reported basis.
International same-store sales were positive with particular strength in Europe, Japan, China and Australia with comps declined in North America as traffic was pressured by the strong U.S. dollar in the overall retail environment. Our e-commerce trend improved somewhat from last quarter, but was offset by our brick-and-mortar comp, which was down 2% to 3% similar to last quarter. 
Within e-commerce, our international business continued to post strong double-digit gains. Excluding onetime charges, retail operating margins in the second quarter was 12.8%, which was 80 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting fixed expense deleverage and negative foreign currency effects.
Licensing revenues increased 7% in constant currency in the second quarter and licensing operating income was in line with the prior year period. Moving on to the balance sheet. 
Consolidated inventory was $1.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new store openings and increase shipments of Polo Sport and Polo Women's. At the end of the second quarter, we had 32 more directly operated stores and 82 more concessions in the chain in a year ago, which is contributing to the growth. We feel comfortable with our inventory levels and the quality of our inventory. 
Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $134 million in the second quarter compared to $91 million in the prior year period. The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter at a cost of $130 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $280 million. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $300 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $727 million of total debt. This reflects the new $300 million senior note offering we completed in August.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. As Chris mentioned, we are taking a prudent approach to planning the balance of the fiscal year. As a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect reported revenues to be approximately flat for the year, driven by a 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth and 400 basis points of negative impact form foreign currency based on current exchange rates.
The constant currency growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives, which we have invested in over the last several years as well as the actions we are taking to mitigate negative currency impacts, including raising pricing for the spring 2016 season in Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia.
Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than Wholesale. As a reminder, we have a 53rd week in fiscal 2016. 
Moving on to operating income. On a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 100 to 230 basis points below fiscal year '15's levels due to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes onetime charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization. We expect these onetime charges to approximately $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016, of which $38 million was recognized in the second quarter and $83 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. This is higher than the estimate we shared previously of $70 million to $100 million, due to inclusion of additional charges associated with the recently announced management changes and additional restructuring activities. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to grow 0% to 2% on a reported basis. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the third quarter to be 250 basis points. Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be 200 to 250 basis points below the prior year period due to negative foreign currency effects and infrastructure investments.
Our third quarter tax rate is estimated at 31%. Overall, we are pleased with the better-than-expected second quarter results. Disciplined planning and rigorous attention to the day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds in addition to driving our strategic initiatives forward.

So I was a little surprised by the magnitude of the gross margin improvement from the SKU improvement you guys made this early considering you tossed the rollout of the global SKU program will really be only in place for one brand, Polo, I think, by fall of 2016. It sounds like you went through a smaller manual process today, and it translates to a lot of improvement. Can you give us any quantitative metrics to help us think about how much you lowered SKUs by this quarter and how that may -- with the magnitude of that is relative to what we're going to see next year in the fall as you roll it out? And then as a follow-up, we've -- you've had us focused on some investment buckets for the past few years. You've commented on e-commerce and ASP has been peaking this year. I think you'll have less intensity and flagship openings next year, so maybe the retail investment isn't quite as intense. But maybe if we start adding up those buckets again, can you give us your early thoughts based on the components as you see them today for the ability to leverage margins in fiscal '17?"

So let me take the first part of that first. So I think the results obviously came in significantly better than we expected this quarter when we gave guidance on the quarter. And really about -- we beat the operating margin expectation that we have",622,"Sure. So let me take the first part of that first. So I think the results obviously came in significantly better than we expected this quarter when we gave guidance on the quarter. And really about -- we beat the operating margin expectation that we have by about 200 basis points. And if you look at that beat, about half of it was due to gross margin and half of it was due to SG&A. And it was really a function of a number of items. On the gross margin side, we did see benefits from the SKU and style rationalization. And you're right that we tackled that when we started the global merchandising group about a year or 2 ago in a manual way. We're just scratching the surface of that, I would say, at this point, because the systemic approach to the style and SKU rationalization is really what's coming in the global line planning process, which is going to -- which was going to kick in 12 to 18 months from now. So I would say if you looked at men's Polo for fall of 2015, we might have been down a low double-digit percentage of styles and SKUs. And then when you look at fall 2016, we're expecting again, even versus that lower base, another improvement of equal magnitude. And I think on many of the other brands, we've had an initial -- a little bit of a progress, but I think there's more progress ahead of us going forward as we move into the line planning process. We also, on the gross margin side, though, benefited from the lower negotiated sourcing costs. If you recall, when we took the big foreign exchange hurt back earlier this calendar year, we commissioned our manufacturing and sourcing group to go back to our sourcing and supply chain base. And that sourcing discussion and cost discussion has resulted in average unit cost reductions that came a little bit bigger than we expected and faster. And then we also benefited from improved full price sell-throughs during the quarter. So all of that kind of went in the positive direction, which led to the gross margin improvement. Relative to next fiscal year, I think we are just about to kick off the budgeting process. So it's premature to give guidance on next fiscal year. We'll provide qualitative perspective at our next call. But your comment is accurate in that certainly, from an infrastructure standpoint, we expect the e-commerce replatforming spend to be higher next year as we ramp up the work on moving to the new e-commerce platform. But we do expect the SAP spending to moderate, though. I expect infrastructure in total to not be a significant year-over-year driver. The retail investment also, I don't expect to be a year-over-year driver because we're at about the rate of new store openings that we anticipate going forward. I do think that we're going to see foreign exchange impact next year continuing primarily on the transactional side because the hedging program that we had in place this year will roll off over the next 9 to 12 months. So we'll see a transactional hit, although the translational impact should be small to nonexisting at current rate. But then we're going to start to see some of the benefits from all of the restructuring work that we've done, both from the global brand restructuring, from the line planning and from the pricing actions that we put in place that should start to roll in over the next 12 months. So we'll provide more specifics on how all of that nets against each under on the next call, but that's where we stand at the moment."

So when we look at our inventory, the currency of our inventory is very well positioned from a current season and future season basis versus a prior season inventory. The inventory growth that we've had in our inventory versus year ago is really to support new store activity and new product introductions, like Polo Sport, around the world. When we look at the U.S. department store channel, I think that's the place where we see a little bit of elevated inventory across the channel that is not just in our business, but in -- broadly defined in many of the competitors. And I think it's a function of the foreign tourist traffic being down in the U.S. as well as of the unseasonably warm start to the fall season. And so as we approach the holiday selling period, which is obviously the biggest selling period of the year for our industry, we felt like it was in the right thing to take a prudent approach to that given where we're headed. We've got a long history of navigating through this in a very strong way. And we've got real expertise within the company to help us do this. And what we're trying to do is keep our inventory fresh and current, exit the season in a positive way as we transition to the next season, but do that in a way that protects the brand equity in the consumer's eyes.

We have not seen cancellation in orders. And in fact, if you look broadly across the business, it's really a mixed environment. In Europe, our reorder rate is stronger than it's ever been. And so we're seeing real strength in the wholesale channel in Europe, and we're chasing the catch-up with the reorder rate there.

The Polo Women's business, we launched, I guess, about, a year ago. And we've seen what I would say as good results to date. The business has been stronger internationally than it has in the U.S. as we've started off. In the international markets, in Europe and in Asia, we largely replace the Blue Label business that was discontinued, and we took many of the locations that were Blue Label locations and converted them to Women's Polo locations. And that business, the Women's Polo business, is now, not only surpassed the size of the Blue Label business, but at price points that are below where Blue Label was. So the unit velocity of the Blue Label, of the Polo Women's business internationally is more than double the unit velocity rate of the Blue Label business. And we see significant expansion opportunities for distribution of Women's Polo around the world. In the U.S., where we didn't have a very well-developed Blue Label business, we launched Women's Polo in incremental spaces into the marketplace. I think we're off to a good start in that business. We see it as a critical element of the company's future growth strategy. And we're working to take learnings from the initial seasons and develop them into the line as part of the line planning process that we're kicking off for Women's Polo as we go forward. So I think we're encouraged by the start that we've had, but there's more to do and certainly, a lot more opportunity ahead of us because, as you know, the women's fashion apparel business is bigger than men's. And with the strength of the Polo brand and the strength of Polo men's, we continue to see a big opportunity in Polo women's."

So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we started with a pilot of the line planning process on the Men's Polo line, which is our biggest line for fall of 2016, and we've now largely completed that pilot process. And it's interesting because the way that we did the pilot process is we started with a hindsighting approach of looking at prior seasons. We also then engaged all of the region and channel leaders around the world to bring in consumer input and feedback into develop -- which we used to develop category and classification strategies and develop specific targets for price points, margins, SKUs by category and classification, which then led to an architecture that we handed off to the design community. And I have to say the design community did an outstanding job of using that feedback and designing a line that is very compelling. So that line that was designed has now been shared back with the regions and the channel teams. And the response from the region and channel teams has been terrific to the design community's progress in terms of product innovation. I'm not going to talk about all of the product innovation at this point because I don't want to give away too much of our secrets. But I referenced a couple of the items that are -- that you're going to see as we move into the fall of '16 men's Polo line. You are going to see us having lighter weight fabrics, a more wear-now sensibility. About half of the Polo distribution is in warm weather climate locations. And we felt like we had a big opportunity to design into that so that both, for the early part of the fall season and the northern climate stores and the majority of the fall season in the warm climate stores, we had product that was more compelling, more innovative and more attractive for those target locations. And I think we've delivered on that. And there's a series of themes like that, that you're going to see as we go through that. So that's where we are really for the fall process on the line planning process. we're really kicking off the line planning process for the spring 2017 season for the majority of the balance of the brands and categories. And so I expect that we'll see similar results for the spring 2017 season as we get through the process on the other brands."

So the global e-commerce revenue was up 10% in the second quarter, and this compared to the 2% increase we had in the first quarter. So we were encouraged by the acceleration of revenue growth in the e-commerce channel. I think that we continued to stay true to our promotional cadence, where, as I mentioned on the last call, we decided to pull back a little bit in terms of the amount of business that we were doing on sale. But what we have this quarter were some omni-channel initiatives like buy online, ship from store, hold online, pick up in store, the new weightless functionality and product videos that drove higher average order value. And the combination of those new omni-channel initiatives, I think, is what drove the return to stronger growth. And that was true both internationally, but also true in the North America e-commerce business. Relative to the profitability, today, we pay eBay Enterprises, or the formerly GSI, 1% of revenue for the service that they're providing. That's a percent of e-commerce revenue. In addition to that, we're incurring charges associated with in-sourcing the platform. Once we convert off of the GSI platform to our in-sourced platform, that GSI fee will go to 0. And so we're effectively double paying, if you will, today for both in-house and outsourced capability. We expect to convert off of the eBay or GSI platform over the next 12 to 18 months. So I think you'll see us double paying for a 12- to 18-month period, and then you'll see us start to generate the benefit after that. The other point I would make is we expect the in-sourced capability and cost to be lower than the GSI fee that we're paying. So it's not just that we're getting more capability, but we're getting more capability at a lower going cost structure."

If there's any read that gives you more or less confidence that consumers will also accept them. And then second, Chris, if you could just touch on now that you're actually seeing some of the benefits from the work you've been doing over the last several quarters and improving efficiencies, line planning, SKU reduction and all that sort of stuff, whether you have sort of fresh perspective on what the margin recovery opportunity is for the business over the longer term as all of these things that you sound so encouraged by and all the long-term opportunity to improve efficiency really come through."

So I think it's a little bit early to talk about the consumer reaction to the price increase, but I'll give you a little bit of what we're seeing. And it's encouraging because we did see, and as you know, we took sort of mid- to high single-digit price increases in the -- to respond to the currency devaluation in Europe, in Canada, in Japan and in Australia, which were the markets that were the most affected by the devaluation. In Europe, which is the largest market that we take in price increases in, we still haven't got the product on the floor in front of consumers. But we have gone through a wholesale market with the higher prices. And what we've seen from that market from wholesale orders is that the wholesale orders have been actually in line with our previous growth rate in terms of unit volume. And so the pricing has come on top of the unit volume. And so we're encouraged by that from a sell-in perspective. We're seeing that the pricing isn't a barrier to strong sell-in in the wholesale channel. We're also hearing that many of the competitors are taking pricing in the market as well, but we don't yet have the consumer read of what is the consumer reaction when that product shows up on the retail and wholesale floors. I expect that we'll get some early indication of that over the next 3 months or so. And then, on the question on longer-term margins, certainly, we're very encouraged by the line planning work that we've done, the SKU reduction opportunity, the global brand reorganization from a cost savings, and from an efficiency of operation. I think it's a little bit too soon to say what that means for longer-term margins, but certainly, we believe all of these things can contribute to a margin improvement story over the next 3 to 5 years. And so we are very much shooting for an operating margin improvement story over that time period as many of these initiatives begin to take hold."

So I think we're trying to manage the business in a volatile period, where we are seeing significant moves and tourist traffic around the world. I do think if you look at Europe and the U.S. combined from a wholesale perspective, I think our view is that, that channel is going to grow at sort of a low single-digit rate. We continue to believe that we can grow market share in that channel by entering new product categories and innovating on our product lines. So we think we might be able to grow a couple of points faster than the channel as we gain market share, which we've pretty consistently done over the last 5 to 10 years. And then, I think our direct-to-consumer strategy of e-commerce and retail expansion is likely to remain a disproportionate growth driver for us going forward."

The global brand teams have been in place now for only a couple of months. And so I think they're both getting up to speed on the business, implementing line plans for the first time, developing brand strategies. We're starting to get brand financial reporting up to enable those teams to really manage the business on a more real-time basis. And so I think we're making progress, but there's more work to do."

We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected second quarter results this morning. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% and diluted earnings per share was up 13% versus year ago, excluding one",1751,"Thanks, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected second quarter results this morning. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% and diluted earnings per share was up 13% versus year ago, excluding onetime charges. Profits were significantly better than our expectations entering the quarter, driven by stronger-than-expected operating margins. This was driven by both gross margin and SG&A improvement. 
On gross margins, we are beginning to benefit from the initial phases of the SKU and style rationalization, lower negotiated sourcing cost, increased full price sell-throughs and mix benefit. SG&A was also significantly better than forecast due to earlier-than-expected cost savings from the global brand reorganization and disciplined expense management. We are pleased to see margin benefits from these initiatives already and expect to see top line benefits as well, as the new global line planning process is implemented.
Now let me provide an overview of the quarter. We continued to see the impact of currency movements on foreign tourist traffic around the world. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced foreign tourist traffic in the U.S., while the weaker euro and Japanese yen had the opposite effect in those markets. In Europe, our revenue was up double digits in constant currency, similar to the first quarter. Growth was driven by increased sales to both local customers and tourists.
Wholesale demand was particularly strong with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. All brands across the portfolio performed well, and by region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best. In Asia, second quarter revenue was up 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in Japan, China, Southeast Asia and Australia. We are successfully elevating our brand in these markets through targeted merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives.
Full price selling is up year-over-year, driving better sales and margins. We are achieving market share gains through success with local customers, as well as increased tourist traffic. Korea, Hong Kong and Macau all were negatively impacted by reduced tourist traffic. In Korea trends started to improve as the lingering effect of the MERS outbreak diminished.
In the Americas, net revenue was up 2% in constant currency. Sales trends were impacted by the continued decline of traffic to both our retail stores and department stores, driven by lower foreign tourist traffic and an unseasonably warm start to the fall season. Within our retail store network, we were able to partially offset the traffic declines by driving increased conversion through successful merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives.
Our global e-commerce sales were up 10% in the second quarter, driven by our international business. In North America e-commerce, we saw improved trends compared to the first quarter. We made several enhancements in our omni-channel capabilities, including the launch of buy online, ship from store; and hold online, pick up in store; and a new feature where customers can be added to a wait list if we are sold out of a size or color.
We also added product videos that are driving a higher average order value. Within the global factory outlet channel, results were mixed. Europe saw increased traffic and conversion rates leading to strong comp store sales growth. The U.S. continued to see traffic declines due to fewer foreign tourists. Importantly, in the U.S., in locations where domestic customers represent more of the traffic, we achieved positive comps driven by improved conversion rates that were the result of successful marketing and in-store initiatives.
As we plan the second half of fiscal 2016, we are taking a prudent approach given the slow start to fall in the U.S., fueled by unseasonably warm weather and continued declines in foreign tourist traffic. We believe inventory in the North America department store channel is elevated. And as a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. Bob will share more details on our second half guidance. 
Now let me provide an update on our key strategic initiatives, starting with the transition to our new global brand management structure. We made excellent progress in the quarter, with all 6 brand presidents and their leadership teams now in place, our new global line planning process well underway and the clarification of decision rights across brands, regions and channels. The global line planning process is one of the most important elements of the new operating model as it impacts the way we design, merchandise and plan our assortments.
The men's Polo brand successfully piloted this new process as the team planned for the fall 2016 season. The team began with input from the regions and channels, and a view of the successes and opportunities of the prior season. This led into category and classification strategies to start the design process. When the new line was completed several weeks ago, the positive impact of the process was evident, yielding significant product innovation, greater global brand consistency, and style and SKU reductions.
For example, for Fall 2016, Polo will feature lighter weight fabrics and a more wear-now sensibility for warm weather stores and early deliveries in northern climate stores. There will also be more elevated product, including more sport coats and dress furnishings, as these elements have seen strong sales in our retail stores. We expect a double-digit reduction in SKUs compared to the same season last year, and this is on top of the reduction we achieved in fall 2015. So we are very encouraged by this progress.
We will be rolling out the global line planning process to other brands over the coming weeks as we kick off the design and development process for the spring 2017 season, and we believe there will be tremendous benefit across our portfolio. The success of the men's Polo pilot has led to enthusiasm and confidence among the brand teams as to the benefits this new way of working will have on the strength of our assortments and the efficiency of our operation.
We continue to expect a significant reduction in SKUs and sample and design cost, which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins and meaningful SG&A cost savings across the brand portfolio over the next 18 to 24 months.
We have also initiated a new global brand strategic planning process that will be completed over the next few months. This will be the first time we will have a holistic strategic view by brand across all geographies and channels of distribution. We are raising our estimate for annual expense savings associated with the restructure to $110 million from $100 million, given the progress we have made in the global brand restructuring effort, as well as incremental store closures we have identified. As a result, we expect a higher restructuring charge of $120 million to $150 million versus our previous estimate of $70 million to $100 million. This increase also includes the impact of recent management changes and onetime charges primarily related to litigation settlements.
Turning to our direct-to-consumer growth strategy. We are expanding our reach through new store openings and elevating our presentation through renovation activity in our existing fleet. In the second quarter, we renovated our Ralph Lauren store in South Coast Plaza, which will reopen shortly, and we will be starting renovations at our Beverly Hills flagship store. These activities will reinforce our luxury presence and elevate our positioning in the Los Angeles market.
For Polo, we opened 5 new directly operated stores in the quarter, including 2 in the U.S. and 3 in Asia. We also made progress with repositioning select stores to either Ralph Lauren Luxury or the Polo concept in North America. We expect this effort to drive better alignment and clarity by brand as well as improved store productivity and efficiency.
Across all brands and concepts, we opened 14 directly operated stores in the second quarter as well as several licensed locations and concessions. This brings us to a total of 20 new directly operated stores for the first half of the year, and we are on track to open 40 to 50 new stores for fiscal 2016, which will provide mid single-digit square footage growth, taking into account planned store closings.
Let me turn to some product highlights for the quarter. We previously announced the clarification of our luxury product offering through the merging of women's and men's Black Label into Ralph Lauren Collection and Purple Label. The first season of the merged line is delivering now and the reception is very positive. We are already seeing the efficiencies of this strategy through a reduction in product development and sample costs, and we expect a strong selling season.
In our accessories business, we continue to gain momentum with our iconic Ricky collection in both existing and new silhouettes and styles. We also saw double-digit comp growth in scarves, jewelry and belts, and are continuing to focus on these categories for disproportionate growth.
Now let me turn to Polo Sport, which launched in our retail stores and select department stores worldwide in August and was followed in October by a launch in 75 top DICK'S Sporting Good stores and on dickssportinggoods.com. We kicked off the launch with the introduction of the PoloTech Shirt at the US Open tennis tournament. The shirt, which features industry-leading advancements in wearable technology, has already generated more than 3.1 billion media impressions and continues to receive strong editorial attention. This was followed by powerful video content leveraged across all distribution channels. 
The early read on Polo Sport is positive, and we have already incorporated initial learning from this first season into go-forward development. We believe Polo Sport will be a significant business for us as consumers' growing desire for performance and athleisure product fits perfectly with the DNA of the Polo brand. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made this year, and we are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make thoughtful, strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me say that we are all excited to have Stefan joining as our new CEO. And on behalf of Ralph, myself and the entire senior management team, we would like to recognize and thank Jacki Nemerov for all of her contributions over the past 11 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I'd like to begin with a brief recap of the quarter. Second quarter net revenues were up 4% to the prior year on a constant currency basis, driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally, as well as the contribution of new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. This is in line with the guidance we provided of 3% to 5% constant currency growth in August. 
The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, largely in line with the expectations. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 1% to $2 billion in the second quarter. Gross profit margin was 56.5% in the second quarter. This was 30 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. On a constant currency basis, gross margin was up 90 basis points compared to the prior year due to lower negotiated sourcing costs, benefit from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, increased full price selling and mix benefits.
Operating margin in the second quarter was 13.5%, excluding onetime charges, 90 basis points below the prior year. This is significantly better than the outlook we provided of a 275 to 325 basis point decline in August. The operating margin was favorable to our guidance due to better-than-expected gross margin, cost savings from the global brand organization plan and disciplined expense management. The lower operating margin to the prior year was attributable to negative foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure. 
Net income for the second quarter was $184 million or $2.13 per diluted share, excluding onetime charges. Earnings per share grew 13% to the prior year period, excluding foreign currency impacts and onetime charges. On a reported basis, net income was $160 million or $1.86 per diluted share in the second quarter. The effective tax rate of 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis was slightly below our guidance of 30% due to discrete tax items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues increased 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. Wholesale revenue was supported by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe with strength across all brands. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $927 million were 2% below the prior year period. Wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.8%, excluding onetime charges. This was 60 basis points above the prior year period, driven by gross margin improvement and disciplined expense management.
Retail sales increased 5% in constant currency to $996 million in the second quarter. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. Comparable-store sales declined 1% in constant currency and declined 6% on a reported basis.
International same-store sales were positive, with particular strength in Europe, Japan, China and Australia, but comps declined in North America as traffic was pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and the overall retail environment. Our e-commerce trend improved somewhat from last quarter, but was offset by our brick-and-mortar comp, which was down 2% to 3%, similar to last quarter. 
Within e-commerce, our international business continued to post strong double-digit gains. Excluding onetime charges, retail operating margin in the second quarter was 12.8%, which was 80 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting fixed expense deleverage and negative foreign currency effects.
Licensing revenues increased 7% in constant currency in the second quarter and licensing operating income was in line with the prior year period. Moving on to the balance sheet. 
Consolidated inventory was $1.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new store openings and increase shipments of Polo Sport and Polo Women's. At the end of the second quarter, we had 32 more directly operated stores and 82 more concessions in the chain than a year ago, which is contributing to the growth. We feel comfortable with our inventory levels and the quality of our inventory. 
Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $134 million in the second quarter compared to $91 million in the prior year period. The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter at a cost of $130 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $280 million. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $300 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $727 million of total debt. This reflects the new $300 million senior note offering we completed in August.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. As Chris mentioned, we are taking a prudent approach to planning the balance of the fiscal year. As a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect reported revenues to be approximately flat for the year, driven by a 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth and 400 basis points of negative impact from foreign currency, based on current exchange rates.
The constant currency growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives which we have invested in over the last several years as well as the actions we are taking to mitigate negative currency impacts, including raising pricing for the spring 2016 season in Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia.
Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than Wholesale. As a reminder, we have a 53rd week in fiscal 2016. 
Moving on to operating income. On a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 100 to 230 basis points below fiscal year '15's levels due to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes onetime charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization. We expect these onetime charges to approximate $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016, of which $38 million was recognized in the second quarter and $83 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. This is higher than the estimate we shared previously of $70 million to $100 million, due to inclusion of additional charges associated with the recently announced management changes and additional restructuring activities. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to grow 0% to 2% on a reported basis. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the third quarter to be 250 basis points. Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be 200 to 250 basis points below the prior year period due to negative foreign currency effects and infrastructure investments.
The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 31%. Overall, we are pleased with the better-than-expected second quarter results. Disciplined planning and rigorous attention to the day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds in addition to driving our strategic initiatives forward.

So I was a little surprised by the magnitude of the gross margin improvement from the SKU improvement you guys made this early, considering you told us the rollout of the global SKU program would really be only in place for one brand, Polo, I think, by fall of 2016. It sounds like you went through a smaller manual process today, and it translated to a lot of improvement. Can you give us any quantitative metrics to help us think about how much you lowered SKUs by this quarter and how that may -- what the magnitude of that is relative to what we're going to see next year in the fall as you roll it out? And then as a follow-up, we've -- you've had us focused on some investment buckets for the past few years. You've commented on e-commerce and SAP spend peaking this year. I think you'll have less intensity and flagship openings next year, so maybe the retail investment isn't quite as intense. But maybe if we start adding up those buckets again, can you give us your early thoughts based on the components as you see them today for the ability to leverage margins in fiscal '17?"

So I think the results obviously came in significantly better than we expected this quarter when we gave guidance on the quarter. And really about -- we beat the operating margin expectation that we had by about 200 basis points. And if you look at that beat, about half of it was due to gross margin and half of it was due to SG&A. And it was really a function of a number of items. On the gross margin side, we did see benefits from the SKU and style rationalization. And you're right that we tackled that, when we started the global merchandising group about a year or 2 ago, in a manual way. We're just scratching the surface of that, I would say, at this point, because the systemic approach to the style and SKU rationalization is really what's coming in the global line planning process, which is going to -- which was going to kick in 12 to 18 months from now. So I would say if you looked at men's Polo for fall of 2015, we might have been down a low double-digit percentage of styles and SKUs. And then when you look at fall 2016, we're expecting again, even versus that lower base, another improvement of equal magnitude. And I think on many of the other brands, we've had an initial little bit of a progress, but I think there's more progress ahead of us going forward as we move into the line planning process. We also, on the gross margin side, though, benefited from the lower negotiated sourcing costs. If you recall, when we took the big foreign exchange hurt back earlier this calendar year, we commissioned our manufacturing and sourcing group to go back to our sourcing and supply chain base. And that sourcing discussion and cost discussion has resulted in average unit cost reductions that came a little bit bigger than we expected and faster. And then we also benefited from improved full price sell-throughs during the quarter. So all of that kind of went in the positive direction, which led to the gross margin improvement. Relative to next fiscal year, I think we are just about to kick off the budgeting process. So it's premature to give guidance on next fiscal year. We'll provide qualitative perspective at our next call. But your comment is accurate in that certainly, from an infrastructure standpoint, we expect the e-commerce replatforming spend to be higher next year as we ramp up the work on moving to the new e-commerce platform. But we do expect the SAP spending to moderate. So I expect infrastructure in total to not be a significant year-over-year driver. The retail investment also I don't expect to be a year-over-year driver because we're at about the rate of new store openings that we anticipate going forward. I do think that we're going to see foreign exchange impacts next year continuing, primarily on the transactional side, because the hedging program that we had in place this year will roll off over the next 9 to 12 months. So we'll see a transactional hit, although the translational impact should be small to nonexistent at current rates. But then we're going to start to see some of the benefits from all of the restructuring work that we've done, both from the global brand restructuring, from the line planning and from the pricing actions that we put in place that should start to roll in over the next 12 months. So we'll provide more specifics on how all of that nets against each other on the next call, but that's where we stand at the moment."

So when we look at our inventory, the currency of our inventory is very well positioned from a current season and future season basis versus a prior season inventory. The inventory growth that we've had in our inventory versus year ago is really to support new store activity and new product introductions, like Polo Sport, around the world. When we look at the U.S. department store channel, I think that's the place where we see a little bit of elevated inventory across the channel that is not just in our business, but in -- broadly defined in many of the competitors. And I think it's a function of the foreign tourist traffic being down in the U.S. as well as the unseasonably warm start to the fall season. And so as we approach the holiday selling period, which is obviously the biggest selling period of the year for our industry, we felt like it was the right thing to take a prudent approach to that given where we're headed. We've got a long history of navigating through this in a very strong way. And we've got real expertise within the company to help us do this. And what we're trying to do is keep our inventory fresh and current, exit the season in a positive way as we transition to the next season, but do that in a way that protects the brand equity in the consumer's eyes.

We have not seen cancellation in orders. And in fact, if you look broadly across the business, it's really a mixed environment. In Europe, our reorder rate is stronger than it's ever been. And so we're seeing real strength in the wholesale channel in Europe, and we're chasing to catch up with the reorder rate there.

The Polo Women's business, we launched I guess about a year ago. And we've seen what I would say as good results to date. The business has been stronger internationally than it has in the U.S. as we've started off. In the international markets, in Europe and in Asia, we largely replaced the Blue Label business that was discontinued, and we took many of the locations that were Blue Label locations and converted them to Women's Polo locations. And that business, the Women's Polo business, has now not only surpassed the size of the Blue Label business, but at price points that are below where Blue Label was. So the unit velocity of the Blue Label -- of the Polo Women's business internationally is more than double the unit velocity rate of the Blue Label business. And we see significant expansion opportunities for distribution of Women's Polo around the world. In the U.S., where we didn't have a very well-developed Blue Label business, we launched Women's Polo in incremental spaces into the marketplace. I think we're off to a good start in that business. We see it as a critical element of the company's future growth strategy. And we're working to take learnings from the initial seasons and develop them into the line as part of the line planning process that we're kicking off for Women's Polo as we go forward. So I think we're encouraged by the start that we've had, but there's more to do and certainly, a lot more opportunity ahead of us because, as you know, the women's fashion and apparel business is bigger than men's. And with the strength of the Polo brand and the strength of Polo men's, we continue to see a big opportunity in Polo women's."

So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we started with a pilot of the line planning process on the Men's Polo line, which is our biggest line, for fall of 2016, and we've now largely completed that pilot process. And it's interesting because the way that we did the pilot process is we started with a hindsighting approach of looking at prior seasons. We also then engaged all of the region and channel leaders around the world to bring in consumer input and feedback in to develop -- which we used to develop category and classification strategies and develop specific targets for price points, margins, SKUs by category and classification, which then led to an architecture that we handed off to the design community. And I have to say the design community did an outstanding job of using that feedback and designing a line that is very compelling. So that line that was designed has now been shared back with the regions and the channel teams. And the response from the region and channel teams has been terrific to the design community's progress in terms of product innovation. I'm not going to talk about all of the product innovation at this point because I don't want to give away too much of our secrets. But I referenced a couple of the items that are -- that you're going to see as we move into the fall of '16 men's Polo line. You are going to see us having lighter weight fabrics, a more wear-now sensibility. About half of the Polo distribution is in warm weather climate locations. And we felt like we had a big opportunity to design into that so that both, for the early part of the fall season in the northern climate stores and the majority of the fall season in the warm climate stores, we had product that was more compelling, more innovative and more attractive for those target locations. And I think we've delivered on that. And there's a series of themes like that, that you're going to see as we go through that. So that's where we are really for the fall process on the line planning process. We're really kicking off the line planning process for the spring 2017 season for the majority of the balance of the brands and categories. And so I expect that we'll see similar results for the spring 2017 season as we get through the process on the other brands."

So the global e-commerce revenue was up 10% in the second quarter, and this compared to the 2% increase we had in the first quarter. So we were encouraged by the acceleration of revenue growth in the e-commerce channel. I think that we continued to stay true to our promotional cadence, where, as I mentioned on the last call, we decided to pull back a little bit in terms of the amount of business that we were doing on sale. But what we had this quarter were some omni-channel initiatives like buy online, ship from store; hold online, pick up in store; the new wait list functionality and product videos that drove higher average order value. And the combination of those new omni-channel initiatives, I think, is what drove the return to stronger growth. And that was true both internationally, but also true in the North America e-commerce business. Relative to the profitability, today, we pay eBay Enterprises, or the formerly GSI, a percent of revenue for the service that they're providing. That's a percent of e-commerce revenue. In addition to that, we're incurring charges associated with in-sourcing the platform. Once we convert off of the GSI platform to our in-sourced platform, that GSI fee will go to 0. And so we're effectively double paying, if you will, today for both in-house and outsourced capability. We expect to convert off of the eBay -- GSI platform over the next 12 to 18 months. So I think you'll see us double paying for a 12- to 18-month period, and then you'll see us start to generate the benefit after that. The other point I would make is we expect the in-sourced capability and cost to be lower than the GSI fee that we're paying. So it's not just that we're getting more capability, but we're getting more capability at a lower going cost structure."

And it's encouraging because we did see in, as you know, we took sort of mid- to high single-digit price increases in the -- to respond to the currency devaluation in Europe, in Canada, in Japan and in Australia, which were the markets that were the most affected by devaluation. In Europe, which is the largest market that we've taken price increases in, we still haven't got the product on the floor in front of consumers. But we have gone through a wholesale market with the higher prices. And what we've seen from that market from wholesale orders is that the wholesale orders have been actually in line with our previous growth rate in terms of unit volume. And so the pricing has come on top of the unit volume. And so we're encouraged by that from a sell-in perspective. We're seeing that the pricing isn't a barrier to strong sell-in in the wholesale channel. We're also hearing that many of the competitors are taking pricing in the market as well, but we don't yet have the consumer read of what is the consumer reaction when that product shows up on the retail and wholesale floors. I expect that we'll get some early indication of that over the next 3 months or so. And then, on the question on longer-term margins, certainly, we're very encouraged by the line planning work that we've done, the SKU reduction opportunity, the global brand reorganization from a cost savings and from an efficiency of operation. I think it's a little bit too soon to say what that means for longer-term margins, but certainly, we believe all of these things can contribute to a margin improvement story over the next 3 to 5 years. And so we are very much shooting for an operating margin improvement story over that time period as many of these initiatives begin to take hold."

So I think that we would like to return to a steady state environment, but we're not counting on returning to a steady state environment. So I think we're trying to manage the business in a volatile period, where we are seeing significant moves in tourist traffic around the world. I do think if you look at Europe and the U.S. combined from a wholesale perspective, I think our view is that, that channel is going to grow at sort of a low single-digit rate. We continue to believe that we can grow market share in that channel by entering new product categories and innovating on our product lines. So we think we might be able to grow a couple of points faster than the channels as we gain market share, which we've pretty consistently done over the last 5 to 10 years. And then, I think our direct-to-consumer strategy of e-commerce and retail expansion is likely to remain a disproportionate growth driver for us going forward."

And one change that I see is that the customer wants something special, and it has to be unique and there has to be a story. And you hear a lot of brands speaking about storytelling. And then you can look back at what Ralph and the team has done, it's been years before anybody else in telling real stories, inviting customers into the movie, sharing a dream of a better life. So I believe that there is a real strength in that going forward as well. And then I have to come back to you when it comes to -- after I've learned more about the brands, the consumer, the market and started to work with the team here on crafting and out -- refining the growth strategy that we already have."

I think that part of what we're doing by moving to the global brand structure is about speed of decision making and speed of execution in the market, because when you have a centralized point of view by brand that, with all of the functional groups represented as part of the brand team, it allows us to move in a faster way. I will say that we're not yet there from a moving in -- as fast as I think we could in some areas. And a lot of that is because we're just at the beginning of the global brand structure. The global brand teams have been in place now for only a couple of months. And so I think they're both getting up to speed on the business, implementing line plans for the first time, developing brand strategies, we're starting to get brand financial reporting up to enable those teams to really manage the business on a more real-time basis. And so I think we're making progress, but there's more work to do."

And being very authentic to that and working with the team to be more and more and more authentic, but at the same time, making sure that we are current. So it's finding those 2 components, and that will deliver something that the consumer will be excited about, and that will drive growth over time."
