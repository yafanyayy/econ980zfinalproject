It is truly a pleasure to be joining you to share our perspectives on E*TRADE's performance and progress in 2014. This was a momentous year for E*TRADE, one in which we benefited from a more focused organization and we shaped our brand both to better connect with our customers, a year of sustained operation under a significantly upgraded risk management framework, ensuring we executed deliberately and with the right controls, and even more striking, all our accomplishments are by the strong financial position and regulatory standing we've had in years, leading to consistent delivery on our capital plan and value creation for our shareholders while positioning us to create even more in the future.
Building on this momentum and on behalf of the board and my colleagues, I am incredibly proud to announce the most significant developments the company has seen in years with respect to capital efficiency and capital structure. To quickly summarize the announcements we made today, we received the go-ahead from our regulators to operate E*TRADE Bank at a leverage ratio of 9% and to remove our broker-dealers from under the Bank, placing them closer to the parent, enabling us to distribute to the parent excess capital of approximately $430 million. We will cover these items in more detail shortly.
Now back to 2014 and a quick walk-through of our key highlights. During the year, we posted our strongest bottom line results since 2006, saw a record customer engagement across a host of metrics, particularly in asset and account growth, evolved the public face of E*TRADE with revamped brand platform, enhanced the digital experience for our customers, seized opportunities to eliminate asymmetric risks by selling legacy assets in the non-core business, navigated our first required stress test submission with satisfying results and feedback, received regulatory approval for consistent quarterly capital distributions from our Bank; and paid down corporate debt with cash for the first time in the company's history. This is a distinguished list of achievements, and I cannot thank my colleagues enough for their hard work this year.
When I began 2 years ago, we went to great lengths to realign our internal operating structure to empower colleagues to execute more effectively. We then took a hard look at our processes to see what we could improve. During 2014, we were well into implementation, and we are just starting to see the benefits of increased rigor, improved productivity across the firm and the upgraded quality of our delivery, all centering on a resolute drive that everything we do results in improvements to the customer and drives long-term value for our owners. With these many internal changes, we are well positioned to deliver the industry-leading products and top-notch services our customers deserve. We are just beginning to see this culture impact our results and look forward to more fully witnessing the of our labors in the coming years.
You've heard me talk a lot about our commitment to reclaim our disruptive digital roots. In pursuit of this goal, we've also realigned our technology development to be more intricately woven into the fabric of our entire organization. Our technology now work more seamlessly across the company to wipe out customer pain points and deliver innovative products backed by more rigorous and robust design and testing. As a result, this quarter caps a year of significant additions, enhancements to the digital experience for our customers. Most recently, we rolled out new customer navigation for E*TRADE.com, delivering a more elegant and intuitive web experience. We also further enhanced the mobile experience through added stock plan functionality, which builds on a year of impressive mobile advancements, including our iOS 8 app with first-to-market functionality, new ETF screeners and additional research tools and resources just to name a few.
Our innovative browser trading app came out of beta this quarter, which delivers real-time quotes, research and trade execution at any web page being browsed as far as enhanced our online advisor and fixed income solution center, added more functionality to our elite trading platform, E*TRADE Pro, and launched back end enhancements, allowing us to be more nimble with delivery of web content. These efforts are top of our already strong offerings resulted in external recognition throughout the year across a number of renowned publications. We received a four-star rating from Barron's and best in mobile from . StockBrokers.com awarded us #1 ratings for mobile and client dashboards, along with 5 best-in-class ratings for customer service, investor education, research, mobile trading and new investors. We were named most improved in the industry by J.D. Power and given a #1 rating for client satisfaction and loyalty for the third consecutive year by industry critic Group Five for our Stock Plan management platform Equity Edge online.
As a digital-centric organization, we devote significant time and energy to make sure we deliver an industry-leading mobile experience. The accolades we received a test to my colleague success in building a robust digital mobile environment, which has only increasing importance across the industry. About 12% of our trades came through our mobile app during the fourth quarter. Even more telling, over a quarter of customer log occurred to this channel, proof that the future of personal finance is increasingly quite literally in the palm of our customers' hands.
Our digital experience, however, is only one side of E*TRADE coin as it's backed by personal support and expert guidance. So this year, we also enhanced the human experience, capitalizing on the new leadership in our corporate services division, customer service teams, financial and sales and branches and arming our front-line employees with better tools to meet our customers' wants and needs.
Turning to our financial results. We recorded earnings of $1.12 for the year, a net income of $330 million, excluding a $59 million pretax charge related to our debt transaction in November. Earnings benefited from increased customer engagements, low credit cost and an elevated net interest spread.
Following Q1's multi-year high in DARTs, trading activity held in well, increasing 12% for the year, inclusive of a 10% sequential increase in Q4. Options continue to account for about 22% of trades in Q4, consistent with the full year mix. Our customers trading across other asset classes continues to be minimal, but futures accounting for 1.5% of trades and Forex making up about 30 basis points.
Trading in January to date is holding quite steady compared to December, currently up 3% thus far. While solid, not exactly the jumping activity we like to see at the start of the year as investors have remained somewhat sidelined in uncertainty around oil and major turbulence within the European markets and currencies.
Another important indicator of customer's engagement with the market is margin receivables, which reached record levels during the year and ended at $7.7 billion, down from $8.1 billion at the end of Q3. The yield actually picked up this quarter since 2011 as a result of the balances shifting a higher price tier accounts.
In terms of net new assets and accounts, we added over 17,000 net new accounts in the quarter, bringing our full year total to 146,000, the high in over a decade. Meanwhile, attrition improved for the seventh consecutive year, albeit modestly to 8.7% from 8.8%, and Q4 was consistent with the prior quarter at 9.1% annualized.
Net new assets of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter brought our 2014 total to $10.9 billion, yet another record and up from $10.4 billion in each of the previous 2 years.
These numbers are encouraging and even more so when noted that 1/3 of our net new assets for the year were in retirement accounts. This is a strategically important area for us as we strive to do more for our customers across the full spectrum of their investing activity. Building on our unbiased approach to investment products and investment solutions, we've had a lot of success growing our managed assets, which ended the year at $3.1 billion, up 1/3 from the end of 2013.
Moving onto expenses and investments in 2015. We intend to carry a momentum forward and continue investing in the business as we've made a lot of progress and feel good about our continued prospects and related value generation.
Let's take a step back. The motive forces behind our investments are: First, our focus on the business and customer offering. This includes everything from our back office to our marketing dollars. We've done a lot in this category, and I can tell you that we've benefited tremendously from our attention here. We operated in a more deliberate manner with more cross collaboration and more disciplined across the business. Along with our foundation, we're investing in customer-facing roles. We continue to elevate the state of play of our service and sales organizations while technology remains at the forefront of our efforts. We also continue to spend opportunistically on marketing, environment permitting. And while we are clocking records across assets, accounts and margins, we have yet to truly yield benefits of our internal improvements here. But I feel sanguine about our prospects.
And the second category is far less selective, following squarely in the table stakes category and that relates to the investments we've made in response to the heightened demand of today's regulatory and security environments. Our spend in legal, risk and compliance alone for 2014 totaled approximately $90 million, which is an increase of 50% from what we spent just 2 years prior. And we expect that number to continue its rise in the 2015 to upwards of $100 million, certainly not insignificant but absolutely necessary to progress with confidence in today's operating and regulatory landscape. While these areas, legal, risk and compliance are often lumped into the category of enterprise risk management, our broader efforts go beyond this level spend and truly encapsulate the fact that risk is now ingrained in everything that we do across the company. We've invested in risk management within all the other departments of the firm as well as our systems and technology related to risk. Our headway in building out these areas has been paramount to our regulatory progress and was prerequisite to our ability to secure the approvals we announced today.
Moving on to the capital plan and the important announcements we made today. All of our progress be risking the company and executing on the component of our plan culminated in significant approvals. First, we received regulatory approval to operate E*TRADE Bank at a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%, providing more opportunities for capital utilization, upon which Matthew will expand. Second, our regulators approved our plan to simplify our legal entity structure, removing our broker-dealer subsidiaries from under E*TRADE Bank, which more efficiently positions a source of earnings and capital. And in conjunction with these approvals, excess capital to broker-dealers of approximately $430 million will be distributed to the parent during the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, the excess capital generated by these entities will also be available to the parent. Separately, we plan to request a dividend of another $75 million from the Bank to the parent in Q1, and beginning in Q2, we will request quarterly dividend equal to the Bank spend income 1 quarter in arrears.
For a brief history lesson. In 2009, as part of the company's efforts to shore up the Bank's financial position and with some logical regulatory encouragement, our introducing broker-dealer, E*TRADE Securities was moved under E*TRADE Bank, where our clearing broker-dealer E*TRADE Clearing already resided. This was done to ensure that the Bank can stand on its own during a time of significant global stress. Suffice it to say, our Bank is now in a much healthier position. So with regulatory approval, we have taken the steps to remove both broker-dealers from under E*TRADE Bank in order to create a more streamlined corporate structure.
So what does this mean? The income and, therefore, the capital generation from our brokerage operations will now be housed directly below our parent company, greatly simplifying the movement of capital. Moreover, given the exquisite regulatory approval to operate the Bank at 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, we have a much greater flexibility to utilize Bank capital generated above that threshold.
We're now faced with a high-quality challenge of what to do with this capital, and I assure you it this top of mind for us. Reducing our debt by another $400 million continues to be a priority of ours. Though as you can imagine, we are valuing the most appropriate uses beyond that. Again, Matthew will update you more on the process.
A final note on the capital front. The issuer received 5 full-notch upgrades by our 3 credit rating agencies, 2 of which occurred in conjunction with our November debt paydown in refinance. While we ultimately like to be investment-grade, these upgrades are a solid testament to the progress we're making and the greatly improved health of the company.
On the management team, I regret to announce that our Chief Marketing Officer, Liza Landsman, has decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities. Liza was 1 of my first hires here and she made significant contributions during her tenure. She revolutionized our approach to marketing, turning what was historically an advertising-centric organization into a data-driven, analytical one that allows us to continue to make deeper and more meaningful connections with customers and prospects. I'm sorry to see her go.
At the board level, we've made significant progress to round out and strengthen our director composition, introducing 2 talented individuals over the last few months, Shelley Lee Woods and Jim Healy. Both of whom sit on the risk oversight committee. Ms. Leibowitz has a deep history with information technology and most recently worked with the World Bank, overseeing its product delivery infrastructure and managing its cyber security program. Mr. Healy has 25 years of experience with the financial markets and investment banking at Crédit Suisse and is an economist at the International Monetary Fund. Both Shelley and Jim are exceptional managers of risk and seasoned operators in their respective fields. With the addition of these 2 and after bringing on a distinguished former Fed president in the past year, our board governance is stronger than ever with a depth of knowledge and expertise across all aspects of our business.
In closing, I want to reiterate how proud I am of all the team and all that it accomplished in 2014. As we enter 2015, we have the backbone in place to enhance our relationships with our customers and continue to grow the business. I have every confidence that everything we have done to setup the business for executional excellence will continue to benefit our customers and our owners.
And I'm particular proud of our commitment to continuously improve our regulatory standing and all we have accomplished to bring us to position of announcing some of the most significant progress we've made since the financial crisis. The vote of confidence from our regulators and the improved capital efficiency in our new corporate structure underscore all that we have done to reduce and manage our legacy risks over the past years and to install and maintain enterprise risk management capabilities, of which we are quite proud.
And with that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Matthew Audette."
27807,281479309,748361,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2015",2015-01-22,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. 2014, truly a defining year for the company as we operationalized a very clear focus and path forward that was started in 2013.

From a financial standpoint, after laying out a plan less than 3 years ago and executing on all the major components, we took yet another giant step forward with our announcements today. Our unwavering commitment to executing on that plan is quite literally paying dividends. But before I get into that, I'd like to go over our results for the quarter and year. We reported fourth quarter net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share, excluding a $59 million pretax charge related to our corporate debt transaction. This compares to net income of $86 million or $0.29 per share in Q3 and net income of $58 million or $0.20 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $461 million were up from $440 million in the prior quarter and $446 million in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue included net interest income of $283 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter as net interest spread increased 15 basis points, and our average assets contracted $400 million. Our Q4 spread of 269 [ph] basis points reflected an outside benefit from stock lending and margin receivables. On stock lending, while we are obviously thrilled with the results over the past couple of quarters, we have noted a big pullback in stock lending revenue toward the end of the quarter, which has continued into Q1. So from where we sit today, stock loan yields are down meaningfully from Q4. Margin receivables, on a similar note, which benefited from record high average balances and an uptick in yield during the quarter, declined toward the quarter end and remain at this level today. The macro environment has also failed to cooperate with the unprecedented drop in oil prices followed by a drop in interest rates, obviously having an impact on our marginal rates of reinvestment.
So while the environment in Q4 was quite beneficial to spread, the environment we find ourselves in today is much more challenging. And if we assume this current environment holds, our net interest spread will decline to the low to mid-240s [ph] 
Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $45.5 billion, [ph] down $0.3 billion from the prior quarter as a result of $1.2 billion of customer net buying and $240 million decline in wholesale funding. The decline in wholesale funding was driven by a temporary funding need in Q3 related to customer activity and rolled off during Q4 as planned. We have $365 million of wholesale obligations expiring during 2015, all of which occurred during the second quarter.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the third quarter were $172 million, up 6% from the prior quarter and up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.84 declined $0.21 in the prior quarter and $0.13 from the year-ago period. The sequential decrease is primarily driven by our mix of options and Stock Plan trades.
Fees and service charges revenues of $48 million included $23 million of payment order flow compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Net gains in loans and securities were $6 million this quarter, down from $8 million in the prior quarter. Over the next few quarters, we expect gains to continue to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. Those rates persists at their current low level, gains would likely be at the high end of that range.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $294 million, up from $277 million in the prior quarter, largely related to marketing and professional services. In marketing, where we typically see a seasonal increase, we also spent dynamically as the environment permitted. And in professional services, there was a mix of both increased hiring as well as some temporary project-related engagements. So there are some room for this the decline going forward.
For the full year 2015, we expect a low to mid-single digit percent increase in full year 2015 expenses. The increase is driven mostly by headcount as we hire throughout 2014 and we'll have the full year run rate in 2015. It also includes a mid- to high-single digit increase in marketing, the area where we obviously maintain the most flexibility. However, with multi-year records in net new accounts and assets in 2014, we are feeling good about our returns on those dollars.
The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $6.4 billion, down $320 million from the prior quarter. This was again predominantly prepayments while charge-offs remain minimal at just $7 million. We expect quarterly runoff for 2015 to remain in the range of 4% to 5% per quarter.
Provision for loan losses was $10 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior quarter. For all of 2014, our provision of $36 million declined 75% from the prior year. While that is tremendous improvement, I want to again reiterate that we expect provision to increase in 2015 and 2016 when the majority of our HELOCs are scheduled to convert to amortize. With that in mind, there is no change for a $10 million to $30 million per quarter range but a bit more color on our expected timing with 2015 expected to be at the lower half of that range and 2016 to be in the upper half.
Our allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $404 million, up marginally from the prior quarter. Reserve for the one to four book remained stable at $27 million as charge-offs again netted to 0 and the release of reserves as we foreshadowed last quarter.
Meanwhile, the home equity allowance again inched upward, ending the quarter at $367 million, a $7 million increase.
1 last point on the loan portfolio. While CLTV is a portfolios were unchanged from the prior quarter at 79% for one- to four-family and 92% for home equity, they trended downward during 2013, driven by an increase in home prices as well as voluntary principal productions.
Now with respect to progress on our Capital Plan. It was a busy year and we accomplished a tremendous amount. While I know you have heard this before, at least for now I won't get tired of delivering the recap. So to quickly hit the highlights. We successfully cleared our first round of Dodd-Frank stress test. We reduced with significant tail risks through actions taken on our legacy investments, including the sale of $800 million of TDRs, the elimination of our remaining non-agency CMOs and the early termination of $100 million of wholesale funding. We demonstrated the sustainability of our enterprise risk management capabilities. We ended the year with a Bank Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.6% even after dividend a total of $300 million from Bank to the parent. And we put that capital to work with a $400 million reduction of corporate debt in conjunction with a $540 million refinance at the lowest coupons in our company's history. And we are certainly starting 2015 on a high note.
As Mr. Idzik covered earlier, we are delighted to announce regulatory approval on one of the key components of our Capital Plan, operating the Bank at a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%. Additionally, we received regulatory approval to move our broker-dealers out from under the Bank, which marks tremendous progress in achieving ongoing capital flexibility. And lastly, we plan to dividend to the parent excess capital in the broker-dealers of approximately $430 million in Q1, taking yet another significant step toward putting capital to work for our shareholders.
With respect to the Bank's Tier 1 leverage ration, we ended the year at 10.6%. Pro forma for the brokerage move, it would be 9.2%, so still above our new 9% target.
Regarding the movement of our broker-dealer entities. Post the financial crisis, we were left with a constraining legal entity structure where our brokerages subsidiaries resided under our Bank. The planned realignment moving the 2 subs out of the Bank in an effort to create a more streamlined and simplified legal entity structure. E*TRADE Securities, which was moved under the Bank in 2009 to serve as a source of strength at the time when the Bank needed it, will be moved in early February. And E*TRADE Clearing, which previously resided under the Bank, will be moved later in the year.
Under our old structure, this meant that substantially all of E*TRADE's earnings were generated within the Bank and were subject to bank regulatory approvals in order to extract the results in capital. Following this reorganization, a significant amount of capital generation will be within closer proximity to the parent.
To put this in context around dividends. Our old methodology of $75 million per quarter led to $300 million in 2014 dividends for the parent. Assuming our new structure had been implemented on January 1, 2014, we would have moved approximately $225 million of earnings from the Bank, along with approximately $200 million of capital generation at brokerage-dealers. In total, this would have led to dividends of approximately $425 million to the parent.
As for Q1, once E*TRADE Securities is moved, we plan to dividend excess capital to the parent, which we estimate to be around $430 million. In the first quarter 2015, we also plan to request approval for another $75 million. And in Q2 2015, we will transition to our new methodology of requesting the full amount from the prior quarter's earnings from the Bank as well as distributing the excess capital generated at the broker-dealers.
Now with respect to capital calculations in the forthcoming implementation of Basel III. We spent a lot of time applying the U.S. final Basel rules to our capital rations, there are several items which deeply impact us. A few of these we've highlighted previously. These include the phaseout of TRUPs from the parent capital, which will have a negative impact, and changes to the risk across our assets will result to net favorable impact to our ratios, predominantly driven by the way we risk weight margin receivables. One additional impact we've identified is positive in that we will be able to include a much larger portion of our DDA in regulatory capital. while we still have not finalized the impact of these changes, we do expect a meaningful benefit to our capital ratios. And as a reminder, these rules became effective at the beginning of this year. So the impact will be reflected in our Q1 ratios.
One other item that impacted our capital ratios in 2014. We benefited from exceptionally robust customer net buying activity of $7.7 billion, which muted natural balance sheet growth. This is well above normalized levels, which are in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. As we mentioned in the past, customer activity rated growth is one element that can be challenging to control. To address this, we're in the process of redesigning our program that to third-party banks that will enable us to manage the size of our balance sheet with greater precision while staying in tune with the quality of the customer experience. We expect it to be up and running in the coming months.
With regards to cash at the parent. We ended the quarter with corporate cash of $233 million. Assuming our planned Q1 dividends of $430 million and $75 million, pro forma corporate cash would be $738 million. After taking into account debt service needs, this is approximately $500 million above our target of maintaining a 2-year debt service coverage. Additionally, at the time we completed our recent debt transaction, we installed a $200 million revolving credit facility, giving us an added layer of and flexibility.
Given all we have accomplished on our Capital Plan, the questions we are now faced with are lesser on the timing and process of accessing capital and more around how to put it to use, and that is squarely where our focus lies today. As you're aware, reducing our corporate debt to $1 billion remains a high priority. While the nearest on our debt is still 10 months away, we are analyzing whether it makes to do something sooner, obviously keeping economics at the top of mind. And there are other options available to us as well. One of the most obvious of which is growing the balance sheet now that we have regulatory approval to operate the Bank in an explicit ratio.
Also, while the loan portfolio continues to be most valuable in our hands and we have no intention of disposing it in the foreseeable future, the secondary market continues to firm up. So we are keeping a watchful eye on market activity. Lastly, and very importantly, we are mindful of the merits of returning capital directly to our shareholders via buybacks and/or dividends. So while there are several potential iterations, those are the broad strokes for capital utilization. And we will obviously keep you posted as we make decisions and prepare to take action.
So in summary, we accomplished a lot in 2014 and are even better positioned for 2015. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead both for the business and our customers as well as our capital structure and for our shareholders.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

I think there's a couple of things do think through, both of which go back to balance sheet side. First is the point in the prepared remarks. Our balance sheet relating growth during the year because of all the customer net buying. Nearly 8 billion of customer net buying. You typically would not have that amount, right? So when I think about that capital utilization, you're going to have -- if things return to normal level, you're going to have on the balance sheet side. And then second, to the comments we made and then Paul highlighted on an earlier question on our ability to bring deposits back on balance sheet. We're going to get to a place in the next couple of months of customer activity driving the amount of deposits in our balance sheet, transitioning to effectively decide very quickly with good to how much deposits to put back on balance sheet. That combined with having explicit Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%, those 2 things together I think will give us comfort to bring those deposits back on balance sheet versus where we've been for the last few quarters. We've been running well below that $50 billion mark to have a much bigger buffer. So I think the back on balance sheet is one of the primary things, but just reiterating a few of the other things that we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we'll be looking things like making sure we're following the loan portfolio, things like the wholesale funding, all the things we've talked about before, we will continue to analyze."

Trust preferred securities will be coming out of capital, 75% in 2015 and then the remainder in 2016. And then on the DTA side, there'll be a larger amount of the DTA will be included in capital. When I put those 2 things together, the DTA being a positive and trust preferred being a negative, we estimate the net impact of that is going to be an increase to that leverage ratio to the parent, not dramatic but an increase. Then at the Bank, there is an impact of the there is no impact of the truck so the primary driver down to the Bank is going to be the deferred tax asset. The deferred tax asset is around $1 billion, $600 million of that -- roughly $600 million is down at the Bank. And I would say broadly 300 -- half of that $600 million is included in capital today. So when I think through what's the max increase that DTA could have down at the Bank, it would be -- it'd be another $300 million.

There is no way to know whether it comes down from here or return back to the Q4 levels tomorrow, right? It can move pretty quickly, but that's where it is at the moment. On the security side, I think the primary driver there is going to be, assuming the balance sheet grows, which means we would be buying securities once the interest rate environment look like? 
And specifically what's interest rate environment look like where we buy bonds, which is more in the belly of the curve. So when you look at the tenure coming down in a big way in Q4, well, the belly of the curve didn't move much at all. So it didn't have a huge impact on things versus the last 2 or 3 weeks, the 3- to 5-year point of the curve moved down in a pretty big way. So it that depends on where that plays out and how much balance sheet growth we have would drive whether or not it would be a meaningful change in security yields going forward."

It is truly a pleasure to be joining you to share our perspectives on E*TRADE's performance and progress in 2014. This was a momentous year for E*TRADE, one in which we benefited from a more focused organization and we shaped our brand, both to better connect with our customers; a year of sustained operation under a significantly upgraded risk management framework, ensuring we executed deliberately and with the right controls. And even more striking, all our accomplishments are buoyed by the strong financial position and regulatory standing we've had in years, leading to consistent delivery on our capital plan and value creation for our shareholders while positioning us to create even more in the future.
Building on this momentum and on behalf of the board and my colleagues, I am incredibly proud to announce the most significant developments the company has seen in years with respect to capital efficiency and company structure. To quickly summarize the announcements we made today, we received the go-ahead from our regulators to operate E*TRADE Bank at a leverage ratio of 9% and to remove our broker-dealers from under the bank, placing them closer to the parent, enabling us to distribute to the parent excess capital of approximately $430 million. We will cover these items in more detail shortly.
Now back to 2014 and a quick walk-through of our key highlights. During the year, we posted our strongest bottom line results since 2006; saw record customer engagement across a host of metrics, particularly in asset and account growth; evolved the public face of E*TRADE with a revamped brand platform; enhanced the digital experience for our customers; seized opportunities to eliminate asymmetric risks by selling legacy assets in the non-core business; navigated our first required stress test submission with satisfying results and feedback; received regulatory approval for consistent quarterly capital distributions from our bank; and paid down corporate debt with cash for the first time in the company's history. This is a distinguished list of achievements, and I cannot thank my colleagues enough for their hard work this year.
When I began 2 years ago, we went to great lengths to realign our internal operating structure to empower colleagues to execute more effectively. We then took a hard look at our processes to see what we could improve. During 2014, we were well into implementation, and we are just starting to see the benefits of increased rigor, improved connectivity across the firm and the upgraded quality of our delivery, all centering on a resolute drive that everything we do results in improvements to the customer and drives long-term value for our owners. With these many internal changes, we are well positioned to deliver the industry-leading products and top-notch services our customers deserve. We are just beginning to see this culture impact our results and look forward to more fully witnessing the product of our labors in the coming years.
You've heard me talk a lot about our commitment to reclaim our disruptive digital roots. In pursuit of this goal, we've also realigned our technology development to be more intricately woven into the fabric of our entire organization. Our technologists now work more seamlessly across the company to wipe out customer pain points and deliver innovative products backed by more rigorous and robust design and testing. As a result, this quarter caps a year of significant additions, enhancements to the digital experience for our customers. Most recently, we rolled out new customer navigation for etrade.com, delivering a more elegant and intuitive web experience. We also further enhanced the mobile experience through added stock plan functionality, which builds on a year of impressive mobile advancements, including our iOS 8 app with first-to-market functionality, new ETF screeners and additional research tools and resources just to name a few.
Our innovative browser trading app came out of beta this quarter, which delivers real-time quotes, research and trade execution of any web page being browsed. This falls in a year in which we enhanced our online adviser and Fixed Income Solutions Center, added more functionality to our elite trading platform, E*TRADE Pro, and launched back-end enhancements, allowing us to be more nimble with delivery of web content. These efforts, on top of our already strong offerings, resulted in external recognition throughout the year across a number of renowned publications. We received a four-star rating from Barron's and best in mobile from Kiplinger's. StockBrokers.com awarded us #1 ratings for mobile and client dashboards, along with 5 best-in-class ratings for customer service, investor education, research, mobile trading and new investors. We were named most improved in the industry by J.D. Power and given a #1 rating for client satisfaction and loyalty for the third consecutive year by industry critic Group Five for our stock plan management platform, Equity Edge Online.
As a digital-centric organization, we devote significant time and energy to make sure we deliver an industry-leading mobile experience. The accolades we have received attest to my colleagues' success in building a robust digital mobile environment, which is only increasing in importance across the industry. About 12% of our trades came through our mobile app during the fourth quarter. And even more telling, over 1/4 of customer logins occurred through this channel, proof that the future of personal finance is increasingly quite literally in the palm of our customers' hands.
Our digital experience, however, is only one side of the E*TRADE coin as it's backed by personal support and expert guidance. So this year, we also enhanced the human experience, capitalizing on the new leadership in our Corporate Services division, customer service teams, financial consultants, sales and branches and arming our front-line employees with better tools to meet our customers' wants and needs.
Turning to our financial results. We recorded earnings of $1.12 for the year on net income of $330 million, excluding a $59 million pretax charge related to our debt transaction in November. Earnings benefited from increased customer engagement, low credit costs and an elevated net interest spread.
Following Q1's multi-year high in DARTs, trading activity held in well, increasing 12% for the year, inclusive of a 10% sequential increase in Q4. Options continue to account for about 22% of trades in Q4, consistent with the full year mix. Our customers trading across other asset classes continues to be minimal, with futures accounting for 1.5% of trades and ForEx making up about 30 basis points.
Trading in January-to-date is holding quite steady compared to December, currently up 3% thus far. While solid, not exactly the jump in activity we'd like to see at the start of the year as investors have remained somewhat sidelined in light of uncertainty around oil and major turbulence within European markets and currencies.
Another important indicator of customers' engagement with the market is margin receivables, which reached record levels during the year and ended at $7.7 billion, down from $8.1 billion at the end of Q3. The yield actually ticked up this quarter for the first time since 2011 as a result of the balances shifting to higher pricing tier accounts.
In terms of bringing in net new assets and accounts, we added over 17,000 net new accounts in the quarter, bringing our full year total to 146,000, the highest in over a decade. Meanwhile, attrition improved for the seventh consecutive year, albeit modestly to 8.7% from 8.8%, and Q4 was consistent with the prior quarter at 9.1% annualized.
Net new assets of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter brought our 2014 total to $10.9 billion, yet another record and up from $10.4 billion in each of the previous 2 years.
These numbers are encouraging and even more so when noted that 1/3 of our net new assets for the year were in retirement accounts. This is a strategically important area for us as we strive to do more for our customers across the full spectrum of their investing activity. Building on our unbiased approach to investment products and investment solutions, we've had a lot of success growing our managed assets, which ended the year at $3.1 billion, up 1/3 from the end of 2013.
Moving on to expenses and investments in 2015. We intend to carry our momentum forward and continue investing in the business as we've made a lot of progress and feel good about our continued prospects and related value generation.
To take a step back, the motive forces behind our investments are: First, our focus on the business and customer offering. This includes everything from our back office to our marketing dollars. We've done a lot in this category, and I can tell you that we've benefited tremendously from our attention here. We operate in a more deliberate manner with more cross collaboration and more discipline across the business. Along with our foundation, we are investing in customer-facing roles. We continue to elevate the state of play of our service and sales organizations while technology remains at the forefront of our effort. We also continue to spend opportunistically on marketing, environment permitting. And while we are clocking records across assets, accounts and margin, we have yet to truly yield benefits of our internal improvements here, but I feel sanguine about our prospects.
And the second category is far less selective, following squarely in the table stakes category, and that relates to the investments we've made in response to the heightened demand of today's regulatory and security environments. Our spend in legal, risk and compliance alone for 2014 totaled approximately $90 million, which is an increase of 50% from what we spent just 2 years prior. And we expect that number to continue its rise in 2015 to upwards of $100 million, certainly not insignificant, but absolutely necessary to progress with confidence in today's operating and regulatory landscape. While these areas, legal, risk and compliance, are often lumped into the category of enterprise risk management, our broader efforts go beyond this level of spend and truly encapsulate the fact that risk is now ingrained in everything we do across the company. We've invested in risk management within all other departments of the firm, as well as our systems and technology related to risk. Our headway in building out these areas has been paramount to our regulatory progress and was prerequisite to our ability to secure the approvals we announced today.
Moving on to the capital plan and the jolly, important announcements we made today. All of our progress de-risking the company and executing on the components of our plan culminated in significant approvals. First, we received regulatory approval to operate E*TRADE Bank at a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%, providing more opportunities for capital utilization, upon which Matthew will expand. Second, our regulators approved our plan to simplify our legal entity structure, removing our broker-dealer subsidiaries from under E*TRADE Bank, which more efficiently position the source of earnings and capital. And in conjunction with these approvals, excess capital of broker-dealers of approximately $430 million will be distributed to the parent during the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, the excess capital generated by these entities will also be available to the parent. Separately, we plan to request a dividend of another $75 million from the bank to the parent in Q1. And beginning in Q2, we will request quarterly dividends equal to the bank's net income 1 quarter in arrears.
For a brief history lesson. In 2009, as part of the company's efforts to shore up the bank's financial position and with some logical regulatory encouragement, our introducing broker-dealer, E*TRADE Securities, was moved under E*TRADE Bank, where our clearing broker-dealer, E*TRADE Clearing, already resided. This was done to ensure that the bank can stand on its own during a time of significant global stress. Suffice it to say, our bank is now in a much healthier position. So with regulatory approval, we have taken the steps to remove both broker-dealers from under E*TRADE Bank in order to create a more streamlined corporate structure.
So what does this mean? The income and, therefore, the capital generation from our brokerage operations will now be housed directly below our parent company, greatly simplifying the movement of capital. Moreover, given the explicit regulatory approval to operate the bank at 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, we have a much greater flexibility to utilize bank capital generated above that threshold.
We're now faced with a high-quality challenge of what to do with this capital, and I assure you, it is top of mind for us. Reducing our debt by another $400 million continues to be a priority of ours. Though as you can imagine, we are evaluating the most appropriate uses beyond that. Again, Matthew will update you more on the process.
A final note on the capital front. The issuer received 5 full-notch upgrades by our 3 credit rating agencies, 2 of which occurred in conjunction with our November debt paydown and refinance. While we'd ultimately like to be investment-grade, these upgrades are a sound testament to the progress we're making and the greatly improved health of the company.
On the management team, I regret to announce that our Chief Marketing Officer, Liza Landsman, has decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities. Liza was one of my first hires here, and she made significant contributions during her tenure. She revolutionized our approach to marketing, turning what was historically an advertising-centric organization into a data-driven, analytical one that allows us to continue to make deeper and more meaningful connections with customers and prospects. I'm sorry to see her go.
At the board level, we've made significant progress to round out and strengthen our director composition, introducing 2 talented individuals over the last few months, Shelley Leibowitz and Jim Healy, both of whom sit on the Risk Oversight Committee. Ms. Leibowitz has a deep history with information technology and most recently worked at the World Bank, overseeing its product delivery infrastructure and managing its cyber security program. Mr. Healy has 25 years of experience with the financial markets and investment banking at Crédit Suisse and is an economist at the International Monetary Fund. Both Shelley and Jim are exceptional managers of risk and seasoned operators in their respective fields. With the addition of these 2 and after bringing on a distinguished former Fed president in the past year, our board governance and support is stronger than ever with a depth of knowledge and expertise across all aspects of our business.
In closing, I want to reiterate how proud I am of all the team and all that it accomplished in 2014. As we enter 2015, we have the backbone in place to enhance our relationships with our customers and continue to grow the business. I have every confidence that everything we have done to setup the business for executional excellence will continue to benefit our customers and our owners.
And I'm particular proud of our commitment to continuously improve our regulatory standing and all we have accomplished to bring us to position of announcing some of the most significant progress we've made since the financial crisis. The vote of confidence from our regulators and the improved capital efficiency in our new corporate structure underscore all that we have done to reduce and manage our legacy risks over the past several years and to install and maintain enterprise risk management capabilities, of which we are quite proud.
And with that, I will turn the call over to our operose CFO, Matthew Audette."
27807,281479309,748437,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2015",2015-01-22,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. 2014, truly a defining year for the company as we operationalized a very clear focus and path forward that was started in 2013.From a financial standpoint, after laying out a plan less than 3 years ago and executing on all the majo",2238,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik. 2014, truly a defining year for the company as we operationalized a very clear focus and path forward that was started in 2013.
From a financial standpoint, after laying out a plan less than 3 years ago and executing on all the major components, we took yet another giant step forward with our announcements today. Our unwavering commitment to executing on that plan is quite literally paying dividends. But before I get into that, I'd like to go over our results for the quarter and year.
We reported fourth quarter net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share, excluding a $59 million pretax charge related to our corporate debt transaction. This compares to net income of $86 million or $0.29 per share in Q3 and net income of $58 million or $0.20 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $461 million were up from $440 million in the prior quarter and $446 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue included net interest income of $283 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter as net interest spread increased 15 basis points, and our average assets contracted $400 million.
Our Q4 spread of 269 basis points reflected an outsized benefit from stock lending and margin receivables. On stock lending, while we are obviously thrilled with the results over the past couple of quarters, we have noted a big pullback in stock lending revenue toward the end of the quarter, which has continued into Q1. So from where we sit today, stock loan yields are down meaningfully from Q4. Margin receivables, on a similar note, which benefited from record high average balances and an uptick in yield during the quarter, declined toward the quarter end and remain near those levels today. The macro environment has also failed to cooperate with the unprecedented drop in oil prices followed by a steep drop in interest rates, obviously having an impact on our marginal rates of reinvestment. So while the environment in Q4 was quite beneficial to spread, the environment we find ourselves in today is much more challenging. And if we assume this current environment holds, our net interest spread would decline to the low to mid-240s.
Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $45.5 billion, down $0.3 billion from the prior quarter as a result of $1.2 billion of customer net buying and $240 million decline in wholesale funding. The decline in wholesale funding was driven by a temporary funding need in Q3 related to customer activity and rolled off during Q4 as planned. We have $365 million of wholesale obligations expiring during 2015, all of which occurred during the second quarter.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the third quarter were $172 million, up 6% from the prior quarter and up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.84 declined $0.21 from the prior quarter and $0.13 from the year-ago period. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by our mix of options and stock plan trades.
Fees and service charges revenues of $48 million included $23 million of payment for order flow compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Net gains in loans and securities were $6 million this quarter, down from $8 million in the prior quarter. Over the next few quarters, we expect gains to continue to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. If those rates persist at their current low levels, gains would likely be at the high end of that range.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $294 million, up from $277 million in the prior quarter, largely related to marketing and professional services. In marketing, where we typically see a seasonal increase, we also spent dynamically as the environment permitted. And in professional services, there was a mix of both increased hiring, as well as some temporary project-related engagements. So there is some room for this to decline going forward.
For the full year 2015, we expect a low to mid-single digit percent increase in full year 2015 expenses. The increase is driven mostly by headcount as we hired throughout 2014, and we'll have the full year run rate in 2015. It also includes a mid- to high-single digit increase in marketing, the area where we obviously maintain the most flexibility. However, with multi-year records in net new accounts and assets in 2014, we are feeling good about our returns on those dollars.
The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $6.4 billion, down $320 million from the prior quarter. This was again predominantly prepayments while charge-offs remain minimal at just $7 million. We expect quarterly runoff for 2015 to remain in the range of 4% to 5% per quarter.
Provision for loan losses was $10 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior quarter. For all of 2014, our provision of $36 million declined 75% from the prior year. While that is tremendous improvement, I want to again reiterate that we expect provision to increase in 2015 and 2016 when the majority of our HELOCs are scheduled to convert to amortizing. With that in mind, there is no change to our $10 million to $30 million per quarter range, but a bit more color on our expected timing with 2015 expected to be at the lower half of that range and 2016 to be at the upper half.
Our allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $404 million, up marginally from the prior quarter. Reserves for the one-to-four book remain stable at $27 million, as charge-offs again netted to 0 and the release of reserves abated as we foreshadowed last quarter. Meanwhile, the home equity allowance again inched upward, ending the quarter at $367 million, a $7 million increase. One last point on the loan portfolio. While CLTVs of both portfolios were unchanged from the prior quarter at 79% for one- to four-family and 92% for home equity, they trended downward during 2013 (sic) [ 2014 ], driven by an increase in home prices as well as voluntary principal reductions.
Now with respect to progress on our capital plan. It was a busy year, and we accomplished a tremendous amount. While I know you have heard this before, at least for now, I won't get tired of delivering the recap. So to quickly hit the highlights. We successfully cleared our first round of Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. We reduced significant tail risk through actions taken on our legacy investments, including the sale of $800 million of TDRs, the elimination of our remaining non-agency CMOs, and the early termination of $100 million of wholesale funding. We demonstrated the sustainability of our enterprise risk management capabilities. We ended the year with a bank Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.6%, even after dividending a total of $300 million from the bank to the parent. And we put that capital to work with a $400 million reduction of corporate debt in conjunction with a $540 million refinance at the lowest coupons in our company's history. And we are certainly starting 2015 on a high note.
As Mr. Idzik covered earlier, we are delighted to announce regulatory approval on one of the key components of our capital plan, operating the bank at a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%. Additionally, we received regulatory approval to move our broker-dealers out from under the bank, which marks tremendous progress in achieving ongoing capital flexibility. And lastly, we plan to dividend to the parent excess capital in the broker-dealers of approximately $430 million in Q1, taking yet another significant step toward putting capital to work for our shareholders.
With respect to the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio, we ended the year at 10.6%. Pro forma for the brokerage entity move, it would be 9.2%, so still above our new 9% target.
Regarding the movement of our broker-dealer entities. Post the financial crisis, we were left with a constraining legal entity structure where our brokerage subsidiaries resided under our bank. The planned realignment involves moving the 2 subs out from the bank in an effort to create a more streamlined and simplified legal entity structure. E*TRADE Securities, which was moved under the bank in 2009 to serve as a source of strength at the time when the bank needed it, will be moved in early February. And E*TRADE Clearing, which previously resided under the bank, will be moved later in the year.
Under our old structure, this meant that substantially all of E*TRADE's earnings were generated within the bank and were subject to bank regulatory approvals in order to extract the resulting capital. Following this reorganization, a significant amount of capital generation will be within closer proximity to the parent.
To put this in context around dividends. Our old methodology of $75 million per quarter led to the $300 million in 2014 dividends to the parent. Assuming our new structure had been implemented on January 1, 2014, we would have moved approximately $225 million of earnings from the bank, along with approximately $200 million of capital generation at the broker-dealers. In total, this would have led to dividends of approximately $425 million to the parent.
As for Q1, once E*TRADE Securities is moved, we plan to dividend excess capital to the parent, which we estimate to be around $430 million. In the first quarter 2015, we also plan to request approval for another $75 million. And in Q2 2015, we will transition to our new methodology of requesting the full amount of the prior quarter's earnings from the bank, as well as distributing the excess capital generated at the broker-dealers.
Now with respect to capital calculations in the forthcoming implementation of Basel III. We spent a lot of time applying the U.S. final Basel rules to our capital ratios, and there are several items which meaningfully impact us. A few of these we've highlighted previously. These include the phaseout of TruPS from the parent capital, which will have a negative impact, and changes to the risk weighting across our assets will result in net favorable impact to our ratios, predominantly driven by the way we risk weight margin receivables. One additional impact we have identified is quite positive in that we will be able to include a much larger portion of our DTA in regulatory capital. While we still have not finalized the impact of these changes, we do expect a meaningful benefit to our capital ratios. And as a reminder, these rules became effective at the beginning of this year. So the impact will be reflected in our Q1 ratios.
One other item that impacted our capital ratios in 2014. We benefited from exceptionally robust customer net buying activity of $7.7 billion, which muted natural balance sheet growth. This is well above normalized levels, which are in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. As we've mentioned in the past, customer activity-related growth is one element that can be challenging to control. To address this, we are in the process of redesigning our program that sweeps balances to third-party banks that will enable us to manage the size of our balance sheet with greater precision while staying in tune with the quality of the customer experience. We expect it to be up and running in the coming months.
With regard to cash at the parent, we ended the quarter with corporate cash of $233 million. Assuming our planned Q1 dividends of $430 million and $75 million, pro forma corporate cash would be $738 million. After taking into account debt service needs, this is approximately $500 million above our target of maintaining 2-year debt service coverage. Additionally, at the time we completed our recent debt transaction, we installed a $200 million revolving credit facility, giving us an added layer of liquidity and flexibility.
Given all we have accomplished on our capital plan, the questions we are now faced with are less around the timing and process of accessing capital and more around how to put it to use, and that is squarely where our focus lies today. As you're aware, reducing our corporate debt to $1 billion remains a high priority. While the nearest callability on our debt is still 10 months away, we are analyzing whether it makes to do something sooner, obviously keeping economics at the top of mind. And there are other options available to us as well. One of the most obvious of which is growing the balance sheet, now that we have regulatory approval to operate the bank at an explicit ratio.
Also, while the loan portfolio continues to be most valuable in our hands and we have no intention of disposing it in the foreseeable future, the secondary market continues to firm up. So we are keeping a watchful eye on market activity. Lastly, and very importantly, we are mindful of the merits of returning capital directly to our shareholders via buybacks and/or dividends. So while there are several potential iterations, those are the broad strokes for capital utilization. And we will obviously keep you posted as we make decisions and prepare to take action.
So in summary, we accomplished a lot in 2014 and are even better positioned for 2015. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, both for the business and for our customers, as well as our capital structure and for our shareholders.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

I mean, if history is a guide, we would still be generating a little bit more capital at the bank and growing that ratio. I think there's a couple of things to think through, both of which go back to balance sheet size. First is the point I highlighted in the prepared remarks. Our balance sheet really didn't grow during the year because of all the customer net buying, nearly $8 billion of customer net buying. You typically would not have that amount, right? So when I think about capital utilization, you're going to have -- if things return to normal levels, you're going to have a natural bias up on the balance sheet size. And then second, to the comments we made and Paul highlighted on an earlier question on our ability to bring deposits back on balance sheet, we're going to get to a place in the next couple of months of customer activity driving the amount of deposits in our own balance sheet transitioning to -- we can effectively decide very quickly with good precision on how much deposits to put back on the balance sheet. That, combined with having an explicit Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%, those 2 things together, I think, will give us comfort to bring those deposits back on balance sheet versus where we've been for the last few quarters. We've been running well below that $50 billion mark to have a much bigger buffer. So I think deposits back on balance sheet is one of the primary things, but just reiterating a few of the other things that we highlight in the prepared remarks, we'll be looking at things like making sure we're following the loan portfolio, things like the wholesale funding, all the things we've talked about before, we will continue to analyze."

Well, on our RWA, I mean, when you look at our risk weighted ratio, they are incredibly high and only going higher. So they're not going to be -- I'd be quite surprised if there are constraints, so we focus on the leverage side. And I think -- well, we don't have the numbers completed. I just figure -- to give you some directional direction on those numbers. So at the parent, there's 2 things going on. The trust preferred securities will be coming out of capital, 75% in 2015 and then the remainder in 2016. And then on the DTA side, there'll be a larger amount of the DTA will be included in capital. When I put those 2 things together, the DTA being a positive and the trust preferreds being a negative, we estimate the net impact of that is going to be an increase to that leverage ratio at the parent, not dramatic but an increase. Down at the bank, there is the impact of the TruPS -- there is no impact of the TruPS. So the primary driver down at the bank is going to be the deferred tax asset. Now the deferred tax asset overall is around $1 billion, $600 million of that -- roughly $600 million is down at the bank. And I would say broadly $300 million -- half of that $600 million is included in capital today. So when I think through, well, what's the max increase the DTA could have down at the bank, it would be -- it'd be another $300 million. So I think that at least give you some direction on what benefit we would expect under Basel III."

And specifically what's the interest rate environment look like where we buy bonds, which is more in the belly of the curve. So when you look at the 10-year coming down in a big way in Q4, well, the belly of the curve didn't move much at all.

It is truly a pleasure to be joining you to share our perspectives on E*TRADE's performance and progress in 2014. This was a momentous year for E*TRADE, one in which we benefited from a more focused organization and reshaped our brand, both to better connect with our customers; a year of sustained operation under a significantly upgraded risk management framework, ensuring we executed deliberately and with the right controls. And even more striking, all our accomplishments are buoyed by the strong financial position and regulatory standing we've had in years, leading to consistent delivery on our capital plan and value creation for our shareholders, while positioning us to create even more in the future.
Building on this momentum and on behalf of the board and my colleagues, I am incredibly proud to announce the most significant developments the company has seen in years with respect to capital efficiency and company structure. To quickly summarize the announcements we made today, we received the go-ahead from our regulators to operate E*TRADE Bank at a leverage ratio of 9% and to remove our broker-dealers from under the bank, placing them closer to the parent, enabling us to distribute to the parent excess capital of approximately $430 million. We will cover these items in more detail shortly.
Now back to 2014 and a quick walk-through of our key highlights. During the year, we posted our strongest bottom line results since 2006; saw record customer engagement across a host of metrics, particularly in asset and account growth; evolved the public face of E*TRADE with a revamped brand platform; enhanced the digital experience for our customers; seized opportunities to eliminate asymmetric risks by selling legacy assets in the non-core business; navigated our first required stress test submission with satisfying results and feedback; received regulatory approval for consistent quarterly capital distributions from our bank; and paid down corporate debt with cash for the first time in the company's history. This is a distinguished list of achievements, and I cannot thank my colleagues enough for their hard work this year.
When I began 2 years ago, we went to great lengths to realign our internal operating structure to empower colleagues to execute more effectively. We then took a hard look at our processes to see what we could improve. During 2014, we were well into implementation, and we are just starting to see the benefits of increased rigor, improved connectivity across the firm and the upgraded quality of our delivery, all centering on a resolute drive that everything we do results in improvements to the customer and drives long-term value for our owners. With these many internal changes, we are well positioned to deliver the industry-leading products and top-notch services our customers deserve. We are just beginning to see this culture impact our results and look forward to more fully witnessing the product of our labors in the coming years.
You've heard me talk a lot about our commitment to reclaim our disruptive digital roots. In pursuit of this goal, we've also realigned our technology development to be more intricately woven into the fabric of our entire organization. Our technologists now work more seamlessly across the company to wipe out customer pain points and deliver innovative products backed by more rigorous and robust design and testing; as a result, this quarter caps a year of significant additions, enhancements to the digital experience for our customers. Most recently, we rolled out new customer navigation for etrade.com, delivering a more elegant and intuitive web experience. We also further enhanced the mobile experience through added stock plan functionality, which builds on a year of impressive mobile advancements, including our iOS 8 app with first-to-market functionality, new ETF screeners and additional research tools and resources just to name a few.
Our innovative browser trading app came out of beta this quarter, which delivers real-time quotes, research and trade execution of any web page being browsed. This follows a year in which we enhanced our online adviser and Fixed Income Solutions Center, added more functionality to our elite trading platform, E*TRADE Pro, and launched back-end enhancements, allowing us to be more nimble with delivery of web content. These efforts, on top of our already strong offerings, resulted in external recognition throughout the year across a number of renowned publications. We received a four-star rating from Barron's, and best in mobile from Kiplinger's. StockBrokers.com awarded us #1 ratings for mobile and client dashboards, along with 5 best-in-class ratings for customer service, investor education, research, mobile trading and new investors. We were named most improved in the industry by J.D. Power and given a #1 rating for client satisfaction and loyalty for the third consecutive year by industry critic Group Five for our stock plan management platform, Equity Edge Online.
As a digital-centric organization, we devote significant time and energy to make sure we deliver an industry-leading mobile experience. The accolades we have received attest to my colleagues' success in building a robust digital mobile environment, which is only increasing in importance across the industry. About 12% of our trades came through our mobile app during the fourth quarter. And even more telling, over 1/4 of customer logins occurred through this channel, proof that the future of personal finance is increasingly quite literally in the palm of our customers' hands.
Our digital experience, however, is only one side of the E*TRADE coin as it's backed by personal support and expert guidance. So this year, we also enhanced the human experience, capitalizing on the new leadership in our Corporate Services division, customer service teams, financial consultants, sales and branches and arming our front-line employees with better tools to meet our customers' wants and needs.
Turning to our financial results. We recorded earnings of $1.12 for the year on net income of $330 million, excluding a $59 million pretax charge related to our debt transaction in November. Earnings benefited from increased customer engagement, low credit costs and an elevated net interest spread.
Following Q1's multi-year high in DARTs, trading activity held in well, increasing 12% for the year, inclusive of a 10% sequential increase in Q4. Options continue to account for about 22% of trades in Q4, consistent with the full year mix. Our customers trading across other asset classes continues to be minimal, with futures accounting for 1.5% of trades and ForEx making up about 30 basis points.
Trading in January-to-date is holding quite steady compared to December, currently up 3% thus far. While solid, not exactly the jump in activity we'd like to see at the start of the year as investors have remained somewhat sidelined in light of uncertainty around oil and major turbulence within European markets and currencies.
Another important indicator of customers' engagement with the market is margin receivables, which reached record levels during the year and ended at $7.7 billion, down from $8.1 billion at the end of Q3. The yield actually ticked up this quarter for the first time since 2011 as a result of the balances shifting to higher pricing tier accounts.
In terms of bringing in net new assets and accounts, we added over 17,000 net new accounts in the quarter, bringing our full year total to 146,000, the highest in over a decade. Meanwhile, attrition improved for the seventh consecutive year, albeit modestly to 8.7% from 8.8%, and Q4 was consistent with the prior quarter at 9.1% annualized.
Net new assets of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter brought our 2014 total to $10.9 billion, yet another record and up from $10.4 billion in each of the previous 2 years.
These numbers are encouraging and even more so when noted that 1/3 of our net new assets for the year were in retirement accounts. This is a strategically important area for us as we strive to do more for our customers across the full spectrum of their investing activity. Building on our unbiased approach to investment products and investment solutions, we've had a lot of success growing our managed assets, which ended the year at $3.1 billion, up 1/3 from the end of 2013.
Moving on to expenses and investments in 2015. We intend to carry our momentum forward and continue investing in the business as we've made a lot of progress and feel good about our continued prospects and related value generation.
To take a step back, the motive forces behind our investments are: first, our focus on the business and customer offering. This includes everything from our back office to our marketing dollars. We've done a lot in this category, and I can tell you that we've benefited tremendously from our attention here. We operate in a more deliberate manner with more cross collaboration and more discipline across the business. Along with our foundation, we are investing in customer-facing roles. We continue to elevate the state of play of our service and sales organizations while technology remains at the forefront of our effort. We also continue to spend opportunistically on marketing, environment permitting. And while we are clocking records across assets, accounts and margin, we have yet to truly yield benefits of our internal improvements here, but I feel sanguine about our prospects.
And the second category is far less selective, following squarely in the table stakes category, and that relates to the investments we've made in response to the heightened demand of today's regulatory and security environments. Our spend in legal, risk and compliance alone for 2014 totaled approximately $90 million, which is an increase of 50% from what we spent just 2 years prior. And we expect that number to continue its rise in 2015 to upwards of $100 million, certainly not insignificant, but absolutely necessary to progress with confidence in today's operating and regulatory landscape. While these areas, legal, risk and compliance, are often lumped into the category of enterprise risk management, our broader efforts go beyond this level of spend and truly encapsulate the fact that risk is now ingrained in everything we do across the company. We've invested in risk management within all other departments of the firm, as well as our systems and technology related to risk. Our headway in building out these areas has been paramount to our regulatory progress and was prerequisite to our ability to secure the approvals we announced today.
Moving on to the capital plan and the jolly, important announcements we made today. All of our progress de-risking the company and executing on the components of our plan culminated in significant approvals. First, we received regulatory approval to operate E*TRADE Bank at a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%, providing more opportunities for capital utilization, upon which Matthew will expand. Second, our regulators approved our plan to simplify our legal entity structure, removing our broker-dealer subsidiaries from under E*TRADE Bank, which more efficiently position the source of earnings and capital. And in conjunction with these approvals, excess capital to broker-dealers of approximately $430 million will be distributed to the parent during the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, the excess capital generated by these entities will also be available to the parent. Separately, we plan to request a dividend of another $75 million from the bank to the parent in Q1. And beginning in Q2, we will request quarterly dividends equal to the bank's net income 1 quarter in arrears.
For a brief history lesson, in 2009 as part of the company's efforts to shore up the bank's financial position and with some logical regulatory encouragement, our introducing broker-dealer, E*TRADE Securities, was moved under E*TRADE Bank, where our clearing broker-dealer, E*TRADE Clearing, already resided. This was done to ensure that the bank can stand on its own during a time of significant global stress. Suffice it to say, our bank is now in a much healthier position. So with regulatory approval, we have taken the steps to remove both broker-dealers from under E*TRADE Bank in order to create a more streamlined corporate structure.
So what does this mean? The income and, therefore, the capital generation from our brokerage operations will now be housed directly below our parent company, greatly simplifying the movement of capital. Moreover, given the explicit regulatory approval to operate the bank at 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, we have a much greater flexibility to utilize bank capital generated above that threshold.
We're now faced with a high-quality challenge of what to do with this capital, and I assure you, it is top of mind for us. Reducing our debt by another $400 million continues to be a priority of ours. Though as you can imagine, we are evaluating the most appropriate uses beyond that. Again, Matthew will update you more on the process.
A final note on the capital front. The issuer received 5 full-notch upgrades by our 3 credit rating agencies, 2 of which occurred in conjunction with our November debt pay-down and refinance. While we'd ultimately like to be investment-grade, these upgrades are a sound testament to the progress we're making and the greatly improved health of the company.
On the management team, I regret to announce that our Chief Marketing Officer, Liza Landsman, has decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities. Liza was one of my first hires here, and she made significant contributions during her tenure. She revolutionized our approach to marketing, turning what was historically an advertising-centric organization into a data-driven, analytical one that allows us to continue to make deeper and more meaningful connections with customers and prospects. I'm sorry to see her go.
At the board level, we've made significant progress to round out and strengthen our director composition, introducing 2 talented individuals over the last few months, Shelley Leibowitz and Jim Healy, both of whom sit on the Risk Oversight Committee. Ms. Leibowitz has a deep history with information technology and most recently worked at the World Bank, overseeing its product delivery infrastructure and managing its cyber security program. Mr. Healy has 25 years of experience with the financial markets and investment banking at Crédit Suisse and as an economist at the International Monetary Fund. Both Shelley and Jim are exceptional managers of risk, and seasoned operators in their respective fields. With the addition of these 2 and after bringing on a distinguished former Fed president in the past year, our board governance and support is stronger than ever with a depth of knowledge and expertise across all aspects of our business.
In closing, I want to reiterate how proud I am of all the team and all that it accomplished in 2014. As we enter 2015, we have a backbone in place to enhance our relationships with our customers and continue to grow the business. I have every confidence that everything we have done to setup the business for executional excellence will continue to benefit our customers and our owners.
And I'm particular proud of our commitment to continuously improve our regulatory standing and all we have accomplished to bring us to position of announcing some of the most significant progress we've made since the financial crisis. The vote of confidence from our regulators and the improved capital efficiency in our new corporate structure underscore all that we have done to reduce and manage our legacy risks over the past several years and to install and maintain enterprise risk management capabilities, of which we are quite proud.
And with that, I will turn the call over to our operose CFO, Matthew Audette."
27807,281479309,748459,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2015",2015-01-22,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. 2014, truly a defining year for the company as we operationalized a very clear focus and path forward that was started in 2013.From a financial standpoint, after laying out a plan less than 3 years ago and executing on all the majo",2238,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik. 2014, truly a defining year for the company as we operationalized a very clear focus and path forward that was started in 2013.
From a financial standpoint, after laying out a plan less than 3 years ago and executing on all the major components, we took yet another giant step forward with our announcements today. Our unwavering commitment to executing on that plan is quite literally paying dividends. But before I get into that, I'd like to go over our results for the quarter and year.
We reported fourth quarter net income of $78 million, or $0.26 per share, excluding a $59 million pretax charge related to our corporate debt transaction. This compares to net income of $86 million, or $0.29 per share in Q3, and net income of $58 million, or $0.20 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $461 million were up from $440 million in the prior quarter and $446 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue included net interest income of $283 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter as net interest spread increased 15 basis points, and our average assets contracted $400 million.
Our Q4 spread of 269 basis points reflected an outsized benefit from stock lending and margin receivables. On stock lending, while we are obviously thrilled with the results over the past couple of quarters, we have noted a big pullback in stock lending revenue toward the end of the quarter, which has continued into Q1. So from where we sit today, stock loan yields are down meaningfully from Q4. Margin receivables, on a similar note, which benefited from record high average balances and an uptick in yield during the quarter, declined toward the quarter end and remain near those levels today. The macro environment has also failed to cooperate with the unprecedented drop in oil prices followed by a steep drop in interest rates, obviously having an impact on our marginal rates of reinvestment. So while the environment in Q4 was quite beneficial to spread, the environment we find ourselves in today is much more challenging. And if we assume this current environment holds, our net interest spread would decline to the low to mid-240s.
Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $45.5 billion, down $0.3 billion from the prior quarter as a result of $1.2 billion of customer net buying and $240 million decline in wholesale funding. The decline in wholesale funding was driven by a temporary funding need in Q3 related to customer activity and rolled off during Q4 as planned. We have $365 million wholesale obligations expiring during 2015, all of which occurred during the second quarter.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the third quarter were $172 million, up 6% from the prior quarter and up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.84 declined $0.21 from the prior quarter and $0.13 from the year-ago period. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by our mix of options and stock plan trades.
Fees and service charges revenues of $48 million included $23 million of payment for order flow compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Net gains on loans and securities were $6 million this quarter, down from $8 million in the prior quarter. Over the next few quarters, we expect gains to continue to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. If those rates persist at their current low levels, gains would likely be at the high end of that range.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $294 million, up from $277 million in the prior quarter, largely related to marketing and professional services. In marketing, where we typically see a seasonal increase, we also spent dynamically as the environment permitted. And in professional services, there was a mix of both increased hiring, as well as some temporary project-related engagements. So there is some room for this to decline going forward.
For the full year 2015, we expect a low to mid-single digit percent increase in full year 2015 expenses. The increase is driven mostly by headcount as we hired throughout 2014, and we'll have the full year run rate in 2015. It also includes a mid- to high-single digit increase in marketing, the area where we obviously maintain the most flexibility. However, with multi-year records in net new accounts and assets in 2014, we are feeling good about our returns on those dollars.
The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $6.4 billion, down $320 million from the prior quarter. This was again predominantly prepayments while charge-offs remain minimal at just $7 million. We expect quarterly runoff for 2015 to remain in the range of 4% to 5% per quarter.
Provision for loan losses was $10 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior quarter. For all of 2014, our provision of $36 million declined 75% from the prior year. While that is tremendous improvement, I want to again reiterate that we expect provision to increase in 2015 and 2016 when the majority of our HELOCs are scheduled to convert to amortizing. With that in mind, there is no change to our $10 million to $30 million per quarter range, but a bit more color on our expected timing with 2015 expected to be at the lower half of that range and 2016 to be at the upper half.
Our allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $404 million, up marginally from the prior quarter. Reserves for the one-to-four book remain stable at $27 million, as charge-offs again netted to 0, and the release of reserves abated as we foreshadowed last quarter. Meanwhile, the home equity allowance again inched upward, ending the quarter at $367 million, a $7 million increase. One last point on the loan portfolio. While CLTVs of both portfolios were unchanged from the prior quarter at 79% for one- to four-family and 92% for home equity, they trended downward during 2013 (sic) [ 2014 ], driven by an increase in home prices as well as voluntary principal reductions.
Now with respect to progress on our capital plan. It was a busy year, and we accomplished a tremendous amount. While I know you have heard this before, at least for now, I won't get tired of delivering the recap. So to quickly hit the highlights. We successfully cleared our first round of Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. We reduced significant tail risk through actions taken on our legacy investments, including the sale of $800 million of TDRs, the elimination of our remaining non-agency CMOs, and the early termination of $100 million of wholesale funding. We demonstrated the sustainability of our enterprise risk management capabilities. We ended the year with a bank Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.6%, even after dividending a total of $300 million from the bank to the parent. And we put that capital to work with a $400 million reduction of corporate debt in conjunction with a $540 million refinance at the lowest coupons in our company's history. And we are certainly starting 2015 on a high note.
As Mr. Idzik covered earlier, we are delighted to announce regulatory approval on one of the key components of our capital plan, operating the bank at a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%. Additionally, we received regulatory approval to move our broker-dealers out from under the bank, which marks tremendous progress in achieving ongoing capital flexibility. And lastly, we plan to dividend to the parent excess capital in the broker-dealers of approximately $430 million in Q1, taking yet another significant step toward putting capital to work for our shareholders.
With respect to the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio, we ended the year at 10.6%. Pro forma for the brokerage entity moves, it would be 9.2%, so still above our new 9% target.
Regarding the movement of our broker-dealer entities. Post the financial crisis, we were left with a constraining legal entity structure where our brokerage subsidiaries resided under our bank. The planned realignment involves moving the 2 subs out from the bank in an effort to create a more streamlined and simplified legal entity structure. E*TRADE Securities, which was moved under the bank in 2009 to serve as a source of strength at the time when the bank needed it, will be moved in early February. And E*TRADE Clearing, which previously resided under the bank, will be moved to later in the year.
Under our old structure, this meant that substantially all of E*TRADE's earnings were generated within the bank, and were subject to bank regulatory approvals in order to extract the resulting capital. Following this reorganization, a significant amount of capital generation will be within closer proximity to the parent.
To put this in context around dividends: Our old methodology of $75 million per quarter led to the $300 million in 2014 dividends to the parent. Assuming our new structure had been implemented on January 1, 2014, we would have moved approximately $225 million of earnings from the bank, along with approximately $200 million of capital generation at the broker-dealers. In total, this would have led to dividends of approximately $425 million to the parent.
As for Q1, once E*TRADE Securities is moved, we plan to dividend excess capital to the parent, which we estimate to be around $430 million. In the first quarter 2015, we also plan to request approval for another $75 million. And in Q2 2015, we will transition to our new methodology of requesting the full amount of the prior quarter's earnings from the bank, as well as distributing the excess capital generated at the broker-dealers.
Now with respect to capital calculations in the forthcoming implementation of Basel III, we spent a lot of time applying the U.S. final Basel rules to our capital ratios. And there are several items which meaningfully impact us; a few of these we've highlighted previously. These include the phaseout of TruPS from the parent capital, which will have a negative impact, and changes to the risk weighting across our assets will result in net favorable impact to our ratios, predominantly driven by the way we risk weight margin receivables. One additional impact we have identified is quite positive in that we will be able to include a much larger portion of our DTA in regulatory capital. While we still have not finalized the impact of these changes, we do expect a meaningful benefit to our capital ratios. And as a reminder, these rules became effective at the beginning of this year. So the impact will be reflected in our Q1 ratios.
One other item that impacted our capital ratios in 2014. We benefited from exceptionally robust customer net buying activity of $7.7 billion, which muted natural balance sheet growth. This is well above normalized levels, which are in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. As we've mentioned in the past, customer activity-related growth is one element that can be challenging to control. To address this, we are in the process of redesigning our program that sweeps balances to third-party banks that will enable us to manage the size of our balance sheet with greater precision while staying in tune with the quality of the customer experience. We expect it to be up and running in the coming months.
With regard to cash at the parent, we ended the quarter with corporate cash of $233 million. Assuming our planned Q1 dividends of $430 million and $75 million, pro forma corporate cash would be $738 million. After taking into account debt service needs, this is approximately $500 million above our target of maintaining 2-year debt service coverage. Additionally, at the time we completed our recent debt transaction, we installed a $200 million revolving credit facility, giving us an added layer of liquidity and flexibility.
Given all we have accomplished on our capital plan, the questions we are now faced with are less around the timing and process of accessing capital and more around how to put it to use, and that is squarely where our focus lies today. As you're aware, reducing our corporate debt to $1 billion remains a high priority. While the nearest call-ability on our debt is still 10 months away, we are analyzing whether it makes to do something sooner, obviously keeping economics at the top of mind. And there are other options available to us as well. One of the most obvious of which is growing the balance sheet, now that we have regulatory approval to operate the bank at an explicit ratio.
Also, while the loan portfolio continues to be most valuable in our hands and we have no intention of disposing it in the foreseeable future, the secondary market continues to firm up. So we are keeping a watchful eye on market activity. Lastly, and very importantly, we are mindful of the merits of returning capital directly to our shareholders via buybacks and/or dividends. So while there are several potential iterations, those are the broad strokes for capital utilization. And we will obviously keep you posted as we make decisions and prepare to take action.
So in summary, we accomplished a lot in 2014 and are even better positioned for 2015. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, both for the business and for our customers, as well as our capital structure and for our shareholders.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

I mean, if history is a guide, we would still be generating a little bit more capital at the bank and growing that ratio. I think there's a couple of things to think through, both of which go back to balance sheet size. First is the point I highlighted in the prepared remarks. Our balance sheet really didn't grow during the year because of all the customer net buying, nearly $8 billion of customer net buying. You typically would not have that amount, right? So when I think about capital utilization, you're going to have -- if things return to normal levels, you're going to have a natural bias up on the balance sheet size. And then second, to the comments we made and Paul highlighted on an earlier question, our ability to bring deposits back on balance sheet. We're going to get to a place in the next couple of months of customer activity driving the amount of deposits in our own balance sheet transitioning to, we can effectively decide very quickly with good precision how much deposits to put back on the balance sheet. That, combined with having an explicit Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%, those 2 things together, I think, will give us comfort to bring those deposits back on balance sheet versus where we've been for the last few quarters. We've been running well below that $50 billion mark to have a much bigger buffer. So I think deposits back on balance sheet is one of the primary things, but just reiterating a few of the other things that we highlight in the prepared remarks, we'll be looking at things like making sure we're following the loan portfolio, things like the wholesale funding, all the things we've talked about before, we will continue to analyze."

So they're not going to be -- I'd be quite surprised if there are constraints, so we focus on the leverage side. And I think -- well, we don't have the numbers completed. I just figure -- to give you some directional direction on those numbers. So at the parent, there's 2 things going on. The trust preferred securities will be coming out of capital, 75% in 2015 and then the remainder in 2016. And then on the DTA side, there'll be a larger amount of the DTA will be included in capital. When I put those 2 things together, the DTA being a positive and the trust preferreds being a negative, we estimate the net impact of that is going to be an increase to that leverage ratio at the parent, not dramatic but an increase. Down at the bank, there is the impact of the TruPS -- there is no impact of the TruPS. So the primary driver down at the bank is going to be the deferred tax asset. Now the deferred tax asset overall is around $1 billion, $600 million of that -- roughly $600 million is down at the bank. And I would say broadly $300 million -- half of that $600 million is included in capital today. So when I think through, well, what's the max increase the DTA could have down at the bank, it would be -- it'd be another $300 million. So I think that at least give you some direction on what benefit we would expect under Basel III."

And specifically what's the interest rate environment look like where we buy bonds, which is more in the belly of the curve. So when you look at the 10-year coming down in a big way in Q4, well, the belly of the curve didn't move much at all. So it didn't have a huge impact on things versus the last 2 or 3 weeks, the 3- to 5-year point in the curve moved down in a pretty big way.

If $50 billion were to move up and quite frankly, I think it should move up, that would just make it easier to look at that without some of the ambiguity of estimating the complete economics."

Good evening, and thank you for joining us. During the quarter, we've posted healthy brokerage methods with robust active accumulation and the team delivered enhancements to our service offerings, earning some welcomed recognition along the way with all of this aimed at meeting our commitment to do more for our customers. 
Let me begin with our capital plans since I recognize that it's stand as a topic of more than passing interest to many of you. We entered 2015 with corners welcoming some key approvals from our regulators. These approvals underscored E*TRADE's progress across a number of fronts then ultimately facilitated the company's reduction of corporate debt to our target level. This represented a major milestone for enterprise, as we continue down the path of driving value for our owners. On last quarter's call, we announced the approval to move out our 2 broker-dealers from under the bank. In February, we completed a move of E*TRADE Securities, our introducing broker. Our plan remains on track to move the clearing broker in the second half of the year as we work through the intricacies of that transaction. Matthew will provide more details later. 
In conjunction with the move of our introducing broker, $434 million of capital became available to the parent which used to achieve the goal of reducing corporate debt to $1 billion. The most recent transaction brings our cumulative debt reduction to $740 million, which were completed in just 4 months. Looked at from another perspective, in the time since the company first submitted its capital plan in 2012, debt service costs have been reduced by more than 70% to just $15 million. Our 3 credit rating agencies have recognized these achievements with a total of 8 full notch upgrades over the past 12 month, including 3 in conjunction with the March debt transaction. Each upgrade is encouraging as we continue to make strides to further goal of becoming investment-grade. With debt reduction behind us, we turn our focus on how we will next with our capital to work. For the first time in more than 5 years, we have a meaningful direct source of capital generation of the parent any form of our introducing broker-dealer and with our organizational realignment, clarity on bank capital ratios and plans to continues requesting quarterly dividends from the bank, we're in an attractive position when it comes to putting more capital work for our shareholders. With significant opportunities in front of us, we are evaluating how to the most appropriately and effectively put capital to use. 
Turning to results. Excluding the early extinguishment of that charge, we recorded earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter on an income of $85 million. Our results were driven by solid customer engagement, including record-high margin loan balances, lower-than-expected provision and a benefit of corporate interest expense from our March debt transaction. DARTs for the quarter were just shy of 170,000, up slightly from the prior quarter but down 14% from last year's unusually buoyant Q1. Options represented approximately 23% of total trading activity, in line with trends over the past couple of years. We've seen a pullback in activity of April to date with DARTs tracking down 6% from March. Margin balances grew by approximately $500 million to end the quarter to record $8.2 billion. Balance has dipped at the beginning of the year which is reflected in the quarterly average of $7.9 billion but steadily rebounded in the latter half of the quarter. Our customers or net buyers are $3.1 billion securities in the quarter, continuing the multiyear trend of customers putting their money to work. We added 39,000 net new brokerage accounts in Q1, up from 17,000 in the prior quarter but down from 72,000 a year ago, which was a 5-year record. Attrition of 8.8% improved from 9.1% in the prior quarter. Net new brokerage assets of $3.5 billion represented annualized growth of 5.7%. This maxed our asset gatherings from the prior quarter but was down from a record $4.1 billion 1 year ago. This asset gathering is encouraging especially when you consider the type of assets customers are bringing to E*TRADE. Becoming known as trusted place for investors to build their financial health is essential for us, and we have devoted much time and energy to that side of the business. As measured by our success, roughly 1/4 of our net new assets in the quarter were in retirement accounts. We closed our retirement season strong, ending with Q1 with nearly $50 billion of retirement assets, up 11% from last year. The key component of growth here is price-based solutions and we are encouraged and how these assets continued to perform. Asset and manage accounts reached $2.2 billion this quarter, up an impressive 24% from a year ago. We also continued our steady drum beat of customer-driven digital enhancements. These included making it easier for our customers to manage taxes related to their investments, creating an even better experience for our most active traders and delivering more functionality to our ready-leading mobile platform, and a tax center delivers a more intuitive and helpful experience by centralizing tax documents and better positioning resources and education for cost base reporting, gains and losses and tax efficient investing. We also made multiple improvements to E*TRADE PRO, our platform for active traders including tax trading, pattern day training enhancements and order entry updates, which were taken together, give a more customized intuitive and hassle-free experience for our most active customers. With a record 30% of our total DARTs place to our mobile application this quarter, we continue to fortify our position as a leader in mobile trading and investing, adding multi-leg options functionality, employee stock plan trading and stock alerts to name a few. Just weeks ago, we announced a meaningful step forward in the wearable space with our app for the Apple watch. The Apple deliver essential market data in an engaging and simple format to help investors and traders monitor their portfolios, watch lists and the markets. It also includes hand-off functionality that delivers a seamless transition from watch to phone. Our continuous improvements in leading-edge technology offerings are not going unnoticed as we received a number of accolades from well-recognized external sources. Parents rated us 4 out of 5 stars in their annual online broker survey, scoring high marks in research amenities and customer service and education. stockbrokers.com gave us 3 first-place awards. :#1 smartphone app, #1 client dashboard and best new tool for E*TRADE browser trading in the 2015 online book review. In the same review, we earned 5 best-in-class ratings for offering investments, investor education, research, mobile trading and new investors. We were also recognize the by in their first annual tech awards for our browser trading web app. And lastly, I recognized that I ran the risk of being ungracious and boring you when I talk about the importance of risk. And my sermon on the subject hasn't changed. We've built out this capabilities, we're running a world-class ERM department and risk management is at the heart of everything we do. To that end, I thought it was an opportune time to have here Chief Risk Officer, Michael Pizzi, joined the call before handing things off to our elusive CFO, Matthew Audette. Over to you, Mr. Pizzi."

I'd first want to take a moment to talk about the central role risk management plays here at E*TRADE, and then I'll move into credit, risk and an update on the legacy loan portfolio. 
In 2012, we devoted significant focused on bolstering our Enterprise Risk Management as a key component of our capital plan. At the time, we have prudently strong financial risk management but significant work remain to establish some full some operational risk framework. We look to a number of outside experts for inputs and best practices and collectively determine if there was a need for much clearer and more robust governance, escalation and root cause analysis. We have spent the past several years putting the systems and processes in place, in conjunction with building out robust and highly credible stress testing capabilities, as well as making significant enhancements in third-party oversight, model risk management, ongoing risk assessment and monitoring. Our hard work has resulted in an Enterprise Risk Management function that is consistent with that of much larger institutions. In practice, our ERM framework consists of 3 lines of defense. The first line, the various lines of business within the company. The second line, the risk organization along with our colleagues and compliance and legal. And the third line, the internal audit group. We have built the coverage model where each area of the company's business has a dedicated partner in the risk, legal and compliance areas. We have also worked to improve and develop the company's risk culture, having conducted workshops throughout the entire organization to ingrain risk management into the very fabric of our organization and to make sure each colleagues knows they are risk owners within the respective areas. We have built a strong risk management culture, tying risk to performance measures down to the individual level. In short, risk management is part of everything we do at E*TRADE. As you've heard Matt and Paul say before, the buildout is key but stainability is critical. The latter is how I would characterize the phase we are in today, demonstrating the sustainability and effectiveness of the program we worked so hard to install. And while I feel good about how far we've come, we will, of course, continue to fine-tune our practices to evolve both with the operating and regulatory landscapes. 
Down on to credit risk management, an important ye t diminishing component of my role. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $6.1 billion, down $317 million from the prior quarter. This was essentially all paid outs as charge-offs were flat to the prior quarter at just $7 million. We expect clearly runoff of the portfolio to remain in the 4% to 5% range throughout 2015. Provision for loan losses was $5 million in the first quarter, down from $10 million in the prior period. Matt will give you more color around our provision expectations, but clearly this quarter was better than we anticipated. As we navigate through the upcoming HELOC conversions throughout the remainder of this year and next, this will be the most prominent variable in determining our provision expense. Thus far, we have a very small sample of loans who have converted their generally a higher credit quality loans. And while they have largely performed more favorably than expected, it is very early days. As we approach more meaningful amount of conversions, we are working with our services on proactive borrower outreach at loss mitigation where possible. Meanwhile, our allowance ended the quarter relatively unchanged at $402 million. The reserves shifted slightly with an increase in the 1-to-4 family book and a decrease in home equity. The 1-to4 reserves increased $4 million to $31 million. Home equity reserves declined $7 million to end the quarter at $360 million. The decline related to better-than-expected performance following a plan service to transfer who was previously booked reserves. The transfer took place in February and is also the driving force behind the increase in early-stage delinquency this quarter. We also had a plan service or transfer in the one-to-four portfolio, which drove an associated increase in early-stage delinquencies. However, we did not recognize reserves for this transfer as 1-to-4 loans typically self-correct where as the for home equity is much lower. So in summary, credit risk is becoming a smaller issue with each passing quarter, and we are proud of the progress we have made to become an institution known internally and externally as one that is serious about and committed to risk management. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

We had a pretty tremendous start to the year. they multiyear effort from, our corporate debt is now were it belongs. And on top of that, we posted strong operating results driven by a number of factors. Reporter first quarter net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share, excluding a $73 million pretax charge related to our corporate debt transaction. Excluding a similar charge of $59 million of the prior quarter, this compares to net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share and net income of $97 million or a $0.33 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $456 million were down from $461 million in the prior quarter and $475 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue included net interest income of $271 million, down $8 million from the prior quarter as net interest spread contracted 7 basis points and our average assets increased approximately $200 million. Although spread contracted sequentially, at 262 basis points, it was above our expectations as we once again benefited from elevated margin loan balances and strong securities lending results. After experiencing declines in both of these at the beginning of Q1, both trended upward in the second 2 months of the quarter. We also saw some spread compression as a result of a slight increase in prepayments and lower reinvestment rates on the securities portfolio. 
In the second quarter to-date, rates continue to be challenging. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low to mid-250s [ph] in the second quarter. Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $46.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter. We completed the conversion of our sweep deposits to a new platform during the quarter and begin to put it to work in March, moving $1.25 billion of customer deposits held by third-party banks back on our balance sheet. With this new platform, we can much more efficiently move deposits on and off balance sheet, giving us a powerful tool for managing balance sheet size. We have converted approximately $15 billion of our $42 billion in brokerage customer cash to the new platform. Of that $15 billion that is converted, a little under $4 billion is held by third-party banks and a little over $11 billion is on our balance sheet. 
One component of our customer cash is [indiscernible], where approximately $8 billion resides largely as a result of our deleveraging efforts. We will ultimately like to move that portion into the sweep program as it has benefits for both us and the customer. It's a more lengthy process involving system changes and customer consents, but we're working on it and we'll keep you posted. 
With the rollout of new sweep platform, we've determined that classifying the revenue generated from off-balance sheet deposits in fees and service charges as opposed to net interest income is more consistent with how this type of revenue is generally presented within the industry. Accordingly, Q1 has about $5 million of reclassified revenue in this line, which is up from $4 million in the prior quarter and $3 million the year-ago quarter. For comparability purposes, prior periods have also been reclassified. Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the first quarter were $176 million, flat with the prior quarter and down 6% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.94 increased $0.10 from the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year-ago period. The quarterly increase was driven by higher stock plan trading while the year-over-year increase was driven by a more favorable options and customer mix. Fees and service charges revenues of $52 million included $23 million of payment quarter for [indiscernible], flat with the prior quarter. Net gains and loans and securities were $9 million this quarter, up from $6 million from prior quarter and in line with our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We stated last quarter that if rates remain low, we would likely be at the high end of the range, and that is exactly what you saw this quarter. Our operating expenses for the quarter were $300 million, up $6 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by comp and ben, which reflected a seasonal increase. Our operating expenses for Q1 were well in line with our expectations, and we are still planning for full year 2015 expenses to increase in the low to mid-single-digits. 
As Mike discussed, provision for the quarter was $5 million. Given what we have experienced and the healthy reserves we maintain, we are adjusting our expected commission range for this year to 0 to $20 million per quarter, effectively expanding and lowering our prior range of $10 million to $20 million. Looking ahead to 2016, we are also adjusting our expectations. Now forecasting provisions will land at or above the top end of our current range. This is slightly improved from our prior range of $20 million to $30 million per quarter. However, I must caution the visibility into performance this far out certainly limited, and we will adjust our expectations as we gain clarity. 
As Mike mentioned, HELOC conversions will be the most important variable here. There are still only a small population of loans that have actually converted. We will have more significant data throughout the year, as there are approximately $500 million of loans that will convert over the course of the next 3 quarters. We will then have $900 million converting next year, after which this event will largely be behind us. We will certainly keep you price of any trends that we see in the performance of these loans. 
Turning now to the capital plans. To reemphasize what Paul said earlier, we've accomplished a lot in 2015 already. To recap the first quarter, we utilized $432 million of corporate cash to pay down $340 million of debt and refinance another $460 million. At 4.625%,  the lowest coupon in the company's history while extending our maturity profile by more than 2 years with our nearest maturity now in 2022. Debt reduction was at central goal of the capital plan when we first laid it out in June of 2012. As we worked on our plans for a number of reasons, it became clear that $1 billion was the right amount. Now that we are sitting at $1 billion, it was no more space for my shelf for debt deal stories. It feels good to be done talking about debt reduction and focusing on what is next. At the moment, we are working to ensure smooth transition of our clearing broker from under the bank. Since this entity has been under the bank, it is benefited from a shared surplus of capital and liquidity. As we prepare to move it out, we have to establish and formalized new lines of liquidity even though this may ultimately remain undrawn. In conjunction with this, we are also evaluating whether it make sense to move additional capital into that entity. So the bottom line is that until we determine how E*TRADE Clearing will be situated from a capital liquidity standpoint, it is prudent to wait on further capital actions. As a reminder, we intend to move the entity in the second half of this year. With the approval to manage the bank at a 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, we ended the quarter rightly above that threshold at 9.8%. The implementation of Basel III benefited that ratio by approximately 90 basis points. Keep in mind that this still include E*TRADE Clearing and its existing capital and assets. Excluding it would've decreased our ratio by approximately 10 basis points. So on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $240 million of capital in excess of our regulatory threshold at the bank. As a reminder, we plan to request quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent, equal to its prior quarter net income. In Q1, net income for the bank was $92 million. 
Also during Q1, E*TRADE Securities generated approximately $50 million in excess capital, which we plan to move to the parent next week. So that go, Paul, we are in a position of strength when it comes to the capital available to us, and we are very deliberately working throughout the most appropriately put it to use. I don't have specifics for you today, but I would like to offer my thoughts on the few of the options. To start, under our new structure, we will have capital available for use at both the bank and the parent. At the bank, we will have the ability to utilize capital and excess of 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Our most prominent options include balance sheet growth in the acceleration of legacy risk reduction, meaning potentially eliminating wholesale funding obligations ahead of schedule and selling the remainder of the loan portfolio. While neither of these actions are in our plans today, we are constantly assessing the path forward as it relates to legacy risks. 
At the parent, we have the ability to utilize capital from the broker, plus the planned quarterly dividend request equivalent to the bank's net income. Obvious uses include share buybacks, dividends and investing in the business where we see opportunity to helping returns. 
For a little more detail on these items, balance sheet growth is certainly an option, especially in a more attractive rate environment than the one we find ourselves in today. We ended the quarter with $46.8 billion of assets, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter, which is largely the result of the implementation of our new sweep deposit program. So we still have some room to utilize capital by growing the balance sheet while staying below $50 billion, which remains our intention. On wholesale funding, we ended up quarter of $4.6 billion with $365 million scheduled to expire primarily in the second half of this year. The cost to eliminate these borrowings would be approximately $415 million pretax, which is essentially the acceleration of future costs, so relatively neutral from an economic standpoint. 
While there certain benefit from accelerating the path towards normalized earnings, there are also other considerations which we would need to work through. Incurring losses of magnitude of the bank with the applications for the capital plan and in our companies tax sharing arrangements. Additionally, keep in mind that the duration profile of wholesale funding is generally longer than that of our deposits, impacting the economic benefit analysis of replacing wholesale with deposits. In short, our current position is to keep in these funding source on our books. However, we are doing the work across multiple, complex dimension to determine if this should change. The loan portfolio is a similar story. It still our intention to hold those loans on our books as that is precisely where we believe the value is maximized. However, as they continue to sea Sun and the risks become more visible, we are keeping a watchful eye in the secondary market. The bottom line is they work more today to hold onto. But if the secondary market of our portfolio will to firm up significantly, our thinking change. 
Now turning to capital at the parent. With the introducing broker-dealer directly under the parent, we have a more definitive source of capital and some additional flexibility for how we put our capital to use. At quarter end, we had $258 million in parent cash, approximately $150 million above our target of 2-year debt service coverage of $100 million. Over the near term at least, our flexibility here is limited by other considerations, including covenants within our corporate debt, which will be a factor as long as our credit rating is self-investment grade. And obviously, our board and regulators are constituencies that are involved in these matters. 
What I want you to take from all of this is that we have some items to work through. And as we have throughout the course of our capital plan progress, we will update you when appropriate. But I can assure you that our objective is to deploy this capital in a way that maximizes value for our shareholders. In summary and speaking for the entirety of our management at E*TRADE, we are full steam ahead. We have checked a number of exceptional accomplishments off our to-do list already, and we are eager to keep moving down this track. And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

So we'll see that where that takes us, now -- meeting in the call, $49 billion range. With respect to timing. The timing is relatively efficient. If it's in your -- I think in your research on your initiation coverage, discussing all the different things that we did from a deleveraging standpoint, those took a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of individual negotiations with banks, so months and months and months to get in place.

It's not an enormous driver of our bottom line from the amount we make on the deposits from the amount we make on margins and stock loans to the growing amount of phase and service charges from our managed products and programs.

During the quarter, we've posted healthy brokerage records with robust asset accumulation.

Permit me to begin with our capital plans, since I recognize that it stands as a topic of more than passing interest to many of you. We entered 2015 with core nets welcoming some key approvals from our regulators. These approvals underscored E*TRADE's progress across a number of fronts and ultimately facilitated the company's reduction of corporate debt to our target level. This represented a major milestone for our enterprise, as we continue down the path of driving value for our owners. On last quarter's call, we announced the approval to move out our 2 broker-dealers from under the bank. In February, we completed the move of E*TRADE Securities, our introducing broker. Our plan remains on track to move the clearing broker in the second half of the year as we work through the intricacies of that transaction. Matthew will provide more details later. 
In conjunction with the move of our introducing broker, $434 million of capital became available to the parent, which we used to achieve the goal of reducing corporate debt to $1 billion. The most recent transaction brings our cumulative debt reduction to $740 million, which we completed in just 4 months. Looked at from another perspective, in the time since the company first submitted its capital plan in 2012, debt service costs have been reduced by more than 70% to just $15 million. Our 3 credit rating agencies have recognized these achievements with a total of 8 full-notch upgrades over the past 12 months, including 3 in conjunction with the March debt transaction. Each upgrade is encouraging, as we continue to make strides towards our goal of becoming investment-grade. With debt reduction behind us, we turn our focus to how we will next put our capital to work. For the first time in more than 5 years, we have a meaningful direct source of capital generation at the parent in the form of our introducing broker-dealer. And with our organizational realignment, clarity on bank capital ratios and plans to continue requesting quarterly dividends from the bank, we're in an attractive position when it comes to putting more capital to work for our shareholders. With significant opportunities in front of us, we are evaluating how to most appropriately and effectively put capital to use. 
Turning to results. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt charge, we recorded earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter on an income of $85 million. Our results were driven by solid customer engagement, including record-high margin loan balances, lower-than-expected provision and a benefit of corporate interest expense from our March debt transaction. DARTs for the quarter were just shy of 170,000, up slightly from the prior quarter but down 14% from last year's unusually buoyant Q1. Options represented approximately 23% of total trading activity, in line with trends over the past couple of years. We've seen a pullback in activity in April to date, with DARTs tracking down 6% from March. Margin balances grew by approximately $500 million to end the quarter at a record $8.2 billion. Balance has dipped at the beginning of the year, which is reflected in the quarterly average of $7.9 billion, but steadily rebounded in the latter half of the quarter. Our customers were net buyers of $3.1 billion securities in the quarter, continuing the multiyear trend of customers putting their money to work. We added 39,000 net new brokerage accounts in Q1, up from 17,000 in the prior quarter but down from 72,000 a year ago, which was a 5-year record. Attrition of 8.8% improved from 9.1% in the prior quarter. Net new brokerage assets of $3.5 billion represented annualized growth of 5.7%. This matched our asset gathering from the prior quarter but was down from a record $4.1 billion 1 year ago. This asset gathering is encouraging, especially when you consider the type of assets customers are bringing to E*TRADE. Becoming known as a trusted place for investors to build their financial health is essential for us, and we have devoted much time and energy to that side of the business. As measured by our success, roughly 1/4 of our net new assets in the quarter were in retirement accounts. We've closed out retirement season strong, ending Q1 with nearly $50 billion of retirement assets, up 11% from last year. A key component of growth here is advice-based solutions, and we are encouraged by how these assets continue to perform. Assets in managed accounts reached $3.2 billion this quarter, up an impressive 24% from a year ago. We also continued our steady drum beat of customer-driven digital enhancements. These included: making it easier for our customers to manage taxes related to their investments, creating an even better experience for our most active traders and delivering more functionality to our already leading mobile platform. Our new Tax Center delivers a more intuitive and helpful experience by centralizing tax documents and better positioning resources and education for cost-based reporting, gains and losses and tax-efficient investing. We also made multiple improvements to E*TRADE Pro, our platform for active traders, including tax live training, pattern day training enhancements and order entry updates, which when taken together, deliver a more customized, intuitive and hassle-free experience for our most active customers. With a record 13% of our total DARTs placed through our mobile application this quarter, we continue to fortify our position as a leader in mobile trading and investing, adding multi-leg options functionality, employee stock plan trading and stock alerts to name a few. Just weeks ago, we announced a meaningful step forward in the wearable space with our app for the Apple Watch. The app will deliver essential market data in an engaging and simple format to help investors and traders monitor portfolios, watchlists in the markets. It also includes hand-off functionality that delivers a seamless transition from watch to phone. Our continuous improvements in leading-edge technology offerings are not going unnoticed, as we've received a number of accolades from well-recognized external sources. Barron's rated us 4 out of 5 stars in their annual Online Broker Survey, scoring high marks in research amenities and customer service and education. StockBrokers.com gave us 3 first place awards: #1 Smartphone App, #1 Client Dashboard and Best New Tool for E*TRADE Browser Trading in their 2015 Online Broker Review. In the same review, we earned 5 best-in-class ratings for Offering of Investments, Investor Education, Research, Mobile Trading and New Investors. We were also recognized by Benzinga in their first annual Fintech Awards for our Browser Trading web app. 
And lastly, I recognize that I run the risk of being ungracious and boring you when I talk about the importance of risk. And my sermon on the subject hasn't changed. We've built out these capabilities, we're running a world-class ERM department and risk management is at the heart of everything we do. To that end, I thought it was an opportune time to have our distinguished Chief Risk Officer, Michael Pizzi, join the call before handing things off to our pellucid CFO, Matthew Audette. Over to you, Mr. Pizzi."

I first want to take a moment to talk about the central role risk management plays here at E*TRADE, and then I'll move into credit risk and an update on the legacy loan portfolio. 
In 2012, we devoted significant focus to bolstering our enterprise risk management as a key component of our capital plan. At the time, we had prudent and strong financial risk management but significant work remain to establish a fulsome operational risk framework. We looked to a number of outside experts for input and best practices, and collectively determined that there was a need for much clearer and more robust governance, escalation and root cause analysis. We have spent the past several years putting these systems and processes in place, in conjunction with building out robust and highly credible stress testing capabilities as well as making significant enhancements in third-party oversight, model risk management, ongoing risk assessment and monitoring. Our hard work has resulted in an enterprise risk management function that is consistent with that of much larger institutions. In practice, our ERM framework consists of 3 lines of defense. The first line, the various lines of business within the company. The second line, the risk organization, along with our colleagues in compliance and legal. And the third line, the internal audit group. We have built a coverage model where each area of the company's business has a dedicated partner in the risk, legal and compliance areas. We have also worked to improve and develop the company's risk culture, having conducted workshops throughout the entire organization to ingrain risk management into the very fabric of our organization and to make sure each colleagues knows they are risk owners within their respective areas. We have built a strong risk management culture, tying risk to performance measures down to the individual level. In short, risk management is part of everything we do at E*TRADE. As you've heard Matt and Paul say before, the buildout is key but stainability is critical. The latter is how I would characterize the phase we are in today, demonstrating the sustainability and effectiveness of the program we've worked so hard to install. And while I feel good about how far we've come, we will, of course, continue to fine-tune our practices to evolve both with the operating and regulatory landscapes. 
Now on to credit risk management, an important yet diminishing component of my role. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $6.1 billion, down $317 million from the prior quarter. This was essentially all paydowns, as charge-offs were flat to the prior quarter at just $7 million. We expect quarterly runoff of the portfolio to remain in the 4% to 5% range throughout 2015. Provision for loan losses was $5 million in the first quarter, down from $10 million in the prior period. Matt will give you more color around our provision expectations, but clearly this quarter was better than we anticipated. As we navigate through the upcoming HELOC conversions throughout the remainder of this year and next, this will be the most prominent variable in determining our provision expense. Thus far, we have a very small sample of loans that have converted. They're generally our higher-credit quality loans. And while they have largely performed more favorably than expected, it is very early days. As we approach a more meaningful amount of conversions, we are working with our servicers on proactive borrower outreach and loss mitigation, where possible. Meanwhile, our allowance ended the quarter relatively unchanged at $402 million. The reserves shifted slightly, with an increase in the one- to four-family book and a decrease in home equity. The one- to four- reserves increased $4 million to $31 million. Home equity reserves declined $7 million to end the quarter at $360 million. The decline related to better-than-expected performance following a planned servicer transfer for which we've previously booked reserves. The transfer took place in February and is also the driving force behind the increase in early-stage delinquency this quarter. We also had a planned servicer transfer in the one- to four- portfolio, which drove an associated increase in early-stage delinquencies. However, we did not recognize reserves for this transfer as one- to four- loans typically self-correct, whereas, the gearing for home equity is much lower. 
So in summary, credit risk is becoming a smaller issue with each passing quarter, and we are proud of the progress we have made to become an institution known internally and externally as one that is serious about, and committed to, risk management. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."
27807,290770469,793823,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, distinguished Mike.

And on top of that, we posted strong operating results driven by a number of factors. We reported first quar",2088,"Thank you, distinguished Mike. We had a pretty tremendous start to the year. After a multiyear effort, our corporate debt is now where it belongs. And on top of that, we posted strong operating results driven by a number of factors. We reported first quarter net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share, excluding a $73 million pretax charge related to our corporate debt transaction. And excluding a similar charge of $59 million in the prior quarter, this compares to net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share and net income of $97 million or a $0.33 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $456 million were down from $461 million in the prior quarter and $475 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue included net interest income of $271 million, down $8 million from the prior quarter, as net interest spread contracted 7 basis points and our average assets increased approximately $200 million. Although spread contracted sequentially, at 262 basis points, it was above our expectations, as we once again benefited from elevated margin loan balances and strong securities lending results. After experiencing declines in both of these at the beginning of Q1, both trended upward in the second 2 months of the quarter. We also saw some spread compression as a result of a slight increase in prepayments and lower reinvestment rates on the securities portfolio. 
In the second quarter to-date, rates continued to be challenging. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low to mid-250s in the second quarter. Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $46.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter. We completed the conversion of our sweep deposits to a new platform during the quarter and began to put it to work in March, moving $1.25 billion of customer deposits held by third-party banks back on our balance sheet. With this new platform, we can much more efficiently move deposits on and off balance sheet, giving us a powerful tool for managing balance sheet size. We have converted approximately $15 billion of our $42 billion in brokerage customer cash to the new platform. Of that $15 billion that is converted, a little under $4 billion is held by third-party banks and a little over $11 billion is on our balance sheet. 
One component of our customer cash is money funds, where approximately $8 billion resides, largely as a result of our de-leveraging efforts. We would ultimately like to move that portion into the sweep program, as it has benefits for both us and the customer. It's a more lengthy process involving system changes and customer consent, but we're working on it and we'll keep you posted. 
With the rollout of a new sweep platform, we've determined that classifying the revenue generated from off-balance sheet deposits in fees and service charges as opposed to net interest income is more consistent with how this type of revenue is generally presented within the industry. Accordingly, Q1 has about $5 million of reclassified revenue in this line, which is up from $4 million in the prior quarter and $3 million in the year-ago quarter. For comparability purposes, prior periods have also been reclassified. Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the first quarter were $176 million, flat with the prior quarter and down 6% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.94 increased $0.10 from the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year-ago period. The quarterly increase was driven by higher stock plan trading, while the year-over-year increase was driven by a more favorable options and customer mix. Fees and service charges revenues of $52 million included $23 million of payment for order flow, flat with the prior quarter. Net gains on loans and securities were $9 million this quarter, up from $6 million the prior quarter and in line with our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We stated last quarter that if rates remain low, we would likely be at the high end of the range. And that is exactly what you saw this quarter. 
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $300 million, up $6 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by compen-ben, which reflected a seasonal increase. Our operating expenses for Q1 were well in line with our expectations, and we are still planning for full year 2015 expenses to increase in the low to mid-single digits. 
As Mike discussed, provision for the quarter was $5 million. Given what we have experienced and the healthy reserves we maintain, we are adjusting our expected provision range for this year to 0 to $20 million per quarter, effectively expanding and lowering our prior range of $10 million to $20 million. Looking ahead to 2016, we are also adjusting our expectations, now forecasting provisions to land at or above the top end of our current range. This is slightly improved from our prior range of $20 million to $30 million per quarter. However, I must caution that visibility into performance this far out is certainly limited, and we will adjust our expectations as we gain clarity. 
As Mike mentioned, HELOC conversions will be the most important variable here. There is still only a small population of loans that have actually converted. We will have more significant data throughout the year, as there are approximately $500 million of loans that will convert over the course of the next 3 quarters. We will then have $900 million converting next year, after which, this event will largely be behind us. We will certainly keep you apprised of any trends that we see in the performance of these loans. 
Turning now to the capital plans. To reemphasize what Paul said earlier, we've accomplished a lot in 2015 already. To recap the first quarter. We utilized $432 million of corporate cash to pay down $340 million of debt and refinanced another $460 million at 4.625%, the lowest coupon in the company's history, while extending our maturity profile by more than 2 years, with our nearest maturity now in 2022. Debt reduction was an essential goal of the capital plan when we first laid it out in June of 2012. As we worked on our plans for a number of reasons, it became clear that $1 billion was the right amount. Now that we are sitting at $1 billion, there were no more space on my shelf for debt deal toys. It feels good to be done talking about debt reduction and focusing on what is next. At the moment, we are working to ensure a smooth transition of our clearing broker from under the bank. Since this entity has been under the bank, it has benefited from a shared surplus of capital and liquidity. As we prepare to move it out, we have to establish and formalize new lines of liquidity, even though this may ultimately remain undrawn. In conjunction with this, we are also evaluating whether it makes sense to move additional capital into that entity. So the bottom line is that until we determine how E*TRADE Clearing will be situated from a capital liquidity standpoint, it is prudent to wait on further capital actions. As a reminder, we intend to move the entity in the second half of this year. With the approval to manage the bank at a 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, we ended the quarter nicely above that threshold at 9.8%. The implementation of Basel III benefited that ratio by approximately 90 basis points. Keep in mind that this still includes E*TRADE Clearing and its existing capital and assets. Excluding it would've decreased our ratio by approximately 10 basis points. So on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $240 million of capital in excess of our regulatory threshold at the bank. As a reminder, we plan to request quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent, equal to its prior-quarter net income. In Q1, net income for the bank was $92 million. 
Also during Q1, E*TRADE Securities generated approximately $50 million in excess capital, which we plan to move to the parent next week. So to echo Paul, we are in a position of strength when it comes to the capital available to us, and we are very deliberately working through how to most appropriately put it to use. I don't have specifics for you today, but I would like to offer my thoughts on a few of the options. 
To start, under our new structure, we will have capital available for use at both the bank and the parent. At the bank, we will have the ability to utilize capital in excess of our 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Our most prominent options include balance sheet growth in the acceleration of legacy risk reduction, meaning potentially eliminating wholesale funding obligations ahead of schedule and selling the remainder of the loan portfolio. While neither of these actions are in our plans today, we are constantly assessing the path forward as it relates to legacy risks. 
At the parent, we have the ability to utilize capital from the broker, plus the planned quarterly dividend request equivalent to the bank's net income. Obvious uses include share buybacks, dividends and investing in the business where we see opportunity for helping returns. 
For a little more detail on these items. Balance sheet growth is certainly an option, especially in a more attractive rate environment than the one we find ourselves in today. We ended the quarter with $46.8 billion of assets, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter, which is largely the result of the implementation of our new sweep deposit program. So we still have some room to utilize capital by growing the balance sheet, while staying below $50 billion, which remains our intention. On wholesale funding, we ended the quarter at $4.6 billion, with $365 million scheduled to expire primarily in the second half of this year. The cost to eliminate these borrowings would be approximately $415 million pretax, which is essentially the acceleration of future costs, so relatively neutral from an economic standpoint. 
While there are certain benefits of accelerating the path toward normalized earnings, there are also other considerations which we will need to work through. Incurring a loss of this magnitude at the bank could have implications for the capital plan and intercompany tax sharing arrangements. Additionally, keep in mind that the duration profile of wholesale funding is generally longer than that of our deposits, impacting the economic benefit analysis of replacing wholesale with deposits. In short, our current position is to keep this funding source on our books. However, we are doing the work across multiple, complex dimension to determine if this should change. The loan portfolio is a similar story. It is still our intention to hold those loans on our books, as that is precisely where we believe the value is maximized. However, as they continue to season and the risks become more visible, we are keeping a watchful eye on the secondary market. The bottom line is they are worth more today to hold on to. But if the secondary market for our portfolio were to firm up significantly, our thinking could change. 
Now turning to capital at the parent. With introducing broker-dealer directly under the parent, we have a more definitive source of capital and some additional flexibility for how we put our capital to use. At quarter end, we had $258 million in parent cash, approximately $150 million above our target of 2 years debt service coverage of $100 million. Over the near term at least, our flexibility here is limited by other considerations, including covenants within our corporate debt, which will be a factor as long as our credit rating is self-investment grade. And obviously, our board and regulators are constituencies that are involved in these matters. 
What I want you to take from all of this is that we have some items to work through. And as we have throughout the course of our capital plan progress, we will update you when appropriate. But I can assure you that our objective is to deploy this capital in a way that maximizes value for our shareholders. 
In summary, and speaking for the entirety of our management team at E*TRADE, we are full steam ahead. We have checked a number of exceptional accomplishments off our to-do list already, and we are eager to keep moving down this track. And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

But I would say that the vast majority of what we are working on is making sure it has external lines of credit appropriate for its size and activity. And at most broker-dealers, those lines of credit typically remain undrawn. As I said, we are also looking at the capital side of things. But I would say that the vast majority of the things that we need to set up are on the liquidity side, not the capital side. So hopefully, this gives you some directional comfort without a number."

And so whether something requires a formal notification or otherwise, we are working with the regulators on our plan for the direction we're taking. So I don't think of it as onerous as otherwise. With the clarity in our bank capital ratios that we've recently achieved, it just makes having some of those discussions take place just more quickly, simply because the parameters are much clearer and because we've continued to work on making sure that our regulatory standing's where it should be. So is it any easier? I'm not sure it's any easier or not easier. I think it's just clearer, the direction we're traveling. And I would say that both the board and the regulators are provided with the clarity that's required and there's good dialogue all the way around.

Under the new program, which is impacted by the -- to your second question, timing, which I'll answer. But under the new program, to oversimplify, we really just choose our balance sheet size. And again, I'll repeat it, it's oversimplifying but it's in that ballpark. So I think our comfort on a buffer is much closer to $50 billion, but it is absolutely a number below $50 billion. So we'll see that -- where that takes us. Now -- meeting in the, call it, the $49 billion range. With respect to timing. The timing is relatively efficient. I mean, if you -- in your -- I think in your research on your initiation coverage of discussing all of the different things that we did from a de-leveraging standpoint, those took a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of individual negotiations with banks. So months and months and months to get in place. Whereas now, it's literally just planning with our third-party sweep service provider about when and how we want balances to be on- and off-balance sheet. So it is incredibly quick and efficient from a timing standpoint as well."

During the quarter, we've posted healthy brokerage records with robust asset accumulation. And the team delivered enhancements to our service offerings, earning some welcomed recognition along the way, with all of this aimed at meeting our commitment to do more for our customers. 
Permit me to begin with our capital plans, since I recognize that it stands as a topic of more than passing interest to many of you. We entered 2015 with core nets welcoming some key approvals from our regulators. These approvals underscored E*TRADE's progress across a number of fronts and ultimately facilitated the company's reduction of corporate debt to our target level. This represented a major milestone for our enterprise as we continue down the path of driving value for our owners. On last quarter's call, we announced the approval to move out our 2 broker-dealers from under the bank. In February, we completed the move of E*TRADE Securities, our introducing broker. Our plan remains on track to move the clearing broker in the second half of the year as we work through the intricacies of that transaction. Matthew will provide more details later. 
In conjunction with the move of our introducing broker, $434 million of capital became available to the parent, which we used to achieve the goal of reducing corporate debt to $1 billion. The most recent transaction brings our cumulative debt reduction to $740 million, which we completed in just 4 months. Looked at from another perspective, in the time since the company first submitted its capital plan in 2012, debt service costs have been reduced by more than 70% to just $15 million. Our 3 credit rating agencies have recognized these achievements with a total of 8 full-notch upgrades over the past 12 months, including 3 in conjunction with the March debt transaction. Each upgrade is encouraging, as we continue to make strides towards our goal of becoming investment-grade. With debt reduction behind us, we turn our focus to how we will next put our capital to work. For the first time in more than 5 years, we have a meaningful direct source of capital generation at the parent in the form of our introducing broker-dealer. And with our organizational realignment, clarity on bank capital ratios and plans to continue requesting quarterly dividends from the bank, we're in an attractive position when it comes to putting more capital to work for our shareholders. With significant opportunities in front of us, we are evaluating how to most appropriately and effectively put capital to use. 
Turning to results. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt charge, we recorded earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter on an income of $85 million. Our results were driven by solid customer engagement, including record-high margin loan balances, lower-than-expected provisions and a benefit of corporate interest expense from our March debt transaction. DARTs for the quarter were just shy of 170,000, up slightly from the prior quarter but down 14% from last year's unusually buoyant Q1. Options represented approximately 23% of total trading activity, in line with trends over the past couple of years. We've seen a pullback in activity in April to date, with DARTs tracking down 6% from March. Margin balances grew by approximately $500 million to end the quarter at a record $8.2 billion. Balance has dipped at the beginning of the year, which is reflected in the quarterly average of $7.9 billion, but steadily rebounded in the latter half of the quarter. Our customers were net buyers of $3.1 billion of securities in the quarter, continuing the multiyear trend of customers putting their money to work. We added 39,000 net new brokerage accounts in Q1, up from 17,000 in the prior quarter but down from 72,000 a year ago, which was a 5-year record. Attrition of 8.8% improved from 9.1% in the prior quarter. Net new brokerage assets of $3.5 billion represented annualized growth of 5.7%. This matched our asset gathering from the prior quarter but was down from a record $4.1 billion 1 year ago. This asset gathering is encouraging, especially when you consider the type of assets customers are bringing to E*TRADE. Becoming known as a trusted place for investors to build their financial health is essential for us, and we have devoted much time and energy to that side of the business. As measured by our success, roughly 1/4 of our net new assets in the quarter were in retirement accounts. We've closed out retirement season strong, ending Q1 with nearly $50 billion of retirement assets, up 11% from last year. A key component of growth here is advice-based solutions, and we are encouraged by how these assets continue to perform. Assets in managed accounts reached $3.2 billion this quarter, up an impressive 24% from a year ago. We also continued our steady drum beat of customer-driven digital enhancements. These included making it easier for our customers to manage taxes related to their investments, creating an even better experience for our most active traders and delivering more functionality to our already leading mobile platform. Our new Tax Center delivers a more intuitive and helpful experience by centralizing tax documents and better positioning resources and education for cost-based reporting, gains and losses and tax-efficient investing. We also made multiple improvements to E*TRADE Pro, our platform for active traders, including tax live training, pattern day trading enhancements and order entry updates, which when taken together, deliver a more customized, intuitive and hassle-free experience for our most active customers. With a record 13% of our total DARTs placed through our mobile application this quarter, we continue to fortify our position as a leader in mobile trading and investing, adding multi-leg options functionality, employee stock plan trading and stock alerts to name a few. Just weeks ago, we announced a meaningful step forward in the wearable space with our app for the Apple Watch. The app will deliver essential market data in an engaging and simple format to help investors and traders monitor portfolios, watchlists and the markets. It also includes hand-off functionality that delivers a seamless transition from watch to phone. Our continuous improvements in leading-edge technology offerings are not going unnoticed, as we've received a number of accolades from well-recognized external sources. Barron's rated us 4 out of 5 stars in their annual Online Broker Survey, scoring high marks in research amenities and customer service and education. StockBrokers.com gave us 3 first place awards: #1 Smartphone App, #1 Client Dashboard and Best New Tool for E*TRADE Browser Trading in their 2015 Online Broker Review. In the same review, we earned 5 best-in-class ratings for Offering of Investments, Investor Education, Research, Mobile Trading and New Investors. We were also recognized by Benzinga in their first annual Fintech Awards for our Browser Trading web app. 
And lastly, I recognize that I run the risk of being ungracious and boring you when I talk about the importance of risk. And my sermon on the subject hasn't changed. We've built out these capabilities, we're running a world-class ERM department and risk management is at the heart of everything we do.

I first want to take a moment to talk about the central role risk management plays here at E*TRADE, and then I'll move into credit risk and an update on the legacy loan portfolio. 
In 2012, we devoted significant focus to bolstering our enterprise risk management as a key component of our capital plan. At the time, we had prudent and strong financial risk management but significant work remained to establish a fulsome operational risk framework. We looked to a number of outside experts for input and best practices, and collectively determined that there was a need for much clearer and more robust governance, escalation and root cause analysis. We have spent the past several years putting these systems and processes in place, in conjunction with building out robust and highly credible stress testing capabilities as well as making significant enhancements in third-party oversight, model risk management, ongoing risk assessment and monitoring. Our hard work has resulted in an enterprise risk management function that is consistent with that of much larger institutions. In practice, our ERM framework consists of 3 lines of defense. The first line, the various lines of business within the company. The second line, the risk organization, along with our colleagues in compliance and legal. And the third line, the internal audit group. We have built a coverage model where each area of the company's business has a dedicated partner in the risk, legal and compliance areas. We have also worked to improve and develop the company's risk culture, having conducted workshops throughout the entire organization to ingrain risk management into the very fabric of our organization and to make sure each colleague knows they are risk owners within their respective areas. We have built a strong risk management culture, tying risk to performance measures down to the individual level. In short, risk management is part of everything we do at E*TRADE. As you've heard Matt and Paul say before, the buildout is key but stainability is critical. The latter is how I would characterize the phase we are in today, demonstrating the sustainability and effectiveness of the program we've worked so hard to install. And while I feel good about how far we've come, we will, of course, continue to fine-tune our practices to evolve both with the operating and regulatory landscapes. 
Now on to credit risk management, an important yet diminishing component of my role. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $6.1 billion, down $317 million from the prior quarter. This was essentially all paydowns, as charge-offs were flat to the prior quarter at just $7 million. We expect quarterly runoff of the portfolio to remain in the 4% to 5% range throughout 2015. Provision for loan losses was $5 million in the first quarter, down from $10 million in the prior period. Matt will give you more color around our provision expectations, but clearly this quarter was better than we anticipated. As we navigate through the upcoming HELOC conversions throughout the remainder of this year and next, this will be the most prominent variable in determining our provision expense. Thus far, we have a very small sample of loans that have converted. They're generally our higher-credit quality loans. And while they have largely performed more favorably than expected, it is very early days. As we approach a more meaningful amount of conversions, we are working with our servicers on proactive borrower outreach and loss mitigation, where possible. Meanwhile, our allowance ended the quarter relatively unchanged at $402 million. The reserves shifted slightly, with an increase in the one- to four-family book and a decrease in home equity. The one- to four- reserves increased $4 million to $31 million. Home equity reserves declined $7 million to end the quarter at $360 million. The decline related to better-than-expected performance following a planned servicer transfer for which we've previously booked reserves. The transfer took place in February and is also the driving force behind the increase in early-stage delinquency this quarter. We also had a planned servicer transfer in the one- to four- portfolio, which drove an associated increase in early-stage delinquencies. However, we did not recognize reserves for this transfer as one- to four- loans typically self-correct, whereas, the curing for home equity is much lower. 
So in summary, credit risk is becoming a smaller issue with each passing quarter, and we are proud of the progress we have made to become an institution known internally and externally as one that is serious about, and committed to, risk management. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

After a multiyear effort, our corporate debt is now where it belongs. And on top of that, we posted strong operating results driven by a number of factors. We reported first quarter net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share, excluding a $73 million pretax charge related to our corporate debt transaction. And excluding a similar charge of $59 million in the prior quarter, this compares to net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share and net income of $97 million or a $0.33 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $456 million were down from $461 million in the prior quarter and $475 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue included net interest income of $271 million, down $8 million from the prior quarter, as net interest spread contracted 7 basis points and our average assets increased approximately $200 million. Although spread contracted sequentially, at 262 basis points, it was above our expectations, as we once again benefited from elevated margin loan balances and strong securities lending results. After experiencing declines in both of these at the beginning of Q1, both trended upward in the second 2 months of the quarter. We also saw some spread compression as a result of a slight increase in prepayments and lower reinvestment rates on the securities portfolio. 
In the second quarter to-date, rates continued to be challenging. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low to mid-250s in the second quarter. Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $46.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter. We completed the conversion of our sweep deposits to a new platform during the quarter and began to put it to work in March, moving $1.25 billion of customer deposits held by third-party banks back on our balance sheet. With this new platform, we can much more efficiently move deposits on and off balance sheet, giving us a powerful tool for managing balance sheet size. We have converted approximately $15 billion of our $42 billion in brokerage customer cash to the new platform. Of that $15 billion that is converted, a little under $4 billion is held by third-party banks and a little over $11 billion is on our balance sheet. 
One component of our customer cash is money funds, where approximately $8 billion resides, largely as a result of our de-leveraging efforts. We would ultimately like to move that portion into the sweep program, as it has benefits for both us and the customer. It's a more lengthy process involving system changes and customer consent, but we're working on it and we'll keep you posted. 
With the rollout of a new sweep platform, we've determined that classifying the revenue generated from off-balance sheet deposits in fees and service charges as opposed to net interest income is more consistent with how this type of revenue is generally presented within the industry. Accordingly, Q1 has about $5 million of reclassified revenue in this line, which is up from $4 million in the prior quarter and $3 million in the year-ago quarter. For comparability purposes, prior periods have also been reclassified. Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the first quarter were $176 million, flat with the prior quarter and down 6% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.94 increased $0.10 from the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year-ago period. The quarterly increase was driven by higher stock plan trading, while the year-over-year increase was driven by a more favorable options and customer mix. Fees and service charges revenues of $52 million included $23 million of payment for order flow, flat with the prior quarter. Net gains on loans and securities were $9 million this quarter, up from $6 million the prior quarter and in line with our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We stated last quarter that if rates remain low, we would likely be at the high end of the range. And that is exactly what you saw this quarter. 
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $300 million, up $6 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by compen-ben, which reflected a seasonal increase. Our operating expenses for Q1 were well in line with our expectations, and we are still planning for full year 2015 expenses to increase in the low to mid single digits. 
As Mike discussed, provision for the quarter was $5 million. Given what we have experienced and the healthy reserves we maintain, we are adjusting our expected provision range for this year to 0 to $20 million per quarter, effectively expanding and lowering our prior range of $10 million to $20 million. Looking ahead to 2016, we are also adjusting our expectations, now forecasting provisions to land at or above the top end of our current range. This is slightly improved from our prior range of $20 million to $30 million per quarter. However, I must caution that visibility into performance this far out is certainly limited, and we will adjust our expectations as we gain clarity. 
As Mike mentioned, HELOC conversions will be the most important variable here. There is still only a small population of loans that have actually converted. We will have more significant data throughout the year, as there are approximately $500 million of loans that will convert over the course of the next 3 quarters. We will then have $900 million converting next year, after which, this event will largely be behind us. We will certainly keep you apprised of any trends that we see in the performance of these loans. 
Turning now to the capital plans. To reemphasize what Paul said earlier, we've accomplished a lot in 2015 already. To recap the first quarter. We utilized $432 million of corporate cash to pay down $340 million of debt and refinanced another $460 million at 4.625%, the lowest coupon in the company's history, while extending our maturity profile by more than 2 years, with our nearest maturity now in 2022. Debt reduction was an central goal of the capital plan when we first laid it out in June of 2012. As we worked on our plans for a number of reasons, it became clear that $1 billion was the right amount. Now that we are sitting at $1 billion, and with no more space on my shelf for debt deal toys. It feels good to be done talking about debt reduction and focusing on what is next. At the moment, we are working to ensure a smooth transition of our clearing broker from under the bank. Since this entity has been under the bank, it has benefited from a shared surplus of capital and liquidity. As we prepare to move it out, we have to establish and formalize new lines of liquidity, even though these may ultimately remain undrawn. In conjunction with this, we are also evaluating whether it makes sense to move additional capital into that entity. So the bottom line is that until we determine how E*TRADE Clearing will be situated from a capital liquidity standpoint, it is prudent to wait on further capital actions. As a reminder, we intend to move the entity in the second half of this year. With the approval to manage the bank at a 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, we ended the quarter nicely above that threshold at 9.8%. The implementation of Basel III benefited that ratio by approximately 90 basis points. Keep in mind that this still includes E*TRADE Clearing and its existing capital and assets. Excluding it would've decreased our ratio by approximately 10 basis points. So on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $240 million of capital in excess of our regulatory threshold at the bank. As a reminder, we plan to request quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent, equal to its prior-quarter net income. In Q1, net income for the bank was $92 million. 
Also during Q1, E*TRADE Securities generated approximately $50 million in excess capital, which we plan to move to the parent next week. So to echo Paul, we are in a position of strength when it comes to the capital available to us, and we are very deliberately working through how to most appropriately put it to use. I don't have specifics for you today, but I would like to offer my thoughts on a few of the options. 
To start, under our new structure, we will have capital available for use at both the bank and the parent. At the bank, we will have the ability to utilize capital in excess of our 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Our most prominent options include balance sheet growth in the acceleration of legacy risk reduction, meaning potentially eliminating wholesale funding obligations ahead of schedule and selling the remainder of the loan portfolio. While neither of these actions are in our plans today, we are constantly assessing the path forward as it relates to legacy risks. 
At the parent, we have the ability to utilize capital from the broker, plus the planned quarterly dividend request equivalent to the bank's net income. Obvious uses include share buybacks, dividends and investing in the business where we see opportunity for healthy returns. 
For a little more detail on these items. Balance sheet growth is certainly an option, especially in a more attractive rate environment than the one we find ourselves in today. We ended the quarter with $46.8 billion of assets, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter, which is largely the result of the implementation of our new sweep deposit program. So we still have some room to utilize capital by growing the balance sheet, while staying below $50 billion, which remains our intention. On wholesale funding, we ended the quarter at $4.6 billion, with $365 million scheduled to expire primarily in the second half of this year. The cost to eliminate these borrowings would be approximately $415 million pretax, which is essentially the acceleration of future costs, so relatively neutral from an economic standpoint. 
While there are certain benefits of accelerating the path toward normalized earnings, there are also other considerations which we will need to work through. Incurring a loss of this magnitude at the bank could have implications for the capital plan and intercompany tax sharing arrangements. Additionally, keep in mind that the duration profile of wholesale funding is generally longer than that of our deposits, impacting the economic benefit analysis of replacing wholesale with deposits. In short, our current position is to keep this funding source on our books. However, we are doing the work across multiple, complex dimension to determine if this should change. The loan portfolio is a similar story. It is still our intention to hold those loans on our books, as that is precisely where we believe the value is maximized. However, as they continue to season and the risks become more visible, we are keeping a watchful eye on the secondary market. The bottom line is they are worth more today to hold on to. But if the secondary market for our portfolio were to firm up significantly, our thinking could change. 
Now turning to capital at the parent. With the introducing broker-dealer directly under the parent, we have a more definitive source of capital and some additional flexibility for how we put our capital to use. At quarter end, we had $258 million in parent cash, approximately $150 million above our target of 2 years debt service coverage of $100 million. Over the near term at least, our flexibility here is limited by other considerations, including covenants within our corporate debt, which will be a factor as long as our credit rating is self-investment grade. And obviously, our board and regulators are constituencies that are involved in these matters. 
What I want you to take from all of this is that we have some items to work through. And as we have throughout the course of our capital plan progress, we will update you when appropriate. But I can assure you that our objective is to deploy this capital in a way that maximizes value for our shareholders. 
In summary, and speaking for the entirety of our management team at E*TRADE, we are full steam ahead. We have checked a number of exceptional accomplishments off our to-do list already, and we are eager to keep moving down this track. And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

With the clarity in our bank capital ratios that we've recently achieved, it just makes having some of those discussions take place just more quickly, simply because the parameters are much clearer and because we've continued to work on making sure that our regulatory standing's where it should be. So is it any easier? I'm not sure it's any easier or not easier. I think it's just clearer, the direction we're traveling.

And again, I'll repeat it, it's oversimplifying but it's in that ballpark. So I think our comfort on a buffer is much closer to $50 billion, but it is absolutely a number below $50 billion. So we'll see that -- where that takes us. Now -- meaning in the, call it, the $49 billion range. With respect to timing. The timing is relatively efficient. I mean, if you -- in your -- I think in your research on your initiation coverage of discussing all of the different things that we did from a de-leveraging standpoint, those took a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of individual negotiations with banks.

During the quarter, we've posted healthy brokerage records with robust asset accumulation. And the team delivered enhancements to our service offerings, earning some welcomed recognition along the way, with all of this aimed at meeting our commitment to do more for our customers. 
Permit me to begin with our capital plans, since I recognize that it stands as a topic of more than passing interest to many of you. We entered 2015 with core nets welcoming some key approvals from our regulators. These approvals underscored E*TRADE's progress across a number of fronts and ultimately facilitated the company's reduction of corporate debt to our target level. This represented a major milestone for our enterprise as we continue down the path of driving value for our owners. On last quarter's call, we announced the approval to move out our 2 broker-dealers from under the bank. In February, we completed the move of E*TRADE Securities, our introducing broker. Our plan remains on track to move the clearing broker in the second half of the year as we work through the intricacies of that transaction. Matthew will provide more details later. 
In conjunction with the move of our introducing broker, $434 million of capital became available to the parent, which we used to achieve the goal of reducing corporate debt to $1 billion. The most recent transaction brings our cumulative debt reduction to $740 million, which we completed in just 4 months. Looked at from another perspective, in the time since the company first submitted its capital plan in 2012, debt service costs have been reduced by more than 70% to just $15 million. Our 3 credit rating agencies have recognized these achievements with a total of 8 full-notch upgrades over the past 12 months, including 3 in conjunction with the March debt transaction. Each upgrade is encouraging, as we continue to make strides towards our goal of becoming investment-grade. With debt reduction behind us, we turn our focus to how we will next put our capital to work. For the first time in more than 5 years, we have a meaningful direct source of capital generation at the parent in the form of our introducing broker-dealer. And with our organizational realignment, clarity on bank capital ratios and plans to continue requesting quarterly dividends from the bank, we're in an attractive position when it comes to putting more capital to work for our shareholders. With significant opportunities in front of us, we are evaluating how to most appropriately and effectively put capital to use. 
Turning to results. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt charge, we recorded earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter on an income of $85 million. Our results were driven by solid customer engagement, including record-high margin loan balances, lower-than-expected provisions and a benefit of corporate interest expense from our March debt transaction. DARTs for the quarter were just shy of 170,000, up slightly from the prior quarter but down 14% from last year's unusually buoyant Q1. Options represented approximately 23% of total trading activity, in line with trends over the past couple of years. We've seen a pullback in activity in April to date, with DARTs tracking down 6% from March. Margin balances grew by approximately $500 million to end the quarter at a record $8.2 billion. Balance has dipped at the beginning of the year, which is reflected in the quarterly average of $7.9 billion, but steadily rebounded in the latter half of the quarter. Our customers were net buyers of $3.1 billion of securities in the quarter, continuing the multiyear trend of customers putting their money to work. We added 39,000 net new brokerage accounts in Q1, up from 17,000 in the prior quarter but down from 72,000 a year ago, which was a 5-year record. Attrition of 8.8% improved from 9.1% in the prior quarter. Net new brokerage assets of $3.5 billion represented annualized growth of 5.7%. This matched our asset gathering from the prior quarter but was down from a record $4.1 billion 1 year ago. This asset gathering is encouraging, especially when you consider the type of assets customers are bringing to E*TRADE. Becoming known as a trusted place for investors to build their financial health is essential for us, and we have devoted much time and energy to that side of the business. As measured by our success, roughly 1/4 of our net new assets in the quarter were in retirement accounts. We've closed out retirement season strong, ending Q1 with nearly $50 billion of retirement assets, up 11% from last year. A key component of growth here is advice-based solutions, and we are encouraged by how these assets continue to perform. Assets in managed accounts reached $3.2 billion this quarter, up an impressive 24% from a year ago. We also continued our steady drum beat of customer-driven digital enhancements. These included making it easier for our customers to manage taxes related to their investments, creating an even better experience for our most active traders and delivering more functionality to our already leading mobile platform. Our new Tax Center delivers a more intuitive and helpful experience by centralizing tax documents and better positioning resources and education for cost-based reporting, gains and losses and tax-efficient investing. We also made multiple improvements to E*TRADE Pro, our platform for active traders, including tax live training, pattern day trading enhancements and order entry updates, which when taken together, deliver a more customized, intuitive and hassle-free experience for our most active customers. With a record 13% of our total DARTs placed through our mobile application this quarter, we continue to fortify our position as a leader in mobile trading and investing, adding multi-leg options functionality, employee stock plan trading and stock alerts to name a few. Just weeks ago, we announced a meaningful step forward in the wearable space with our app for the Apple Watch. The app will deliver essential market data in an engaging and simple format to help investors and traders monitor portfolios, watchlists and the markets. It also includes hand-off functionality that delivers a seamless transition from watch to phone. Our continuous improvements in leading-edge technology offerings are not going unnoticed, as we've received a number of accolades from well-recognized external sources. Barron's rated us 4 out of 5 stars in their annual Online Broker Survey, scoring high marks in research amenities and customer service and education. StockBrokers.com gave us 3 first place awards: #1 Smartphone App, #1 Client Dashboard and Best New Tool for E*TRADE Browser Trading in their 2015 Online Broker Review. In the same review, we earned 5 best-in-class ratings for Offering of Investments, Investor Education, Research, Mobile Trading and New Investors. We were also recognized by Benzinga in their first annual Fintech Awards for our Browser Trading web app. 
And lastly, I recognize that I run the risk of being ungracious and boring you when I talk about the importance of risk. And my sermon on the subject hasn't changed. We've built out these capabilities, we're running a world-class ERM department and risk management is at the heart of everything we do. To that end, I thought it was an opportune time to have our distinguished Chief Risk Officer, Michael Pizzi, join the call before handing things off to our pellucid CFO, Matthew Audette. Over to you, Mr. Pizzi."

I first want to take a moment to talk about the central role risk management plays here at E*TRADE, and then I'll move into credit risk and an update on the legacy loan portfolio. 
In 2012, we devoted significant focus to bolstering our enterprise risk management as a key component of our capital plan. At the time, we had prudent and strong financial risk management but significant work remained to establish a fulsome operational risk framework. We looked to a number of outside experts for input and best practices, and collectively determined that there was a need for much clearer and more robust governance, escalation and root cause analysis. We have spent the past several years putting these systems and processes in place, in conjunction with building out robust and highly credible stress testing capabilities as well as making significant enhancements in third-party oversight, model risk management, ongoing risk assessment and monitoring. Our hard work has resulted in an enterprise risk management function that is consistent with that of much larger institutions. In practice, our ERM framework consists of 3 lines of defense. The first line, the various lines of business within the company. The second line, the risk organization, along with our colleagues in compliance and legal. And the third line, the internal audit group. We have built a coverage model where each area of the company's business has a dedicated partner in the risk, legal and compliance areas. We have also worked to improve and develop the company's risk culture, having conducted workshops throughout the entire organization to ingrain risk management into the very fabric of our organization and to make sure each colleague knows they are risk owners within their respective areas. We have built a strong risk management culture, tying risk to performance measures down to the individual level. In short, risk management is part of everything we do at E*TRADE. As you've heard Matt and Paul say before, the buildout is key but stainability is critical. The latter is how I would characterize the phase we are in today, demonstrating the sustainability and effectiveness of the program we've worked so hard to install. And while I feel good about how far we've come, we will, of course, continue to fine-tune our practices to evolve both with the operating and regulatory landscapes. 
Now on to credit risk management, an important yet diminishing component of my role. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $6.1 billion, down $317 million from the prior quarter. This was essentially all paydowns, as charge-offs were flat to the prior quarter at just $7 million. We expect quarterly runoff of the portfolio to remain in the 4% to 5% range throughout 2015. Provision for loan losses was $5 million in the first quarter, down from $10 million in the prior period. Matt will give you more color around our provision expectations, but clearly this quarter was better than we anticipated. As we navigate through the upcoming HELOC conversions throughout the remainder of this year and next, this will be the most prominent variable in determining our provision expense. Thus far, we have a very small sample of loans that have converted. They're generally our higher-credit quality loans. And while they have largely performed more favorably than expected, it is very early days. As we approach a more meaningful amount of conversions, we are working with our servicers on proactive borrower outreach and loss mitigation, where possible. Meanwhile, our allowance ended the quarter relatively unchanged at $402 million. The reserves shifted slightly, with an increase in the one- to four-family book and a decrease in home equity. The one- to four- reserves increased $4 million to $31 million. Home equity reserves declined $7 million to end the quarter at $360 million. The decline related to better-than-expected performance following a planned servicer transfer for which we've previously booked reserves. The transfer took place in February and is also the driving force behind the increase in early-stage delinquency this quarter. We also had a planned servicer transfer in the one- to four- portfolio, which drove an associated increase in early-stage delinquencies. However, we did not recognize reserves for this transfer as one- to four- loans typically self-correct, whereas, the curing for home equity is much lower. 
So in summary, credit risk is becoming a smaller issue with each passing quarter, and we are proud of the progress we have made to become an institution known internally and externally as one that is serious about, and committed to, risk management. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

After a multiyear effort, our corporate debt is now where it belongs. And on top of that, we posted strong operating results driven by a number of factors. We reported first quarter net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share, excluding a $73 million pretax charge related to our corporate debt transaction. And excluding a similar charge of $59 million in the prior quarter, this compares to net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share and net income of $97 million or a $0.33 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $456 million were down from $461 million in the prior quarter and $475 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue included net interest income of $271 million, down $8 million from the prior quarter, as net interest spread contracted 7 basis points and our average assets increased approximately $200 million. Although spread contracted sequentially, at 262 basis points, it was above our expectations, as we once again benefited from elevated margin loan balances and strong securities lending results. After experiencing declines in both of these at the beginning of Q1, both trended upward in the second 2 months of the quarter. We also saw some spread compression as a result of a slight increase in prepayments and lower reinvestment rates on the securities portfolio. 
In the second quarter to-date, rates continued to be challenging. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low to mid-250s in the second quarter. Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $46.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter. We completed the conversion of our sweep deposits to a new platform during the quarter and began to put it to work in March, moving $1.25 billion of customer deposits held by third-party banks back on our balance sheet. With this new platform, we can much more efficiently move deposits on and off balance sheet, giving us a powerful tool for managing balance sheet size. We have converted approximately $15 billion of our $42 billion in brokerage customer cash to the new platform. Of that $15 billion that is converted, a little under $4 billion is held by third-party banks and a little over $11 billion is on our balance sheet. 
One component of our customer cash is money funds, where approximately $8 billion resides, largely as a result of our de-leveraging efforts. We would ultimately like to move that portion into the sweep program, as it has benefits for both us and the customer. It's a more lengthy process involving system changes and customer consent, but we're working on it and we'll keep you posted. 
With the rollout of a new sweep platform, we've determined that classifying the revenue generated from off-balance sheet deposits in fees and service charges as opposed to net interest income is more consistent with how this type of revenue is generally presented within the industry. Accordingly, Q1 has about $5 million of reclassified revenue in this line, which is up from $4 million in the prior quarter and $3 million in the year-ago quarter. For comparability purposes, prior periods have also been reclassified. Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the first quarter were $176 million, flat with the prior quarter and down 6% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.94 increased $0.10 from the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year-ago period. The quarterly increase was driven by higher stock plan trading, while the year-over-year increase was driven by a more favorable options and customer mix. Fees and service charges revenues of $52 million included $23 million of payment for order flow, flat with the prior quarter. Net gains on loans and securities were $9 million this quarter, up from $6 million the prior quarter and in line with our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We stated last quarter that if rates remain low, we would likely be at the high end of the range. And that is exactly what you saw this quarter. 
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $300 million, up $6 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by compen-ben, which reflected a seasonal increase. Our operating expenses for Q1 were well in line with our expectations, and we are still planning for full year 2015 expenses to increase in the low to mid- single digits. 
As Mike discussed, provision for the quarter was $5 million. Given what we have experienced and the healthy reserves we maintain, we are adjusting our expected provision range for this year to 0 to $20 million per quarter, effectively expanding and lowering our prior range of $10 million to $20 million. Looking ahead to 2016, we are also adjusting our expectations, now forecasting provisions to land at or above the top end of our current range. This is slightly improved from our prior range of $20 million to $30 million per quarter. However, I must caution that visibility into performance this far out is certainly limited, and we will adjust our expectations as we gain clarity. 
As Mike mentioned, HELOC conversions will be the most important variable here. There is still only a small population of loans that have actually converted. We will have more significant data throughout the year, as there are approximately $500 million of loans that will convert over the course of the next 3 quarters. We will then have $900 million converting next year, after which, this event will largely be behind us. We will certainly keep you apprised of any trends that we see in the performance of these loans. 
Turning now to the capital plans. To reemphasize what Paul said earlier, we've accomplished a lot in 2015 already. To recap the first quarter. We utilized $432 million of corporate cash to pay down $340 million of debt and refinanced another $460 million at 4.625%, the lowest coupon in the company's history, while extending our maturity profile by more than 2 years, with our nearest maturity now in 2022. Debt reduction was an central goal of the capital plan when we first laid it out in June of 2012. As we worked on our plans for a number of reasons, it became clear that $1 billion was the right amount. Now that we are sitting at $1 billion, and with no more space on my shelf for debt deal toys. It feels good to be done talking about debt reduction and focusing on what is next. At the moment, we are working to ensure a smooth transition of our clearing broker from under the bank. Since this entity has been under the bank, it has benefited from a shared surplus of capital and liquidity. As we prepare to move it out, we have to establish and formalize new lines of liquidity, even though these may ultimately remain undrawn. In conjunction with this, we are also evaluating whether it makes sense to move additional capital into that entity. So the bottom line is that until we determine how E*TRADE Clearing will be situated from a capital liquidity standpoint, it is prudent to wait on further capital actions. As a reminder, we intend to move the entity in the second half of this year. With the approval to manage the bank at a 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, we ended the quarter nicely above that threshold at 9.8%. The implementation of Basel III benefited that ratio by approximately 90 basis points. Keep in mind that this still includes E*TRADE Clearing and its existing capital and assets. Excluding it would've decreased our ratio by approximately 10 basis points. So on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $240 million of capital in excess of our regulatory threshold at the bank. As a reminder, we plan to request quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent, equal to its prior-quarter net income. In Q1, net income for the bank was $92 million. 
Also during Q1, E*TRADE Securities generated approximately $50 million in excess capital, which we plan to move to the parent next week. So to echo Paul, we are in a position of strength when it comes to the capital available to us, and we are very deliberately working through how to most appropriately put it to use. I don't have specifics for you today, but I would like to offer my thoughts on a few of the options. 
To start, under our new structure, we will have capital available for use at both the bank and the parent. At the bank, we will have the ability to utilize capital in excess of our 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Our most prominent options include balance sheet growth in the acceleration of legacy risk reduction, meaning potentially eliminating wholesale funding obligations ahead of schedule and selling the remainder of the loan portfolio. While neither of these actions are in our plans today, we are constantly assessing the path forward as it relates to legacy risks. 
At the parent, we have the ability to utilize capital from the broker, plus the planned quarterly dividend request equivalent to the bank's net income. Obvious uses include share buybacks, dividends and investing in the business where we see opportunity for healthy returns. 
For a little more detail on these items. Balance sheet growth is certainly an option, especially in a more attractive rate environment than the one we find ourselves in today. We ended the quarter with $46.8 billion of assets, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter, which is largely the result of the implementation of our new sweep deposit program. So we still have some room to utilize capital by growing the balance sheet, while staying below $50 billion, which remains our intention. On wholesale funding, we ended the quarter at $4.6 billion, with $365 million scheduled to expire primarily in the second half of this year. The cost to eliminate these borrowings would be approximately $415 million pretax, which is essentially the acceleration of future costs, so relatively neutral from an economic standpoint. 
While there are certain benefits of accelerating the path toward normalized earnings, there are also other considerations which we will need to work through. Incurring a loss of this magnitude at the bank could have implications for the capital plan and intercompany tax sharing arrangements. Additionally, keep in mind that the duration profile of wholesale funding is generally longer than that of our deposits, impacting the economic benefit analysis of replacing wholesale with deposits. In short, our current position is to keep this funding source on our books. However, we are doing the work across multiple, complex dimension to determine if this should change. The loan portfolio is a similar story. It is still our intention to hold those loans on our books, as that is precisely where we believe the value is maximized. However, as they continue to season and the risks become more visible, we are keeping a watchful eye on the secondary market. The bottom line is they are worth more today to hold on to. But if the secondary market for our portfolio were to firm up significantly, our thinking could change. 
Now turning to capital at the parent. With the introducing broker-dealer directly under the parent, we have a more definitive source of capital and some additional flexibility for how we put our capital to use. At quarter end, we had $258 million in parent cash, approximately $150 million above our target of 2 years debt service coverage of $100 million. Over the near term at least, our flexibility here is limited by other considerations, including covenants within our corporate debt, which will be a factor as long as our credit rating is self-investment grade. And obviously, our board and regulators are constituencies that are involved in these matters. 
What I want you to take from all of this is that we have some items to work through. And as we have throughout the course of our capital plan progress, we will update you when appropriate. But I can assure you that our objective is to deploy this capital in a way that maximizes value for our shareholders. 
In summary, and speaking for the entirety of our management team at E*TRADE, we are full steam ahead. We have checked a number of exceptional accomplishments off our to-do list already, and we are eager to keep moving down this track. And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

And so whether something requires a formal notification or otherwise, we are working with the regulators on our plan for the direction we're taking. So I don't think of it as onerous as otherwise. With the clarity in our bank capital ratios that we've recently achieved, it just makes having some of those discussions take place just more quickly, simply because the parameters are much clearer and because we've continued to work on making sure that our regulatory standing's where it should be. So is it any easier? I'm not sure it's any easier or not easier. I think it's just clearer, the direction we're traveling.

Each quarter that goes by, when you look at the distribution of our earnings, where trading commissions fall out, it's not an enormous driver of our bottom line, from the amount we make on deposits, from the amount we make on margins and stock loans to the growing amount of fees and service charges from our managed products and programs. So I think that the growth and the diversification of our business model is really providing many opportunities, including not having to start projects when trading's up and stop them when it's down.

While the retail trading environment was dampened by seasonality, the pace of our progress remains solid. Core activities, we continue to demonstrate the resilience of E*TRADE's model growing accounts and assets and hitting several notable milestones. We delivered on our commitment to do more for our customers, rolling out a number of new or enhanced products and services, including an upgrade in retirement center and our groundbreaking app for the Apple Watch. We also further sharpened our focus deciding to sunset of our non-core global trading platform. 
On the capital front, our risk profile extended its trend of steady improvement, while we continue to evolve shareholders on the capital plan. Now beginning well the second annual the best process, distributing more than $140 million with the parent and competitive steps with the broker from under the bank. We also transitioned our finance leadership, welcoming the new CFO within our executive ranks. Information, a lot going on, a lot done, second half of the year in a position to real strength focused on continuing to deliver for our customers and our owners. 
Elaborating a bit on the capital story, we completed a number of important components of our plan, most notably steps to E*TRADE Clearing. We completed the move on July 1, hitting the mark on our committed to do so in the latter half of 2015. More than a matter of stellar the team devoted a significant time and energy to ensuring the transition was a smooth one, including the terminating funding and capitalization and completing the work to secure additional external lines of liquidity, bringing the total to approximately $900 million and contributing $150 million in capital for the bank. We are pleased to have completed this. We are now directing our focus towards what's next. 
We also completed the second annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. We're not surprised. We obviously ended our bank performance well under all stress scenarios remaining above regulatory well-capitalized minimums by a healthy margin. With Bank Tier 1 leverage remaining above 10% even when stress most stringently and our risk-weighted measures remaining at more than 4x of regulatory minimums. It's worth mentioning that the stress test utilized a reporting data as of the third quarter of last year and our legacy risk have diminished significantly since then, including a reduction in total loans of more than 15%. 
Overall, we are pleased with the results and feel good about the feedback we received from our regulators regarding our capabilities and methodology. Today, we are in a very respectable position when it comes to future capital usage. Having knocked out some big-ticket items in the form of material reduction in debt and extracting 1 strap value from the bank to the brokerage moves, we march forward in determining our next capital initiatives.  Mr. Pizzi will provide you with more details on our current thinking in just a few moments. 
Turning to our financials. I feel it's appropriate time to formally introduce our new CFO, Michael Pizzi. Mike took the CFO at the time in mid-June after having the name with the company for more than a decade, latterly servicing as our Chief Risk Officer and before that serving a number of years as our treasurer. Mike is a strong prudent leader. His expertise, regulatory experience and considerable intellectual firepower make him an ideal fit. As all you get know him, I'm sure my opinion and value the dialogue with him. I'm also certain that under Mike's leadership, we will resolutely prosecute our capital plan, maintaining strong oversight of our finance function and continue to execute other important financial initiatives. 
As for the quarter's results, we recorded earnings of $72 million or $0.25 per share. This excludes $220 million of tax benefit related to the favorable outcome of an IRSI. The quarter also included from guidance within our compensation, FDIC and other expense lines. The first $6 million in compensation related to the of our former CFO. The second $9 million of other expenses related to a contract amendment with our former subsidiary G1X. 
In the nutshell, we renegotiated the order routing agreement with our partner G1X to us with greater flexibility and optionality as part of commitment to deliver the best possible execution for our customers. 
And last, our FDIC expense dropped sequentially by $7 million. This expense reflects the calculation of both quantitative and qualitative assessments of risk, including the composition of the balance sheet and overlaying regulatory judgment. We've indicated for some time that we expected our FDIC rate to ultimately reduce significantly, and that is exactly what happened in Q2. This is a strong testament to our progress derisking improving our regulatory standing. Going forward, we expect the FDIC rate will be approximately 8 bps on total asset as opposed to the previous run rates of around 20 bps. 
Before we go into metrics, I want to highlight business decision made on the administration of Mr. Pizzi during the quarter, which is to discontinue our non-core global trade platform. We found that it did not have the scale to justify the associated expense, capital or energy. The accounts we did have, while reasonable an absolute quantum worked actively used, particularly as customers can access much of the same international exposure for our core U.S. trading platform. 
Importantly, we do not expect the significant outflow of assets related to these accounts as most of the customers are simply consolidating our investments into other E*TRADE brokerage accounts. We began the closure process in May and expect to complete in an early Q3. In total we expect to close approximately 24,000 accounts, of which 3,300 were recognized in Q2 with a vast majority expected in July. This decision allows us to focus these resources on core products and services for our customer base. Our brokerage metrics reflects some seasonality as the quarter opens taxes in April and closes as we head into lows of summer trading. 
DARTs of 149,000 were down 12% sequentially with options representing a steady 23% of total activity. As volatility rose sharply in the first half of July in it's market turmoil in China and melodrama in Greece, customer trading volumes have increased slightly up 6% from June. 
Mobile continue to represent an increasingly important component of our traits, reaching a record 14% this quarter compared to 11% a year ago, and underscoring the increasing churn mobile option, roughly 1/3 of our unique logins [indiscernible] which are in mobile apps. We have also seen positive traction with our recent Apple Watch app with already 5,000 downloads since it was launched in April. 
Margin balances remain healthy during the quarter even as the equity markets cool slightly. We ended the quarter at $8.1 billion just shy of the prior quarter's record high. We reported net new brokerage accounts of 19,000 during the quarter with the metric reduced by 2 items. First, approximately 3,300 accounts related to global trading as I just mentioned. And second, 3,500 accounts due to shipment, an outsize number compared to normal levels as it related to a more comprehensive process concluded in May. 
Excluding these 2 items, net new brokerage accounts would have been approximately 25,000 with a normalized attrition rate of 8.7% consistent with the prior quarter. Net new brokerage assets were $900 million during the quarter, down considerably from Q1 largely a result of seasonality during tax season. 
We've been diligent in our efforts to expand awareness of our retirement product and services. As a testament to team and work, these assets grown by more than 50% in just 3 years and have represented about 1/3 of total net new brokerage assets over the past 2 years. 
Furthermore, we continue to see stability in our managed assets, which ended the quarter at $3.2 billion. As part of our effort to continue growing this element of our customer relationships, we revamped the retirement experience on E*TRADE.com, creating a cleaner, simple design with inviting content that helps customers engage and take charge, which offers interactive widgets customize to each account, demonstrating the benefits of disciplined saving and investing. An account widget that helps to customers with the returning account that is right for them and personalized checklist and do list for each stage of an investor's retirement planning. 
In addition to the new retirement expense, other noteworthy platform enhancements are as follows: on our active trading platform E*TRADE Pro, we roll out a robust experience, new plug-and-play layouts to support the unique needs of traders as improvements to several other customization features. We also simplest watchlist management and churning options and gathered the ability to trade tax logs across equity and options positions. 
On E*TRADE.com, we made a number of improvements to our stock-planned participation experience and enhanced our bill pay functionality. We will continue to see enhancements and innovations as we start better serve our customers in the fashion that find most relevant to support taking carriage of their financial help, that encourage you to stay tuned. One last item before I turn the call over. I'd like to take a brief moment to express my gratitude to service our former CFO. Matt Audette was a faithful student of E*TRADE and its finances over 16 years, helping to guide the company to some of our most challenging times. We wish him the best in the future endeavors in Southern California. And I let my pleasure to turn the call to our recognized CFO, Mike Pizzi."

It's a pleasure to be speaking with you on my first call as CFO. I'll get right into it. We accomplished a lot during the second quarter and we posted good results. Excluding the $220 million tax benefit, we recorded earnings of $72 milli",1687,"Thank you, Paul. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you on my first call as CFO. I'll get right into it. We accomplished a lot during the second quarter and we posted good results. Excluding the $220 million tax benefit, we recorded earnings of $72 million or $0.25 per share for the quarter compared to $85 million or 29% $0.29 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $73 million pretax charge related to our landmark corporate debt transaction. It also compares to $69 million or $0.24 per share in the year-ago quarter. To quickly elaborate on the tax benefit, it resulted from an IRS audit of higher year's tax returns. So essentially years ago, we took a conservative position on the deductibility of certain tax losses and have been working with IRS for some time to resolve this position. 
This tax benefit also resulted in an increase in our deferred tax asset, which ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, further increasing the shield against is the payment of future tax dollars. 
Turning back to the top. Total net revenues were $445 million in the quarter compared to $456 million in the prior quarter and $438 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest income of $267 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter as net interest spread contracted 12 basis points partially offset by $1.2 billion increase in average assets. The average balance sheet growth was driven primarily by third-party deposits, which moved back on balance sheet in conjunction with our new speed platform. Although spread contracted sequentially at 250 basis points, it was in line with our expectations as interest rates remained challenging in the quarter. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low 240 basis point range in the third quarter. 
Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $47.1 billion, up approximately $300 million from the prior quarter. Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the second quarter were $167 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, but up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission portrayed of $10.96 increased $0.02 from the prior quarter and $0.24 from the year-ago. The year-over-year increase was driven largely by the mix of stock plan and option traits. Fees and service charges revenues of $55 million, increased from $52 million in the prior quarter. This is a result of more favorable revenue on third-party deposit relationships and seasonally higher proxy fees, partially offset by slightly lower order flow revenue. 
As you may remember from last quarter with the rollout of a new suite platform, we determined appropriate to reclassify the revenue generated from all balance sheet deposits into fees and service charges from net interest income. Net gains on loans and securities were $11 million this quarter compared to $9 million in the prior quarter and just above our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We expect to remain near the higher end of the range if rates remain low as they have been in the past couple of quarters. 
We recorded $309 million in operating expenses for the quarter, inclusive of severance and the expense related to the G1X contract amendment. Excluding these 2 items, our expenses for the quarter would have been $294 million compared to $300 million in the prior quarter and $284 million a year ago. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect expenses to be within our previous guidance range of a low to mid-single-digit increase over 2014. This is inclusive of the 2 unique items in this quarter's numbers along with the benefit to FDIC expense. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, down $412 million or 7% from the prior quarter. This welcome decline was driven by higher than average prepayments among our borrowers. Net charge-offs of just 3 million across all loans were the lowest levels since Q3 of 2001. Provision expense was also $3 million, down from $5 million in the prior quarter, leaving our allowance unchanged at $402 million. 
There are a few factors impacting provision this quarter. First, similar to how we previously reserved for high-risk from equity loans nearing conversion, this quarter we established a lifetime reserve on a subset of higher risk one- to four-family loans. Second, we made some changes to our modeling practices, which triggered a revaluation of the loss emergence period on loans covered in the general reserve. Based on our review of our recent loan performance, current economic conditions and their impact on borrower behavior, we extended the loss emergence period from 12 to 18 months. These changes largely offset the positive impact of faster prepayments, improving credit quality and lower-than-expected defaults on the ballons loans that mature during the quarter. 
As of June 30, the ballon segment of the HELOC portfolio was approximately $120 million with an average of $20 million scheduled to mature over each of the next 4 quarters. Over the next several quarters, we continue to provision -- we continue to expect provision to fall within the range of $0 million to $20 million per quarter, however, we are entering a period of increasing HELOC conversions, driving potentially greater volatility in future provision. As our HELOC portfolio converts to amortizing loans, it takes a month or 2 following the event to get meaningful performance data and we don't yet have that for the 2015 subset. I expect we will have more data by Q4 and at that time we'll be able to provide clear insight into the provision expense for 2016. 
Turning now to the capital plan. It feels good to have the clearing broker move behind us. The entity was already capitalized well in excess of regulatory requirements. However, we had to take steps to prudently bolster the position to meet funding requirements under aggressive stress scenarios. The $150 million of capital moved from the bank addresses the permanent working capital position and the roughly $9 million in external lines meaningfully enhances the liquidity position. We anticipate these lines will cost us approximately $3 million to $5 million annually depending on usage. As for our capital position, the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. Pro forma for the move of the clearing broker would have declined by approximately 50 basis points, implying $113 million of capital in excess of our targeted 9% leverage ratio. The bank's net income for the quarter was $114 million, which includes $20 million from the clearing broker. We will seek to -- we'll seek approval to dividend the full amount of the parent in the current quarter. In addition, the introducing broker generated $30 million of capital during the quarter and we intend to move that amount to the parent in the coming weeks. 
Corporate cash ended the quarter at $406 million, an increase of $148 million from the prior quarter and well above our target of maintaining $100 million. Now with debt reduction and the broker move is behind us, we are entering the next evolution of capital planning. No longer with pressing needs, but rather a host of strategic opportunities to evaluate and I'm proud to be running point on these initiatives. Each comes with a number of considerations, but I want to give you some context as to how we think about them. 
Balance sheet growth continues to be an attractive use of capital. And with our new suite platform, we have the ability to operate close to the $50 billion threshold. In terms of composition, we are ever mindful of the possibility to accelerate the run-off of legacy funding in investments, including extinguishing wholesale funding obligations, disposing of the loan portfolio and paying down Trust Preferred Securities. With respect to the wholesale funding, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of issuance obligations, with $315 million set to expire in the second half of the year. While it is presently our intention to continue issuing those obligations, their termination would create capacity to on-board deposits, recasting our liability structure to be predominantly core funded and low cost. However, doing so would also result in loss of approximately $420 million pretax. 
In terms of other funding, we could redeem all $433 million of Trust Preferred Securities, of which the final 25% currently included in Tier 1 capital will be phased out in Q1 of 2016. However, there is a handful of reasons we are not overly anxious to do so at the moment, including the fairly modest associated cost of these notes. 
As for the loan portfolio, there continues to be a mismatch between what they are work to us and what they might sell for in the secondary market. So, while we intend to continue to hold them on our books, as the size continues to shrink and we work our way through the conversions, the gap could meaningfully narrow and our strategy could change. With respect to other uses, we continue to prudently invest in the business, while being mindful of any unique feature opportunities. This of course includes taking advantage of the scalability of our core brokerage platform through acquisition or expanding our product and service offerings. 
And lastly, regarding dividends and share buybacks. While squarely on our radar until we achieve investment grade status, we remain restricted by covenants within our corporate debt. The bottom line is that we are in a strong position when it comes to capital utilization opportunities. Having deployed a significant amount to reduce our corporate debt, we intend to continue evaluating the best path forward and we'll update you appropriate. 
To summarize, we are in a position that we haven't been in -- for quite some time from a financial and capital standpoint and it's our goal to take advantage of the stance provide value to our customers and shareholders. On a personal note, I'm excited to take on this new opportunity as CFO of such a tremendous company under the focused leadership of Mr. It sick and look forward to working with many of you. And with that, operator, we will open the line for questions."

So this quarter, the provision in one- to four-family was directly affected by what I talked about in the prepared remarks. We took a special reserve on that population of high-risk one- to four-family loans. So loans that we've identified a pool of heightened risk, so that's additive to the allowance balance for the one- to four-family. Also the increase in the emergence period from 12 to 18 months will increase that allowance balance as more loans are now in the emergence period.

Now beginning well the second annual DFAST process, distributing more than $140 million to the parent and completing the steps to move our clearing broker from under the bank. We also transitioned our finance leadership, welcoming a new CFO from within our executive ranks. 
In summation, we have a lot going on, got a lot done, and start the second half of the year in a position of real strength, focused on continuing to deliver for our customers and our owners. 
Elaborating a bit on the capital story. We completed a number of important components of our plan, most notably were steps to move E*TRADE Clearing. We completed the move on July 1, hitting the mark on our commitment to do so in the latter half of 2015. More than a matter of stellar marksmanship, the team under Mr. Pizzi's devoted significant time and energy to ensuring the transition was a smooth one, including determining funding and capitalization and completing the work to secure additional external lines of liquidity, bringing the total to approximately $900 million and contributing $150 million in capital from the bank. We are pleased to have completed this. We are now directing our focus towards what's next. 
We also completed the second annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests. While not surprised, we obviously ended our banking performance well under all stress scenarios, remaining above regulatory well-capitalized minimums by a healthy margin. With Bank Tier 1 leverage remaining above 10%, even when stressed most stringently, and our risk-weighted measures remaining at more than 4x the regulatory minimums. It's worth mentioning that the Stress Test utilized a reporting data as of the third quarter of last year, and our legacy risks have diminished significantly since then, including a reduction in total loans of more than 15%. 
Overall, we are pleased with the results and feel good about the feedback we received from our regulators regarding our capabilities and methodology. 
Today, we're in a very respectable position when it comes to future capital usage. Having knocked out some big-ticket items in the form of material reduction in debt and extracting 1 strap value to the bank to the brokerage moves, we march forward in determining our next capital initiatives. Mr. Pizzi will provide you with more details on our current thinking in just a few moments. 
Turning to our financials. I feel it's an appropriate time to formally introduce our new CFO, Michael Pizzi. Mike took the CFO at the time in mid-June, after having been with the company for more than a decade, latterly serving as our Chief Risk Officer, and before that, serving a number of years as our Treasurer. Mike is a strong, proven leader. His expertise, regulatory experience and considerable intellectual firepower make him an ideal fit. As all you get know him, I'm sure you'll share my opinion and value the dialogue with him. I'm also certain that under Mike's leadership, we will resolutely prosecute our capital plan, maintain strong oversight of our finance function and continue to execute on other important financial initiatives. 
As for the quarter's results. We recorded earnings of $72 million or $0.25 per share. This excludes a $220 million tax benefit related to the favorable outcome of an IRSI. The quarter also included some unique items within our compensation, FDIC and other expense lines. The first $6 million in compensation related to departure of our former CFO. The second $9 million and other expenses related to a contract amendment with our former subsidiary, G1X. 
In a nutshell, we renegotiated the order routing agreement with our partners at G1X to provide us with greater flexibility and optionality as part of our staunch commitment to deliver the best possible execution for our customers. 
And last, our FDIC expense dropped sequentially by $7 million. This expense reflects the calculation of both quantitative and qualitative assessments of risk, including the composition of the balance sheet and overlaying regulatory judgment. We've indicated for some time that we expected our FDIC rate to ultimately reduce significantly, and that is exactly what happened in Q2. This is a strong testament to our privacy risking and improving our regulatory standing. Going forward, we expect the FDIC rate will be approximately 8 bps on total assets as opposed to the previous run rate of around 20 bps. 
Before we get into metrics, I want to highlight a business decision made under the administration of Mr. Pizzi during the quarter, which is to discontinue our noncore global trading platform. We found that it did not have the scale to justify the associated expense, capital or energy. The accounts we did have, while reasonable in absolute quantum, weren't actively used, particularly as customers can access much of the same international exposure for our core U.S. trading platform. 
Importantly, we do not expect the significant outflow of assets related to these accounts, as most of the customers are simply consolidating their investments into other E*TRADE brokerage accounts. We began the closure process in May and expect to complete it in early Q3. In total, we expect to close approximately 24,000 accounts, of which 3,300 were recognized in Q2, with the vast majority expected in July. This decision allows us to focus these resources on core products and services for our customer base. Our brokerage metrics reflect some seasonality as the quarter opens at the zenith of tax season in April and closes as we head into the lows of summer trading. 
DARTs of 149,000 were down 12% sequentially, with options representing a steady 23% of total activity. As volatility rose sharply in the first half of July amidst market turmoil in China and melodrama in Greece, customer trading volumes have increased slightly, up 6% from June. 
Mobile continue to represent an increasingly important component of our trades, reaching a record 14% this quarter compared to 11% a year ago, and underscoring the increasing trend of mobile adoption, roughly 1/3 of our unique logins [indiscernible], which are in mobile apps. We've also seen positive traction with our most recent Apple Watch app, with already 5,000 downloads since we launched in April. 
Margin balances remain healthy during the quarter, even as the equity markets cool slightly. We ended the quarter at $8.1 billion, just shy of the prior quarter's record high. We reported net new brokerage accounts of 19,000 during the quarter with the metric reduced by 2 items: first, approximately 3,300 accounts related to global trading, as I just mentioned. And second, circa 3,500 accounts due to escheatment, an outsized number compared to normal levels as it related to a more comprehensive process concluded in May. 
Excluding these 2 items, net new brokerage accounts would have been approximately 25,000, with a normalized attrition rate of 8.7% consistent with the prior quarter. Net new brokerage assets were $900 million during the quarter, down considerably from Q1, largely a result of seasonality during tax season. 
We've been diligent in our efforts to expand awareness of our retirement products and services. As a testament to the team's hard work, these assets have grown by more than 50% in just 3 years, and have represented about 1/3 of total net new brokerage assets over the past 2 years. 
Furthermore, we continue to see stability in our managed assets, which ended the quarter at $3.2 billion. As part of our effort to continue growing this element of our customer relationships, we revamped the retirement experience on E*TRADE.com, creating a cleaner, simpler design with inviting content that helps customers engage and take charge. It offers interactive widgets, customized to each account, demonstrating the benefits of disciplined saving and investing. An account wizard that helps direct customers with the returning account that is right for them and personalized checklist and to-do list for each stage of an investor's retirement planning. 
In addition to the new retirement expense, other noteworthy platform enhancements are as follows: on our active trader platform E*TRADE Pro, we rolled out a robust new tutorial experience, new plug-and-play layouts to support the unique needs of traders as well as improvements to several other customization features. We also simplified watch list management and charting options and added the ability to trade tax lots across equity and options positions. 
On E*TRADE.com, we made a number of improvements to our stock-planned participant experience and enhanced our bill-pay functionality. We will continue to see enhancements and innovations as we strive to better serve our customers in the fashion they find most relevant to support taking charge of their financial health. I encourage you to stay tuned. One last item before I turn the call over. I'd like to take a brief moment to express my gratitude for the service of our former CFO. Matthew Audette was a faithful steward of E*TRADE and its finances over 16 years, helping to guide the company through some of our most challenging times. We wish him the best in his future endeavors in sunny Southern, California. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to our recondite CFO, Mike Pizzi."

We accomplished a lot during the second quarter and we posted good results. Excluding the $220 million tax benefit, we recorded earnings of $72 million or $0.25 per share for the quarter compared to $85 million or $0.29 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $73 million pretax charge related to our landmark corporate debt transaction. It also compares to $69 million or $0.24 per share in the year-ago quarter. To quickly elaborate on the tax benefit, it resulted from an IRS audit of prior year's tax returns. So essentially, years ago, we took a conservative position on the deductibility of certain tax losses and have been working with the IRS for some time to resolve this position. 
This tax benefit also resulted in an increase in our deferred tax asset, which ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, further increasing the shield against the payment of future tax dollars. 
Turning back to the top. Total net revenues were $445 million in the quarter compared to $456 million in the prior quarter and $438 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest income of $267 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter as net interest spread contracted 12 basis points, partially offset by a $1.2 billion increase in average assets. The average balance sheet growth was driven primarily by third-party deposits, which moved back on the balance sheet in conjunction with our new suite platform. Although spread contracted sequentially at 250 basis points, it was in line with our expectations as interest rates remained challenging in the quarter. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low 240-basis-point range in the third quarter. 
Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $47.1 billion, up approximately $300 million from the prior quarter. Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the second quarter were $167 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, but up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission portrayed of $10.96 increased $0.02 from the prior quarter and $0.24 from the year ago. The year-over-year increase was driven largely by the mix of stock plan and option trades. Fees and service charges revenues of $55 million increased from $52 million in the prior quarter. This is a result of more favorable revenue on third-party deposit relationships and seasonally higher proxy fees, partially offset by slightly lower order flow revenue. 
As you may remember from last quarter with the rollout of the new suite platform, we determined it appropriate to reclassify the revenue generated from off-balance sheet deposits into fees and service charges from net interest income. Net gains on loans and securities were $11 million this quarter compared to $9 million in the prior quarter and just above our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We expect to remain near the high end of the range if rates remain low, as they have been in the past couple of quarters.
We recorded $309 million in operating expenses for the quarter, inclusive of severance and the expense related to the G1X contract amendment. Excluding these 2 items, our expenses for the quarter would have been $294 million compared to $300 million in the prior quarter and $284 million a year ago. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect expenses to be within our previous guidance range of a low- to mid-single-digit increase over 2014. This is inclusive of the 2 unique items in this quarter's numbers along with the benefit to FDIC expense. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, down $412 million or 7% from the prior quarter. This welcome decline was driven by higher-than-average prepayments among our borrowers. Net charge-offs of just 3 million across all loans were at the lowest levels since Q3 of 2001. Provision expense was also $3 million, down from $5 million in the prior quarter, leaving our allowance unchanged at $402 million. 
There are a few factors impacting provision this quarter. First, similar to how we previously reserved for high-risk home equity loans nearing conversion, this quarter, we established a lifetime reserve on a subset of higher risk one- to four-family loans. Second, we made some changes to our modeling practices, which triggered a reevaluation of the loss emergence period on loans covered in the general reserve. Based on our review of recent loan performance, current economic conditions and their impact on borrower behavior, we extended the loss emergence period from 12 to 18 months. These changes largely offset the positive impact of faster prepayments, improving credit quality and lower-than-expected defaults on the balloon loans that matured during the quarter. 
As of June 30, the balloon segment of the HELOC portfolio was approximately $120 million, with an average of $20 million scheduled to mature over each of the next 4 quarters. Over the next several quarters, we continue to provision -- we continue to expect provision to fall within a range of $0 million to $20 million per quarter, however, we are entering a period of increasing HELOC conversions, driving potentially greater volatility in future provision. As our HELOC portfolio converts to amortizing loans, it takes a month or 2 following the event to get meaningful performance data, and we don't yet have that for the 2015 subset. I expect we will have more data by Q4, and at that time, we'll be able to provide clear insight into the provision expense for 2016. 
Turning now to the capital plan. It feels good to have the Clearing broker move behind us. The entity was already capitalized well in excess of regulatory requirements. However, we had to take steps to prudently bolster the position to meet funding requirements under aggressive stress scenarios. The $150 million of capital move from the bank addresses the permanent working capital position and the roughly $9 million in external lines meaningfully enhances the liquidity position. We anticipate these lines will cost us approximately $3 million to $5 million annually, depending on usage. As for our capital position, the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. Pro forma for the move of the clearing broker, it would have declined by approximately 50 basis points, implying $113 million of capital in excess of our targeted 9% leverage ratio. The bank's net income for the quarter was $114 million, which includes $20 million from the clearing broker. We will seek to -- we will seek approval to dividend the full amount to the parent in the current quarter. In addition, the introducing broker generated $30 million of capital during the quarter and we intend to move that amount to the parent in the coming weeks. 
Corporate cash ended the quarter at $406 million, an increase of $148 million from the prior quarter and well above our target of maintaining $100 million. Now with debt reduction and the broker moves behind us, we are entering the next evolution of capital planning. No longer with pressing needs but rather a host of strategic opportunities to evaluate, and I'm proud to be running point on these initiatives. Each comes with a number of considerations, but I want to give you some context as to how we think about them. 
Balance sheet growth continues to be an attractive use of capital. And with our new suite platform, we have the ability to operate close to the $50 billion threshold. In terms of composition, we are ever mindful of the possibility to accelerate the runoff of legacy funding in investments, including extinguishing wholesale funding obligations, disposing of the loan portfolio and paying down Trust Preferred Securities. With respect to the wholesale funding, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of issuance obligations, with $315 million set to expire in the second half of the year. While it is presently our intention to continue issuing those obligations, their termination would create capacity to on-boarding deposits. Recasting our liability structure to be predominantly core-funded and low cost. However, doing so would also result in a loss of approximately $420 million pretax. 
In terms of other funding, we could redeem all $433 million of Trust Preferred Securities, of which the final 25% currently included in Tier 1 capital, will be phased out in Q1 of 2016. However, there's a handful of reasons we are not overly anxious to do so at the moment, including the fairly modest associated cost of these notes. 
As for the loan portfolio, there continues to be a mismatch between what they are worth to us and what they might sell for in the secondary market. So while we intend to continue to hold them on our books, as the size continues to shrink and we work our way through the conversions, the gap could meaningfully narrow and our strategy could change. With respect to other uses, we continue to prudently invest in the business, while being mindful of any unique future opportunities. This, of course, includes taking advantage of the scalability of our core brokerage platform through acquisition or expanding our product and service offerings. 
And lastly, regarding dividends and share buybacks. While squarely on our radar until we achieve investment-grade status, we remain restricted by covenants within our corporate debt. The bottom line is that we are in a strong position when it comes to capital-utilization opportunities. Having deployed a significant amount to reduce our corporate debt, we intend to continue evaluating the best path forward and we'll update you when appropriate. 
To summarize, we are in a position that we haven't been in -- for quite some time from a financial and capital standpoint, and it's our goal to take advantage of this stance by continuing to provide value to our customers and shareholders. On a personal note, I'm excited to take on this new opportunity as CFO of such a tremendous company under the focused leadership of Mr. Idzik and look forward to working with many of you. And with that, operator, we will open the line for questions."

Is it going to actually require a portfolio sale or is it simply sufficient comfort with the current earnings trajectory that it can be sustained? I just wanted to have a better understanding of that, given the significant capital that you have and the share repurchase considerations."

The product would have required some additional technology investment. It also was capital inefficient in terms of the capital exposures at the clearing broker dealer. And given the need to reinvest, given the capital inefficiency, given that it didn't provide much in terms of revenue or trading, we thought at best to shut it down.

While the retail trading environment was dampened by seasonality, the pace of our progress remains solid. Core activities, we continue to demonstrate the resilience of E*TRADE's model, growing accounts and assets and hitting several notable milestones. We delivered on our commitment to do more for our customers, rolling out a number of new or enhanced products and services, including an upgrade in Retirement Center and our groundbreaking app for the Apple Watch. We also further sharpened our focus, deciding to sunset our noncore global trading platform. 
On the capital front, our risk profile extended its trend of steady improvement, while we continue to advance the ball for shareholders on the capital plan. Navigating well the second annual DFAST process, distributing more than $140 million to the parent and completing the steps to move our clearing broker from under the bank. We also transitioned our finance leadership, welcoming a new CFO from within our executive ranks. 
In summation, we have a lot going on, got a lot done, and start the second half of the year in a position of real strength, focused on continuing to deliver for our customers and our owners. 
Elaborating a bit on the capital story. We completed a number of important components of our plan, most notably were steps to move E*TRADE Clearing. We completed the move on July 1, hitting the mark on our commitment to do so in the latter half of 2015. More than a matter of stellar marksmanship, the team under Mr. Pizzi's devoted significant time and energy to ensuring the transition was a smooth one, including determining funding and capitalization and completing the work to secure additional external lines of liquidity, bringing the total to approximately $900 million and contributing $150 million in capital from the bank. We are pleased to have completed this. We are now directing our focus towards what's next. 
We also completed the second annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests. While not surprised, we are proud to say that our bank  performed well under all stress scenarios, remaining above regulatory well-capitalized minimums by a healthy margin, with Bank Tier 1 leverage remaining above 10%, even when stressed most stringently.  And our risk-weighted measures remaining at more than 4x the regulatory minimums. It's worth mentioning that the Stress Test utilized a reporting data as of the third quarter of last year, and our legacy risks have diminished significantly since then, including a reduction in total loans of more than 15%. 
Overall, we are pleased with the results and feel good about the feedback we received from our regulators regarding our capabilities and methodology. 
Today, we're in a very respectable position when it comes to future capital usage. Having knocked out some big-ticket items in the form of material reduction in debt and extracting once trapped value from the bank to the brokerage moves, we march forward in determining our next capital initiatives. Mr. Pizzi will provide you with more details on our current thinking in just a few moments. 
Turning to our financials. I feel it's an appropriate time to formally introduce our new CFO, Michael Pizzi. Mike took the CFO at the time in mid-June, after having been with the company for more than a decade, latterly serving as our Chief Risk Officer, and before that, serving a number of years as our Treasurer. Mike is a strong, proven leader. His expertise, regulatory experience and considerable intellectual firepower make him an ideal fit. As all you get know him, I'm sure you'll share my opinion and value the dialogue with him. I'm also certain that under Mike's leadership, we will resolutely prosecute our capital plan, maintain strong oversight of our finance function and continue to execute on other important financial initiatives. 
As for the quarter's results. We recorded earnings of $72 million or $0.25 per share. This excludes a $220 million tax benefit related to the favorable outcome of an IRSI. The quarter also included some unique items within our compensation, FDIC and other expense lines. The first $6 million in compensation related to departure of our former CFO. The second $9 million and other expenses related to a contract amendment with our former subsidiary, G1X. 
In a nutshell, we renegotiated the order routing agreement with our partners at G1X to provide us with greater flexibility and optionality as part of our staunch commitment to deliver the best possible execution for our customers. 
And last, our FDIC expense dropped sequentially by $7 million. This expense reflects the calculation of both quantitative and qualitative assessments of risk, including the composition of the balance sheet and overlaying regulatory judgment. We've indicated for some time that we expected our FDIC rate to ultimately reduce significantly, and that is exactly what happened in Q2. This is a strong testament to our privacy risking and improving our regulatory standing. Going forward, we expect the FDIC rate will be approximately 8 bps on total assets as opposed to the previous run rate of around 20 bps. 
Before we get into metrics, I want to highlight a business decision made under the administration of Mr. Pizzi during the quarter, which is to discontinue our noncore global trading platform. We found that it did not have the scale to justify the associated expense, capital or energy. The accounts we did have, while reasonable in absolute quantum, weren't actively used, particularly as customers can access much of the same international exposure for our core U.S. trading platform. 
Importantly, we do not expect the significant outflow of assets related to these accounts, as most of the customers are simply consolidating their investments into other E*TRADE brokerage accounts. We began the closure process in May and expect to complete it in early Q3. In total, we expect to close approximately 24,000 accounts, of which 3,300 were recognized in Q2, with the vast majority expected in July. This decision allows us to focus these resources on core products and services for our customer base. Our brokerage metrics reflect some seasonality as the quarter opens at the zenith of tax season in April and closes as we head into the lulls of summer trading. 
DARTs of 149,000 were down 12% sequentially, with options representing a steady 23% of total activity. As volatility rose sharply in the first half of July amidst market turmoil in China and the melodrama in Greece, customer trading volumes have increased slightly, up 6% from June. 
Mobile continue to represent an increasingly important component of our trades, reaching a record 14% this quarter compared to 11% a year ago, and underscoring the increasing trend of mobile adoption, roughly 1/3 of our unique logins during the quarter were through our mobile apps. We've also seen positive traction with our most recent Apple Watch app, with already 5,000 downloads since it launched in April. 
Margin balances remain healthy during the quarter, even as the equity markets cooled slightly. We ended the quarter at $8.1 billion, just shy of the prior quarter's record high. We reported net new brokerage accounts of 19,000 during the quarter with the metric reduced by 2 items: first, approximately 3,300 accounts related to global trading, as I just mentioned. And second, circa 3,500 accounts due to escheatment, an outsized number compared to normal levels as it related to a more comprehensive process concluded in May. 
Excluding these 2 items, net new brokerage accounts would have been approximately 25,000, with a normalized attrition rate of 8.7% consistent with the prior quarter. Net new brokerage assets were $900 million during the quarter, down considerably from Q1, largely a result of seasonality during tax season. 
We've been diligent in our efforts to expand awareness of our retirement products and services. As a testament to the team's hard work, these assets have grown by more than 50% in just 3 years, and have represented about 1/3 of total net new brokerage assets over the past 2 years. 
Furthermore, we continue to see stability in our managed assets, which ended the quarter at $3.2 billion. As part of our effort to continue growing this element of our customer relationships, we revamped the retirement experience on E*TRADE.com, creating a cleaner, simpler design with inviting content that helps customers engage and take charge. It offers interactive widgets, customized to each account, demonstrating the benefits of disciplined saving and investing. An account wizard that helps direct customers with a retirement account that is right for them and personalized checklist and to-do list for each stage of an investor's retirement planning. 
In addition to the new retirement experience, other noteworthy platform enhancements are as follows: on our active trader platform E*TRADE Pro, we rolled out a robust new tutorial experience, new plug-and-play layouts to support the unique needs of traders as well as improvements to several other customization features. We also simplified watch list management and charting options and added the ability to trade tax lots across equity and options positions. 
On E*TRADE.com, we made a number of improvements to our stock-planned participant experience and enhanced our bill-pay functionality. We will continue to see enhancements and innovations as we strive to better serve our customers in the fashion they find most relevant to support taking charge of their financial health. I encourage you to stay tuned. One last item before I turn the call over. I'd like to take a brief moment to express my gratitude for the service of our former CFO. Matthew Audette was a faithful steward of E*TRADE and its finances over 16 years, helping to guide the company through some of our most challenging times. We wish him the best in his future endeavors in sunny Southern California. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to our recondite CFO, Mike Pizzi."

We accomplished a lot during the second quarter and we posted good results. Excluding the $220 million tax benefit, we recorded earnings of $72 million or $0.25 per share for the quarter compared to $85 million or $0.29 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $73 million pretax charge related to our landmark corporate debt transaction. It also compares to $69 million or $0.24 per share in the year-ago quarter. To quickly elaborate on the tax benefit, it resulted from an IRS audit of prior year's tax returns. So essentially, years ago, we took a conservative position on the deductibility of certain tax losses and have been working with the IRS for some time to resolve this position. 
This tax benefit also resulted in an increase in our deferred tax asset, which ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, further increasing the shield against the payment of future tax dollars. 
Turning back to the top. Total net revenues were $445 million in the quarter compared to $456 million in the prior quarter and $438 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest income of $267 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter as net interest spread contracted 12 basis points, partially offset by a $1.2 billion increase in average assets. The average balance sheet growth was driven primarily by third-party deposits, which moved back on the balance sheet in conjunction with our new suite platform. Although spread contracted sequentially at 250 basis points, it was in line with our expectations as interest rates remained challenging in the quarter. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low 240-basis-point range in the third quarter. 
Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $47.1 billion, up approximately $300 million from the prior quarter. Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the second quarter were $167 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, but up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission portrayed of $10.96 increased $0.02 from the prior quarter and $0.24 from the year ago. The year-over-year increase was driven largely by the mix of stock plan and option trades. Fees and service charges revenues of $55 million increased from $52 million in the prior quarter. This is a result of more favorable revenue on third-party deposit relationships and seasonally higher proxy fees, partially offset by slightly lower order flow revenue. 
As you may remember from last quarter with the rollout of the new suite platform, we determined it appropriate to reclassify the revenue generated from off-balance sheet deposits into fees and service charges from net interest income. Net gains on loans and securities were $11 million this quarter compared to $9 million in the prior quarter and just above our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We expect to remain near the high end of the range if rates remain low, as they have been in the past couple of quarters.
We recorded $309 million in operating expenses for the quarter, inclusive of severance and the expense related to the G1X contract amendment. Excluding these 2 items, our expenses for the quarter would have been $294 million compared to $300 million in the prior quarter and $284 million a year ago. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect expenses to be within our previous guidance range of a low- to mid-single-digit increase over 2014. This is inclusive of the 2 unique items in this quarter's numbers along with the benefit to FDIC expense. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, down $412 million or 7% from the prior quarter. This welcome decline was driven by higher-than-average prepayments among our borrowers. Net charge-offs of just 3 million across all loans were at the lowest levels since Q3 of 2001. Provision expense was also $3 million, down from $5 million in the prior quarter, leaving our allowance unchanged at $402 million. 
There are a few factors impacting provision this quarter. First, similar to how we previously reserved for high-risk home equity loans nearing conversion, this quarter, we established a lifetime reserve on a subset of higher risk one- to four-family loans. Second, we made some changes to our modeling practices, which triggered a reevaluation of the loss emergence period on loans covered in the general reserve. Based on our review of recent loan performance, current economic conditions and their impact on borrower behavior, we extended the loss emergence period from 12 to 18 months. These changes largely offset the positive impact of faster prepayments, improving credit quality and lower-than-expected defaults on the balloon loans that matured during the quarter. 
As of June 30, the balloon segment of the HELOC portfolio was approximately $120 million, with an average of $20 million scheduled to mature over each of the next 4 quarters. Over the next several quarters, we continue to provision -- we continue to expect provision to fall within a range of $0 million to $20 million per quarter. However, we are entering a period of increasing HELOC conversions, driving potentially greater volatility in future provision. As our HELOC portfolio converts to amortizing loans, it takes a month or 2 following the event to get meaningful performance data, and we don't yet have that for the 2015 subset. I expect we will have more data by Q4, and at that time, we'll be able to provide clear insight into the provision expense for 2016. 
Turning now to the capital plan. It feels good to have the Clearing broker move behind us. The entity was already capitalized well in excess of regulatory requirements. However, we had to take steps to prudently bolster the position to meet funding requirements under aggressive stress scenarios. The $150 million of capital move from the bank addresses the permanent working capital position and the roughly 900 million external lines meaningfully enhances the liquidity position. We anticipate these lines will cost us approximately $3 million to $5 million annually, depending on usage. As for our capital position, the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. Pro forma for the move of the clearing broker, it would have declined by approximately 50 basis points, implying $113 million of capital in excess of our targeted 9% leverage ratio. The bank's net income for the quarter was $114 million, which includes $20 million from the clearing broker. We will seek to -- we will seek approval to dividend the full amount to the parent in the current quarter. In addition, the introducing broker generated $30 million of capital during the quarter and we intend to remove that amount from[ph] the parent in the coming weeks. 
Corporate cash ended the quarter at $406 million, an increase of $148 million from the prior quarter and well above our target of maintaining $100 million. Now with debt reduction and the broker moves behind us, we are entering the next evolution of capital planning. No longer with pressing needs but rather a host of strategic opportunities to evaluate, and I'm proud to be running point on these initiatives. Each comes with a number of considerations, but I want to give you some context as to how we think about them. 
Balance sheet growth continues to be an attractive use of capital. And with our new suite platform, we have the ability to operate close to the $50 billion threshold. In terms of composition, we are ever mindful of the possibility to accelerate the runoff of legacy funding in investments, including extinguishing wholesale funding obligations, disposing of the loan portfolio and paying down Trust Preferred Securities. With respect to the wholesale funding, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of issuance obligations, with $315 million set to expire in the second half of the year. While it is presently our intention to continue issuing those obligations, their termination would create capacity to on-boarding deposits. Recasting our liability structure to be predominantly core-funded and low cost. However, doing so would also result in a loss of approximately $420 million pretax. 
In terms of other funding, we could redeem all $433 million of Trust Preferred Securities, of which the final 25% currently included in Tier 1 capital, will be phased out in Q1 of 2016. However, there's a handful of reasons we are not overly anxious to do so at the moment, including the fairly modest associated cost of these notes. 
As for the loan portfolio, there continues to be a mismatch between what they are worth to us and what they might sell for in the secondary market. So while we intend to continue to hold them on our books, as the size continues to shrink and we work our way through the conversions, the gap could meaningfully narrow and our strategy could change. With respect to other uses, we continue to prudently invest in the business, while being mindful of any unique future opportunities. This, of course, includes taking advantage of the scalability of our core brokerage platform through acquisition or expanding our product and service offerings. 
And lastly, regarding dividends and share buybacks. While squarely on our radar until we achieve investment-grade status, we remain restricted by covenants within our corporate debt. The bottom line is that we are in a strong position when it comes to capital-utilization opportunities. Having deployed a significant amount to reduce our corporate debt, we intend to continue evaluating the best path forward and we'll update you when appropriate. 
To summarize, we are in a position that we haven't been in -- for quite some time from a financial and capital standpoint, and it's our goal to take advantage of this stance by continuing to provide value to our customers and shareholders. On a personal note, I'm excited to take on this new opportunity as CFO of such a tremendous company under the focused leadership of Mr. Idzik and look forward to working with many of you. And with that, operator, we will open the line for questions."

Beyond t",1875,"Good evening and thank you for joining us. The third quarter was busy with customer engagement demonstrating a bimodal distribution, high engagement during the market turmoil, bracketed by a more muted trading activity in the rest of the quarter. Beyond this, we took yet another confidence step on the capital front with termination of legacy wholesale funding, which will significantly enhance forward earnings power, but came with one-time charges. Excluding those, we posted net income of $98 million or $0.33 per share. Our results also reflected better-than-expected credit trends and performance as we reached an inflection point in the loan portfolio, releasing reserves for the first time since the portfolio transitioned to run off more than 8 years ago.
During the quarter, we continue to enhance our brokerage products and services, posting capabilities in our professional trading and mobile platforms. We continue to tighten our progress making the choice to discontinue a less of our international local operations and exit a pair of ancillary products. Both of these actions continue to reflect our dislike of a symmetric risks. We've also further sharpened our pencils on capital deployment and have weighted several felicitous steps may to date, we will share an update to our thinking on future uses later on this call.
Also in early August, we were upgraded to rare 3 [ph] notches to an investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's. We are obviously pleased that our corporate ratings are beginning to reflect the progress we've made and where we are as a company.
As for our metrics, we reported 156,000 DARTs, up 4% from Q2, as an inter quarter spike and volatility propelled customer trading during typically slow period. Amidst the volatility in volumes from August 24th, we processed a full day's worth of activity in the first hour of trading and posted an all-time record with 394,000 trades on the day. The ability to handle flow this magnitude is a true testament to the work we have completed over the past couple of years to strengthen our foundation, including a hardy bowl strength of our tech and operations infrastructure.
[indiscernible] as a percentage of total DARTs held steady at 23%, a level relatively consistent with the past couple of years. And trades -- our mobile applications, represented a record 15% of total trading activity, having doubled over the past 2.5 years. Over one quarter of our unique logins came through this channel. We again enhanced our capabilities down this front as we aim to deliver an experience that rivals the best of digital be it desktop, tablets, smartphone or smart watch. And finally, on trading, October DARTs are tracking relatively flat with September.
March imbalances ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, down only 2% from Q2 despite a more substantial decline in the equity markets. However we've seen a slight pullback in Q4 to date with balances currently at $7.5 billion. Excluding the impact of discontinuing our global trading platform, we added 19,000 net new brokerage accounts during the period. Adjusted attrition for the quarter was 9.3%. Net new brokerage assets were $2.1 billion during the quarter, down slightly from the year-ago period for more than double the prior quarter.
As we think about E*TRADE's growth, we continually refine our focus. Last quarter, we made the decision to sunset our global trading platform, which is nearly complete. This quarter, we made the decision to wind down our brokerage operations in Hong Kong and Singapore in consideration of a level of requisite investment to maintain a competitive platform while continuing to meet the potential standards of both local and U.S. regulators. The opportunity simply didn't justify the demand of resources. We are in the early stages of this process and are determining which of any of the accounts will continue to service in the U.S. Our business in Hong Kong and Singapore comprises approximately 25,000 accounts with assets of around $1.8 billion.
Also this quarter, we have discontinued our FX offering as it was not core to our product suite. We previously facilitated customer FX activity through a third party broker, which linked to our platform for account visibility only. The only true change for customers resulted from our linking these accounts is that their FX transactions and account information will no longer be visible through our platform. There is no impact to our account metrics resulting from this change.
To dial in more closely on our products and services, think of best-in-class digitally centered broker means continuing to raise the bar when it comes to the customer experience of our various platforms. To that end, I'm pleased to review some of the key improvements we made this quarter. We continue to expand the capabilities of our active trader platform, E*TRADE Pro, this quarter making a series of significant enhancements to our options analyzer. Beyond the new streamline design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple option strategies, run through various [indiscernible] and scenarios, customize graphing features more easily, and seamlessly send any strategy directly to trade execution.
We also added capabilities to our industry-leading mobile applications, including capitalizing a new Apple Watch functionality. Moreover, we launched conditional orders and rolling options for our core smartphone apps.
For the more long-term investors, we made strides in enhancing our tablet functionality, particularly around mutual fund transactions. This is of particular note as the importance of mobile investing continues to expand beyond the realm of the active trader. It's becoming increasingly difficult channel for all investor types.
When it comes to accolades, which I will never reluctant to trumpet during these calls, we have a few to report. First, we went best overall IRA provider and best IRA for beginners by NerdWallet in the summer 2015 review. We were the only broker to win in 2 categories. Next, NerdWallet recently rated our mobile platform 5 out of 5 stars, highlighting our data and research functionality, level disabilities, easy trade execution and availability on many devices as reasons why we are best-in-class.
Finally, I'm also delighted to announce that for the fourth consecutive year E*TRADE Corporate Services was rated #1 in customer satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five with an impressive 92% satisfaction rating. 
With respect to our progress on the capital front, this quarter witnessed a major accomplishment with the elimination of our long-standing legacy wholesale funding obligations, a noncore component of our balance sheets that had long been in a slow runoff. To give you some context, from 2005 to 2008, with a very different balance sheet strategy in place, the company committed to future funding on the form of advances and repurchase agreements. The manner in which these funding was structured made it less valuable in the event of a downward shift in either rates or balance sheet size.
The unprecedented low rate environment, coupled with our own deleveraging, made this funding source quite burdensome in terms of its high effective cost and its occupation of balance sheet capacity and valuable capital. The relatively meaningful cost of terminating this funding were a gaining factored. However, as we continue to naturally reduce in size, and as we generate healthy levels of capital, we got to a place where we were able to absorb the acceleration of these charges. In doing so, we immediately reduced our funding cost, transforming to a balance sheet funded predominantly by core strategically important customer deposits and providing capacity to on board more of these deposits, powerfully improving our earnings potential.
More broadly in our capital and financial plan, we have accomplished a lot. And the fruits of our labors have included a more efficient organization structure, greater capital flexibility, as well as improved regulatory standing and credit ratings. Since we first amended the capital plan in 2012, we distributed more than $1.3 billion of capital to the parent and completed 2 major initiatives, debt reduction, and wholesale funding elimination. We've collectively improved our earnings power by close to $190 million annually.
Today, we remain just as diligent about effectively deploying capital and as we progress down the list of available options, it naturally becomes shorter and more focused. To walk through what remains, starting with balance sheet growth, we are now targeting a balance sheet size just shy of $50 billion and we intend to reach that early next year.
With the flexibility provided by our new suite deposit platform, running within $500 million of that target is a highly achievable goal. The return here are attractive and Mr. Pizzi will run through our status on this initiative. Also on the list is returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends. While this has long been considered the recent upgrade of our debt to investment grade, there's some constraints around absolute quantum. While the value of deploying capital in this manner is definite, we must weigh it against options that can benefit the longer term value of the franchise or provide strategic energy via inorganic growth.
Acquisition was excluded from our narrative for many years as we focused on improving our capital levels and regulatory standing. And today, we are paying appropriate attention to the external opportunities to bolster our market position without getting distracted by [indiscernible].
Regarding deployment of our owner's capital, management and our board carefully filter all opportunities, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders, and our regulatory standing at the forefront of any decisions. And while nothing is imminent, I wanted to update our shareholders on our capital approach as progress across multiple dimensions has delivered us to a place where each rate can ship firmly to its front foot regarding growth and value creation.
To sum it up, we made a lot of progress and we are keenly aware of all the work it took to get where we are. Our mandate is to maintain and build upon this position.
Lastly, this bitter sweet can be announced by our President, Navtej Nandra, who will be departing the company at the end of the year, having completed his mission as my lead changer. When I arrived at E*TRADE in 2013 with sight set on getting our house in order, I newly needed to leverage a persistent and meticulous leader who could intensively focus on our structure and execution, better aligning our capabilities and platforms, ensuring up our resources and processes. I'll be the first to admit that these are some bold ambitions, which often require a powerful microscope and unrelenting resolve. Mr. Nandra was uniquely qualified to lead the work and help instill a culture of excellence from top to bottom.
Making changes of this nature surely do not happen overnight, with help, the vast majority of this work has now been accomplished. Whether we reenergize a more productive E*TRADE in our reality, [indiscernible] now is the right time to flatten our leadership structure. Above all, the company of E*TRADE size is the prudent thing for us to do for our shareholders. Indeed, I will miss his leadership and insight, but I'm certain that contribution will have a positive and lasting impact on E*TRADE for years to come.
And now, with that, I will hand the call over to our percipient CFO, Mr. Pizzi"

To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a one-time event and then move to our results.The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4",1448,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik. To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a one-time event and then move to our results.
The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4 billion of legacy funding obligations, reduced our net income by $251 million or $0.86 per share. On a pretax basis, the $413 million charge consisted of 2 parts. First, a $370 million loss included in net revenues, and second, $43 million of early extinguishment of debt. Now on to our core results.
Excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction, we reported adjusted earnings of $98 million or $0.33 per share. That compares to adjusted $72 million or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $220 million tax benefit. It also compares to $86 million or $0.29 per share in the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted revenues were $443 million, consistent with $445 million in the prior quarter and $440 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest income of $263 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter, as a $2 billion decrease in average assets offset the 8 basis point improvement to spread mostly attributable to the wholesale elimination.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $170 million, up 2% from both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, largely due to the increase in total trading activity related to both periods.
Average commission for trade [ph] of $10.87 declined $0.09 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year-ago. The changes from both comparable periods were primarily driven by pure stock plan trades. Fees and service charges revenue of $52 million decreased $3 million sequentially.
Adjusted debt gains on securities were $10 million, in line with the prior quarter and at the high end of our $5 million to $10 million range as we actively were selling securities in connection with our wholesale funding termination. Going forward, there is no change to our expected range with the current rate environment likely to keep us near the high end.
Operating expenses were $293 million, down from $309 million in the prior quarter, which included $6 million of severance and $9 million related to a contract amendment. Excluding severance in Q2, compensation increased $11 million sequentially related to [indiscernible] incentive compensation performance thresholds.
FDIC declined 4 million sequentially, reflecting the full quarter impact of our reduced assessment rate that went into effect in mid-Q2. With the balance sheet of just under $50 billion, $7 million is a good quarterly run rate for this line.
And lastly, communication expense increased $5 million sequentially, which included approximately $3 million of one-time vendor expense.
As for expenses going forward, we expect Q4 to be around $305 million, including severance, putting our full-year right around a 5% increase over 2014 in line with our original guidance.
Advertising, in particular, should increase meaningfully in Q4 consistent with our normal seasonal patterns. One last slide of the P&L, adjusted early extinguishment of debt was a $4 million gain, which related to the repurchase of 14 million of trust preferred with a discount. We now have 414 million outstanding of which 25% of the total balance is included in Tier 1 capital at the parent through year-end. While the remainder is not incredibly high on our list for capital deployment, given their long-term duration and relatively low cost funding cost, we closely monitor their market for any prudent opportunities to buy them in.
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the quarter at $5.3 billion, down $370 million or 7%. In addition to the fast pace of portfolio runoff, loan delinquency and net charge-offs continue to trend positively. A significant volume, 173 million of HELOCs, reached their end of draw and converged to amortizing loans this quarter. However, we only have first payment data from around 25% of those loans as many converted later in the quarter. To date, loan delinquency and losses related to interest only HELOC borrowers converged to amortizing payments has been better than expected.
As a result of positive trends in our portfolio, we reduced the allowance to 376 million or 7.1% of total loans at the end of Q3.
The lower ending reserve balance, combined with only 1 million in net charge-offs, resulted in a 25 million provision benefit for the quarter.
A few factors contributed to the lower level of net charge-offs and reduced reserve balance. First, the pace of portfolio runoff is reducing our future loss forecast and the related reserves. Specifically, the early payoff on balloon loans prior to maturity is a prominent contributor to the lower allowance. Second, we continue to benefit from the steady level of recoveries for collection efforts and the recapture pyrite as upon paydown. Third, over the course of the past couple of years, we have identified subsets of high risk loans within our portfolio where we reserve the full life loss expectation. The performance of many of these loans has exceeded our original expectations.
While we are pleased with the performance to date, we will obtain more meaningful data during Q4. While results have been better than expected, it is still too early to make changes to our estimates for future performance. At the moment, however, with strong recoveries, we expect Q4 as well as full year 2016 provision expense to be near 0. Building at this can vary meaningfully for a number of reasons.
Moving on to capital. Following the successful extraction of our clearing broker from the bank on July 1st, we spent the first 2 months of Q3 focused on ensuring our capital and liquidity position was strong. Once satisfied in early September, management and the board agreed the bank was in position to execute on the termination of wholesale funding obligations.
Now diving a bit deeper into the details. With the cost of approximately 330 basis points, well above our blended yield on assets, and considering [indiscernible] 1 basis point customer deposits that could be on the balance sheet, the decision to eliminate this funding was clear from a value creation standpoint. We just needed sufficient excess capital in the bank entity to absorb the upfront charge while maintaining our targeted 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, accordingly, we demonstrated what -- we downstream $110 million of parent capital offsetting the $114 million dividend we completed earlier in the quarter and reduced our balance sheet size.
Given that regulatory calculations for bank capital are based on average assets, we wouldn't capture the full benefit of the latter action until Q4. Accordingly, we started Q4 with approximately 100 basis points of excess capital, resulting from starting the peer group lower average assets. We fully intend to utilize the capital and balance sheet capacity and have begun the process of moving customer deposits from third parties back on our balance sheet. Since quarter end, we have moved $1.25 billion.
We intend to onboard an additional $2 billion of deposits by the end of this quarter. By early next year, we expect our consolidated balance sheet size to reach our targeted $49.5 billion, giving us an appropriate buffer to the daunting city threshold. For clarity, the target is for our consolidated balance sheet size and interest-earning assets currently run about $4 billion lower as they do not include goodwill, intangible assets, PPNE and the DTI, among other items.
Returning to the impact this had on our metrics. Spread was 258 basis points for the quarter and would have been approximately 245 basis points pro forma for the wholesale elimination. For Q4, if we hold today's rate environment constant and consider the current level of margin balances, we would expect spread to be in the high 270 basis point range on average interest-earning assets of $40 billion.
Lastly, with respect to corporate cash. We ended the quarter at $432 million, an increase of $26 million largely attributable to the $30 million dividend from E*TRADE securities. We also have some movement of capital between the bank and parent during the quarter. We [indiscernible] Q2 net income of $114 million up to the parent, but then subsequently downstream-ed $110 million of capital to the bank in conjunction with the wholesale termination. As a reminder, we will not request a dividend from the bank to the parent in Q4 as the bank reported a Q3 net loss of $186 million. We will resume quarterly dividend request in Q1 of 2016.
So in summary, we remain well positioned from a capital standpoint and are committed to continue putting that capital to work for our shareholders. And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

The second would be to add things more broadly in the retirement of investment and savings this, the robust pace, and he things to help our E*TRADE Pro services provide a greater level of product and services and so that's a bit of a little more of a multicolored opportunity, if you will. And then the third would be in banking space, in order to do a better job of monetizing the value our customer deposits and to more broadly serve the wealth segment that we currently serve for brokerage.

Beyond",1886,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter was busy with customer engagement demonstrating a bimodal distribution, high engagement during the market turmoil, bracketed by a more muted trading activity in the rest of the quarter. Beyond this, we took yet another confident step on the capital front, the termination of legacy wholesale funding, which will significantly enhance forward earnings power, but came with onetime charges. Excluding those, we posted net income of $98 million or $0.33 per share. Our results also reflected better-than-expected credit trends and performance as we reached an inflection point in the loan portfolio, releasing reserves for the first time since the portfolio transitioned to runoff more than 8 years ago.
During the quarter, we continued to enhance our brokerage products and services, boosting capabilities on our professional trading and mobile platforms. We continue to tighten our focus, making the choice to discontinue the last of our international local operations, and exit a pair of ancillary products. Both of these actions continue to reflect our dislike of asymmetric risks. We've also further sharpened our pencils on capital deployment, and in the wake of several felicitous steps made to date, we will share an update to our thinking on future uses later in this call.
Also, in early August, we were upgraded a rare 3 notches to investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's. We are obviously pleased that our corporate ratings are beginning to reflect the progress we've made and where we are as a company.
As for our metrics, we reported 156,000 DARTs, up 4% from Q2, as an inter-quarter spike in volatility propelled customer trading during typically slow period. Amidst the volatility and buy-ins of August 24, we processed a full day's worth of activity in the first hour of trading and posted an all-time record with 394,000 trades on the day. The ability to handle flow of this magnitude is a true testament to the work we've completed over the past couple of years to strengthen our foundation, including a hearty bolstering of our tech and operations infrastructure.
Options as a percentage of total DARTs held steady at 23%, a level relatively consistent with the past couple of years. And trades through our mobile applications represented a record 15% of total trading activity, having doubled over the past 2.5 years. Over one quarter of our unique logins came through this channel. We, again, enhanced our capabilities on this front as we aim to deliver an experience that rivals the best of digital, be it desktop, tablets, smartphone or smart watch. And finally, on trading, October DARTs are tracking relatively flat with September.
Margin balances ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, down only 2% from Q2 despite a more substantial decline in the equity markets. However, we've seen a slight pullback in Q4 to date with balances currently at $7.5 billion. Excluding the impact of discontinuing our global trading platform, we added 19,000 net new brokerage accounts during the period. Adjusted attrition for the quarter was 9.3%. Net new brokerage assets were $2.1 billion during the quarter, down slightly from the year-ago period, but more than double the prior quarter.
As we think about E*TRADE's growth, we continually refine our focus. Last quarter, we made the decision to sunset our global trading platform, which is nearly complete. This quarter, we made the decision to wind down our brokerage operations in Hong Kong and Singapore in consideration of a level of requisite investment to maintain a competitive platform while continuing to meet the prudential standards of both local and U.S. regulators. The opportunity simply didn't justify the demand on resources. We are in the early stages of this process and are determining which, if any, of the accounts will continue to service from the U.S. Our business in Hong Kong and Singapore comprises approximately 25,000 accounts with assets of around $1.8 billion.
Also, this quarter, we discontinued our FX offering as it was not core to our product suite. We previously facilitated customer FX activity through a third-party broker, which linked to our platform for account visibility only. The only true change for customers resulting from our delinking these accounts is that their FX transactions and account information will no longer be visible through our platform. There is no impact to our account metrics resulting from this change.
To dial in more closely on our products and services, being a best-in-class digitally centered broker means continuing to raise the bar when it comes to the customer experience on our various platforms. To that end, I am pleased to review some of the key improvements made this quarter. We continue to expand the capabilities of our active trader platform E*TRADE Pro this quarter, making a series of significant enhancements to our options analyzer. Beyond the new streamlined design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple options strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features more easily, and seamlessly send any strategy directly to trade execution.
We also added capabilities to our industry-leading mobile applications, including capitalizing a new Apple Watch functionality. Moreover, we launched conditional orders and rolling options for our core smartphone apps.
For the more long-term investors, we made strides in enhancing our tablet functionality, particularly around mutual fund transactions. This is of particular note as the importance of mobile investing continues to expand beyond the realm of the active trader. It has become an increasingly critical channel for all investor types.
When it comes to accolades, which I'm never reluctant to trumpet during these calls, we have a few to report. First, we won Best Overall IRA Provider and Best IRA For Beginners by NerdWallet in their summer 2015 review. We were the only broker to win in 2 categories. Next, NerdWallet recently rated our mobile platform 5 out of 5 stars, highlighting our data and research functionality, web-level capabilities, easy trade execution and availability on many devices as reasons why we are best-in-class.
Finally, I'm also delighted to announce that for the fourth consecutive year, E*TRADE Corporate Services was rated #1 in customer satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five with an impressive 92% satisfaction rating. 
With respect to our progress on the capital front, this quarter witnessed a major accomplishment with the elimination of our long-standing legacy wholesale funding obligations, a non-core component of our balance sheet that had long been in a slow runoff. To give you some context, from 2005 to 2008, with a very different balance sheet strategy in place, the company committed to future funding in the form of web advances and repurchase agreements. The manner in which this funding was structured made it less valuable in the event of a downward shift in either rates or balance sheet size.
The unprecedented low rate environment, coupled with our own deleveraging, made this funding source quite burdensome in terms of its high effective costs and its occupation of balance sheet capacity and valuable capital. The relatively meaningful cost of terminating this funding were a gaining factor. However, as we continue to naturally reduce in size, and as we generated healthy levels of capital, we got to a place where we were able to absorb the acceleration of these charges. In doing so, we immediately reduced our funding costs, transforming to a balance sheet funded predominantly by core strategically important customer deposits and providing capacity to on board more of these valued deposits, powerfully improving our earnings potential.
More broadly in our capital and financial plan. We've accomplished a lot. And the fruits of our labors have included a more efficient organizational structure, greater capital flexibility as well as improved regulatory standing and credit ratings. Since we first amended the capital plan in 2012, we've distributed more than $1.3 billion of capital to the parent and completed 2 major initiatives: debt reduction and wholesale funding elimination. We've collectively improved our earnings power by close to $190 million annually.
Today, we remain just as diligent about effectively deploying capital. And as we progress down the list of available options, it naturally becomes shorter and more focused. 
To walk through what remains, starting with balance sheet growth. We are now targeting a balance sheet size just shy of $50 billion, and we intend to reach that early next year.
With the flexibility provided by our new suite deposit platform, running within $500 million of that target is a highly achievable goal. The return here are attractive, and Mr. Pizzi will run through our status on this initiative. 
Also, on the list, is returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends. While this has long been considered, the recent upgrade of our debt to investment grade, there's some constraints around absolute quantum. While the value of deploying capital in this manner is definite, we must weigh it against options that can benefit the longer-term value of the franchise or provide strategic energy via inorganic growth.
Acquisition was excluded from our narrative for many years as we focused on improving our capital levels and regulatory standing. And today, we are paying appropriate attention to the external opportunities to bolster our market position without getting distracted by great shiny objects.
Regarding deployment of our owner's capital, management and our board carefully filter all opportunities, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders, and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions. And while nothing is imminent, I wanted to update our shareholders on our capital approach as progress across multiple dimensions has delivered us to a place where each rate can ship firmly to its front foot regarding growth and value creation.
To sum it up, we made a lot of progress and we are keenly aware of all the work it took to get where we are. Our mandate is to [indiscernible] maintain and build upon this position.
Lastly, it is bittersweet for me to announce that our President, Navtej Nandra, will be departing the company at the end of the year, having completed his mission as my lead change agent. When I arrived at E*TRADE in 2013 with sight set on getting our house in order, I knew we needed to leverage a persistent and meticulous leader who could intensively focus on our structure and execution, better aligning our capabilities and platforms and shoring up our resources and processes. I'll be the first to admit that these are some bold ambitions, which often required a powerful microscope and unrelenting resolve. Mr. Nandra was uniquely qualified to lead the work and help instill a culture of excellence from top to bottom.
Making changes of this nature surely do not happen overnight. With Navtej's help, the vast majority of this work has now been accomplished. With your reenergized and more productive E*TRADE now a reality, Navtej and I agree that now is the right time to flatten our leadership structure. Above all, for a company of E*TRADE's size is the prudent thing for us to do for our shareholders. Indeed, I will miss his leadership and insight, but I am certain that Navtej's contributions will have a positive and lasting impact on E*TRADE for years to come.
And now with that, I will hand the call over to our percipient CFO, Mr. Pizzi"

To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a onetime event, and then move to our results.The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4",1454,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik. To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a onetime event, and then move to our results.
The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4 billion of legacy funding obligations, reduced our net income by $251 million or $0.86 per share. On a pretax basis, the $413 million charge consisted of 2 parts: first, a $370 million loss included in net revenues; and second, $43 million of early extinguishment of debt. Now on to our core results.
Excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction, we reported adjusted earnings of $98 million or $0.33 per share. That compares to adjusted $72 million or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $220 million tax benefit. It also compares to $86 million or $0.29 per share in the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted revenues were $443 million, consistent with $445 million in the prior quarter and $440 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest income of $263 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter, as a $2 billion decrease in average assets offset the 8 basis point improvement to spread mostly attributable to the wholesale elimination.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $170 million, up 2% from both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, largely due to the increase in total trading activity related to both periods.
Average commission per trade of $10.87 declined $0.09 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year-ago. The changes from both comparable periods were primarily driven by pure stock plan trades. Fees and service charges revenue of $52 million decreased $3 million sequentially.
Adjusted debt gains on securities were $10 million, in line with the prior quarter and at the high end of our $5 million to $10 million range as we actively were selling securities in connection with our wholesale funding termination. Going forward, there is no change to our expected range with the current rate environment likely to keep us near the high end.
Operating expenses were $293 million, down from $309 million in the prior quarter, which included $6 million of severance and $9 million related to a contract amendment. Excluding severance in Q2, compensation increased $11 million sequentially related to hitting some incentive compensation performance thresholds.
FDIC declined 4 million sequentially, reflecting the full quarter impact of our reduced assessment rate that went into effect in mid-Q2. With the balance sheet of just under $50 billion, $7 million is a good quarterly run rate for this line.
And lastly, communications expense increased $5 million sequentially, which included approximately $3 million of onetime vendor expense.
As for expenses going forward, we expect Q4 to be around $305 million, including severance, putting our full year right around a 5% increase over 2014, in line with our original guidance.
Advertising, in particular, should increase meaningfully in Q4, consistent with our normal seasonal patterns. 
One last line of the P&L. Adjusted early extinguishment of debt was a $4 million gain, which related to the repurchase of 14 million of trust preferred at a discount. We now have 414 million outstanding, of which 25% of the total balance is included in Tier 1 capital at the parent through year-end. While the remainder is not incredibly high on our list for capital deployment, given their long-term duration and relatively low cost funding costs, we closely monitor their market for any prudent opportunities to buy them in.
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the quarter at $5.3 billion, down $370 million or 7%. In addition to the fast pace of portfolio runoff, loan delinquency and net charge-offs continued to trend positively. A significant volume, 173 million of HELOCs, reached their end of draw and converged to amortizing loans this quarter. However, we only have first payment data from around 25% of those loans as many converted later in the quarter. To date, loan delinquency and losses related to interest-only HELOC borrowers converted to amortizing payments has been better than expected.
As a result of positive trends in our portfolio, we reduced the allowance to $376 million or 7.1% of total loans at the end of Q3.
The lower ending reserve balance, combined with only $1 million in net charge-offs, resulted in a $25 million provision benefit for the quarter.
A few factors contributed to the lower level of net charge-offs and reduced reserve balance. First, the pace of portfolio runoff is reducing our future loss forecast and the related reserves. Specifically, the early payoff on balloon loans prior to maturity is a prominent contributor to the lower allowance. Second, we continue to benefit from a steady level of recoveries through collection efforts and the recapture of prior write downs upon paydown. Third, over the course of the past couple of years, we identified subsets of high-risk loans within our portfolio where we reserved the full life loss expectation. The performance of many of these loans has exceeded our original expectations.
While we are pleased with the performance to date, we will obtain more meaningful data during Q4. While results have been better than expected, it is still too early to make changes to our estimates for future performance. At the moment, however, with strong recoveries, we expect Q4, as well as full year 2016 provision expense, to be near 0, noting that this can vary meaningfully for a number of reasons.
Moving on to capital. Following the successful extraction of our clearing broker from the bank on July 1, we spent the first 2 months of Q3 focused on ensuring our capital and liquidity position was strong. Once satisfied in early September, management and the board agreed the bank was in position to execute on the termination of wholesale funding obligations.
Now diving a bit deeper into the details. With the cost of approximately 330 basis points, well above our blended yield on assets, and considered it -- considering it displaced 1 basis point customer deposits that could be on the balance sheet, the decision to eliminate this funding was clear from the value creation standpoint. We just needed sufficient excess capital in the bank entity to absorb the upfront charge while maintaining our targeted 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Accordingly, we demonstrated what -- we downstreamed $110 million of parent capital, offsetting the $114 million dividend we completed earlier in the quarter and reduced our balance sheet size.
Given that regulatory calculations for bank capital are based on average assets, we wouldn't capture the full benefit of the latter action until Q4. Accordingly, we started Q4 with approximately 100 basis points of excess capital, resulting from starting the period with lower average assets. We fully intend to utilize the capital and balance sheet capacity and have begun the process of moving customer deposits from third parties back on our balance sheet. Since quarter end, we have moved $1.25 billion.
We intend to onboard an additional $2 billion of deposits by the end of this quarter. By early next year, we expect our consolidated balance sheet size to reach our targeted $49.5 billion, giving us an appropriate buffer to the daunting CP [ph] threshold. For clarity, the target is for our consolidated balance sheet size, and interest-earning assets currently run about $4 billion lower as they do not include goodwill, intangible assets, PP&E, and the DTA, among other items.
Returning to the impact this had on our metrics. Spread was 258 basis points for the quarter and would have been approximately 245 basis points pro forma for the wholesale elimination. For Q4, if we hold today's rate environment constant and consider the current level of margin balances, we would expect spread to be in the high 270 basis point range on average interest-earning assets of $40 billion.
Lastly, with respect to corporate cash. We ended the quarter at $432 million, an increase of $26 million largely attributable to the $30 million dividend from E*TRADE securities. We also had some movement of capital between the bank and parent during the quarter. We dividended [ph] Q2 net income of $114 million up to the parent, but then subsequently downstreamed $110 million of capital to the bank in conjunction with the wholesale termination. As a reminder, we will not request a dividend from the bank to the parent in Q4 as the bank reported a Q3 net loss of $186 million. We will resume quarterly dividend requests in Q1 of 2016.
So in summary, we remain well positioned from a capital standpoint and are committed to continue putting that capital to work for our shareholders. 
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

So I'd say it falls across 3 broad, 3 generic categories. The first would be finding ways to add capacity in the brokerage space because of the value of scale in that part of our business, and quite frankly, they've very attractive operating leverage. The second would be to add things more broadly in terms of retirement investing in savings space, the robo space, adding things to help our E*TRADE Corporate Services business provide a greater level of products and services. And so that's a bit of a little more of a multicolored opportunity, if you will. And then the third would be in banking space in order to do a better job of monetizing the value our customer deposits and to more broadly serve the wealth segment that we currently serve through brokerage.

Meaning, I know you want to keep all your options open, but is there a certain level where cash kind of continues to creep higher where you say there is -- it's attractive enough to do buybacks at that point in time versus continuing to kind of navigate or scan the industry for growth areas?"

Beyond",1885,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter was busy with customer engagement demonstrating a bimodal distribution, high engagement during the market turmoil, bracketed by a more muted trading activity in the rest of the quarter. Beyond this, we took yet another confident step on the capital front, the termination of legacy wholesale funding, which will significantly enhance forward earnings power, but came with onetime charges. Excluding those, we posted net income of $98 million or $0.33 per share. Our results also reflected better-than-expected credit trends and performance as we reached an inflection point in the loan portfolio, releasing reserves for the first time since the portfolio transitioned to runoff more than 8 years ago.
During the quarter, we continued to enhance our brokerage products and services, boosting capabilities on our professional trading and mobile platforms. We continue to tighten our focus, making the choice to discontinue the last of our international local operations, and exit a pair of ancillary products. Both of these actions continue to reflect our dislike of asymmetric risks. We've also further sharpened our pencils on capital deployment, and in the wake of several felicitous steps made to date, we will share an update to our thinking on future uses later in this call.
Also, in early August, we were upgraded a rare 3 notches to investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's. We are obviously pleased that our corporate ratings are beginning to reflect the progress we've made and where we are as a company.
As for our metrics, we reported 156,000 DARTs, up 4% from Q2, as an inter-quarter spike in volatility propelled customer trading during typically slow period. Amidst the volatility and buy-ins of August 24, we processed a full day's worth of activity in the first hour of trading and posted an all-time record with 394,000 trades on the day. The ability to handle flow of this magnitude is a true testament to the work we've completed over the past couple of years to strengthen our foundation, including a hearty bolstering of our tech and operations infrastructure.
Options as a percentage of total DARTs held steady at 23%, a level relatively consistent with the past couple of years. And trades through our mobile applications represented a record 15% of total trading activity, having doubled over the past 2.5 years. Over one quarter of our unique logins came through this channel. We, again, enhanced our capabilities on this front as we aim to deliver an experience that rivals the best of digital, be it desktop, tablets, smartphone or smart watch. And finally, on trading, October DARTs are tracking relatively flat with September.
Margin balances ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, down only 2% from Q2 despite a more substantial decline in the equity markets. However, we've seen a slight pullback in Q4 to date with balances currently at $7.5 billion. Excluding the impact of discontinuing our global trading platform, we added 19,000 net new brokerage accounts during the period. Adjusted attrition for the quarter was 9.3%. Net new brokerage assets were $2.1 billion during the quarter, down slightly from the year-ago period, but more than double the prior quarter.
As we think about E*TRADE's growth, we continually refine our focus. Last quarter, we made the decision to sunset our global trading platform, which is nearly complete. This quarter, we made the decision to wind down our brokerage operations in Hong Kong and Singapore in consideration of a level of requisite investment to maintain a competitive platform while continuing to meet the prudential standards of both local and U.S. regulators. The opportunity simply didn't justify the demand on resources. We are in the early stages of this process and are determining which, if any, of the accounts we'll continue to service from the U.S. Our business in Hong Kong and Singapore comprises approximately 25,000 accounts with assets of around $1.8 billion.
Also, this quarter, we discontinued our FX offering as it was not core to our product suite. We previously facilitated customer FX activity through a third-party broker, which linked to our platform for account visibility only. The only true change for customers resulting from our delinking these accounts is that their FX transactions and account information will no longer be visible through our platform. There is no impact to our account metrics resulting from this change.
To dial in more closely on our products and services, being a best-in-class digitally centered broker means continuing to raise the bar when it comes to the customer experience on our various platforms. To that end, I am pleased to review some of the key improvements made this quarter. We continue to expand the capabilities of our active trader platform E*TRADE Pro this quarter, making a series of significant enhancements to our options analyzer. Beyond the new streamlined design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple options strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features more easily, and seamlessly send any strategy directly to trade execution.
We also added capabilities to our industry-leading mobile applications, including capitalizing a new Apple Watch functionality. Moreover, we launched conditional orders and rolling options for our core smartphone apps.
For the more long-term investors, we made strides in enhancing our tablet functionality, particularly around mutual fund transactions. This is of particular note as the importance of mobile investing continues to expand beyond the realm of the active trader. It has become an increasingly critical channel for all investor types.
When it comes to accolades, which I'm never reluctant to trumpet during these calls, we have a few to report. First, we won Best Overall IRA Provider and Best IRA For Beginners by NerdWallet in their summer 2015 review. We were the only broker to win in 2 categories. Next, NerdWallet recently rated our mobile platform 5 out of 5 stars, highlighting our data and research functionality, web-level capabilities, easy trade execution and availability on many devices as reasons why we are best-in-class.
Finally, I'm also delighted to announce that for the fourth consecutive year, E*TRADE Corporate Services was rated #1 in customer satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five with an impressive 92% satisfaction rating. 
With respect to our progress on the capital front, this quarter witnessed a major accomplishment with the elimination of our long-standing legacy wholesale funding obligations, a non-core component of our balance sheet that had long been in a slow runoff. To give you some context, from 2005 to 2008, with a very different balance sheet strategy in place, the company committed to future funding in the form of web advances and repurchase agreements. The manner in which this funding was structured made it less valuable in the event of a downward shift in either rates or balance sheet size.
The unprecedented low rate environment, coupled with our own deleveraging, made this funding source quite burdensome in terms of its high effective costs and its occupation of balance sheet capacity and valuable capital. The relatively meaningful cost of terminating this funding were a gating factor. However, as it continued to naturally reduce in size, and as we generated healthy levels of capital, we got to a place where we were able to absorb the acceleration of these charges. In doing so, we immediately reduced our funding costs, transforming to a balance sheet funded predominantly by core strategically important customer deposits and providing capacity to on board more of these valued deposits, powerfully improving our earnings potential.
More broadly in our capital and financial plan. We've accomplished a lot. And the fruits of our labors have included a more efficient organizational structure, greater capital flexibility as well as improved regulatory standing and credit ratings. Since we first amended the capital plan in 2012, we've distributed more than $1.3 billion of capital to the parent and completed 2 major initiatives: debt reduction and wholesale funding elimination. We've collectively improved our earnings power by close to $190 million annually.
Today, we remain just as diligent about effectively deploying capital. And as we progress down the list of available options, it naturally becomes shorter and more focused. 
To walk through what remains, starting with balance sheet growth. We are now targeting a balance sheet size just shy of $50 billion, and we intend to reach that early next year.
With the flexibility provided by our new suite deposit platform, running within $500 million of that target is a highly achievable goal. The return here are attractive, and Mr. Pizzi will run through our status on this initiative. 
Also, on the list, is returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends. While this has long been considered, the recent upgrade of our debt to investment grade, lift's some constraints around absolute quantum. While the value of deploying capital in this manner is definite, we must weigh it against options that can benefit the longer-term value of the franchise or provide strategic energy via inorganic growth.
Acquisition was excluded from our narrative for many years as we focused on improving our capital levels and regulatory standing. And today, we are paying appropriate attention to the external opportunities to bolster our market position without getting distracted by bright shiny objects.
Regarding deployment of our owner's capital, management and our board carefully filter all opportunities, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders, and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions. And while nothing is imminent, I wanted to update our shareholders on our capital approach as progress across multiple dimensions has delivered us to a place where E*TRADE can shift firmly to its front foot regarding growth and value creation.
To sum it up, we made a lot of progress and we are keenly aware of all the work it took to get where we are. Our mandate is to perspicaciously maintain and build upon this position.
Lastly, it is bittersweet for me to announce that our President, Navtej Nandra, will be departing the company at the end of the year, having completed his mission as my lead change agent. When I arrived at E*TRADE in 2013 with sights set on getting our house in order, I knew we needed to leverage a persistent and meticulous leader who could intensively focus on our structure and execution, better aligning our capabilities and platforms and shoring up our resources and processes. I'll be the first to admit that these were some bold ambitions, which often required a powerful microscope and unrelenting resolve. Mr. Nandra was uniquely qualified to lead the work and helped instill a culture of excellence from top to bottom.
Making changes of this nature certainly do not happen overnight. With Navtej's help, the vast majority of this work has now been accomplished. With your reenergized and more productive E*TRADE now a reality, Navtej and I agree that now is the right time to flatten our leadership structure. Above all, for a company of E*TRADE's size is the prudent thing for us to do for our shareholders. Indeed, I will miss his leadership and insight, but I am certain that Navtej's contributions will have a positive and lasting impact on E*TRADE for years to come.
And now with that, I will hand the call over to our percipient CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a onetime event, and then move to our results.The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4",1454,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik. To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a onetime event, and then move to our results.
The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4 billion of legacy funding obligations, reduced our net income by $251 million or $0.86 per share. On a pretax basis, the $413 million charge consisted of 2 parts: first, a $370 million loss included in net revenues; and second, $43 million of early extinguishment of debt. Now on to our core results.
Excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction, we reported adjusted earnings of $98 million or $0.33 per share. That compares to adjusted $72 million or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $220 million tax benefit. It also compares to $86 million or $0.29 per share in the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted revenues were $443 million, consistent with $445 million in the prior quarter and $440 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest income of $263 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter, as a $2 billion decrease in average assets offset the 8 basis point improvement to spread mostly attributable to the wholesale elimination.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $170 million, up 2% from both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, largely due to the increase in total trading activity related to both periods.
Average commission per trade of $10.87 declined $0.09 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year-ago. The changes from both comparable periods were primarily driven by fewer stock plan trades. Fees and service charges revenue of $52 million decreased $3 million sequentially.
Adjusted debt gains on securities were $10 million, in line with the prior quarter and at the high end of our $5 million to $10 million range as we actively were selling securities in connection with our wholesale funding termination. Going forward, there is no change to our expected range with the current rate environment likely to keep us near the high end.
Operating expenses were $293 million, down from $309 million in the prior quarter, which included $6 million of severance and $9 million related to a contract amendment. Excluding severance in Q2, compensation increased $11 million sequentially related to hitting some incentive compensation performance thresholds.
FDIC declined 4 million sequentially, reflecting the full quarter impact of our reduced assessment rate that went into effect in mid-Q2. With the balance sheet of just under $50 billion, $7 million is a good quarterly run rate for this line.
And lastly, communications expense increased $5 million sequentially, which included approximately $3 million of onetime vendor expense.
As for expenses going forward, we expect Q4 to be around $305 million, including severance, putting our full year right around a 5% increase over 2014, in line with our original guidance.
Advertising, in particular, should increase meaningfully in Q4, consistent with our normal seasonal patterns. 
One last line of the P&L. Adjusted early extinguishment of debt was a $4 million gain, which related to the repurchase of 14 million of trust preferreds at a discount. We now have 414 million outstanding, of which 25% of the total balance is included in Tier 1 capital at the parent through year-end. While the remainder is not incredibly high on our list for capital deployment, given their long-term duration and relatively low cost funding costs, we closely monitor their market for any prudent opportunities to buy them in.
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the quarter at $5.3 billion, down $370 million or 7%. In addition to the fast pace of the portfolio runoff, loan delinquency and net charge-offs continued to trend positively. A significant volume, 173 million of HELOCs, reached their end of draw and converged to amortizing loans this quarter. However, we only have first payment data from around 25% of those loans as many converted later in the quarter. To date, loan delinquency and losses related to interest-only HELOC borrowers converted to amortizing payments has been better than expected.
As a result of positive trends in our portfolio, we reduced the allowance to $376 million or 7.1% of total loans at the end of Q3.
The lower ending reserve balance, combined with only $1 million in net charge-offs, resulted in a $25 million provision benefit for the quarter.
A few factors contributed to the lower level of net charge-offs and reduced reserve balance. First, the pace of portfolio runoff is reducing our future loss forecast and the related reserves. Specifically, the early payoff on balloon loans prior to maturity is a prominent contributor to the lower allowance. Second, we continue to benefit from a steady level of recoveries through collection efforts and the recapture of prior write downs upon paydown. Third, over the course of the past couple of years, we identified subsets of high-risk loans within our portfolio where we reserved the full life loss expectation. The performance of many of these loans has exceeded our original expectations.
While we are pleased with the performance to date, we will obtain more meaningful data during Q4. While results have been better than expected, it is still too early to make changes to our estimates for future performance. At the moment, however, with strong recoveries, we expect Q4, as well as full year 2016 provision expense, to be near 0, noting that this can vary meaningfully for a number of reasons.
Moving on to capital. Following the successful extraction of our clearing broker from the bank on July 1, we spent the first 2 months of Q3 focused on ensuring our capital and liquidity position was strong. Once satisfied in early September, management and the board agreed the bank was in position to execute on the termination of wholesale funding obligations.
Now diving a bit deeper into the details. With the cost of approximately 330 basis points, well above our blended yield on assets, and considered it -- considering it displaced 1 basis point customer deposits that could be on the balance sheet, the decision to eliminate this funding was clear from the value creation standpoint. We just needed sufficient excess capital in the bank entity to absorb the upfront charge while maintaining our targeted 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Accordingly, we demonstrated what -- we downstreamed $110 million of parent capital, offsetting the $114 million dividend we completed earlier in the quarter and reduced our balance sheet size.
Given that regulatory calculations for bank capital are based on average assets, we wouldn't capture the full benefit of the latter action until Q4. Accordingly, we started Q4 with approximately 100 basis points of excess capital, resulting from starting the period with lower average assets. We fully intend to utilize the capital and balance sheet capacity and have begun the process of moving customer deposits from third parties back on our balance sheet. Since quarter end, we have moved $1.25 billion.
We intend to onboard an additional $2 billion of deposits by the end of this quarter. By early next year, we expect our consolidated balance sheet size to reach our targeted $49.5 billion, giving us an appropriate buffer to the daunting CP [ph] threshold. For clarity, the target is for our consolidated balance sheet size, and interest-earning assets currently run about $4 billion lower as they do not include goodwill, intangible assets, PP&E, and the DTA, among other items.
Returning to the impact this had on our metrics. Spread was 258 basis points for the quarter and would have been approximately 245 basis points pro forma for the wholesale elimination. For Q4, if we hold today's rate environment constant and consider the current level of margin balances, we would expect spread to be in the high 270 basis point range on average interest-earning assets of $40 billion.
Lastly, with respect to corporate cash. We ended the quarter at $432 million, an increase of $26 million largely attributable to the $30 million dividend from E*TRADE securities. We also had some movement of capital between the bank and parent during the quarter. We dividended Q2 net income of $114 million up to the parent, but then subsequently downstreamed $110 million of capital to the bank in conjunction with the wholesale termination. As a reminder, we will not request a dividend from the bank to the parent in Q4 as the bank reported a Q3 net loss of $186 million. We will resume quarterly dividend requests in Q1 of 2016.
So in summary, we remain well positioned from a capital standpoint and are committed to continue putting that capital to work for our shareholders. 
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

And as you know, they become fully -- they become payable in full on their balloon date. All of these factors combined, really, to put us in a position to reduce the allowance this quarter."

The first would be finding ways to add capacity in the brokerage space because of the value of scale in that part of our business, and quite frankly, they've very attractive operating leverage. The second would be to add things more broadly in terms of retirement investing in savings space, the robo space, adding things to help our E*TRADE Corporate Services business provide a greater level of products and services. And so that's a bit of a little more of a multicolored opportunity, if you will. And then the third would be in banking space in order to do a better job of monetizing the value our customer deposits and to more broadly serve the wealth segment that we currently serve through brokerage. So I hope that lays out the landscape, Rich. In terms of size, I don't have any view on size."

Beyond",1886,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter was busy with customer engagement demonstrating a bimodal distribution, high engagement during the market turmoil, bracketed by a more muted trading activity in the rest of the quarter. Beyond this, we took yet another confident step on the capital front, the termination of legacy wholesale funding, which will significantly enhance forward earnings power, but came with onetime charges. Excluding those, we posted net income of $98 million or $0.33 per share. Our results also reflected better-than-expected credit trends and performance as we reached an inflection point in the loan portfolio, releasing reserves for the first time since the portfolio transitioned to runoff more than 8 years ago.
During the quarter, we continued to enhance our brokerage products and services, boosting capabilities on our professional trading and mobile platforms. We continue to tighten our focus, making the choice to discontinue the last of our international local operations, and exit a pair of ancillary products. Both of these actions continue to reflect our dislike of asymmetric risks. We've also further sharpened our pencils on capital deployment, and in the wake of several felicitous steps made to date, we will share an update to our thinking on future uses later in this call.
Also, in early August, we were upgraded a rare 3 notches to investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's. We are obviously pleased that our corporate ratings are beginning to reflect the progress we've made and where we are as a company.
As for our metrics, we reported 156,000 DARTs, up 4% from Q2, as an intra-quarter spike in volatility propelled customer trading during a typically slow period. Amidst the volatility in volumes of August 24, we processed a full day's worth of activity in the first hour of trading and posted an all-time record with 394,000 trades on the day. The ability to handle flow of this magnitude is a true testament to the work we've completed over the past couple of years to strengthen our foundation, including a hearty bolstering of our tech and operations infrastructure.
Options as a percentage of total DARTs held steady at 23%, a level relatively consistent with the past couple of years. And trades through our mobile applications represented a record 15% of total trading activity, having doubled over the past 2.5 years. Over one quarter of our unique logins came through this channel. We, again, enhanced our capabilities on this front as we aim to deliver an experience that rivals the best of digital, be it desktop, tablets, smartphone or smart watch. And finally, on trading, October DARTs are tracking relatively flat with September.
Margin balances ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, down only 2% from Q2 despite a more substantial decline in the equity markets. However, we've seen a slight pullback in Q4 to date with balances currently at $7.5 billion. Excluding the impact of discontinuing our global trading platform, we added 19,000 net new brokerage accounts during the period. Adjusted attrition for the quarter was 9.3%. Net new brokerage assets were $2.1 billion during the quarter, down slightly from the year-ago period, but more than double the prior quarter.
As we think about E*TRADE's growth, we continually refine our focus. Last quarter, we made the decision to sunset our global trading platform, which is nearly complete. This quarter, we made the decision to wind down our brokerage operations in Hong Kong and Singapore in consideration of the level of requisite investment to maintain a competitive platform while continuing to meet the prudential standards of both local and U.S. regulators. The opportunity simply didn't justify the demand on resources. We are in the early stages of this process and are determining which, if any, of the accounts we'll continue to service from the U.S. Our business in Hong Kong and Singapore comprises approximately 25,000 accounts with assets of around $1.8 billion.
Also, this quarter, we discontinued our FX offering as it was not core to our product suite. We previously facilitated customer FX activity through a third-party broker, which linked to our platform for account visibility only. The only true change for customers resulting from our delinking these accounts is that their FX transactions and account information will no longer be visible through our platform. There is no impact to our account metrics resulting from this change.
To dial in more closely on our products and services, being a best-in-class digitally centered broker means continuing to raise the bar when it comes to the customer experience on our various platforms. To that end, I am pleased to review some of the key improvements made this quarter. We continue to expand the capabilities of our active trader platform E*TRADE Pro this quarter, making a series of significant enhancements to our options analyzer. Beyond the new streamlined design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple options strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features more easily, and seamlessly send any strategy directly to trade execution.
We also added capabilities to our industry-leading mobile applications, including capitalizing a new Apple Watch functionality. Moreover, we launched conditional orders and rolling options for our core smartphone apps.
For the more long-term investors, we made strides in enhancing our tablet functionality, particularly around mutual fund transactions. This is of particular note as the importance of mobile investing continues to extend beyond the realm of the active trader. It has become an increasingly critical channel for all investor types.
When it comes to accolades, which I'm never reluctant to trumpet during these calls, we have a few to report. First, we won Best Overall IRA Provider and Best IRA for Beginners by NerdWallet in their summer 2015 review. We were the only broker to win in 2 categories. Next, NerdWallet recently rated our mobile platform 5 out of 5 stars, highlighting our data and research functionality, web-level capabilities, easy trade execution and availability on many devices as reasons why we are best-in-class.
Finally, I'm also delighted to announce that for the fourth consecutive year, E*TRADE Corporate Services was rated #1 in customer satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five with an impressive 92% satisfaction rating. 
With respect to our progress on the capital front, this quarter witnessed a major accomplishment with the elimination of our long-standing legacy wholesale funding obligations, a non-core component of our balance sheet that had long been in a slow runoff. To give you some context, from 2005 to 2008, with a very different balance sheet strategy in place, the company committed to future funding in the form of club advances and repurchase agreements. The manner in which this funding was structured made it less valuable in the event of a downward shift in either rates or balance sheet size.
The unprecedented low rate environment, coupled with our own deleveraging, made this funding source quite burdensome in terms of its high effective costs and its occupation of balance sheet capacity and valuable capital. The relatively meaningful cost of terminating this funding were a gating factor. However, as it continued to naturally reduce in size, and as we generated healthy levels of capital, we got to a place where we were able to absorb the acceleration of these charges. In doing so, we immediately reduced our funding costs, transforming to a balance sheet funded predominantly by core strategically important customer deposits and providing capacity to on board more of these valued deposits, powerfully improving our earnings potential.
More broadly in our capital and financial plan. We've accomplished a lot. And the fruits of our labors have included a more efficient organizational structure, greater capital flexibility as well as improved regulatory standing and credit ratings. Since we first submitted the capital plan in 2012, we've distributed more than $1.3 billion of capital to the parent and completed 2 major initiatives: debt reduction and wholesale funding elimination, which collectively improved our earnings power by close to $190 million annually.
Today, we remain just as diligent about effectively deploying capital. And as we progress down the list of available options, it naturally becomes shorter and more focused. 
To walk through what remains, starting with balance sheet growth. We are now targeting a balance sheet size just shy of $50 billion, and we intend to reach that early next year.
With the flexibility provided by our new suite deposit platform, running within $500 million of that target is a highly achievable goal. The return here are attractive, and Mr. Pizzi will run through our status on this initiative. 
Also, on the list, is returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends. While this has long been considered, the recent upgrade of our debt to investment grade, there's some constraints around absolute quantum. While the value of deploying capital in this manner is definite, we must weigh it against options that can benefit the longer-term value of the franchise or provide strategic energy via inorganic growth.
Acquisition was excluded from our narrative for many years as we focused on improving our capital levels and regulatory standing. And today, we are paying appropriate attention to the external opportunities to bolster our market position without getting distracted by bright shiny objects.
Regarding deployment of our owner's capital, management and our board carefully filter all opportunities, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders, and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions. And while nothing is imminent, I wanted to update our shareholders on our capital approach as progress across multiple dimensions has delivered us to a place where E*TRADE can shift firmly to its front foot regarding growth and value creation.
To sum it up, we made a lot of progress and we are keenly aware of all the work it took to get where we are. Our mandate is to perspicaciously maintain and build upon this position.
Lastly, it is bittersweet for me to announce that our President, Navtej Nandra, will be departing the company at the end of the year, having completed his mission as my lead change agent. When I arrived at E*TRADE in 2013 with sights set on getting our house in order, I knew we needed to leverage a persistent and meticulous leader who could intensively focus on our structure and execution, better aligning our capabilities and platforms and shoring up our resources and processes. I'll be the first to admit that these were some bold ambitions, which often required a powerful microscope and unrelenting resolve. Mr. Nandra was uniquely qualified to lead the work and helped instill a culture of excellence from top to bottom.
Making changes of this nature certainly do not happen overnight. With Navtej's help, the vast majority of this work has now been accomplished. With the reenergized and more productive E*TRADE now a reality, Navtej and I agree that now is the right time to flatten our leadership structure. Above all, for a company of E*TRADE's size is the prudent thing for us to do for our shareholders. Indeed, I will miss his leadership and insight, but I am certain that Navtej's contributions will have a positive and lasting impact on E*TRADE for years to come.
And now with that, I will hand the call over to our percipient CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a onetime event, and then move to our results.The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4",1453,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik. To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a onetime event, and then move to our results.
The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4 billion of legacy funding obligations, reduced our net income by $251 million or $0.86 per share. On a pretax basis, the $413 million charge consisted of 2 parts: first, a $370 million loss included in net revenues; and second, $43 million of early extinguishment of debt. Now on to our core results.
Excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction, we reported adjusted earnings of $98 million or $0.33 per share. That compares to adjusted $72 million or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $220 million tax benefit. It also compares to $86 million or $0.29 per share in the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted revenues were $443 million, consistent with $445 million in the prior quarter and $440 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest income of $263 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter, as a $2 billion decrease in average assets offset the 8 basis point improvement to spread mostly attributable to the wholesale elimination.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $170 million, up 2% from both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, largely due to the increase in total trading activity related to both periods.
Average commission per trade of $10.87 declined $0.09 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year-ago. The changes from both comparable periods were primarily driven by fewer stock plan trades. Fees and service charges revenue of $52 million decreased $3 million sequentially.
Adjusted net gains on securities were $10 million, in line with the prior quarter and at the high end of our $5 million to $10 million range as we actively were selling securities in connection with our wholesale funding termination. Going forward, there is no change to our expected range with the current rate environment likely to keep us near the high end.
Operating expenses were $293 million, down from $309 million in the prior quarter, which included $6 million of severance and $9 million related to a contract amendment. Excluding severance in Q2, compensation increased $11 million sequentially related to hitting some incentive compensation performance thresholds.
FDIC declined 4 million sequentially, reflecting the full quarter impact of our reduced assessment rate that went into effect in mid-Q2. With the balance sheet of just under $50 billion, $7 million is a good quarterly run rate for this line.
And lastly, communications expense increased $5 million sequentially, which included approximately $3 million of onetime vendor expense.
As for expenses going forward, we expect Q4 to be around $305 million, including severance, putting our full year right around a 5% increase over 2014, in line with our original guidance.
Advertising, in particular, should increase meaningfully in Q4, consistent with our normal seasonal patterns. 
One last line of the P&L. Adjusted early extinguishment of debt was a $4 million gain, which related to the repurchase of 14 million of trust preferreds at a discount. We now have 414 million outstanding, of which 25% of the total balance is included in Tier 1 capital at the parent through year-end. While the remainder is not incredibly high on our list for capital deployment, given their long-term duration and relatively low cost funding costs, we closely monitor their market for any prudent opportunities to buy them in.
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the quarter at $5.3 billion, down $370 million or 7%. In addition to the fast pace of the portfolio runoff, loan delinquency and net charge-offs continued to trend positively. A significant volume, 173 million of HELOCs, reached their end of draw and converted to amortizing loans this quarter. However, we only have first payment data from around 25% of those loans as many converted later in the quarter. To date, loan delinquency and losses related to interest-only HELOC borrowers converted to amortizing payments has been better than expected.
As a result of positive trends in our portfolio, we reduced the allowance to $376 million or 7.1% of total loans at the end of Q3.
The lower ending reserve balance, combined with only $1 million in net charge-offs, resulted in a $25 million provision benefit for the quarter.
A few factors contributed to the lower level of net charge-offs and reduced reserve balance. First, the pace of portfolio runoff is reducing our future loss forecast and the related reserves. Specifically, the early payoff on balloon loans prior to maturity is a prominent contributor to the lower allowance. Second, we continue to benefit from a steady level of recoveries through collection efforts and the recapture of prior write downs upon paydown. Third, over the course of the past couple of years, we identified subsets of high-risk loans within our portfolio where we reserved the full life loss expectation. The performance of many of these loans has exceeded our original expectations.
While we are pleased with the performance to date, we will obtain more meaningful data during Q4. While results have been better than expected, it is still too early to make changes to our estimates for future performance. At the moment, however, with strong recoveries, we expect Q4, as well as full year 2016 provision expense, to be near 0, noting that this can vary meaningfully for a number of reasons.
Moving on to capital. Following the successful extraction of our clearing broker from the bank on July 1, we spent the first 2 months of Q3 focused on ensuring our capital and liquidity position was strong. Once satisfied in early September, management and the board agreed the bank was in position to execute on the termination of wholesale funding obligations.
Now diving a bit deeper into the details. With the cost of approximately 330 basis points, well above our blended yield on assets, and considered it -- considering it displaced 1 basis point customer deposits that could be on the balance sheet, the decision to eliminate this funding was clear from the value creation standpoint. We just needed sufficient excess capital in the bank entity to absorb the upfront charge while maintaining our targeted 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Accordingly, we demonstrated what -- we downstreamed $110 million of parent capital, offsetting the $114 million dividend we completed earlier in the quarter and reduced our balance sheet size.
Given that regulatory calculations for bank capital are based on average assets, we wouldn't capture the full benefit of the latter action until Q4. Accordingly, we started Q4 with approximately 100 basis points of excess capital, resulting from starting the period with lower average assets. We fully intend to utilize the capital and balance sheet capacity and have begun the process of moving customer deposits from third parties back on our balance sheet. Since quarter end, we have moved $1.25 billion.
We intend to onboard an additional $2 billion of deposits by the end of this quarter. By early next year, we expect our consolidated balance sheet size to reach our targeted $49.5 billion, giving us an appropriate buffer to the daunting SIFI threshold. For clarity, the target is for our consolidated balance sheet size, and interest-earning assets currently run about $4 billion lower as they do not include goodwill, intangible assets, PP&E, and the DTA, among other items.
Returning to the impact this had on our metrics. Spread was 258 basis points for the quarter and would have been approximately 245 basis points pro forma for the wholesale elimination. For Q4, if we hold today's rate environment constant and consider the current level of margin balances, we would expect spread to be in the high 270 basis point range on average interest-earning assets of $40 billion.
Lastly, with respect to corporate cash. We ended the quarter at $432 million, an increase of $26 million largely attributable to the $30 million dividend from E*TRADE securities. We also had some movement of capital between the bank and parent during the quarter. We dividended Q2 net income of $114 million up to the parent, but then subsequently downstreamed $110 million of capital to the bank in conjunction with the wholesale termination. As a reminder, we will not request a dividend from the bank to the parent in Q4 as the bank reported a Q3 net loss of $186 million. We will resume quarterly dividend requests in Q1 of 2016.
So in summary, we remain well positioned from a capital standpoint and are committed to continue putting that capital to work for our shareholders. 
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

In addition to that, we have seen the portfolio accelerating in prepayment speeds, so speeds faster than we had originally modeled. All of this creates a backdrop in which the risk in the portfolio is reducing. In addition to that, there is a segment of portfolio of balloon loans that we are continuing to see prepayment activity from as well. And as you know, they become fully -- they become payable in full on their balloon date. All of these factors combined, really, to put us in a position to reduce the allowance this quarter."

So I'd say it falls across 3 broad, 3 generic categories. The first would be finding ways to add capacity in the brokerage space because of the value of scale in that part of our business, and quite frankly, they've very attractive operating leverage. The second would be to add things more broadly than the retirement, investing and savings space, the robo space, adding things to help our E*TRADE Corporate Services business provide a greater level of products and services. And so that's a bit of a little more of a multicolored opportunity, if you will. And then the third would be in banking space in order to do a better job of monetizing the value our customer deposits and to more broadly serve the wealth segment that we currently serve through brokerage.
