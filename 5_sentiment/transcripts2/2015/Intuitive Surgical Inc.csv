At the outset, we focused on driving adoption",954,"Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2014 has been a year of transition for Intuitive with macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of the year giving way to improving performance as the year progressed. At the outset, we focused on driving adoption of our platform in general surgery in launching key new products and in increasing our organizational capability and performance in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan. The organization has responded well in the year with solid procedure performance and a strong launch of our newest-generation da Vinci platform. General surgery and international procedures have become the growth engine for the business [indiscernible] general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci outside of the United States and strength in neurology, offset by flat annual performance in gynecology. General surgery growth was approximately 33% for the year, comprised of strong growth in da Vinci Colorectal Surgery, hernia repair and in other general surgery procedures, offset by slowing da Vinci Single-Site use in cholecystectomy. While Single-Site cholecystectomy procedures were up 2014, they were down in the fourth quarter. Outside of the United States, procedure growth remained robust, rising approximately 20% over procedures in 2013 based on strength in Europe and Asia. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Looking at trends in capital sales for the year. Capital placements increased in sequential quarters, helped by the launch of da Vinci Xi in the second quarter of 2014. Outside of the United States, our capital business was solid with international system strength in Europe and Asia outside of Japan. System sales weakened in Japan over 2013 as customers wait for both Xi clearance and additional reimbursement. Sales elsewhere, particularly China, grew over 2013.
Our product launches were significant in 2014. In the second quarter, we launched our fourth-generation platform, the da Vinci Xi surgical system. We launched Xi United States in April followed by CE mark in June, availability in France, Austria and Switzerland in October and Korea in December. The Xi System enhances our prior-generation systems by improving multi-quadrant access to the body, introducing the ability to move the endoscope between robotic arms, increasing range of motion and reach with slimmer arms and enhancing ease-of-use and setup. Customer reception of the Xi has been strong with interest in use by multiple specialties, including colorectal surgeons, urologists, thoracic surgeons and gynecologic oncologists. Our systems are optimized for different positions by dozens of instruments and accessories. In 2014, we added to the initial set of instruments and accessories available for the Xi at launch by introducing the Xi Vessel Sealer in Q2, Xi Firefly in Q3 and Xi Stapler in Q1 of 2015. In 2015, we plan to submit a 510(k) for software that allows for coordinated table motion with the Xi and a 510(k) for an Xi-compatible version of our Single-Site instruments. This filling out of the Xi products will increase the applicability of the platform to institutions interested in owning a single da Vinci system.
Turning to instruments. We launched our Wristed Needle Driver estimate for use with Single-Site surgery in Q4 of 2014. Surgeons performing single-incision hysterectomy with da Vinci Single-Site are particularly interested in the Wristed Needle Driver, and initial uptake has been strong. Single-Site hysterectomy with Wristed Needle Driver is still in its early days, and projecting its long-term [indiscernible] stapler after we observed 3 intraoperative instrument failures. In each case, these procedures were completed successfully, minimally invasively. Our team has identified the root causes of failure and has recalled 5 [ph] stapler. As of this first quarter of 2015, the Si EndoWrist Stapler is back in production and first cases have been completed. Our Xi Stapler was also launched in the quarter with first cases completed this month.
Looking back at the full year 2014. Our operating performance was as follows: worldwide procedures grew approximately 9%. We shipped 431 surgical systems in the year, down from 546 in 2013. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, down 6% from 2013. Recurring revenue grew to $1.57 billion, up 5% and comprising 70% of total revenue. We generated $819 million in operating profit before noncash stock option expense, down 21% from last year. Pro forma net income was $607 million, down 24% from 2013. And we reduced our shares outstanding by repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $398 [ph] per share during 2014.
Turning to our operating performance in the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 10% over the fourth quarter last year. We sold 137 da Vinci Surgical Systems, down from 138 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total revenue for the quarter was $605 million, up 5% from prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $281 million, up 5%. We generated an operating profit of $237 million in the quarter before noncash stock compensation expense, down 8% from the fourth quarter last year and pro forma net income was $184 million, down 5% from Q4 of 2013.
In 2014, we made significant investments in organization, including growing our direct commercialization in Japan. We anticipate growing our organization in specific areas through 2015, with particular emphasis on Asia, Europe and in operations. Looking to 2015, our priorities are as follows: First, we will you focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, we'll work to complete our launch and new product introductions of da Vinci Xi in key markets globally. Third, we'll develop our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, we plan to build Xi-compatible da Vinci Sp prototypes and initiate customer valuations.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights."

quarter of 2015. We also began shipment of our Xi Stapler early this quarter. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure compared with $1,930 for both the fourth quarter 2013 and last quarter. The decrease from the prior year as well as the prior quarter reflects the timing of customer orders and the field action for our da Vinci Si stapler. Pro forma system revenue of $211 million increased 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 and increased 37% compared with the third quarter of 2014. The increase in systems revenue compared with the third quarter primarily reflects higher system sales in Europe and the U.S. 137 systems were placed in the third quarter, excluding 2 Xis traded for Sis under our trade-out program, compared with 138 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 111 systems last quarter. 97 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were Xis, compared with 59 in the third quarter and 50 in the second quarter. Globally, our system ASP of 1,550,000 increased relative to the ASP for the fourth quarter of last year of 1,460,000 [ph] and relative to last quarter of 1,450,000. The increase in ASPs relative to last year reflects product mix with the current quarter included a high mix of Xis and the fourth quarter of 2013 included a high mix of the Si-es. The increase in ASPs relative to the last quarter reflect the higher proportion of Xi systems, a higher proportion of Dual Console systems and a positive geographic mix.
Hospitals financed approximately 15% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 27% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which 5 were structured as operating leases. Through the fourth quarter of 2014, we have entered into 14 operating leases. In the U.S., we placed 71 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 72 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 61 systems in the third quarter of 2014. Outside the U.S., we sold 66 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 48 systems last quarter. Year-over-year, system placements reflect growth in Europe, 39 systems this quarter, compared with 28 systems last [indiscernible] a quarter-over-quarter system placement growth reflects higher system placements in Europe and other world markets. Fourth quarter system sales included 9 in Italy, 7 into Turkey and 5 into the Nordic countries. International revenue results were as follows: Fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. was $197 million or approximately same as the fourth quarter of 2013 revenue of $195 million and up 29% compared with $153 million last quarter. Our higher sequential international revenue was driven by increased procedures and higher system sales and a seasonally stronger quarter. Fourth quarter 2014 OUS procedure volume was approximately 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and 14% higher than the third quarter of this year. Procedure volume was led -- growth was led by dVP, but also reflected strong growth in GYN and general surgery.
Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 67.1% compared with 70.7% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014. Our lower-margin percentage relative to prior quarters primarily reflects a high mix of Xi systems. In the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated cost of settling a number product liability and legal claims against the company. During the second quarter and the fourth quarter, we recorded additional charges of $10 million and $5 million reflecting additional claims. These claims relates to the alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar cautery scissor or MCS instruments that included an MCS cover accessory that was the subject of our market withdrawal in 2012 and surgeries that were performed at MCS instruments that were the subject of a recall in 2013. Our estimate of the anticipated cost of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who participated in a mediation process that the company established in conjunction with the polling agreement. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process. Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, were up 9% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 and were up 2% compared with last quarter. Our fourth quarter 2014 pro forma operating expense compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. The increase compared to last quarter was driven by higher incentive compensation [indiscernible] for the fourth quarter was 23.5% compared with 25.8% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 27.2% last quarter. The pro forma effective tax rate for 2014 benefited from the release of reserves specific to the tax years where we have completed our IRS audit or jurisdictions where the statute of limitations have now expired. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2014 rate benefited from the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit. We anticipate our pro forma effective rate for 2015 will reflect a more normal range of 28% to 30%. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in mix of U.S. and OUS income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated. Our pro forma net income was $184 million or $4.92 per share compared with $193 million or $4.98 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $145 million or $3.91 per share for the third quarter of 2014. Excluding onetime tax benefits, our fourth quarter 2014 pro forma net income would have been $159 million or $4.25. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $576 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $550 million for the third quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $166 million or $4.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.5 billion, up from $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations. During the year, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $1 billion at an average purchase price of $398 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

As mentioned earlier, total Q4 year-over-year procedures grew approximately 10% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 8% and international procedures growing approximately 21%. And U.S. urology, the uptick in dVP procedures experienced in Q3 continued in Q4. Given our high rate of penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market, our dVP volumes are likely to attract overall U.S. prostatectomy volumes. Couple with continued [indiscernible] prior quarters in 2014 with low single-digit procedure declines. DVHb volumes appear consistent with the expected total market benign hysterectomy procedure decline, partially offset by growth in cancer procedures. Single-Site hysterectomies continued to display a rapid early growth off a small base.
Moving onto U.S. general surgery. Adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal and hernia adoptions remains a source of strength, while cholecystectomy declined modestly in the quarter. Over the course of 2014, we have seen a shift in focus from cholecystectomy to hernia repair by our general surgeons and sales force. Despite the decline in cholecystectomies this quarter, we continue to hear positive feedback from segments of the patient and surgeon populations that see value in the single-incision approach of our Single-Site technology or the real-time imaging of the biliary anatomy with our Firefly technology, among advantages associated with robotic surgery.
Looking more deeply at hernia repair. We are encouraged by robust procedure growth coupled with positive feedback about the clinical outcomes being generated with da Vinci Surgery during these early stages of adoption. However, hernia repair is a broad term, and the benefits associated with robotic and minimally invasive surgery varies across patient subsets. Hernias, surgeon feedbacks around the ease of suturing and enhanced vision associated with robotic surgery enables a minimally invasive closure of the primary defect that is similar to open surgery. Relative to laparoscopy, da Vinci surgeons have commented on increased intra-abdominal surgical dexterity for dissection and suturing as postoperative pain and similar or lower material operating cost. For inguinal hernia, discussions continue among surgeons about the role of minimally invasive surgery for some procedures. However, da Vinci surgeons have reported to us that for certain inguinal hernias, there are advantages in transabdominal defect closure and reduction in postoperative pain. Defining the subsets of hernia repair where robotic surgery is expected to thrive is difficult, particularly in these early days, but we are encouraged by our physician commentaries.
Looking abroad. International Q4 procedure growth of approximately 21% continued to be led by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery. In Japan, we've seen continued adoption of dVP. Clinical trials to support our reimbursement submissions for partial nephrectomy and gastrectomy have begun enrollment, and we continued discussions with key opinion-leading surgeons and surgical society leadership on other procedures of interest. Recently, a population-based study of the first year of dVP adoption in Japan was completed by researchers from the University of Tokyo and the Cleveland Clinic that included more than 10,000 patients. [indiscernible] the study found that dVP, despite being within the first year of broad adoption, was associated with the lower complication rate, lower transfusion rate, shorter hospitalization, longer anesthesia time and higher cost compared to open surgery and minimally invasive alternatives. There is little detail around how cost were calculated in the study, though they appear co-related to anesthesia time. We know from prior studies that with experience, both cost and operating room time, declined. The authors found that favorable clinical outcomes with robotic surgery noteworthy during these early phases of introduction of our technology, offsetting the longer anesthesia time.
In Europe, in addition to strong capital sales, we are encouraged by continued clinical developments. While dVP adoption is driving the majority of procedure growth, initial developments in colorectal surgery may establish the foundation for future adoption. Under the leadership of key opinion-leading surgeons, the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgeons was launched in December. Through a network of hospitals and surgeons, this group is providing standardized training and prompting to support introduction of robotic colorectal surgery across Europe. While there have been cost studies published to compare robotic surgery with inpatient and surgeon populations and medical laparoscopy, additional cost studies with appropriate comparators were published this quarter. I'll quickly review one from the University of Pittsburgh published in the Journal of the Society of Laparo-endoscopic surgeons that compared robotic laparoscopic and open benign hysterectomies among surgeons who most commonly perform open surgery. The study reviewed nearly 5,000 benign hysterectomies performed by 237 surgeons across 10 hospitals from 2011 to 2013, including 119 surgeons that predominantly performed open hysterectomies. Using actual cost data during the hospital stay, the authors found that when open surgeons performed robotic and laparoscopic procedures, the cost were similar on an operating cost basis. Including an add-on cost for robotic maintenance and depreciation resulted in higher cost for robotic surgeries, but the authors noted a bias in this analysis due to the exclusion of similar cost associated with the laparoscopic procedures. In conclusion, the author stated, ""although laparoscopic hysterectomy had the lowest cost overall, robotics may be no more costly than laparoscopic hysterectomy when performed by surgeons who predominantly perform open hysterectomies.""
This conclude my remarks, and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement last week, 2014 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 9% to roughly 570,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2015, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of [indiscernible] in 2015 as we have expense in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset.
With respect to revenue guidance, consistent with last year, we will not be providing specific revenue guidance. We do expect 2015 capital sales to follow historical seasonal patterns with Q1 being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. We will face foreign exchange headwinds in 2015 based upon the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be fairly consistent with Q4 2014, based upon the anticipated proportion of Xi Stapler and other new products with lower gross profit margins in our product mix and the foreign exchange headwinds I mentioned earlier, partially offset by cost reductions realized during the year. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely upon product mix and systems production volume.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. As we have stated previously, we believe it is fundamentally early days for computer-assisted surgery, and we will continue to make investments to pursue significant growth opportunities.
We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $180 million and $185 million in 2015 compared to $169 million [ph] in 2014. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $14 million and $16 million [ph] in 2015. With regard to income tax, as Marshall described, we expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast is consistent with our 2014 pro forma tax rate, excluding the impact of tax reserve releases in 2014 and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q4 2014 was approximately 37.3 million shares. We estimate our Q1 2015 diluted share count to range between 37.4 million shares and 37.6 million shares.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

In regards to procedure mix, we don't necessarily see that moving the dial either up or down on that, although there are swing items in relation to the metric. One would be our relative success with the stapler and Vessel Sealer utilization and where our revenue procedures higher where these advanced instruments are used.

If you look at a system that's getting average utilization, the consumables cost of that procedure and compare it to more alternatives, we think we're right in there in terms of being competitive. Appropriate [indiscernible] we're hearing back from our customers is that as they look at competition for time on robot, they're making decisions about which cases get scheduled and which ones don't. And that's a near-term problem. I think in the U.S., we saw a increase in procedures per system. So that turned around in the year where we are be -- where we are building capacity at the beginning part of '14. The field is now consuming capacity in the robots in the U.S. I think hernia is driving that. And so part of that is this issue of which one does a surgeon and an institution find greater value in at the moment they have to make that decision. And I think that's been a primary driver of that competition. And we'll see over time is as capacity grows out and we have a broader set of options for them to choose from, whether that modulates, we'll have to watch over the next few quarters and see how these 2 play together. The economics of hernia are interesting a little bit different. The laparoscopic hernia repairs use a different mix of instruments than chole do. It's a more expensive mix, using one of our systems instead of laparoscopy allows for trade-out of some more expensive laparoscopic instruments. And so our economic value there is well supported where we are currently. I think that looks really good. The other thing is that not all hernias are in exchange between laparoscopy and da Vinci. A lot of them are still done old -- a lot [indiscernible] numbers and your comments also look also there. The economics are portraying back are pretty solid.

Having said that, they can be really lumpy. And one of the reasons that we -- it seemed to have the capital lumpiness you just described is because there are different market access requirements in different countries. For example, what approvals look like in China are totally different than what they look like in Japan and different again from what they might look like in different parts of Europe. So long term, we're very positive and it's a motivation for investments we make. Short term, we expect lumpiness as it can require coders or approval or submissions and each country it's a little bit different."

So they're been interest in pursuit of colorectal. So there is a group of surgeons who are both interested and skilled in moving forward, and Xi allows them to keep going. So in a sense, that's a virtuous cycle. You have some folks who have experience. Xi gives them a little are great of capability as they step in and start to use that, there are to explore the greater good ability in that drives for the growth and so we've seen that. We've been also pleasantly surprised by feedback from some more of our longer-term customers in urology and gynecology who have also find benefit in Xi that perhaps exceeded what we thought they might in the very beginning."

At the outset, we focused on driving adoption",996,"Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2014 has been a year of transition for Intuitive, with macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of the year giving way to improving performance as the year progressed. At the outset, we focused on driving adoption of our platform in general surgery in launching key new products and increasing our organizational capability and performance in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan. The organization has responded well in the year with solid procedure performance and a strong launch of our newest-generation da Vinci platform. General surgery and international procedures have become the growth engine for the business. 
Starting with a review of procedures. Year-over-year growth was approximately 9%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci outside of the United States and the strength in neurology, offset by flat annual performance in gynecology.
General surgery growth was approximately 33% for the year, comprised of strong growth in da Vinci colorectal surgery, hernia repair and in other general surgery procedures, offset by slowing da Vinci Single-Site use in cholecystectomy.
While Single-Site cholecystectomy procedures were up in 2014, they were down in the fourth quarter. Outside of the United States, procedure growth remained robust, rising approximately 20% over procedures in 2013 based on strength in Europe and Asia. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Looking at trends in capital sales for the year. Capital placements increased in sequential quarters, helped by the launch of da Vinci Xi in the second quarter of 2014. Outside of the United States, our capital business was solid with international system strength in Europe and Asia outside of Japan. System sales weakened in Japan over 2013 as customers wait for both Xi clearance and additional reimbursement. Sales elsewhere, particularly China, grew over 2013.
Our product launches were significant in 2014. In the second quarter, we launched our fourth-generation platform, the da Vinci Xi Surgical System. We launched Xi in the United States in April, followed by CE mark in June, availability in France, Austria and Switzerland in October and Korea in December. The Xi System enhances our prior-generation systems by improving multi-quadrant access to the body, introducing the ability to move the endoscope between robotic arms, increasing range of motion and reach with slimmer arms and enhancing ease-of-use and setup. Customer reception of the Xi has been strong with interest in use by multiple specialties, including colorectal surgeons, urologists, thoracic surgeons and gynecologic oncologists.
Our systems are optimized for different procedures by dozens of instruments and accessories. In 2014, we added to the initial set of instruments and accessories available for the Xi at launch by introducing the Xi Vessel Sealer in Q2, Xi Firefly in Q3 and Xi Stapler in Q1 of 2015. In 2015, we plan to submit a 510(k) for software, that allows for coordinated table motion with the Xi, and a 510(k) for an Xi-compatible version of our Single-Site instruments. This filling out of the Xi products will increase the applicability of the platform to institutions interested in owning a single da Vinci system.
Turning to instruments. We launched our Wristed Needle Driver instrument for use with Single-Site surgery in Q4 of 2014. Surgeons performing single-incision hysterectomy with da Vinci's Single-Site are particularly interested in the Wristed Needle Driver, and initial uptake has been strong. Single-Site hysterectomy with Wristed Needle Driver is still in its early days, and projecting its long-term impact on the hysterectomy market is premature. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we issued a field action for our da Vinci Si Stapler after we observed 3 intraoperative instrument failures. In each case, these procedures were completed successfully, minimally invasively. Our team has identified the root causes of failure and has requalified the Stapler. As of this first quarter of 2015, the Si EndoWrist Stapler is back in production, and first cases have been completed. Our Xi Stapler was also launched in the quarter, with first cases completed this month.
Looking back at the full year 2014. Our operating performance was as follows: worldwide procedures grew approximately 9%; we shipped 431 surgical systems in the year, down from 546 in 2013; total revenue was $2.1 billion, down 6% from 2013; recurring revenue grew to $1.57 billion, up 5% and comprising 70% of total revenue; we generated $819 million in operating profit before noncash stock option expense, down 21% from last year; pro forma net income was $607 million, down 24% from 2013; and we reduced our shares outstanding by repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $398 [ph] per share during 2014.
Turning to our operating performance in the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 10% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 137 da Vinci Surgical Systems, down from 138 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total revenue for the quarter was $605 million, up 5% from prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $281 million, up 5%. We generated an operating profit of $237 million in the quarter before noncash stock compensation expense, down 8% from the fourth quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $184 million, down 5% from Q4 of 2013.
In 2014, we made significant investments in our organization, including growing our direct commercialization [ph] in Japan. We anticipate growing our organization in specific areas through 2015, with particular emphasis on Asia, Europe and in operations.
Looking to 2015, our priorities are as follows: first, we will you focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, we'll work to complete our launch and new product introductions of da Vinci Xi in key markets globally; third, we'll develop our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, we plan to build Xi-compatible da Vinci Sp prototypes and initiate customer valuations.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights."

Our first quarter 2014 revenue procedures were consistent with our press release issued on January 13. Fourth quarter revenues were $605 million, up 5% compared with $576 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, and up 10% from last quarter.
Procedures for the fourth quarter grew approximately 10% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, and approximately 9% compared with last quarter.
I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We are providing pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our gap results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Procedure highlights will be covered by Patrick. Revenue highlights are as follows: proforma instrument and accessory revenue 4% grew compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, and 3% compared with the third quarter of 2014. The increase is relative to prior quarters reflect procedure growth, partially offset by customer-buying impact of the field action for our da Vinci Si Stapler. We have resolved the issue underlying the stapler, and began shipping it again early in the first quarter of 2015. We also began shipment of our Xi Stapler early this quarter.
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure, compared with $1,930 for both the fourth quarter of 2013 and last quarter. The decrease from the prior year as well as the prior quarter reflects the timing of customer orders and the field action for our da Vinci Si stapler.
Pro forma system revenue of $211 million increased 3%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, and increased 37%, compared with the third quarter of 2014. The increase in systems revenue compared with the third quarter, primarily reflects higher system sales in Europe and the U.S.
137 systems were placed in the third quarter, excluding 2 Xis traded for Sis under our trade-out program, compared with 138 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 111 systems last quarter. 97 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were Xis, compared with 59 in the third quarter and 50 in the second quarter. Globally, our system ASP of 1,550,000 increased relative to the ASP for the fourth quarter of last year of 1,460,000 and relative to last quarter of 1,450,000. The increase in ASPs relative to last year reflects product mix, where the current quarter included a high mix of Xis and the fourth quarter of 2013 included a high mix of the Si-es. The increase in ASPs relative to the last quarter, reflect a higher proportion of Xi Systems, a higher proportion of Dual Console systems and a positive geographic mix.
Hospitals financed approximately 15% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 27% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which 5 were structured as operating leases. Through the fourth quarter of 2014, we have entered into 14 operating leases.
In the U.S., we placed 71 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 72 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 61 systems in the third quarter of 2014. Outside the U.S., we sold 66 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 48 systems last quarter. Year-over-year, system placements reflect growth in Europe, 39 systems this quarter, compared with 28 systems last year; and a reduction in Japan systems, 6 systems this quarter compared with 21 systems last year. Quarter-over-quarter system placement growth reflects higher system placements in Europe and other world markets.
Fourth quarter system sales included 9 into Italy, 7 into Turkey and 5 into the Nordic countries. International revenue results were as follows: fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. was $197 million or approximately same as the fourth quarter of 2013 revenue of $195 million, and up 29% compared with $153 million last quarter. Our higher sequential international revenue was driven by increased procedures and higher system sales and a seasonally stronger quarter.
Fourth quarter 2014 OUS procedure volume was approximately 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, and 14% higher than the third quarter of this year. Procedure volume was led -- growth was led by dVP, but also reflected strong growth in GYN and general surgery.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 67.1%, compared with 70.7% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014. Our lower-margin percentage relative to prior quarters primarily reflects a high mix of Xi Systes.
In the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability and legal claims against the company. During the second quarter and the fourth quarter, we recorded additional charges of $10 million and $5 million reflecting additional claims. These claims relate to the alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar cautery scissor, or MCS, instruments that included an MCS tip cover accessory that was the subject of a market withdrawal in 2012 in surgeries that were performed at MCS instruments that were the subject of a recall in 2013. Our estimate of the anticipated cost of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who participated in the mediation process that the company established in conjunction with the polling agreement. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process. Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, were up 9%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 and were up 2% compared with last quarter. Our fourth quarter 2014 pro forma operating expense, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. The increase, compared to last quarter, was driven by higher incentive compensation and severance costs. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.5%, compared with 25.8% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 27.2% last quarter. The pro forma effective tax rate for 2014 benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years, where we have completed our IRS audit or jurisdictions where the statute of limitations have now expired. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2014 rate benefited from the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit.
We anticipate our pro forma effective rate for 2015 will reflect a more normal range of 28% to 30%. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in mix of U.S. and OUS income, and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated.
Our pro forma net income was $184 million, or $4.92 per share, compared with $193 million, or $4.98 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $145 million, or $3.91 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Excluding onetime tax benefits, our fourth quarter 2014 pro forma net income would have been $159 million or $4.25. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $576 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $550 million for the third quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $147 million, or $3.94 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $166 million, or $4.28 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $124 million, or $3.35 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.5 billion, up from $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations. During the year, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $1 billion at an average purchase price of $398 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

As mentioned earlier, total Q4 year-over-year procedures grew approximately 10%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 8% and international procedures growing approximately 21%.
In U.S. urology, the uptick in dVP procedures experienced in Q3 continued in Q4. Given our high rate of penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market, our dVP volumes are likely to track to overall U.S. prostatectomy volumes. Coupled with continued growth in kidney procedures, our overall U.S. urology procedure showed modest growth in 2014. 
In U.S. gynecology, Q4 results were similar to prior quarters in 2014, with low single-digit procedure declines. DVHb volumes appear consistent with the expected total market benign hysterectomy procedure decline, partially offset by growth in cancer procedures. Single-Site hysterectomy continued to display rapid early growth off a small base.
Moving on to U.S. general surgery. Adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal and hernia adoption remains a source of strength, while cholecystectomy has declined modestly in the quarter. Over the course of 2014, we have seen a shift in focus from cholecystectomy to hernia repair by our general surgeons and sales force.
Despite the decline in cholecystectomies this quarter, we continue to hear positive feedback from segments of the patient and surgeon populations that see value in the single-incision approach of our Single-Site technology or the real-time imaging of the biliary anatomy with our Firefly technology, among advantages associated with robotic surgery.
Looking more deeply at hernia repair. We are encouraged by robust procedure growth, coupled with positive feedback about the clinical outcomes being generated with da Vinci Surgery during these early stages of adoption. However, hernia repair is a broad term, and the benefits associated with robotic and minimally invasive surgery varies across patient subsets. [indiscernible] hernias, surgeon feedback around the ease of suturing and enhanced vision associated with robotic surgery, enables a minimally invasive closure of the primary defect that is similar to open surgery.
Relative to laparoscopy, da Vinci surgeons have commented on increased intra-abdominal surgical dexterity for dissection and suturing as post-operative pain and similar or lower material operating costs. For inguinal hernia, discussions continue among surgeons about the role of minimally invasive surgery for some procedures. However, da Vinci surgeons have reported to us that for certain inguinal hernias, there are advantages in transabdominal defect closure and reduction in post-operative pain. Defining the subsets of hernia repair, where robotic surgery is expected to thrive is difficult, particularly in these early days, but we are encouraged by our physician commentaries.
Looking abroad. International Q4 procedure growth of approximately 21% continued to be led by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures, with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery. In Japan, we've seen continued adoption of dVP. Clinical trials to support our reimbursement submissions for partial nephrectomy and gastrectomy have begun enrollment, and we continued discussions with key opinion-leading surgeons and surgical society leadership on other procedures of interest.
Recently, a population-based study of the first year of dVP adoption in Japan was completed by researchers from the University of Tokyo and the Cleveland Clinic that included more than 10,000 patients. [indiscernible] in cancer science, the study found that dVP, despite being within the first year of broad adoption, was associated with a lower complication rate, lower transfusion rate, shorter hospitalization, longer anesthesia time and higher cost compared to open surgery and minimally invasive alternatives. There is little detail around how costs were calculated in this study, but they appear co-related to anesthesia time. We know from prior studies that with experience, both cost and operating room time, declined. The authors found that favorable clinical outcomes with robotic surgery noteworthy during these early phases of the introduction of our technology, offsetting the longer anesthesia time.
In Europe, in addition to strong capital sales, we are encouraged by continued clinical developments. While dVP adoption is driving the majority of procedure growth, initial developments in colorectal surgery may establish the foundation for future adoption.
Under the leadership of key opinion-leading surgeons, the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgeons was launched in December. Through a network of hospitals and surgeons, this group is providing standardized training and proctoring to support the introduction of robotic colorectal surgery across Europe. While there have been cost studies published to compare robotic surgery within patient and surgeon populations in [indiscernible] laparoscopy, additional cost studies with appropriate comparators were published this quarter. I'll quickly review one from the University of Pittsburgh published in the Journal of the Society of laparo-endoscopic surgeons that compared robotic to laparoscopic in open benign hysterectomies among surgeons who most commonly perform open surgery. The study reviewed nearly 5,000 benign hysterectomies performed by 237 surgeons across 10 hospitals from 2011 to 2013, including 119 surgeons that predominantly performed open hysterectomies. Using actual cost data during the hospital stay, the authors found that when open surgeons performed robotic and laparoscopic procedures, the costs were similar on an operating cost basis. Including an add-on cost for robotic maintenance and depreciation resulted in higher cost for robotic surgeries, but the authors noted a bias in this analysis due to the exclusion of similar costs associated with the laparoscopic procedures.
In conclusion, the author stated, ""although laparoscopic hysterectomy had the lowest cost, overall, robotics may be no more costly than laparoscopic hysterectomy when performed by surgeons who predominantly perform open hysterectomy.""
This concludes my remarks, and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement last week, 2014 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 9% to roughly 570,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2015, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 7% to 10%. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2015 as we have experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset.
With respect to revenue guidance, consistent with last year, we will not be providing specific revenue guidance. We do expect 2015 capital sales to follow historical seasonal patterns Q1 being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. We will face foreign exchange headwinds in 2015 based upon the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be fairly consistent with Q4 2014, based upon the anticipated proportion of Xi, Stapler and other new products with lower gross profit margins in our product mix, and the foreign exchange headwinds I mentioned earlier, partially offset by cost reductions realized during the year. Our actual gross profit margin will vary, quarter-to-quarter, depending largely upon product mix and systems production volume.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. As we have stated previously, we believe it is fundamentally early days for computer-assisted surgery, and we will continue to make investments to pursue significant growth opportunities.
We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $180 million and $185 million in 2015, compared to $169 million in 2014. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $14 million and $16 million [ph] in 2015.
With regard to income tax, as Marshall described, we expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast is consistent with our 2014 pro forma tax rate, excluding the impact of tax reserve releases in 2014 and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q4 2014 was approximately 37.3 million shares. We estimate our Q1 2015 diluted share count to range between 37.4 million shares and 37.6 million shares.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

The primary procedure that the Wristed Needle Driver -- Single-Site Wristed Needle Driver is being used for is benign hysterectomy. And it's being pursued for patients who have an interest in the single incision. We see a mixture of existing robotic surgeons and those who have not approached da Vinci systems before, so it's both folks who are currently engaged with us as customers and those who have not prior engaged, we see a mixture of both of those. The product is performing well. Early demand has been really good. And what we really want to watch and track is what happens on reorders and how people really experience it as they go forward. We see a little bit of both in the early stages, a little bit of switching multiport procedures into Single-Site, and a little bit of approaching patients that otherwise would not have been done necessarily multiport robotically. So we're seeing both of those things. And it will take some quarters, I think, to shake out, where people ultimately find that optimization. I'm not too stressed about a little bit of cannibalization here. I think that goes with the territory, and we'll support surgeons taking the approach they think is most appropriate."

With regard to do we think that there's a possibility in other types of care or other sides of care, I think the answer to that is yes. So you think about both -- there's kind of duration of care when you talk about things like outpatient, but there's both duration and location, how long are they in the hospital and where is it being performed. And we see increases in both -- increases in shorter-duration stays and increase in robotic surgery in different locations. And so Si and Si-e, some of those lower-priced packages, are designed to give an option to some of the customers who are interested in exploring that space. And so we've seen some interest.

So on the chole side on pricing, we think that where we are right now on chole pricing, with Single-Site, is really appropriate. If you look at a system that's getting average utilization, the consumables cost of that procedure and compare it to multiport alternatives, we think we're right in there in terms of being competitive. And appropriate value for what Single-Site can bring. So I think we're in a good spot there. I think the biggest thing -- and Patrick alluded to it, and the biggest thing we're hearing back from our customers is that as they look at competition for time on the robot, they're making decisions about which cases get scheduled and which ones don't, and that's a near-term problem. I think, in the U.S., we saw an increase in procedures per system. So that turned around in the year, where we were building capacity in the beginning part of 2014. The field has now been consuming capacity on the robots in the U.S. I think hernia is driving that. And so part of that is this issue of which one does a surgeon, and an institution find greater value in -- at the moment they have to make that decision. And I think that's been a primary driver of that competition. And we'll see, over time, if as capacity grows out, and we have a broader set of options for them to choose from, whether that modulates. We'll have to watch over the next few quarters and see how these 2 play together. The economics of hernia are interesting and a little bit different. The laparoscopic hernia repairs use a different mix of instruments than choles do. It's a more expensive mix, using one of our systems instead of laparoscopy allows for trade-out of some more expensive laparoscopic instruments. And so our economic value there is well supported where we are. And currently, I think that looks really good. The other thing is that not all hernias are in exchange between laparoscopy and da Vinci. A lot of them are still done open -- a surprising number is still done open. And the economics also look good there. So hernia economics, the reports we're hearing back are pretty solid, and we're feeling like we're in a pretty good position."

So that part has been really good. If you think about colorectal, just to go back to your assertion, colorectal is growing pretty nicely on the Si base already. So there had been interest in pursuit of colorectal. So there is a group of surgeons who are both interested and skilled in moving forward, and Xi allows them to keep going. So in a sense, it's -- that's a virtuous cycle. You have some folks who have experience. Xi gives them a little greater capability as they've step in and start to use that, they're starting to explore that greater capability, and that drives further growth and so we've seen that.

Particular swing items that could move you towards the lower end or the higher end of the range would be changes in those macro trends in gynecology and neurology. Those are large sets of procedures. And as we saw in this last couple of years, those things can definitely move the dial. Growth rates in early-stage U.S. general surgery procedures, how they -- the trajectory they follow is going to be important in the international growth side of things. And as was discussed a little earlier, just how successful we are with the Wristed Needle Driver contributions and how that may impact benign hysterectomy."

Rather than thinking about procedures I'd guide you to what does it do differently. And because I think it's early and it has a lot of long-term possibility, but predicting exactly which ones when is going to be hard. What does it do differently? It delivers a 4 computer-assisted or robotically assisted instruments through a parallel access that can go fairly deep into the body through an entry point. And so when you think about that, you think about accessing the throat or the head and neck area, trans-oral, or you think about trans-umbilical things, that might able to be reached that are otherwise hard to reach with an architecture like Single-Site or trans-anal procedures or transvaginal procedures. Now you can think a lot about and we think about what are the disease stage that surgeons can affect positively impact with a technology like that or an opportunity like that. And they're fairly diverse and pretty interesting. And then, you have to go all the way through some of the testing and evaluation that we're talking about doing this year, which is what can actually be done and that -- what kind of efficiency and what kind of price points, and that's where the heavy-lifting is. So long term, I think it will open some interesting doors. Near term, we're not ready to call procedure sizes for you yet."

30239,278824694,748444,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2015",2015-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2014 has been a year of transition for Intuitive, with macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of the year giving way to improving performance as the year progressed. At the outset, we focused on driving adoption",997,"Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2014 has been a year of transition for Intuitive, with macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of the year giving way to improving performance as the year progressed. At the outset, we focused on driving adoption of our platform in general surgery in launching key new products and increasing our organizational capability and performance in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan. The organization has responded well in the year with solid procedure performance and a strong launch of our newest-generation da Vinci platform. General surgery and international procedures have become the growth engine for the business. 
Starting with a review of procedures, year-over-year growth was approximately 9%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci outside of the United States and the strength in neurology, offset by flat annual performance in gynecology.
General surgery growth was approximately 33% for the year, comprised of strong growth in da Vinci colorectal surgery, hernia repair and in other general surgery procedures, offset by slowing da Vinci Single-Site use in cholecystectomy.
While Single-Site cholecystectomy procedures were up in 2014, they were down in the fourth quarter. Outside of the United States, procedure growth remained robust, rising approximately 20% over procedures in 2013 based on strength in Europe and Asia. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Looking at trends in capital sales for the year, capital placements increased in sequential quarters, helped by the launch of da Vinci Xi in the second quarter of 2014. Outside of the United States, our capital business was solid with international system strength in Europe and Asia outside of Japan. System sales weakened in Japan over 2013 as customers wait for both Xi clearance and additional reimbursement. Sales elsewhere, particularly China, grew over 2013.
Our product launches were significant in 2014. In the second quarter, we launched our fourth-generation platform, the da Vinci Xi Surgical System. We launched Xi in the United States in April, followed by CE mark in June, availability in France, Austria and Switzerland in October and Korea in December. The Xi System enhances our prior-generation systems by improving multi-quadrant access to the body, introducing the ability to move the endoscope between robotic arms, increasing range of motion and reach with slimmer arms and enhancing ease-of-use and setup. Customer reception of the Xi has been strong with interest in use by multiple specialties, including colorectal surgeons, urologists, thoracic surgeons and gynecologic oncologists.
Our systems are optimized for different procedures by dozens of instruments and accessories. In 2014, we added to the initial set of instruments and accessories available for the Xi at launch by introducing the Xi Vessel Sealer in Q2, Xi Firefly in Q3 and Xi Stapler in Q1 of 2015. In 2015, we plan to submit a 510(k) for software that allows for coordinated table motion with the Xi, and a 510(k) for an Xi-compatible version of our Single-Site instruments. This filling out of the Xi product suite will increase the applicability of the platform to institutions interested in owning a single da Vinci system.
Turning to instruments, we launched our Wristed Needle Driver instrument for use with Single-Site surgery in Q4 of 2014. Surgeons performing single-incision hysterectomy with da Vinci's Single-Site are particularly interested in the Wristed Needle Driver, and initial uptake has been strong. Single-Site hysterectomy with Wristed Needle Driver is still in its early days, and projecting its long-term impact on the hysterectomy market is premature. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we issued a field action for our da Vinci Si Stapler after we observed 3 intraoperative instrument failures. In each case, these procedures were completed successfully, minimally invasively. Our team has identified the root causes of failure and has requalified the Stapler. As of this first quarter of 2015, the Si EndoWrist Stapler is back in production, and first cases have been completed. Our Xi Stapler was also launched in the quarter, with first cases completed this month.
Looking back at the full year 2014, our operating performance was as follows: worldwide procedures grew approximately 9%; we shipped 431 surgical systems in the year, down from 546 in 2013; total revenue was $2.1 billion, down 6% from 2013; recurring revenue grew to $1.57 billion, up 5% and comprising 70% of total revenue; we generated $819 million in operating profit before noncash stock option expense, down 21% from last year; pro forma net income was $607 million, down 24% from 2013; and we reduced our shares outstanding by repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $398 [ph] per share during 2014.
Turning to our operating performance in the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 10% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 137 da Vinci Surgical Systems, down from 138 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total revenue for the quarter was $605 million, up 5% from prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $281 million, up 5%. We generated an operating profit of $237 million in the quarter before noncash stock compensation expense, down 8% from the fourth quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $184 million, down 5% from Q4 of 2013.
In 2014, we made significant investments in our organization, including growing our direct commercial organization [ph] in Japan. We anticipate growing our organization in specific areas through 2015, with particular emphasis on Asia, Europe and in operations.
Looking to 2015, our priorities are as follows: first, we will focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, we'll work to complete our launch and new product introductions of da Vinci Xi in key markets globally; third, we'll develop our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, we plan to build Xi-compatible da Vinci Sp prototypes and initiate customer evaluations.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights."

Our first quarter 2014 revenue procedures were consistent with our press release issued on January 13. Fourth quarter revenues were $605 million, up 5% compared with $576 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, and up 10% from last quarter.
Procedures for the fourth quarter grew approximately 10% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately 9% compared with last quarter.
I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We are providing pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our gap results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Procedure highlights will be covered by Patrick. Revenue highlights are as follows: proforma instrument and accessory revenue grew 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 and 3% compared with the third quarter of 2014. The increases relative to prior quarters reflect procedure growth partially offset by customer-buying impact of the field action for our da Vinci Si Stapler. We have resolved the issue underlying the stapler, and began shipping it again early in the first quarter of 2015. We also began shipment of our Xi Stapler early this quarter.
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure, compared with $1,930 for both the fourth quarter of 2013 and last quarter. The decrease from the prior year as well as the prior quarter reflects the timing of customer orders and the field action for our da Vinci Si stapler.
Pro forma system revenue of $211 million increased 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, and increased 37% compared with the third quarter of 2014. The increase in systems revenue compared with the third quarter primarily reflects higher system sales in Europe and the U.S.
137 systems were placed in the third quarter, excluding 2 Xis traded for Sis under our trade-out program, compared with 138 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 111 systems last quarter. 97 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were Xis, compared with 59 in the third quarter and 50 in the second quarter. Globally, our system ASP of 1,550,000 increased relative to the ASP for the fourth quarter of last year of 1,460,000 and relative to last quarter of 1,450,000. The increase in ASPs relative to last year reflects product mix, where the current quarter included a high mix of Xis and the fourth quarter of 2013 included a high mix of the Si-es. The increase in ASPs relative to the last quarter reflect a higher proportion of Xi Systems, a higher proportion of Dual Console systems and a positive geographic mix.
Hospitals financed approximately 15% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 27% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which 5 were structured as operating leases. Through the fourth quarter of 2014, we have entered into 14 operating leases.
In the U.S., we placed 71 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 72 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 61 systems in the third quarter of 2014. Outside the U.S., we sold 66 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 48 systems last quarter. Year-over-year, system placements reflect growth in Europe, 39 systems this quarter, compared with 28 systems last year; and a reduction in Japan systems, 6 systems this quarter compared with 21 systems last year. Quarter-over-quarter system placement growth reflects higher system placements in Europe and other world markets.
Fourth quarter system sales included 9 into Italy, 7 into Turkey and 5 into the Nordic countries. International revenue results were as follows: fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. was $197 million or approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2013 revenue of $195 million and up 29% compared with $153 million last quarter. Our higher sequential international revenue was driven by increased procedures and higher system sales and a seasonally stronger quarter.
Fourth quarter 2014 oUS procedure volume was approximately 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, and 14% higher than the third quarter of this year. Procedure volume was led -- growth was led by dVP, but also reflected strong growth in GYN and general surgery.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 67.1% compared with 70.7% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014. Our lower-margin percentage relative to prior quarters primarily reflects a high mix of Xi Systems.
In the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability and legal claims against the company. During the second quarter and the fourth quarter, we recorded additional charges of $10 million and $5 million reflecting additional claims. These claims relate to the alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar cautery scissor, or MCS, instruments that included an MCS tip cover accessory that was the subject of a market withdrawal in 2012 in surgeries that were performed with MCS instruments that were the subject of a recall in 2013. Our estimate of the anticipated cost of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who participated in the mediation process that the company established in conjunction with a tolling agreement. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process. Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, were up 9% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 and were up 2% compared with last quarter. Our fourth quarter 2014 pro forma operating expense, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. The increase, compared to last quarter, was driven by higher incentive compensation and severance costs. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.5% compared with 25.8% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 27.2% last quarter. The pro forma effective tax rate for 2014 benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years where we have completed our IRS audit or jurisdictions where the statute of limitations have now expired. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2014 rate benefited from the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit.
We anticipate our pro forma effective rate for 2015 will reflect a more normal range of 28% to 30%. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in mix of U.S. and oUS income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit unless such credit is reinstated.
Our pro forma net income was $184 million, or $4.92 per share, compared with $193 million, or $4.98 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $145 million, or $3.91 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Excluding onetime tax benefits, our fourth quarter 2014 pro forma net income would have been $159 million or $4.25 per share. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $576 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $550 million for the third quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $147 million, or $3.94 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $166 million, or $4.28 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $124 million, or $3.35 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.5 billion, up from $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations. During the year, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $1 billion at an average purchase price of $398 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

As mentioned earlier, total Q4 year-over-year procedures grew approximately 10%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 8% and international procedures growing approximately 21%.
In U.S. urology, the uptick in dVP procedures experienced in Q3 continued in Q4. Given our high rate of penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market, our dVP volumes are likely to track to overall U.S. prostatectomy volumes. Coupled with continued growth in kidney procedures, our overall U.S. urology procedures showed modest growth in 2014. 
In U.S. gynecology, Q4 results were similar to prior quarters in 2014 with low single-digit procedure declines. DVHb volumes appeared consistent with the expected total market benign hysterectomy procedure decline, partially offset by growth in cancer procedures. Single-Site hysterectomy continued to display rapid early growth off a small base.
Moving on to U.S. general surgery, adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal and hernia adoption remains a source of strength, while cholecystectomy has declined modestly in the quarter. Over the course of 2014, we have seen a shift in focus from cholecystectomy to hernia repair by our general surgeons and sales force.
Despite the decline in cholecystectomies this quarter, we continue to hear positive feedback from segments of the patient and surgeon populations that see value in the single-incision approach of our Single-Site technology or the real-time imaging of the biliary anatomy with our Firefly technology, among advantages associated with robotic surgery.
Looking more deeply at hernia repair, we are encouraged by robust procedure growth coupled with positive feedback about the clinical outcomes being generated with da Vinci Surgery during these early stages of adoption. However, hernia repair is a broad term and the benefits associated with robotic and minimally invasive surgery varies across patient subsets. Provincial [ph] hernias, surgeon feedback around the ease of suturing and enhanced vision associated with robotic surgery, enables a minimally invasive closure of the primary defect that is similar to open surgery.
Relative to laparoscopy, da Vinci surgeons have commented on increased intra-abdominal surgical dexterity for dissection and suturing, less post-operative pain and similar or lower material operating costs. For inguinal hernia, discussions continue among surgeons about the role of minimally invasive surgery for some procedures. However, da Vinci surgeons have reported to us that for certain inguinal hernias, there are advantages in transabdominal defect closure and reduction in post-operative pain. Defining the subsets of hernia repair where robotic surgery is expected to thrive is difficult, particularly in these early days, but we are encouraged by our physician commentaries.
Looking abroad, international Q4 procedure growth of approximately 21% continued to be led by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures, with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery. In Japan, we've seen continued adoption of dVP. Clinical trials to support our reimbursement submissions for partial nephrectomy and gastrectomy have begun enrollment, and we continue discussions with key opinion-leading surgeons and surgical society leadership on other procedures of interest.
Recently, a population-based study of the first year of dVP adoption in Japan was completed by researchers from the University of Tokyo and the Cleveland Clinic that included more than 10,000 patients. Published in Cancer Science, the study found that dVP, despite being within the first year of broad adoption, was associated with a lower complication rate, lower transfusion rate, shorter hospitalization, longer anesthesia time and higher costs compared to open surgery and minimally invasive alternatives. There is little detail around how costs were calculated in this study, though they appear correlated to anesthesia time. We know from prior studies that with experience, both costs and operating room time decline. The authors found that favorable clinical outcomes with robotic surgery noteworthy during these early phases of the introduction of our technology, offsetting the longer anesthesia time.
In Europe, in addition to strong capital sales, we are encouraged by continued clinical developments. While dVP adoption is driving the majority of procedure growth, initial developments in colorectal surgery may establish the foundation for future adoption.
Under the leadership of key opinion-leading surgeons, the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgeons was launched in December. Through a network of hospitals and surgeons, this group is providing standardized training and proctoring to support the introduction of robotic colorectal surgery across Europe. While there have been cost studies published that compare robotic surgery within patient and surgeon populations in [indiscernible] laparoscopy, additional cost studies with appropriate comparators were published this quarter. I'll quickly review one from the University of Pittsburgh published in the Journal of the Society of laparo-endoscopic surgeons that compared robotic to laparoscopic in open benign hysterectomies among surgeons who most commonly perform open surgery. The study reviewed nearly 5,000 benign hysterectomies performed by 237 surgeons across 10 hospitals from 2011 to 2013, including 119 surgeons that predominantly performed open hysterectomies. Using actual cost data during the hospital stay, the authors found that when open surgeons performed robotic and laparoscopic procedures, the costs were similar on an operating cost basis. Including an add-on cost for robotic maintenance and depreciation resulted in higher cost for robotic surgeries, but the authors noted a bias in this analysis due to the exclusion of similar costs associated with the laparoscopic procedures.
In conclusion, the author stated, ""although laparoscopic hysterectomy had the lowest costs, overall, robotics may be no more costly than laparoscopic hysterectomy when performed by surgeons who predominantly perform open hysterectomy.""
This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

As described in our announcement last week, 2014 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 9% to roughly 570,000 procedures performed worldwide.",418,"Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement last week, 2014 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 9% to roughly 570,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2015, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 7% to 10%. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2015 as we have experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset.
With respect to revenue guidance, consistent with last year, we will not be providing specific revenue guidance. We do expect 2015 capital sales to follow historical seasonal patterns with Q1 being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. We will face foreign exchange headwinds in 2015 based upon the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be fairly consistent with Q4 2014, based upon the anticipated proportion of Xi, Stapler and other new products with lower gross profit margins in our product mix and the foreign exchange headwinds I mentioned earlier, partially offset by cost reductions realized during the year. Our actual gross profit margin will vary, quarter-to-quarter, depending largely upon product mix and systems production volume.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. As we have stated previously, we believe it is fundamentally early days for computer-assisted surgery, and we will continue to make investments to pursue significant growth opportunities.
We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $180 million and $185 million in 2015, compared to $169 million in 2014. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $14 million and $16 million in 2015.
With regard to income tax, as Marshall described, we expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast is consistent with our 2014 pro forma tax rate, excluding the impact of tax reserve releases in 2014 and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q4 2014 was approximately 37.3 million shares. We estimate our Q1 2015 diluted share count to range between 37.4 million shares and 37.6 million shares.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

And I think, specifically, what I'd like to understand better is the reason it's been more volatile in the last few quarters. Kind of maybe asking the impact beyond the simple math of how many systems you sell in a given quarter and the stocking associated with it. But why is that more volatile?

In this last quarter, it was timing of various types of orders, including stocking orders associated with new system sales. Fewer of those coming through in the quarter than may have been according to historical norms. You have timing of orders with international distributors and just general timing of orders. So -- and as I mentioned earlier, not so much to do with things like procedure mix. And so is there a pattern to this? I think your question is, is there a pattern? I don't think there is. I think these things just tend to fluctuate, quarter-to-quarter and balance out over longer periods of time."

And then I have a quick follow-up."

So on the chole side on pricing, we think that where we are right now on chole pricing, with Single-Site, is really appropriate. If you look at a system that's getting average utilization, the consumables cost of that procedure and compare it to multiport alternatives, we think we're right in there in terms of being competitive. And appropriate value for what Single-Site can bring. So I think we're in a good spot there. I think the biggest thing -- and Patrick alluded to it, and the biggest thing we're hearing back from our customers is that as they look at competition for time on the robot, they're making decisions about which cases get scheduled and which ones don't, and that's a near-term problem. I think, in the U.S., we saw an increase in procedures per system. So that turned around in the year, where we were building capacity in the beginning part of 2014. The field has now been consuming capacity on the robots in the U.S. I think hernia is driving that. And so part of that is this issue of which one does a surgeon and an institution find greater value in? At the moment, they have to make that decision. And I think that's been a primary driver is that competition. And we'll see, over time, if as capacity grows out, and we have a broader set of options for them to choose from, whether that modulates. We'll have to watch over the next few quarters and see how these 2 play together. The economics of hernia are interesting and a little bit different. The laparoscopic hernia repairs use a different mix of instruments than choles do. It's a more expensive mix, using one of our systems instead of laparoscopy allows for trade-out of some more expensive laparoscopic instruments. And so our economic value there is well supported where we are. And currently, I think that looks really good. The other thing is that not all hernias are an exchange between laparoscopy and da Vinci. A lot of them are still done open -- a surprising number is still done open. And the economics also look good there. So hernia economics, the reports we're hearing back are pretty solid and we're feeling like we're in a pretty good position."

And so those have been launched to the market in a staggered way based on conversations with regulators and other pragmatic constraints. So it was unclear as to when different folks would step in to acquire that system, and we've been pleased with the rate at which Xi has been adopted in the U.S. and in Europe, for that matter. So that part has been really good. If you think about colorectal, just to go back to your assertion, colorectal was growing pretty nicely on the Si base already. So there had been interest in pursuit of colorectal. So there is a group of surgeons who are both interested and skilled in moving forward, and Xi allows them to keep going. So in a sense, it's -- that's a virtuous cycle. You have some folks who have experience. Xi gives them a little greater capability as they've stepped in and started to use that, they're starting to explore that greater capability, and that drives further growth and so we've seen that. We've been also pleasantly surprised by feedback from some more of our longer-term customers in urology and gynecology who also have find benefit in Xi that perhaps exceeded what we thought they might in the very beginning."

In the first quarter, we experienced solid growth in procedures, modest system sales growth and increased pressure on product margins. Starting with Procedures, year-over-year growth in the first quarter was approximately 13%. Growth was led by general surgery, particularly hernia repair and colon and rectal resections. Early response by surgeons to the use of da Vinci and early data sets in these procedures are very encouraging. Urology also continued to show growth, maintaining growth rates seen in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year performance in gynecology grew modestly over Q1 of 2014. Procedure outperformance what broad-based and included U.S., Europe and key markets in Asia. Patrick will review Procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
Looking at trends in capital sales for the year, we placed 99 systems in the quarter compared to 87 in the first quarter of 2014. da Vinci Xi continues to draw significant interest from our customers. Sales in Europe are historically lumpy and Q1 sales were lower than Q4 due primarily to the seasonality. System placements and distributor markets were solid in the quarter. In Japan, da Vinci Xi was cleared for sale at the end of Q1. We placed one Si system in Japan in Q1 as customers waited to evaluate Xi. We remain focused on supporting Japanese customers and pursuing reimbursement and continue to make progress in data collection and analysis. 
Turning to costs, margins decreased relative to prior quarters as a result of 3 main drivers. First, manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue for our new system and advanced instruments remain higher than our more mature products. As these new products make up a greater percentage of our sales, our aggregated product margins have declined. Second, service costs for our Xi Imaging System have remained higher than we would have liked as we work new technologies into our supply chain. We are addressing both manufacturing and service costs and we'll pursue the reduction diligently over the next several quarters. Finally, the strength of the dollar was a negative in [indiscernible]. In the first quarter, financial and operational hedges have offset some of the impact of exchange rates, although we expect the impact of exchange rates to increase through the year. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call. 
In summary, our operating performance for the first quarter is as follows: Procedures grew 13% over the first quarter of last year; we placed 99 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 87 in the first quarter of 2014; total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $532 million, up 9% from prior year and up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $277 million, [indiscernible] 8% over the prior year; we generated a pro forma operating profit of $185 million in the quarter compared with $189 million in the first quarter of 2014; and pro forma net income was $135 million compared to $139 million in Q4 -- in Q1 of 2014. 
In product development, we are rounding out our Xi system offering by launching additional [indiscernible] instruments, development Single-Site for our Xi system and integrating table motion on to the Xi platform. We expect to submit our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with our Xi System in the third quarter, file the 510(k) for Xi Single-Site instruments for the year. For da Vinci SP, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development remains on track, with system integration and laboratory testing in process. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review our financial performance."
30239,288699584,791418,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairment. We are provid",1649,"Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairment. We are providing pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Pro forma first quarter revenue was $532 million, an increase of 9% compared with $490 million for the first quarter of 2014 and down 11% from last quarter. On a constant currency basis, pro forma first quarter revenue increased 11% over the prior year. First quarter 2014 pro forma revenue includes revenue for systems where we subsequently offered a trade out -- to trade out Si products for Xi products. These trade out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. 
Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 8% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and declined 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth partially offset by lower instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. The decrease from prior quarter primarily reflects procedure seasonality. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,840 per procedure compared with $1,930 in the first quarter of 2014, and $1,820 last quarter. The decrease relative to the prior year reflects the impact of foreign exchange, lower Si vessel sealer generators and Firefly kits, lower instrument usage per case as surgeons become more efficient in their instrument usage, partially offset by increasing stocking orders. The increase relative to the previous quarter primarily reflects increased stocking orders and customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Pro forma system revenue of $141 million increased 9% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and decreased 33% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in systems revenues compared with the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonality of system sales and lower system sales in Japan as customers anticipated Xi approval. 99 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 87 systems in the first quarter of 2013 and 137 systems last quarter. 76% was [indiscernible] placed in the first quarter were Xis compared with 71% in the fourth quarter. Xi was launched in April of 2014. 
Globally, our system ASP of 1,480,000 was approximately the same as the first quarter of last year and decreased relative to last quarter ASP of 1,550,000 [ph]. Relative to the first quarter of 2014, system in ASPs were higher due to the introduction of Xi, which was offset by geographic mix, a higher Si trade-in credit mix and foreign exchange. The decrease in ASP is relative to last quarter, reflects higher trading credits and foreign exchange partially offset by an increased mix of Xi product including Xi Dual Consoles. 
Hospital signage is approximately 14% of the systems placed in the first quarter down from 15% last quarter. We directly financed 11 systems, of which 9 were structured as operating leases. Through the first quarter of 2015, we have entered into 23 operating leases. In the U.S., we placed 63 systems in the first quarter compared with 45 systems in the first quarter of 2014 and 71 systems in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase compared with prior years reflects market acceptance of the Xi and procedure growth. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter reflects seasonality in system sales. Outside of the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 42 in the first quarter of 2014 and 66 systems last quarter. The reduction in year-over-year system placements includes a reduction in Japan system placements. One system this quarter compared with 19 systems last quarter as customers anticipated the Xi approval. We received Xi approval in Japan in late March. Europe system placements grew from 14 systems in 2014 to 18 systems in the first quarter of 2015. We also placed 8 systems in China this year compared with 0 in the first quarter of 2014. The reduction in system placements relative to the prior quarter reflects seasonality. 
International revenue results were as follows: First quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. was $150 million compared with $155 million for the first quarter of 2014 and $197 million last quarter. The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower Japan system revenue of over $30 million and the impact of foreign exchange partially offset by higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth and higher system placements in the Europe and Rest Of World markets. Our lower sequential international revenue primarily reflects seasonality. First quarter 2015 OUS procedure volume was approximately 22% higher than the first quarter of 2014 and 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Procedure growth was led by dVP but also reflected strong growth in gynecology and general surgery. 
Before moving on to the remainder of the P&L, I'd like to outline the impact of the strengthening of the dollar had on our results. We generally hedged a portion of our expected revenue for 6 month period in January and July. In addition, we purchased system components from suppliers in euros and paid our sales force in local currencies providing for natural hedges. The pretax impact of currency movement net of hedges relative to the fourth quarter was less than $1 million. However, relative to the first quarter of 2014, currency movement had the impact of lowering our revenue to 9% versus 11% on a constant currency basis. Note that approximately 17% of our first quarter 2015 revenue was transacted in other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in euro and yen, a natural hedges, only partially offset the impact of currency movements on revenue. The impact of the past year's currency changes will have a more pronounced impact going forward particularly after our January hedges expire in July. 
Moving to the remainder of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was 65.6% compared with 70.2% from the first quarter of 2014 and 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage relative to prior quarter, primarily reflect a high mix of Xi Systems which have a lower margin than our mature Si products as well as costs associated with our Drake and Scope recalls. New products like Xi and Stapler have lower gross margins earlier in the life cycle than our mature products. We believe our efforts to reduce the cost of these products will begin to deliver limited improvement in our gross margins by the end of this year, and greater improvement in fiscal 2016. The costs associated with the drape and scope recall -- product recalls are now expected to continue. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability claims under our agreement. In the second and fourth quarters of 2014, we recorded another $15 million of charges reflecting additional claims. In the first quarter of 2015, we refined our estimated overall cost of settling claims we recorded $7 million of additional reserves. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process. 
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP were up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and were down 1% compared with last quarter. Our first quarter 2015 pro forma operating expense compared to the first quarter of 2014 reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 27% for all of 2014. The pro forma effective tax rate for 2014 benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years where we have completed our IRS audit or jurisdictions where statute of limitations has now expired. In addition, the 2014 rate benefited from the reinstatement of the Federal Research and Development Credit. Our tax rate fluctuate with changes of a mix of OUS and U.S. income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit unless such credit is reinstated.  Our pro forma net income was $135 million or $3.57 per share, compared with $139 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2014 and $184 million or $4.92 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared with $465 million for the first quarter of 2014 and $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 compared with $44 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of 2014 and $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased 30,000 shares for $15 million at an average price of $495 per share. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

A meaningful uptick in U.S. procedure",1229,"Thanks, Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total first [ph] quarter year-over-year procedures grew approximately 13% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 22%. A meaningful uptick in U.S. procedure growth rates during the first quarter was largely due to a return to a more normal Q4 to Q1 transition relative to what we experienced during the first quarter of 2014. U.S. da Vinci process procedure growth experienced in the second half of 2014 continued through the first half of 2015. Given our high rate of penetration in the U.S. [indiscernible] market our dVP volumes are likely to track overall U.S. [indiscernible] volumes which has improved over the past 3 quarters. Taking cancer procedures continue to be a solid contributor to our U.S. urology procedure growth during the first quarter. In U.S. gynecology, modest growth returned in Q1 led by benign and malignant hysterectomies. We believe that the modest increase in da Vinci benign hysterectomy volume during the first quarter has more to do with the return to normal seasonality and a change in the trajectory of the total market for benign hysterectomies. We continue to believe that our procedure volumes are likely to track to the overall benign hysterectomy market estimated to be declining at a low single-digit rate. Despite the high levels of da Vinci penetration for malignant hysterectomy, growth remains consistent in cancer procedures. 
Moving on to U.S. general surgery, adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal and hernia adoption remains a source of strength, while cholecystectomy has continued to decline in the quarter. During the quarter, there were positive developments for the adoption of da Vinci surgery and colorectal resections and hernia repair. For colorectal resections, return of our Si Stapler and modular Xi Stapler were positively received by surgeons. With our Stapler, the surgeons are reporting that the improved articulation and stability of the platform enables use deep in the pelvis for rectal resections, while improved dexterity is supporting an evolving technique of intracorporeal [indiscernible] and right [indiscernible] the momentum behind adoption of da Vinci surgery and [indiscernible] hernia repair continues to build. At the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons annual meeting and the Global Symposium on Robotic Assisted and Minimally Invasive Hernia Repair, surgeons shared cases that show da Vinci surgery contributed to improved clinical outcomes within their practice and made service tools to expand minimally invasive surgery to a larger population of patients. A number of surgeons have reported that the material operating costs associated with their da Vinci procedures is similar to the cost of laparoscopic procedures as da Vinci technique enables substitution of high-cost instruments such as tacks and balloons. 
Looking abroad, first quarter international procedures growth were approximately 23% [ph] continued to be led by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery. In Asia, dVP adoption in Japan remains a source of strength in the first quarter. The clinical trial to support a reimbursement submission for partial nephrectomy continued enrollment and we continue to explore reimbursement pathways for additional procedures. In China, initial utilization of the system sold in the second half of 2014 contributed to international procedure growth. In Europe, dVP adoption continue to be the primary driver of procedure growth in the first quarter, with solid contributions from Gynecologic Oncology in colorectal procedures. During the quarter, doctor and colleagues in the hospital within the United Kingdom's National Health Service published on the impact of da Vinci surgery has had on the Gynecologic Oncology service in the Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer-Assisted Surgery. In the study of 196 radical hysterectomies, the rate of laparotomy decreased from 60% pre-da Vinci to 26% following the adoption of da Vinci surgery. Clinical outcomes improved as complications and blood loss reduced and length of stay decreased by 2 days. And average cost per patient decreased by about 1,400 pounds or about 1,200 pounds when system depreciation was modeled, while noted that the hospital's existing had capacity not been consumed by their urologists. In a detailed cost analysis, da Vinci Surgery was found to be the least expensive method with GBP 407,900  versus GBP 12,500 pounds worth of surgery and GBP 10,000  for laparoscopic surgery with the da Vinci surgery costs remaining lowest at GBP 8,500 pounds when model depreciation was included. These results are similar to papers from the U.S., Canada and [ph] that report clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of da Vinci surgery for gynecologic oncology. 
During the quarter, there were several large-scale database studies published according supporting the role of da Vinci Surgery. Two studies in interest pertained to benign hysterectomy and partial nephrectomy. The first study used premier database of nearly 300,000 benign hysterectomies from 156 hospitals that adopted da Vinci following FDA clearance for gynecologic surgery in 2005. All despite doctor and colleagues from the hospitals in Central Connecticut were support from Intuitive. The Study minimally invasive surgery increase from 40% to 67% from 2005 to 2010. the increase of minimally invasive surgery came from both adoption of da Vinci surgery and expansion of laparoscopy. The profile of the da Vinci patient cohort is similar to the open cohort with higher comorbidities, larger [indiscernible] and a greater rate of morbid obesity in the laparoscopic and vaginal cohorts. Despite this more complex patient mix, da Vinci Surgery experienced a lower complication than open, lap or vaginal procedures. This lower complication rate was also true during the initial 25 case series of a newly adopting surgeon compared to the mature rates of laparoscopic surgery. Conversion rates were also lower in the da Vinci Surgery ARM compared in the laparoscopic ARM. While da Vinci procedures took longer than the other 3 modalities, experienced surgeons were able to achieve similar operating times to laparoscopy. There has been earlier studies published from the premier database of that compared da Vinci surgery to laparoscopic procedures within the narrower patient population that is minimal for laparoscopy. But this study showed the da Vinci patient operations were closer in profile to open surgery patients and that da Vinci currently improved clinical outcomes. 
The second study analyzed kidney cancer from within the Medicare surveillance, epidemiology and end results database to assess whether access to da Vinci systems enabled greater adherence to surgical society guidelines for partial nephrectomy and the clinical and economic impact da Vinci Surgery has had on kidney cancer populations. [indiscernible] led by doctor Chong from Harvard studied over 27,000 kidney cancer patients through partial and total nephrectomies from 1995 to 2010 and published the results in health affairs. The laparoscopic communities that had access to a da Vinci system were consistently more likely to have a higher rate of partial nephrectomies compared to nephrectomies than those communities that did not have da Vinci system with an average 52% increase in the rate of partial nephrectomy penetration. Patients in these communities experience lower rates of mortality [indiscernible]. 
These improved outcomes led to 5-year net benefit and quality adjusted life years of about $100,000 per patient. The offers concluded that the benefits of da Vinci surgery outweigh the costs by a ratio of 5:1 from a payer and patient perspective. intuitive provided financial services in this study. This concludes my remarks and I thank you for time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 7% to 10% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. No",350,"Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 7% to 10% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. Now based upon continued strength in U.S. general surgery procedures, particularly hernia repair, favorable dVP macro trends and solid international procedure growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 8% to 11%. 
Turning to gross profit, our full year 2014 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4% of revenue. During 2015, at today's exchange rate, we expect the stronger U.S. dollar will reduce gross profit by about 200 basis points for the year. Excluding this exchange impact, we anticipate our full year 2015 gross profit margin will be roughly flat with 2014 on a constant currency basis. We expect gross margin to increase by quarter in 2015 as the positive effects of our product cost reductions take effect. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rate. 
Turning to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecasted to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. We now expect to grow operating expenses towards the lower end of this range. We now expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2015 compared to $180 million to $185 million forecast on our last call and $169 million in 2014. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $14 million and $16 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily upon the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast has not assumed the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2013.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

I think long-term there, that's moving in a positive direction for us, how big that total market is still a little bit hard to estimate, but the early returns there look like surgeons are finding value pretty quickly. When you look at renal hernia, there's subsegments in that. And so that one, that picture is a little more complicated or a little more nuanced. There are clearly some cases that are more complex, either because the disease is more advanced or because the patient has comorbidities in which da Vinci really is delivering value and we're getting a lot of great feedback and there are other procedures that are a little simpler and a little different where we use maybe a little bit more optional. I think we're going to have to let how that play out. On the renal side, there's clearly a segment that matters and there are some other segments that may be less so and we won't know that for sure until we see a few quarters pass."

One is foreign exchange I believe our original estimates back in January, and that has a negative impact on us. Second thing is as we head in the quarter, we had some a higher mix of Xi Systems, and Xi Systems, as we've said before, have lower margins than our Si Systems. And then, finally, we had some product recall costs that we don't expect to continue. But they reduced our margin this quarter. As we go forward into the year, what our guidance is really predicting is that we are working hard towards reduction of costs associated with our newer products, and it will start to see some benefit from that. Having said that, it takes time, and the majority of the benefit from those efforts will really be realized in 2016."

That's not new for the quarter, we've seen that for the last few but we expect that trend to continue. For sure, you saw a difference in Japan I think year ago Japan, Marshall, the number was 19 down to 1. So that has to do with the things we had talked about prior about Japan both reimbursement and timing of Xi. I think that the real question becomes -- the answer to your question is going to come down to available capacity on systems and existing customers, how hard can they push capacity utilization before they need additional systems. We have a pretty good read on that for single hospitals.

In the first quarter, we experienced solid growth in procedures, modest system sales growth and increased pressure on product margins.
Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the first quarter was approximately 13%. Growth was led by general surgery, particularly hernia repair and colon and rectal resections. Early response by surgeons to the use of da Vinci and early datasets in these procedures are very encouraging. Urology also continued to show growth, maintaining growth rates seen in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year performance in gynecology grew modestly over Q1 of 2014. Procedure outperformance what broad-based and included U.S., Europe and key markets in Asia. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Looking at trends in capital sales for the year, we placed 99 systems in the quarter compared to 87 in the first quarter of 2014. da Vinci Xi continues to draw significant interest from our customers. Sales in Europe are historically lumpy and Q1 sales were lower than Q4 due primarily to seasonality. System placements in distributor markets were solid in the quarter. In Japan, da Vinci Xi was cleared for sale at the end of Q1. We placed one Si System in Japan in Q1 as customers waited to evaluate Xi. We remain focused on supporting Japanese customers and pursuing reimbursement and continue to make progress in data collection and analysis.
Turning to costs. Margins decreased relative to prior quarters as a result of 3 main drivers. First, manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue for our new system and advanced instruments remain higher than our more mature products. As these new products make up a greater percentage of our sales, our aggregated product margins have declined. Second, service costs for our Xi imaging system have remained higher than we would like as we work new technologies into our supply chain. We are addressing both manufacturing and service costs, and we'll pursue the reduction diligently over the next several quarters. Finally, the strength of the dollar was a negative in margins. In the first quarter, financial and operational hedges have offset some of the impact of exchange rates, although we expect the impact of exchange rates to increase through the year. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.
In summary, our operating performance for the first quarter is as follows: procedures grew 13% over the first quarter of last year; we placed 99 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 87 in the first quarter of 2014; total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $532 million, up 9% from prior year and up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $277 million, up 8% over prior year; we generated a pro forma operating profit of $185 million in the quarter compared with $189 million in the first quarter of 2014; and pro forma net income was $135 million compared to $139 million in Q4 -- in Q1 of 2014.
In product development, we are rounding out our Xi System offering by launching additional EndoWrist instruments, developing Single-Site for our Xi System and integrating table motion onto the Xi platform. We expect to submit our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with our Xi System in the third quarter and the 510(k) for Xi Single-Site instruments in the second half of the year. For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development remains on track, with system integration and laboratory testing in process.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review our financial performance."
30239,288699584,791572,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in program, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairment. We are providi",1657,"Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in program, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairment. We are providing pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion.
Pro forma first quarter revenue was $532 million, an increase of 9% compared with $490 million for the first quarter of 2014 and down 11% from last quarter. On a constant currency basis, pro forma first quarter revenue increased 11% over the prior year. First quarter 2014 pro forma revenue includes revenue for systems where we subsequently offered a trade-out, to trade out Si product for Xi product. These trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014.
Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 8% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and declined 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth, partially offset by lower instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. The decrease from prior quarter primarily reflects procedure seasonality.
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,840 per procedure compared with $1,930 in the first quarter of 2014, and $1,820 last quarter. The decrease relative to the prior year reflects the impact of foreign exchange, lower Si vessel sealer generators and Firefly kits, lower instrument usage per case as surgeons become more efficient in their instrument usage, partially offset by increasing stocking orders. The increase relative to the previous quarter primarily reflects increased stocking orders and customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
Pro forma system revenue of $141 million increased 9% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and decreased 33% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in systems revenue compared with the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonality of system sales and lower system sales in Japan as customers anticipated Xi approval.
99 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 87 systems in the first quarter of 2014 and 137 systems last quarter. 76% of the systems placed in the first quarter were Xis compared with 71% in the fourth quarter. Xi was launched in April of 2014.
Globally, our system ASP of $1,480,000 was approximately the same as the first quarter of last year and decreased relative to last quarter ASP of $1,550,000. Relative to the first quarter of 2014, system ASPs were higher due to the introduction of Xi, which was offset by geographic mix, a higher Si trade-in credit mix and foreign exchange. The decrease in ASPs relative to last quarter reflects higher trade-in credits and foreign exchange, partially offset by an increased mix of Xi product, including Xi Dual Consoles.
Hospitals financed approximately 14% of the systems placed in the first quarter, down from 15% last quarter. We directly financed 11 systems, of which 9 were structured as operating leases. Through the first quarter of 2015, we have entered into 23 operating leases.
In the U.S., we placed 63 systems in the first quarter compared with 45 systems in the first quarter of 2014 and 71 systems in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase compared with prior year reflects market acceptance of the Xi and procedure growth. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter reflects seasonality in system sales. Outside of the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 42 in the first quarter of 2014 and 66 systems last quarter. The reduction in year-over-year system placements includes a reduction in Japan system placements, one system this quarter compared with 19 systems last quarter as customers anticipated the Xi approval. We received Xi approval in Japan in late March. Europe system placements grew from 14 systems in 2014 to 18 systems in the first quarter of 2015. We also placed 8 systems in China this year compared with 0 in the first quarter of 2014. The reduction in system placements relative to the prior quarter reflects seasonality.
International revenue results were as follows: first quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. was $150 million compared with $155 million for the first quarter of 2014 and $197 million last quarter. The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower Japan system revenue of over $30 million and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth and higher system placements into Europe and rest of world markets. Our lower sequential international revenue primarily reflects seasonality.
First quarter 2015 o U.S. procedure volume was approximately 22% higher than the first quarter of 2014 and 12% higher than the first -- than the fourth quarter of 2014. Procedure growth was led by dVP, but also reflected strong growth in gynecology and general surgery.
Before moving on to the remainder of the P&L, I'd like to outline the impact that the strengthening of the dollar has had on our results. We generally hedge a portion of our expected revenue for a 6-month period at the beginning of January and July. In addition, we purchased system components from suppliers in euros and paid our sales force in local currencies providing for natural hedges. The pretax impact of currency movement net of hedges relative to the fourth quarter was less than $1 million. However, relative to the first quarter of 2014, currency movement had the impact of lowering our revenue to 9% versus 11% on a constant currency basis. Note that approximately 17% of our first quarter 2015 revenue was transacted in other than U.S. dollar, primarily in euro and yen, a natural hedges, only partially offset the impact of currency movements on revenue. The impact of the past year's currency changes will have a more pronounced impact going forward particularly after our January hedges expire in July.
Moving to the remainder of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was 65.6% compared with 70.2% from the first quarter of 2014 and 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage relative to prior quarters primarily reflect a high mix of Xi Systems, which have a lower margin than our mature Si products, as well as costs associated with our drape and scope recalls. New products like Xi and stapling have lower gross margins early in their life cycle than our mature products. We believe our efforts to reduce the cost of these products will begin to deliver limited improvement in our gross margins by the end of this year, and greater improvement in fiscal 2016. The costs associated with the drape and scope recall -- product recalls are not expected to continue. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability claims under our tolling agreement. In the second and fourth quarters of 2014, we recorded another $15 million of charges reflecting additional claims. In the first quarter of 2015, we refined our -- estimated the overall cost of settling claims and recorded $7 million of additional reserves. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process.
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, were up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and were down 1% compared with last quarter. Our first quarter 2015 pro forma operating expense compared to the first quarter of 2014 reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.9%, compared with an effective tax rate of 27% for all of 2014. The pro forma effective tax rate for 2014 benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years where we have completed our IRS audit or jurisdictions where statute of limitations has now expired. In addition, the 2014 rate benefited from the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of o U.S. and U.S. income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit unless such credit is reinstated.
Our pro forma net income was $135 million or $3.57 per share, compared with $139 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2014 and $184 million or $4.92 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $532 million for the fourth -- first quarter of 2015 compared with $465 million for the first quarter of 2014 and $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015, compared with $44 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of 2014, and $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased 30,000 shares for $15 million at an average price of $495 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

As mentioned earlier, total first quarter year-over-year procedures grew approximately 13%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 22%. The meaningful uptick in U.S. procedure growth rates during the first quarter was largely due to a return to a more normal Q4-to-Q1 transition relative to what we experienced during the first quarter of 2014.
U.S. da Vinci prostatectomy procedure growth experienced in the second half of 2014 continued through the first half of 2015. Given our high rate of penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market, our dVP volumes are likely to track overall U.S. prostatectomy volumes, which have improved over the past 3 quarters. Kidney cancer procedures continue to be a solid contributor to our U.S. urology procedure growth during the first quarter.
In U.S. gynecology, modest growth returned in Q1 led by benign and malignant hysterectomy. We believe that the modest increase in da Vinci benign hysterectomy volume during the first quarter has more to do with the return to normal seasonality than a change in the trajectory of the total market for benign hysterectomy. We continue to believe that our procedure volumes are likely to track to the overall benign hysterectomy market estimated to be declining at a low single-digit rate. Despite the high levels of da Vinci penetration for malignant hysterectomy, growth remains consistent with cancer procedures.
Moving on to U.S. general surgery, adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal and hernia adoption remains a source of strength, while cholecystectomy has continued to decline in the quarter. During the quarter, there were positive developments supporting the adoption of da Vinci surgery in colorectal resections and hernia repair. For colorectal resections, the return of our Si stapler and modular Xi stapler were positively received by surgeons. With our stapler, surgeons are reporting that the improved articulation and stability of the platform enables use deep in the pelvis for rectal resections, while improved dexterity is supporting an evolving technique of intracorporeal anastomosis and right hemicolectomies. For hernia, the momentum behind adoption of da Vinci surgery in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to build. At the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons annual meeting and the Global Symposium on Robotic-Assisted and Minimally Invasive Hernia Repair, surgeons shared case series that show da Vinci surgery contributed to improved clinical outcomes within their practice and may serve as a tool to expand minimally invasive surgery to a larger population of patients. A number of surgeons have reported that the material operating costs associated with their da Vinci procedures is similar to the cost of laparoscopic procedures as da Vinci technique enables substitution of high-cost instruments such as tacks and balloons.
Looking abroad, first quarter international procedure growth of approximately 22% continued to be led by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures, with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery.
In Asia, dVP adoption in Japan remains a source of strength in the first quarter. The clinical trial to support a reimbursement submission for partial nephrectomy completed enrollment, and we continue to explore reimbursement pathways for additional procedures.
In China, strong initial utilization of the system sold in the second half of 2014 contributed to international procedure growth.
In Europe, dVP adoption continued to be the primary driver of procedure growth in the first quarter, with solid contributions from gynecologic oncology and colorectal procedures. During the quarter, Dr. Ind and colleagues from The Royal Marsden hospital within the United Kingdom's National Health Service published on the impact da Vinci surgery has had on the gynecologic oncology service in the Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. In the study of 196 radical hysterectomies, the rate of laparotomy decreased from 60% pre-da Vinci to 26% following the adoption of da Vinci surgery. Clinical outcomes improved as complications and blood loss were reduced and length of stay decreased by 2 days. And average cost per patient decreased by about GBP 1,400 or about GBP 1,200 when system depreciation was modeled, though the operator noted that the hospital's existing system had capacity not being consumed by their urologists. In a detailed cost analysis, da Vinci surgery was found to be the least expensive method reported at GBP 7,900 versus GBP 12,500 for open surgery and GBP 10,000 for laparoscopic surgery, with the da Vinci surgery cost remaining lowest at GBP 8,500 when model depreciation was included. These results are similar to papers from the U.S., Canada and Sweden that report clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of da Vinci surgery for gynecologic oncology.
During the quarter, there were several large-scale database studies published supporting the role of da Vinci surgery. Two studies of interest pertained to benign hysterectomy and partial nephrectomy. The first study used the Premier database of nearly 300,000 benign hysterectomies from 156 hospitals that adopted da Vinci following FDA clearance for gynecologic surgery in 2005. Published by Dr. Luciano and colleagues from The Hospital of Central Connecticut with support from Intuitive. The study determined that the rate of minimally invasive surgery increased from 40% to 67% from 2005 to 2010. The increase of minimally invasive surgery came from both the adoption of da Vinci surgery and the expansion of laparoscopy. The profile of the da Vinci patient cohort was similar to the open cohort, with higher comorbidities, larger uteri and a greater rate of morbid obesity than the laparoscopic and vaginal cohorts. Despite this more complex patient mix, da Vinci surgery experienced a lower complication rate than open, lap or vaginal procedures. This lower complication rate was also true during the initial 25 case series of a newly adopting surgeon compared to mature rates of lap or open surgery. Conversion rates were also lower in the da Vinci surgery arm compared with the laparoscopic arm. While da Vinci procedures took longer than the other 3 modalities, experienced surgeons were able to achieve similar operating times to laparoscopy. There have been earlier studies published from the Premier database that compared da Vinci surgery to laparoscopic procedures within the narrower patient population that is amenable to laparoscopy, but this study showed da Vinci patient operations were closer in profile to open surgery patients and that da Vinci currently improved clinical outcomes.
The second study analyzed kidney cancer from within the Medicare Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database to assess whether access to da Vinci systems enabled greater adherence to surgical society guidelines for partial nephrectomy and the clinical and economic impact da Vinci Surgery has had on kidney cancer populations. A team of health economists led by Dr. Chandra from Harvard studied over 27,000 kidney cancer patients through partial and total nephrectomies from 1995 to 2010 and published the results in Health Affairs. The authors found a community that had access to a da Vinci system were consistently more likely to have a higher rate of partial nephrectomies compared to total nephrectomies than those communities that did not have da Vinci system, with an average 52% increase in the rate of partial nephrectomy penetration. Patients in these communities experienced lower rates of mortality in renal failure.
These improved outcomes led to 5-year net benefit in quality-adjusted life years of about $100,000 per patient. The authors concluded that the benefits of da Vinci surgery outweighed the costs by a ratio of 5:1 from a payer and patient perspective. Intuitive provided financial support for this study.
This concludes my remarks, and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 7% to 10% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. Now based upon continued strength in U.S. general surgery procedures, particularly hernia repair, favorable dVP macro trends and solid international procedure growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 8% to 11%.
Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2014 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4% of revenue. During 2015, at today's exchange rate, we expect the stronger U.S. dollar will reduce gross profit by about 200 basis points for the year. Excluding this exchange impact, we anticipate our full year 2015 gross profit margin will be roughly flat with 2014 on a constant currency basis. We expect gross margin to increase by quarter in 2015 as the positive impacts of our product cost reductions take effect. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.
Turning to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecasted to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. We now expect to grow operating expenses towards the lower end of this range. We now expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2015, compared to $180 million to $185 million forecast on our last call and $169 million in 2014. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $14 million and $16 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily upon the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.

The early response from surgeons and the data looks quite good. I think long term there, that's moving in a positive direction for us. How big that total market is still a little bit hard to estimate, but the early returns there look like surgeons are finding value pretty quickly. When you look at inguinal hernia, there are some subsegments in that. And so that one, that picture is a little more complicated or a little more nuanced. There are clearly some cases that are more complex, either because the disease is more advanced or because the patient has comorbidities in which da Vinci really is delivering value, and we're getting a lot of great feedback. And there are some other procedures that are a little simpler and a little different where its use may be a little bit more optional. I think we're going to have to let that play out. So I think on the inguinal side, there's clearly a segment that matters and there are some other segments that may be less so, and we won't know that for sure until we see a few quarters pass."

I think that hernia would continue on its growth rate. It's on a fast growth rate. I think as surgeons find value as those publications come out, I think that would support the higher end. Urology has had some macro environment positives. We would have to see those continue to be at the high end. And then gynecology has stabilized in this quarter, although we think as Patrick has described in his prepared remarks, that hysterectomy, the fundamentals around hysterectomy are likely staying about the same environmentally. We think that we're really just looking at Q1-over-Q1 changes here. So to be on the high end, I think you have to see positive support there and a stabilization of the cole business."

And primarily, I think at least in my view, the biggest lever is probably around the ASP, both on instruments and for the systems. If I look at this over several years, they tend to be declining and the argument that Xi is a greater percentage of mix, that seems to be the way of the future, I guess, in where systems are going.

On the U.S. side, we see hospital systems, particularly corporate ownership, optimizing their capital portfolio. It actually makes perfect sense. And so what they're doing is looking at where they want their systems, both within a hospital and between hospitals that they own. We support them in doing that. And that, I think, will drive capacity consumption. And so on those very customers, they're doing that, and we see that. That's not new for the quarter. We've seen that for the last few, but I expect that trend to continue. For sure, you saw a difference in Japan. I think a year ago in Japan, Marshall, the number was 19 down to 1. So that has to do with the things we had talked about prior about Japan, both reimbursement and timing of Xi. I think that the real question becomes -- the answer to your question is going to come down to available capacity on systems in existing customers. How hard can they push capacity utilization before they need additional systems. We have a pretty good read on that for single hospitals. What changes the dynamic is corporate-owned hospital groups, where they're willing to either move doctors, move patients or move systems to get higher utilization.

I wouldn't tag one particular thing as the general trend here. In terms of Xi cost reductions, the work that we're doing tends to be a fair number of little things.

It's really optimizing both component manufacturing, looking at manufacturing yields in various parts of the line and working with suppliers who have better processes. So it's a lot of little work, and I wouldn't tag it to one thing in particular. On the service side, some of it is really getting to utilization of our products and what service costs are, both in terms of building out the field replaceable units in the field. So there's some investments to make that happen, as well as optimizing kind of the ruggedness of some products in some environments. And so that's the main focus on that product side.

So part of the reason that you go through a process of optimization over a couple of years is that it takes that long to get through the volume changes that you need to make and also to do some of the manufacturing optimizations. Just not possible to do it on very low volumes ahead of time. So it is generally expected that you'll have a margin hit when one of the new pieces of capital come in. And so we would expect some.

In the first quarter, we experienced solid growth in procedures, modest system sales growth and increased pressure on product margins.
Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the first quarter was approximately 13%. Growth was led by general surgery, particularly hernia repair and colon and rectal resections. Early response by surgeons to the use of da Vinci and early datasets in these procedures are very encouraging. Urology also continued to show growth, maintaining growth rates seen in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year performance in gynecology grew modestly over Q1 of 2014. Procedure outperformance was broad-based and included the U.S., Europe and key markets in Asia. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Looking at trends in capital sales for the year, we placed 99 systems in the quarter compared to 87 in the first quarter of 2014. da Vinci Xi continues to draw significant interest from our customers. Sales in Europe are historically lumpy and Q1 sales were lower than Q4 due primarily to seasonality. System placements in distributor markets were solid in the quarter. In Japan, da Vinci Xi was cleared for sale at the end of Q1. We placed one Si System in Japan in Q1 as customers waited to evaluate Xi. We remain focused on supporting Japanese customers and pursuing reimbursement and continue to make progress in data collection and analysis.
Turning to costs. Margins decreased relative to prior quarters as a result of 3 main drivers. First, manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue for our new system and advanced instruments remain higher than our more mature products. As these new products make up a greater percentage of our sales, our aggregated product margins have declined. Second, service costs for our Xi imaging system have remained higher than we would like as we work new technologies into our supply chain. We are addressing both manufacturing and service costs, and we'll pursue the reduction diligently over the next several quarters. Finally, the strength of the dollar was a negative in margins. In the first quarter, financial and operational hedges have offset some of the impact of exchange rates, although we expect the impact of exchange rates to increase through the year. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.
In summary, our operating performance for the first quarter is as follows: procedures grew 13% over the first quarter of last year; we placed 99 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 87 in the first quarter of 2014; total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $532 million, up 9% from prior year and up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $277 million, up 8% over prior year; we generated a pro forma operating profit of $185 million in the quarter compared with $189 million in the first quarter of 2014; and pro forma net income was $135 million compared to $139 million in Q4 -- in Q1 of 2014.
In product development, we are rounding out our Xi System offering by launching additional EndoWrist instruments, developing Single-Site for our Xi System and integrating table motion onto the Xi platform. We expect to submit our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with our Xi System in the third quarter and the 510(k) for Xi Single-Site instruments in the second half of the year. For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development remains on track, with system integration and laboratory testing in process.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review our financial performance."
30239,288699584,791588,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in program, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairment. We are providi",1657,"Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in program, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairment. We are providing pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion.
Pro forma first quarter revenue was $532 million, an increase of 9% compared with $490 million for the first quarter of 2014 and down 11% from last quarter. On a constant currency basis, pro forma first quarter revenue increased 11% over the prior year. First quarter 2014 pro forma revenue includes revenue for systems where we subsequently offered a trade-out, to trade out Si product for Xi product. These trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014.
Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 8% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and declined 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth, partially offset by lower instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. The decrease from prior quarter primarily reflects procedure seasonality.
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,840 per procedure compared with $1,930 in the first quarter of 2014, and $1,820 last quarter. The decrease relative to the prior year reflects the impact of foreign exchange, lower Si vessel sealer generators and Firefly kits, lower instrument usage per case as surgeons become more efficient in their instrument usage, partially offset by increasing stocking orders. The increase relative to the previous quarter primarily reflects increased stocking orders and customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
Pro forma system revenue of $141 million increased 9% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and decreased 33% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in systems revenue compared with the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonality of system sales and lower system sales in Japan as customers anticipated Xi approval.
99 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 87 systems in the first quarter of 2014 and 137 systems last quarter. 76% of the systems placed in the first quarter were Xis compared with 71% in the fourth quarter. Xi was launched in April of 2014.
Globally, our system ASP of $1,480,000 was approximately the same as the first quarter of last year and decreased relative to last quarter ASP of $1,550,000. Relative to the first quarter of 2014, system ASPs were higher due to the introduction of Xi, which was offset by geographic mix, a higher Si trade-in credit mix and foreign exchange. The decrease in ASPs relative to last quarter reflects higher trade-in credits and foreign exchange, partially offset by an increased mix of Xi product, including Xi Dual Consoles.
Hospitals financed approximately 14% of the systems placed in the first quarter, down from 15% last quarter. We directly financed 11 systems, of which 9 were structured as operating leases. Through the first quarter of 2015, we have entered into 23 operating leases.
In the U.S., we placed 63 systems in the first quarter compared with 45 systems in the first quarter of 2014 and 71 systems in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase compared with prior years reflects market acceptance of the Xi and procedure growth. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter reflects seasonality in system sales. Outside of the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 42 in the first quarter of 2014 and 66 systems last quarter. The reduction in year-over-year system placements includes a reduction in Japan system placements, one system this quarter compared with 19 systems last quarter as customers anticipated the Xi approval. We received Xi approval in Japan in late March. Europe system placements grew from 14 systems in 2014 to 18 systems in the first quarter of 2015. We also placed 8 systems in China this year compared with 0 in the first quarter of 2014. The reduction in system placements relative to the prior quarter reflects seasonality.
International revenue results were as follows: first quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. was $150 million compared with $155 million for the first quarter of 2014 and $197 million last quarter. The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower Japan system revenue of over $30 million and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth and higher system placements into Europe and rest of world markets. Our lower sequential international revenue primarily reflects seasonality.
First quarter 2015 o U.S. procedure volume was approximately 22% higher than the first quarter of 2014 and 12% higher than the first -- than the fourth quarter of 2014. Procedure growth was led by dVP, but also reflected strong growth in gynecology and general surgery.
Before moving on to the remainder of the P&L, I'd like to outline the impact that the strengthening of the dollar has had on our results. We generally hedge a portion of our expected revenue for a 6-month period at the beginning of January and July. In addition, we purchase system components from suppliers in euros and pay our sales force in local currencies providing for natural hedges. The pretax impact of currency movements net of hedges relative to the fourth quarter was less than $1 million. However, relative to the first quarter of 2014, currency movement had the impact of lowering our revenue to 9% versus 11% on a constant currency basis. Note that approximately 17% of our first quarter 2015 revenue was transacted in other than U.S. dollar, primarily in euro and yen, in natural hedges only partially offset the impact of currency movements on revenue. The impact of the past year's currency changes will have a more pronounced impact going forward particularly after our January hedges expire in July.
Moving to the remainder of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was 65.6% compared with 70.2% in the first quarter of 2014 and 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage relative to prior quarters primarily reflect a high mix of Xi Systems, which have a lower margin than our mature Si products, as well as costs associated with our Drape and scope recalls. New products like Xi and stapling have lower gross margins early in their life cycle than our mature products. We believe our efforts to reduce the cost of these products will begin to deliver limited improvement in our gross margins by the end of this year, and greater improvement in fiscal 2016. The costs associated with the Drape and scope recall -- product recalls are not expected to continue. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability claims under a tolling agreement. In the second and fourth quarters of 2014, we recorded another $15 million of charges reflecting additional claims. In the first quarter of 2015, we refined our -- estimated the overall cost of settling claims and recorded $7 million of additional reserves. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process.
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, were up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and were down 1% compared with last quarter. Our first quarter 2015 pro forma operating expense compared to the first quarter of 2014 reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.9%, compared with an effective tax rate of 27% for all of 2014. The pro forma effective tax rate for 2014 benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years where we have completed our IRS audit or jurisdictions where statute of limitations has now expired. In addition, the 2014 rate benefited from the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of o U.S. and U.S. income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit unless such credit is reinstated.
Our pro forma net income was $135 million or $3.57 per share, compared with $139 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2014 and $184 million or $4.92 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $532 million for the fourth -- first quarter of 2015 compared with $465 million for the first quarter of 2014 and $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015, compared with $44 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of 2014, and $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased 30,000 shares for $15 million at an average price of $495 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

The meaningful uptick in U.S. procedure gr",1256,"Thanks, Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total first quarter year-over-year procedures grew approximately 13%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 22%. The meaningful uptick in U.S. procedure growth rates during the first quarter was largely due to a return to a more normal Q4-to-Q1 transition relative to what we experienced during the first quarter of 2014.
U.S. da Vinci prostatectomy procedure growth experienced in the second half of 2014 continued through the first half of 2015. Given our high rate of penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market, our dVP volumes are likely to track overall U.S. prostatectomy volumes, which have improved over the past 3 quarters. Kidney cancer procedures continue to be a solid contributor to our U.S. urology procedure growth during the first quarter.
In U.S. gynecology, modest growth returned in Q1 led by benign and malignant hysterectomies. We believe that the modest increase in da Vinci benign hysterectomy volume during the first quarter has more to do with the return to normal seasonality than a change in the trajectory of the total market for benign hysterectomies. We continue to believe that our procedure volumes are likely to track to the overall benign hysterectomy market estimated to be declining at a low single-digit rate. Despite the high levels of da Vinci penetration for malignant hysterectomy, growth remains consistent with cancer procedures.
Moving on to U.S. general surgery, adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal and hernia adoption remains a source of strength, while cholecystectomy has continued to decline in the quarter. During the quarter, there were positive developments supporting the adoption of da Vinci surgery in colorectal resections and hernia repair. For colorectal resections, the return of our Si stapler and modular Xi stapler were positively received by surgeons. With our stapler, surgeons are reporting that the improved articulation and stability of the platform enables use deep in the pelvis for rectal resections, while improved dexterity is supporting an evolving technique of intracorporeal anastomosis and right hemicolectomies. For hernia, the momentum behind adoption of da Vinci surgery in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to build. At the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons annual meeting and the Global Symposium on Robotic-Assisted and Minimally Invasive Hernia Repair, surgeons shared case series that shows da Vinci surgery contributed to improved clinical outcomes within their practice and may serve as a tool to expand minimally invasive surgery to a larger population of patients. A number of surgeons have reported that the material operating costs associated with their da Vinci procedures is similar to the cost of laparoscopic procedures as da Vinci technique enables substitution of high-cost instruments such as tacks and balloons.
Looking abroad, first quarter international procedure growth of approximately 22% continued to be led by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures, with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery.
In Asia, dVP adoption in Japan remains a source of strength in the first quarter. The clinical trial to support a reimbursement submission for partial nephrectomy completed enrollment, and we continue to explore reimbursement pathways for additional procedures.
In China, strong initial utilization of the system sold in the second half of 2014 contributed to international procedure growth.
In Europe, dVP adoption continued to be the primary driver of procedure growth in the first quarter, with solid contributions from gynecologic oncology and colorectal procedures. During the quarter, Dr. Ind and colleagues from The Royal Marsden hospital within the United Kingdom's National Health Service published on the impact da Vinci surgery has had on the gynecologic oncology service in the Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. In the study of 196 radical hysterectomies, the rate of laparotomy decreased from 60% pre-da Vinci to 26% following the adoption of da Vinci surgery. Clinical outcomes improved as complications and blood loss were reduced and length of stay decreased by 2 days. And average cost per patient decreased by about GBP 1,400 or about GBP 1,200 when system depreciation was modeled, though the operator noted that the hospital's existing system had capacity not being consumed by their urologists. In a detailed cost analysis, da Vinci surgery was found to be the least expensive method reported at GBP 7,900 versus GBP 12,500 for open surgery and GBP 10,000 for laparoscopic surgery, with the da Vinci surgery cost remaining lowest at GBP 8,500 when model depreciation was included. These results are similar to papers from the U.S., Canada and Sweden that report clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of da Vinci surgery for gynecologic oncology.
During the quarter, there were several large-scale database studies published supporting the role of da Vinci surgery. Two studies of interest pertained to benign hysterectomy and partial nephrectomy. The first study used the Premier database of nearly 300,000 benign hysterectomies from 156 hospitals that adopted da Vinci following FDA clearance for gynecologic surgery in 2005. Published by Dr. Luciano and colleagues from The Hospital of Central Connecticut with support from Intuitive, the study determined that the rate of minimally invasive surgery increased from 40% to 67% from 2005 to 2010. The increase of minimally invasive surgery came from both the adoption of da Vinci surgery and the expansion of laparoscopy. The profile of the da Vinci patient cohort was similar to the open cohort, with higher comorbidities, larger uteri and a greater rate of morbid obesity than the laparoscopic and vaginal cohorts. Despite this more complex patient mix, da Vinci surgery experienced a lower complication rate than open, lap or vaginal procedures. This lower complication rate was also true during the initial 25 case series of a newly adopting surgeon compared to mature rates of lap or open surgery. Conversion rates were also lower in the da Vinci surgery arm compared with the laparoscopic arm. While da Vinci procedures took longer than the other 3 modalities, experienced surgeons were able to achieve similar operative times to laparoscopy. There have been earlier studies published from the Premier database that compared da Vinci surgery to laparoscopic procedures within the narrower patient population that is amenable to laparoscopy, but this study showed da Vinci patient populations were closer in profile to open surgery patients and that da Vinci surgery improved clinical outcomes.
The second study analyzed kidney cancer from within the Medicare Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database to assess whether access to da Vinci systems enabled greater adherence to surgical society guidelines for partial nephrectomy and the clinical and economic impact da Vinci Surgery has had on kidney cancer populations. A team of health economists led by Dr. Chandra from Harvard studied over 27,000 kidney cancer patients through partial and total nephrectomies from 1995 to 2010 and published the results in Health Affairs. The authors found in communities that had access to a da Vinci system were consistently more likely to have a higher rate of partial nephrectomies compared to total nephrectomies than those communities that did not have a da Vinci system, with an average 52% increase in the rate of partial nephrectomy penetration. Patients in these communities experienced lower rates of mortality and renal failure.
These improved outcomes led to 5-year net benefit in quality-adjusted life years of about $100,000 per patient. The authors concluded that the benefits of da Vinci surgery outweighed the costs by a ratio of 5:1 from a payer and patient perspective. Intuitive provided financial support for this study.
This concludes my remarks, and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 7% to 10% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. Now based upon continued strength in U.S. general surgery procedures, particularly hernia repair, favorable dVP macro trends and solid international procedure growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 8% to 11%.
Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2014 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4% of revenue. During 2015, at today's exchange rate, we expect the stronger U.S. dollar will reduce gross profit by about 200 basis points for the year. Excluding this exchange impact, we anticipate our full year 2015 gross profit margin will be roughly flat with 2014 on a constant currency basis. We expect gross margin to increase by quarter in 2015 as the positive impacts of our product cost reductions take effect. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.
Turning to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecasted to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. We now expect to grow operating expenses towards the lower end of this range. We now expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2015, compared to $180 million to $185 million forecast on our last call and $169 million in 2014. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $14 million and $16 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily upon the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.

The early response from surgeons and the data looks quite good. I think long term there, that's moving in a positive direction for us. How big that total market is still a little bit hard to estimate, but the early returns there look like surgeons are finding value pretty quickly. When you look at inguinal hernia, there are some subsegments in that. And so that one, that picture is a little more complicated or a little more nuanced. There are clearly some cases that are more complex, either because the disease is more advanced or because the patient has comorbidities in which da Vinci really is delivering value, and we're getting a lot of great feedback. And there are some other procedures that are a little simpler and a little different where its use may be a little bit more optional. I think we're going to have to let that play out. So I think on the inguinal side, there's clearly a segment that matters and there are some other segments that may be less so, and we won't know that for sure until we see a few quarters pass."

So for my first question, I wanted to circle back to the gross margin conversation. And I understand that there are a number of puts and takes in the quarter, whether that's FX or recall costs and et cetera. But I was hoping that we could just kind of take a step back and talk about what your assessment is of the long-term trajectory for the gross margin of the businesses. And primarily, I think at least in my view, the biggest lever is probably around the ASP, both on instruments and for the systems. If I look at this over several years, they tend to be declining and the argument that Xi is a greater percentage of mix, that seems to be the way of the future, I guess, in where systems are going. So I just don't understand how we can get back to where that old run rate was. And any more color there will be very helpful."

On the U.S. side, we see hospital systems, particularly corporate ownership, optimizing their capital portfolio. It actually makes perfect sense. And so what they're doing is looking at where they want their systems, both within a hospital and between hospitals that they own. We support them in doing that. And that, I think, will drive capacity consumption. And so on those very customers, they're doing that, and we see that. That's not new for the quarter. We've seen that for the last few, but I expect that trend to continue. For sure, you saw a difference in Japan. I think a year ago in Japan, Marshall, the number was 19 down to 1. So that has to do with the things we had talked about prior about Japan, both reimbursement and timing of Xi. I think that the real question becomes -- the answer to your question's going to come down to available capacity on systems in existing customers. How hard can they push capacity utilization before they need additional systems. We have a pretty good read on that for single hospitals. What changes the dynamic is corporate-owned hospital groups, where they're willing to either move doctors, move patients or move systems to get higher utilization. And that part, it's not yet clear where that will settle."

I wouldn't tag one particular thing as the general trend here. In terms of Xi cost reductions, the work that we're doing tends to be a fair number of little things.

It's really optimizing both component manufacturing, looking at manufacturing yields in various parts of the line and working with suppliers who have better processes. So it's a lot of little work, and I wouldn't tag it to one thing in particular. On the service side, some of it is really getting to utilization of our products and what service costs are, both in terms of building out the field replaceable units in the field. So there's some investments to make that happen, as well as optimizing kind of the ruggedness of some products in some environments. And so that's the main focus on that product side.

So part of the reason that you go through a process of optimization over a couple of years is that it takes that long to get through the volume changes that you need to make and also to do some of the manufacturing optimizations. Just not possible to do it on very low volumes ahead of time. So it is generally expected that you'll have a margin hit when one of the new pieces of capital come in. And so we would expect some.

In the quarter, growth in procedures was healthy, maintaining the rate of growth we expensed in the first quarter and showing solid performance in several specialties and geographies. Our capital performance improved in the quarter, as did our margins.
Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the second quarter was just under 14% compared with Q2 of 2014. Utilization trends present last quarter continued, with strength in hernia repair, solid growth in colon and rectal resections, continued recovery in prostatectomy and stable trends in hysterectomy. Growth in the use of our products was broad-based and included the U.S., Europe and key markets in Asia. Procedures grew strongly in China, and growth was solid in Japan and Korea. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Turning to capital sales. We placed 118 systems in the quarter compared to 96 in the second quarter of 2014. The United States and Japan accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. We see interest across our product line from our multi-quadrant Xi System to our Si System, with customers choosing the system that best fits their programs' needs. In Japan, clearance of Xi system unlocked some system demand, and we sold 13 systems in the quarter compared with 5 a year earlier. Procedure growth in Japan remains healthy given the current state of reimbursement. As we've said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators have submitted their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues to work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement -- for additional procedures. We have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time.
Turning to margins. Our operating teams are focused on reducing product costs for our new products, and we're managing our fixed expenses carefully. This quarter was a step in the right direction on gross margin, though an early one. We will continue to focus on improvements over the next several quarters. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.
In summary, our operating performance for the second quarter is as follows: Procedures grew just under 14% over the second quarter last year. We placed 118 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 96 in the second quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $586 million, up 16% from the prior year and up 20% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $297 million, up 13% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $228 million in the quarter compared with $196 million in the second quarter of 2014, and pro forma net income was $173 million compared to $140 million in Q2 of 2014. In product development, we are rounding out our Xi System offering by launching additional EndoWrist instruments, integrated table motioned with Xi and developing Single-Site for Xi. In Europe in the second quarter, surgeons have performed the first clinical cases using integrated table motion with Xi with enthusiastic feedback. We recently submitted our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with Xi. We anticipate filing our 510(k) for Xi Single-Site in the second half of the year.
We have also broadened the rollout of our white reload for our da Vinci Xi stapler. Feedback on its utility has been positive. Additional Xi EndoWrist instruments have been released in the quarter, continuing to round out our instrument offering for Xi. For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development is progressing with system integration and laboratory testing in progress.
Stepping back and looking at the business at the midway point of the year. We're focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair, filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally, developing our organizational capabilities and markets in Europe and Asia, improving our gross margins and advancing our technologies to improve surgery.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review our financial performance."
30239,306462635,835298,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary.

We",1487,"Thank you, Gary. I will be describing results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization and purchased IP and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Pro forma second quarter revenue was $586 million, an increase of 16% compared with $507 million for the second quarter of 2014 and an increase of 10% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the second quarter of 2014 excludes net revenues associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for an Xi product, trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. Second quarter procedures of approximately 162,000 grew nearly 14% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and approximately 8% compared with the first quarter of 2015.
Revenue highlights are as follows: Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 13% compared with the second quarter of 2014. It increased 7% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth in customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure, approximately the same as the second quarter of 2014 and similar to the approximately $1,840 last quarter. Pro forma system revenue of $176 million increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2014. It increased 25% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase compared with the first quarter primarily reflects increased unit sales. 118 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 96 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 99 systems last quarter. 64% of the systems placed in the second quarter were Xis compared with 52% in the second quarter of 2014 and 76% in the first quarter of 2015. We sold more Sis in the quarter than the previous quarter, reflecting 7 Si system sales under a contract with the Department of Defense and 8 Si system sales in Japan. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $113 million increased 6% year-over-year and decreased $1 million compared with the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase reflects increased -- the increase in our installed base. The decrease compared with the first quarter reflects the timing of service contract renewals and changes in the foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our installed base.
Globally, our system ASP of 1,500,000 was approximately the same as the second quarter of last year. It increased relative to the first quarter ASP of 1,480,000. Relative to the second quarter of 2014, higher ASPs were primarily associated with higher mix of Xis, offset by the impact of the strengthened dollar. The increase in ASPs relative to last quarter reflect geographic mix and lower trading activity. ASPs will fluctuate on a geographic and product mix, trading volume and changes in the foreign exchange rates.
Hospitals financed approximately 21% of the systems placed in the second quarter, up from 14% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which 5 were structured as operating leases. Several customers bought out previously leased systems in the quarter. Although revenue associated with the buyouts are included in total revenue, we've excluded this revenue from the computation of system ASPs. We've also excluded these buyouts from the system placement number.
In the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter compared with 61 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 63 systems in the first quarter of 2015. As previously noted, second quarter system placements in the U.S. included 7 systems sold under our Department of Defense contract. In general, the increase in systems placements relative to prior year reflect growth in procedures and market acceptance of the Xi system. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: Second quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. of $168 million grew 25% compared with $135 million for the second quarter of 2014 and grew 12% compared with $150 million last quarter. The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher Japan system revenue, higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange. The increase compared with last quarter reflects higher Japan systems placements, geographic mix of system placements and procedure growth. Outside the U.S., we placed 46 systems in the second quarter compared with 35 in the second quarter of 2014 and 36 systems last quarter. OUS system placements reflect 13 systems into Japan this quarter compared with 5 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 1 last quarter. We obtained Xi approval in Japan in late March and 5 of the system sold this quarter were Xi systems.
European system placements grew to 22 systems this quarter compared with 19 last year and 18 last quarter. We placed no systems into China this quarter compared with 1 in the second quarter of 2014 and 8 last quarter. As we've indicated in the past and consistent with our history, system placements in our OUS markets will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin in the second quarter of 2015 was 68% compared with 69.2% for the second quarter of 2014 and 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015. The decline in gross margins relative to the second quarter of 2014 is primarily attributable to foreign exchange and a higher mix of newer products, including Xi and stapling. The sequential improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to the completion of activities that resulted in onetime charges in the first quarter and cost of sales efficiency gains.
In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we have refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $7 million in each of the first and second quarters. These charges are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process.
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 10% compared with second quarter of 2014 and increased 4% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase of pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2014 and 28.9% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 benefited from approximately $8 million or the equivalent of $0.21 per share of discrete items, including the release of reserves specific to tax years where we recently completed audits. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated.
Our pro forma net income was $173 million or $4.57 per share compared with $140 million or $3.73 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $512 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $532 million for the first quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.9 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2015. The increase was from primarily driven by cash generated by operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares for $49 million at an average purchase price of $494 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin, who'll go over our procedure and clinical highlights and provide 2015 financial guidance."
30239,306462635,835298,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marshall. Let me begin with a review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximat",1060,"Thanks, Marshall. Let me begin with a review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximately 27%. In the U.S., trends observed during the first quarter largely continued through the second quarter. In neurology, growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at a similar rate as the first quarter. We continue to believe that our prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader U.S. prostate surgery market. In U.S. gynecology, procedures were flat year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, offset by declines in benign procedures. In recent quarters, an increasing proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists. During the second quarter, general surgery remain the primary contributor to U.S. growth with robust growth in hernia repair and solid contribution from colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. During the first half of 2015, ventral and inguinal hernia repair contributed the majority of the increase in U.S. general surgery procedures. The contribution to first half U.S. growth from mature procedures in highly penetrated markets such as da Vinci Prostatectomy and da Vinci malignant and complex hysterectomy has exceeded our expectations. In the second half of 2015, growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy is likely to slow as we anniversary into higher prior year growth rates.
Looking abroad. During the second quarter, international procedure growth was led by a modest acceleration in the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. During the first half of 2015, growth in international da Vinci Prostatectomy was approximately 20%.
Let me take a few moments to provide a bit more color around China. Over the past year, we've sold 20 systems under tenders from among 38 civilian hospitals authorized by the government to acquire a da Vinci system. Procedure adoption has been broad-based in urologic, gynecologic, general and thoracic procedures. While we're encouraged by these developments, future system placements are dependent on completion of the central purchasing tender under the current authorization, which is set to expire at the end of 2015. It is not certain whether the tender process will be completed or when future governmental authorizations and approvals may enable system placements in 2016 and beyond. Procedure growth rates are likely to be governed by the timing of additional system placements.
Moving on to clinical and economic validation. A recent publication from Starland University by Prof. Statle and team evaluated the cost-effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy compared to open prostatectomy from a German payer perspective in a 1,400-patient study partially supported by Intuitive. From a clinical perspective, the robotic patient population showed fewer positive surgical margins and required fewer intraoperative transfusions with a reduction in hospitalization of approximately 6 days. In the economic analysis, the study showed that the robotic patients were roughly EUR 3,000 per patient less expensive as measured by a period from date of surgery to 2 years post operation. The authors concluded that the improved clinical outcomes led to the reduction in postoperative cost.
In the quarter, there was considerable interest in colorectal clinical data with the initial outcomes reported from ROLLAR study. In addition, several other notable studies were published during the quarter.
Let me take a moment to highlight 2 studies from large-scale, statewide, general surgery registries published in Surgical Endoscopy. The first study was published by Dr. Cleary and team from St. Joseph Mercy Health System in Michigan. After reviewing over 2,700 minimally invasive colorectal surgeries from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative Registry, the authors found that conversion rates were lower with robotic compared to laparoscopic procedures for rectal resections, and hospital length of stay was shorter with robotic procedures compared to conventional and hand-assisted laparoscopic colon procedures. The second study was published by Dr. Altieri and colleagues from Stony Brook University in a broad-based study of nearly 170,000 minimally invasive general surgeries from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. The authors found that robotic-assisted procedures had lower rates of complications and hospital length of stay compared to laparoscopy across several general surgeries with a lower rate of complications for colectomies. They concluded, ""Robotic approaches may facilitate safer adoption of minimally invasive approaches in areas where penetrance of conventional laparoscopy is low such as in colorectal surgery.""
This concludes my procedures and critical commentary. I will now be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015.
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 8% to 11% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 13%.
Turning to gross profit. Our outlook for gross profit margin has modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our second half 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67% to 68% of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our second quarter gross margin as Q2 benefited from favorable product and regional system mix and Q3 and Q4 will likely face stronger foreign-exchange headwinds. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.
Turning to operating expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. We now expect our 2015 noncash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of the $170 million to $180 million range forecast in our last call, fairly flat compared to $169 million in 2014. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

I recognize that hernia is both more than one kind of procedure, abdominal hernia or ventral hernia and inguinal hernia. And even within those, there is variation in both technique and patient population. So clearly, right now, there's a mixture of sustained use by our customers and people who are learning and trialing the technology. What that mix looks like in the near term is actually very hard to determine. We do see some early evidence of a strong clinical benefit in some of the categories and segments, and we think that's long-term durable. Calling right now how big those total billable markets are going to be is still premature. So we have some basic estimates. We're working them down. As the quarters go by, we'll be able to increase our certainty of what those long terms look like. With regard to Sp, we're not predicting the shift date at this time. We're on track in our technical developments. We're in conversations with several certain groups as well as regulators about where both long-term value can be and what regulatory pathways are.

The -- with regard to the table motion, just the value of it, why do it, the value of an integrated intraoperative table is that it allows the surgeon to position the patient using gravity. It's something that they do frequently, but also allows the anesthesiologist easier interaction to help manage the patient. And the power of the integration we've done with our partner has been that it allows it to be done quickly and efficiently. So it's fast. So the real value here is to speed up procedures. It allows them to do it seamlessly. And so we don't think it's so much opening a different market as it is making it easier in lowering barriers. The feedback to it -- they've been now used in dozens of cases in Europe, where it has CE Mark. Feedback has been really good, and the implementation done by the team is very, very good. So that looks good, and we're encouraged. We've we submitted a 510(k) just recently, so we'll answer FDA's questions as they come and work through that. It really is rounding out. It's really one of the features that rounds out the Xi platform. Interoperable table motion is a strong beneficiary for general surgery procedures where folks are wanting to move around the abdomen helps a lot in that setting. And so that fact that they can do that dynamically is powerful. Turning to Single-Site on Xi. Single-Site is already available, of course, as you know, on the Si. There's nothing that's technological limitation from putting on the Xi. It's really been doing the work and getting the clearances. What that will enable is the midsize hospital that owns one platform, they may have an Si now, they're doing Single-Site, and they want to upgrade to an Xi. That's complete the set for them so they don't have to step away from something on their Si system when they move to Xi. And so that's really the opportunity for us there, and we're meeting our clinical milestones -- I'm sorry, our technical milestones and working through the set of validations that will be required to get clearance. So we're excited about it."

There's really 3 levers that we've talked about and remain in place. One of them is upgrade for our customer who has a system and is thinking about upgrading from an S or an Si, one of the prior systems. They're really looking out and saying, ""Does Xi bring to them either outcome benefit or new service lines relative to prior products?"" That's where table motion and Single-Site can make a difference, particularly for single-system hospitals. And so we think as those product lines go out, that will help that upgrade pipeline. There are people who just by purely on capacity. They just use the existing capacity of the system. As procedures grow, they look to do additional procedures. They'll buy a second system or so. And the last one is really capacity again but often is in the right place. If you're a larger institution or an integrated delivering network, you may be interested in moving the capacity to a different region or different part of your service network. Sometimes, they do that by moving systems. Sometimes, they do that by buying systems. So capital decisions are really predicated on those 3 pillars."

In the quarter, growth in procedures was healthy, maintaining the rate of growth we experienced in the first quarter and showing solid performance in several specialties and geographies. Our capital performance improved in the quarter, as did our margins.
Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the second quarter was just under 14% compared with Q2 of 2014. Utilization trends present last quarter continued, with strength in hernia repair, solid growth in colon and rectal resections, continued recovery in prostatectomy and stable trends in hysterectomy. Growth in the use of our products was broad-based and included the U.S., Europe and key markets in Asia. Procedures grew strongly in China, and growth was solid in Japan and Korea. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Turning to capital sales. We placed 118 systems in the quarter compared to 96 in the second quarter of 2014. The United States and Japan accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. We see interest across our product line from our multi-quadrant Xi System to our Si System, with customers choosing the system that best fits their programs' needs. 
In Japan, clearance of Xi system unlocked some system demand, and we sold 13 systems in the quarter compared with 5 a year earlier. Procedure growth in Japan remains healthy given the current state of reimbursement. As we've said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators have submitted their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues to work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement of -- for additional procedures. We have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time.
Turning to margins. Our operating teams are focused on reducing product costs for our new products, and we're managing our fixed expenses carefully. This quarter was a step in the right direction on gross margin, though an early one. We will continue to focus on improvements over the next several quarters. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.
In summary, our operating performance for the second quarter is as follows. Procedures grew just under 14% over the second quarter of last year. We placed 118 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 96 in the second quarter of 2014. 
Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $586 million, up 16% from the prior year and up 20% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $297 million, up 13% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $228 million in the quarter compared with $196 million in the second quarter of 2014, and pro forma net income was $173 million compared to $140 million in Q2 of 2014. 
In product development, we are rounding out our Xi System offering by launching additional EndoWrist instruments, integrating table motion with Xi and developing Single-Site for Xi. 
In Europe in the second quarter, surgeons have performed the first clinical cases using integrated table motion with Xi with enthusiastic feedback. We recently submitted our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with Xi. We anticipate filing our 510(k) for Xi Single-Site in the second half of the year.
We have also broadened the rollout of our white reload for our da Vinci Xi stapler. Feedback on this utility has been positive. Additional Xi EndoWrist instruments have been released in the quarter, continuing to round out our instrument offering for Xi. For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development is progressing with system integration and laboratory testing in progress.
Stepping back and looking at the business at the midway point of the year. We're focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair, filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally, developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia, improving our gross margins and advancing our technologies to improve surgery.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review our financial performance."

I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization and purchased IP and investment impairments.",1492,"Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization and purchased IP and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. 
I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Pro forma second quarter revenue was $586 million, an increase of 16% compared with $507 million for the second quarter of 2014 and an increase of 10% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the second quarter of 2014 excludes net revenues associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. 
Second quarter procedures of approximately 162,000 grew nearly 14% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and approximately 8% compared with the first quarter of 2015.
Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 13% compared with the second quarter of 2014. It increased 7% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth in customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects procedure growth. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure, approximately the same as the second quarter of 2014 and similar to the approximately $1,840 last quarter. 
Pro forma system revenue of $176 million increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2014. It increased 25% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase compared with the first quarter primarily reflects increased unit sales. 
118 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 96 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 99 systems last quarter. 64% of the systems placed in the second quarter were Xis compared with 52% in the second quarter of 2014 and 76% in the first quarter of 2015. We sold more Sis in the quarter than the previous quarter, reflecting 7 Si system sales under a contract with the Department of Defense and 8 Si system sales in Japan. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $113 million increased 6% year-over-year and decreased $1 million compared with the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase reflects increased -- the increase in our installed base. The decrease compared with the first quarter reflects the timing of service contract renewals and changes in the foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our installed base.
Globally, our system ASP of 1,500,000 was approximately the same as the second quarter of last year. It increased relative to the first quarter ASP of 1,480,000. Relative to the second quarter of 2014, higher ASPs were primarily associated with higher mix of Xis, offset by the impact of the strengthened dollar. 
The increase in ASPs relative to last quarter reflect geographic mix and lower trade-in activity. ASPs will fluctuate on a geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in the foreign exchange rates.
Hospitals financed approximately 21% of the systems placed in the second quarter, up from 14% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which 5 were structured as operating leases. Several customers bought out previously leased systems in the quarter. Although revenue associated with the buyouts are included in total revenue, we've excluded this revenue from the computation of system ASPs. We've also excluded these buyouts from the system placement number.
In the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter compared with 61 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 63 systems in the first quarter of 2015. As previously noted, second quarter system placements in the U.S. included 7 systems sold under our Department of Defense contract. 
In general, the increase in systems placements relative to prior year reflect growth in procedures and market acceptance of the Xi system. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Second quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. of $168 million grew 25% compared with $135 million for the second quarter of 2014 and grew 12% compared with $150 million last quarter. 
The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher Japan system revenue, higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange. The increase compared with last quarter reflects higher Japan systems placements, geographic mix of system placements and procedure growth. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 46 systems in the second quarter compared with 35 in the second quarter of 2014 and 36 systems last quarter. OUS system placements reflect 13 systems into Japan this quarter compared with 5 systems into -- in the second quarter of 2014 and 1 last quarter. We obtained Xi approval in Japan in late March and 5 of the system sold this quarter were Xi systems.
European system placements grew to 22 systems this quarter compared with 19 last year and 18 last quarter. We placed no systems into China this quarter compared with 1 in the second quarter of 2014 and 8 last quarter. As we have indicated in the past and consistent with our history, system placements in our OUS markets will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin in the second quarter of 2015 was 68% compared with 69.2% for the second quarter of 2014 and 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015. The decline in gross margins relative to the second quarter of 2014 is primarily attributable to foreign exchange and a higher mix of newer products, including Xi and stapling. 
The sequential improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to the completion of activities that resulted in onetime charges in the first quarter and cost of sales efficiency gains.
In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we have refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $7 million in each of the first and second quarters. These charges are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process.
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 10% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 4% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses, primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2014 and 28.9% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 benefited from approximately $8 million or the equivalent of $0.21 per share of discrete items, including the release of reserves specific to tax years where we recently completed audits. 
Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated.
Our pro forma net income was $173 million or $4.57 per share compared with $140 million or $3.73 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $512 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $532 million for the first quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.9 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2015. The increase was from primarily driven by cash generated by operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares for $49 million at an average purchase price of $494 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin, who'll go over our procedure and clinical highlights and provide 2015 financial guidance."
30239,306462635,835366,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marshall. Let me begin with a review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximat",1062,"Thanks, Marshall. Let me begin with a review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximately 27%. 
In the U.S., trends observed during the first quarter largely continued through the second quarter. In neurology, growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at a similar rate as the first quarter. We continue to believe that our prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader U.S. prostate surgery market. 
In U.S. gynecology, procedures were flat year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, offset by declines in benign procedures. In recent quarters, an increasing proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists. 
During the second quarter, general surgery remain the primary contributor to U.S. growth with robust growth in hernia repair and solid contribution from colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. 
During the first half of 2015, ventral and inguinal hernia repair contributed the majority of the increase in U.S. general surgery procedures. The contribution to first half U.S. growth from mature procedures in highly penetrated markets such as da Vinci Prostatectomy and da Vinci malignant and complex hysterectomy has exceeded our expectations. In the second half of 2015, growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy is likely to slow as we anniversary into higher prior year growth rates.
Looking abroad. During the second quarter, international procedure growth was led by a modest acceleration in the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. During the first half of 2015, growth in international da Vinci Prostatectomy was approximately 20%.
Let me take a few moments to provide a bit more color around China. Over the past year, we've sold 20 systems under tenders from among 38 civilian hospitals authorized by the government to acquire a da Vinci system. Procedure adoption has been broad-based in urologic, gynecologic, general and thoracic procedures. While we're encouraged by these developments, future system placements are dependent on completion of the central purchasing tender under the current authorization, which is set to expire at the end of 2015. 
It is not certain whether the tender process will be completed or when future governmental authorizations and approvals may enable system placements in 2016 and beyond. Procedure growth rates are likely to be governed by the timing of additional system placements.
Moving on to clinical and economic validation. A recent publication from Saarland University by Prof. Stöckle and team evaluated the cost-effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy compared to open prostatectomy from a German payer perspective in a 1,400-patient study partially supported by Intuitive. 
From a clinical perspective, the robotic patient population showed fewer positive surgical margins and required fewer intraoperative transfusions with a reduction in hospitalization of approximately 6 days. 
In the economic analysis, the study showed that the robotic patients were roughly EUR 3,000 per patient less expensive as measured by the period from date of surgery to 2 years post operation. The authors concluded that the improved clinical outcomes led to the reduction in postoperative cost.
In the quarter, there was considerable interest in colorectal clinical data with the initial outcomes reported from the ROLARR study. In addition, several other notable studies were published during the quarter.
Let me take a moment to highlight 2 studies from large-scale, statewide, general surgery registries published in Surgical Endoscopy. The first study was published by Dr. Cleary and team from St. Joseph Mercy Health System in Michigan. After reviewing over 2,700 minimally invasive colorectal surgeries from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative registry, the authors found that conversion rates were lower with robotic compared to laparoscopic procedures for rectal resections, and hospital length of stay was shorter with robotic procedures compared to conventional and hand-assisted laparoscopic colon procedures. 
The second study was published by Dr. Altieri and colleagues from Stony Brook University in a broad-based study of nearly 170,000 minimally invasive general surgeries from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. 
The authors found that robotic-assisted procedures had lower rates of complications and hospital length of stay compared to laparoscopy across several general surgeries with a lower rate of complications for colectomies. They concluded, ""Robotic approaches may facilitate safer adoption of minimally invasive approaches in areas where penetrance of conventional laparoscopy is low such as in colorectal surgery.""
This concludes my procedures and critical commentary. I will now be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015.
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 8% to 11% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 13%.
Turning to gross profit. Our outlook for gross profit margin has modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our second half 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67% to 68% of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our second quarter gross margin as Q2 benefited from favorable product and regional system mix and Q3 and Q4 will likely face stronger foreign exchange headwinds. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.
Turning to operating expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. 
We now expect our 2015 noncash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of the $170 million to $180 million range forecast on our last call, fairly flat compared to $169 million in 2014. 
We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

I recognize that hernia is both more than one kind of procedure, abdominal hernia or ventral hernia and inguinal hernia. And even within those, there is variation in both technique and patient population. So clearly, right now, there's a mixture of sustained use by our customers and people who are learning and trialing the technology. What that mix looks like in the near term is actually very hard to determine. We do see some early evidence of a strong clinical benefit in some of the categories and segments, and we think that's long-term durable. Calling right now how big those total billable markets are going to be is still premature. So we have some basic estimates. We're working them down. As the quarters go by here, we'll be able to increase our certainty of what those long terms look like. With regard to Sp, we're not predicting the shift date at this time. We're on track in our technical developments. We're in conversations with several surgeon groups as well as regulators about where both long-term value can be and what regulatory pathways are.

The value of an integrated intraoperative table is that it allows the surgeon to position the patient using gravity. It's something that they do frequently, but also allows the anesthesiologist easier interaction to help manage the patient. And the power of the integration we've done with our partner has been that it allows it to be done quickly and efficiently. So it's fast. So the real value here is to speed up procedures. It allows them to do it seamlessly. And so we don't think it's so much opening a different market as it is making it easier on lowering barriers. The feedback to it -- they've been now used in dozens of cases in Europe, where it has CE Mark. Feedback has been really good, and the implementation done by the team is very, very good. So that looks good, and we're encouraged. We've we submitted a 510(k) just recently, so we'll answer FDA's questions as they come and work through that. It really is rounding out. It's one of the features that rounds out the Xi platform. Intraoperative table motion is a strong beneficiary for general surgery procedures, where folks are wanting to move around the abdomen, helps a lot in that setting. And so the fact that they can do that dynamically is powerful. Turning to Single-Site on Xi. Single-Site is already available, of course, as you know, on the Si. There's nothing that's a technological limitation from putting it on the Xi. It's really been doing the work and getting the clearances. What that will enable is the midsized hospital that owns one platform, they may have an Si now, they're doing Single-Site, and they want to upgrade to an Xi. That completes the set for them so that they don't have to step away from something on their Si system when they move to Xi. And so that's really the opportunity for us there, and we're meeting our clinical milestones and our -- I'm sorry, our technical milestones and working through the set of validations that'll be required to get clearance. So we're excited about it."

That's where table motion and Single-Site can make a difference, particularly for single-system hospitals. And so we think as those product lines go out, that will help that upgrade pipeline. There are people who just buy purely on capacity. They have used the existing capacity of their system. As procedures grow, they look to do additional procedures. They'll buy a second system or so. And the last one is really capacity again, but often, is it in the right place? If you're a larger institution or an integrated delivery network, you may be interested in moving the capacity to a different region or different part of your service network. Sometimes, they do that by moving systems. Sometimes, they do that by buying systems. So capital decisions are really predicated on those 3 pillars."

I understand results would be one of those things, but as you look at factors that you monitor, are we at a turning point where robotic surgery growth is back on track versus some of the challenges you face over the past couple of years? Or are there sort of nagging factors that you think still need to be addressed?"

I think with regard to visibility and predictability of the financials of the business, I think that's, really, as I said before, predominantly predicated on capital. I think there are some interesting things going on in the market. I do think that market acceptance of robotic surgery is increasing. I think some of the debates of where it adds value are starting to be resolved. We see kind of a different tone in some of the surgical conversations more broadly, and I think that's a real positive. So I -- we feel good about that. Having said that, I think that working through reimbursement pathways, working through regulatory pathways and building really capable organizations takes times, and that's what we're focused on that will be the biggest predictor of our long-term performance."

Selling cycles in Japan are much longer than that. In fact, they take multiple quarters to get systems done. That's why you see Sis getting done in the quarter because the process for which the budget was established by the hospital in the purchase process takes a long time. And so this is just completion of deals that were already in flight months before this. And it will take time for Xi.

So how many systems are in the neighborhood of the patients who can benefit from them. And so that's really how you have to back into it.

In the quarter, growth in procedures was healthy, maintaining the rate of growth we experienced in the first quarter and showing solid performance in several specialties and geographies. Our capital performance",704,"Thank you for joining us on the call today. In the quarter, growth in procedures was healthy, maintaining the rate of growth we experienced in the first quarter and showing solid performance in several specialties and geographies. Our capital performance improved in the quarter, as did our margins.
Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the second quarter was just under 14% compared with Q2 of 2014. Utilization trends present last quarter continued, with strength in hernia repair, solid growth in colon and rectal resections, continued recovery in prostatectomy and stable trends in hysterectomy. Growth in the use of our products was broad-based and included the U.S., Europe and key markets in Asia. Procedures grew strongly in China, and growth was solid in Japan and Korea. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Turning to capital sales. We placed 118 systems in the quarter compared to 96 in the second quarter of 2014. The United States and Japan accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. We see interest across our product line from our multi-quadrant Xi System to our Si System, with customers choosing the system that best fits their programs' needs. 
In Japan, clearance of the Xi system unlocked some system demand, and we sold 13 systems in the quarter compared with 5 a year earlier. Procedure growth in Japan remains healthy given the current state of reimbursement. As we've said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators have submitted their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues to work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement of -- for additional procedures. We have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time.
Turning to margins. Our operating teams are focused on reducing product costs for our new products, and we're managing our fixed expenses carefully. This quarter was a step in the right direction on gross margin, though an early one. We will continue to focus on improvements over the next several quarters. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.
In summary, our operating performance for the second quarter is as follows. Procedures grew just under 14% over the second quarter of last year. We placed 118 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 96 in the second quarter of 2014. 
Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $586 million, up 16% from the prior year and up 20% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $297 million, up 13% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $228 million in the quarter compared with $196 million in the second quarter of 2014, and pro forma net income was $173 million compared to $140 million in Q2 of 2014. 
In product development, we are rounding out our Xi System offering by launching additional EndoWrist instruments, integrating table motion with Xi and developing Single-Site for Xi. 
In Europe in the second quarter, surgeons have performed the first clinical cases using integrated table motion with Xi with enthusiastic feedback. We recently submitted our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with Xi. We anticipate filing our 510(k) for Xi Single-Site in the second half of the year.
We have also broadened the rollout of our white reload for our da Vinci Xi stapler. Feedback on this utility has been positive. Additional Xi EndoWrist instruments have been released in the quarter, continuing to round out our instrument offering for Xi. For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development is progressing with system integration and laboratory testing in progress.
Stepping back and looking at the business at the midway point of the year, we're focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair, filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally, developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia, improving our gross margins and advancing our technologies to improve surgery.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review our financial performance."
30239,306462635,835396,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary.

I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. 
I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Pro forma second quarter revenue was $586 million, an increase of 16% compared with $507 million for the second quarter of 2014 and an increase of 10% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the second quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. 
Second quarter procedures of approximately 162,000 grew nearly 14% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and approximately 8% compared with the first quarter of 2015.
Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 13% compared with the second quarter of 2014. It increased 7% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth in customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects procedure growth. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure, approximately the same as the second quarter of 2014 and similar to the approximately $1,840 last quarter. 
Pro forma system revenue of $176 million increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2014. It increased 25% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase compared with the first quarter primarily reflects increased unit sales. 
118 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 96 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 99 systems last quarter. 64% of the systems placed in the second quarter were Xis compared with 52% in the second quarter of 2014 and 76% in the first quarter of 2015. We sold more Sis in the quarter than the previous quarter, reflecting 7 Si system sales under a contract with the Department of Defense and 8 Si system sales in Japan. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $113 million increased 6% year-over-year and decreased $1 million compared with the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase reflects increased -- the increase in our installed base. The decrease compared with the first quarter reflects the timing of service contract renewals and changes in the foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our installed base.
Globally, our system ASP of 1,500,000 was approximately the same as the second quarter of last year. It increased relative to the first quarter ASP of 1,480,000. Relative to the second quarter of 2014, higher ASPs were primarily associated with higher mix of Xis, offset by the impact of the strengthened dollar. 
The increase in ASPs relative to last quarter reflect geographic mix and lower trade-in activity. ASPs will fluctuate on a geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in the foreign exchange rates.
Hospitals financed approximately 21% of the systems placed in the second quarter, up from 14% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which 5 were structured as operating leases. Several customers bought out previously leased systems in the quarter. Although revenue associated with the buyouts are included in total revenue, we've excluded this revenue from the computation of system ASPs. We've also excluded these buyouts from the system placement number.
In the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter compared with 61 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 63 systems in the first quarter of 2015. As previously noted, second quarter system placements in the U.S. included 7 systems sold under our Department of Defense contract. 
In general, the increase in systems placements relative to the prior year reflect growth in procedures and market acceptance of the Xi system. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Second quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. of $168 million grew 25% compared with $135 million for the second quarter of 2014 and grew 12% compared with $150 million last quarter. 
The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher Japan system revenue, higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange. The increase compared with last quarter reflects higher Japan systems placements, geographic mix of system placements and procedure growth. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 46 systems in the second quarter compared with 35 in the second quarter of 2014 and 36 systems last quarter. O U.S. system placements reflect 13 systems into Japan this quarter compared with 5 systems into -- in the second quarter of 2014 and 1 last quarter. We obtained Xi approval in Japan in late March and 5 of the systems sold this quarter were Xi systems.
European system placements grew to 22 systems this quarter compared with 19 last year and 18 last quarter. We placed no systems into China this quarter compared with 1 in the second quarter of 2014 and 8 last quarter. As we have indicated in the past and consistent with our history, system placements in our  o U.S. markets will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin in the second quarter of 2015 was 68% compared with 69.2% for the second quarter of 2014 and 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015. The decline in gross margins relative to the second quarter of 2014 is primarily attributable to foreign exchange and a higher mix of newer products, including Xi and stapling. 
The sequential improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to the completion of activities that resulted in onetime charges in the first quarter and cost of sales efficiency gains.
In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we have refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $7 million in each of the first and second quarters. These charges are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process.
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 10% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 4% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses, primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2014 and 28.9% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 benefited from approximately $8 million or the equivalent of $0.21 per share of discrete items, including the release of reserves specific to tax years where we recently completed audits. 
Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and o U.S. income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated.
Our pro forma net income was $173 million or $4.57 per share compared with $140 million or $3.73 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $512 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $532 million for the first quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.9 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated by operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares for $49 million at an average purchase price of $494 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin, who'll go over our procedure and clinical highlights and provide 2015 financial guidance."

Let me begin with a review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximat",1062,"Thanks, Marshall. Let me begin with a review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximately 27%. 
In the U.S., trends observed during the first quarter largely continued through the second quarter. In neurology, growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at a similar rate as the first quarter. We continue to believe that our prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader U.S. prostate surgery market. 
In U.S. gynecology, procedures were flat year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, offset by declines in benign procedures. In recent quarters, an increasing proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists. 
During the second quarter, general surgery remain the primary contributor to U.S. growth with robust growth in hernia repair and solid contribution from colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. 
During the first half of 2015, ventral and inguinal hernia repair contributed the majority of the increase in U.S. general surgery procedures. The contribution to first half U.S. growth from mature procedures in highly penetrated markets such as da Vinci Prostatectomy and da Vinci malignant and complex hysterectomy has exceeded our expectations. In the second half of 2015, growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy is likely to slow as we anniversary into higher prior year growth rates.
Looking abroad during the second quarter, international procedure growth was led by a modest acceleration in the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. During the first half of 2015, growth in international da Vinci Prostatectomy was approximately 20%.
Let me take a few moments to provide a bit more color around China. Over the past year, we've sold 20 systems under tenders from among 38 civilian hospitals authorized by the government to acquire a da Vinci system. Procedure adoption has been broad-based in urologic, gynecologic, general and thoracic procedures. While we're encouraged by these developments, future system placements are dependent on completion of the central purchasing tender under the current authorization, which is set to expire at the end of 2015. 
It is not certain whether the tender process will be completed or when future governmental authorizations and approvals may enable system placements in 2016 and beyond. Procedure growth rates are likely to be governed by the timing of additional system placements.
Moving on to clinical and economic validation. A recent publication from Saarland University by Professor Stöckle and team evaluated the cost-effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy compared to open prostatectomy from a German payer perspective in a 1,400-patient study partially supported by Intuitive. 
From a clinical perspective, the robotic patient population showed fewer positive surgical margins and required fewer intraoperative transfusions with a reduction in hospitalization of approximately 6 days. 
In the economic analysis, the study showed that the robotic patients were roughly EUR 3,000 per patient less expensive as measured by the period from date of surgery to 2 years post operation. The authors concluded that the improved clinical outcomes led to the reduction in postoperative cost.
In the quarter, there was considerable interest in colorectal clinical data with the initial outcomes reported from the ROLARR study. In addition, several other notable studies were published during the quarter.
Let me take a moment to highlight 2 studies from large-scale, statewide, general surgery registries published in Surgical Endoscopy. The first study was published by Dr. Cleary and team from St. Joseph Mercy Health System in Michigan. After reviewing over 2,700 minimally invasive colorectal surgeries from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative registry, the authors found that conversion rates were lower with robotic compared to laparoscopic procedures for rectal resections, and hospital length of stay was shorter with robotic procedures compared to conventional and hand-assisted laparoscopic colon procedures. 
The second study was published by Dr. Altieri and colleagues from Stony Brook University in a broad-based study of nearly 170,000 minimally invasive general surgeries from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. 
The authors found that robotic-assisted procedures had lower rates of complications and hospital length of stay compared to laparoscopy across several general surgeries with a lower rate of complications for colectomies. They concluded, ""Robotic approaches may facilitate safer adoption of minimally invasive approaches in areas where penetrants of conventional laparoscopy is low such as in colorectal surgery.""
This concludes my procedures and clinical commentary. I will now be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015.
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 8% to 11% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 13%.
Turning to gross profit. Our outlook for gross profit margin has modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our second half 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67% to 68% of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our second quarter gross margin as Q2 benefited from favorable product and regional system mix and Q3 and Q4 will likely face stronger foreign exchange headwinds. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.
Turning to operating expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. 
We now expect our 2015 noncash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of the $170 million to $180 million range forecast on our last call, fairly flat compared to $169 million in 2014. 
We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

So is the back half level that you're talking about here, 67% to 68%, as you think about the long term, is that a level that you view as kind of sustainable when you think about all the different puts and takes?

I recognize that hernia is both more than one kind of procedure, abdominal hernia or ventral hernia and inguinal hernia. And even within those, there's variation in both technique and patient population. So clearly, right now, there's a mixture of sustained use by our customers and people who are learning and trialing the technology. What that mix looks like in the near term is actually very hard to determine. We do see some early evidence of a strong clinical benefit in some of the categories and segments, and we think that's long-term durable. Calling right now how big those total available markets are going to be, is still premature. So we have some basic estimates. We're working them down. As the quarters go by here, we'll be able to increase our certainty of what those long terms look like. With regard to Sp, we're not predicting the shift date at this time. We're on track in our technical developments. We're in conversations with several surgeon groups as well as regulators about where both long-term value can be and what regulatory pathways are.

The value of an integrated intraoperative table is that it allows the surgeon to position the patient using gravity. It's something that they do frequently, but also allows the anesthesiologist easier interaction to help manage the patient. And the power of the integration we've done with our partner has been that it allows it to be done quickly and efficiently. So it's fast. So the real value here is to speed up procedures. It allows them to do it seamlessly. And so we don't think it's so much opening a different market as it is making it easier on lowering barriers. The feedback to it -- they've been now used in dozens of cases in Europe, where it has CE Mark. Feedback has been really good, and the implementation done by the team is very, very good. So that looks good, and we're encouraged. We've we submitted the 510(k) just recently, so we'll answer FDA's questions as they come and work through that. It really is rounding out. It's one of the features that rounds out the Xi platform. Intraoperative table motion is a strong beneficiary for general surgery procedures, where folks are wanting to move around the abdomen, helps a lot in that setting. And so the fact that they can do that dynamically is powerful. Turning to Single-Site on Xi. Single-Site is already available, of course, as you know, on the Si. There's nothing that's a technological limitation from putting it on the Xi. It's really been doing the work and getting the clearances. What that will enable is, the midsized hospital that owns one platform, they may have an Si now, they're doing Single-Site, and they want to upgrade to an Xi, that completes the set for them so that they don't have to step away from something on their Si system when they move to Xi. And so that's really the opportunity for us there, and we're meeting our clinical milestones and our -- I'm sorry, our technical milestones and working through the set of validations that'll be required to get clearance. So we're excited about it."

Just speaking to the main levers here of system purchase decisions, there's really 3 levers that we've talked about and remain in place. One of them is upgrade for a customer who has a system and is thinking about upgrading from an S or an Si, one of the prior systems. They're really looking out and saying, ""Does Xi bring to them either outcome benefit or new service lines relative to prior products?"" That's where table motion and Single-Site can make a difference, particularly for single-system hospitals. And so we think as those product lines fill out, that will help that upgrade pipeline. There are people who just buy purely on capacity. They've used the existing capacity of their system. As procedures grow, they look to do additional procedures. They'll buy a second system or so. And the last one is really capacity again, but often, is it in the right place? If you're a larger institution or an integrated delivery network, you may be interested in moving the capacity to a different region or different part of your service network. Sometimes they do that by moving systems. Sometimes they do that by buying systems. So capital decisions are really predicated on those 3 pillars."

In the quarter, growth in procedures was healthy, maintaining the rate of growth we experienced in the first quarter and showing solid performance in several specialties and geographies. Our capital performance",704,"Thank you for joining us on the call today. In the quarter, growth in procedures was healthy, maintaining the rate of growth we experienced in the first quarter and showing solid performance in several specialties and geographies. Our capital performance improved in the quarter, as did our margins.
Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the second quarter was just under 14% compared with Q2 of 2014. Utilization trends present last quarter continued, with strength in hernia repair, solid growth in colon and rectal resections, continued recovery in prostatectomy and stable trends in hysterectomy. Growth in the use of our products was broad-based and included the U.S., Europe and key markets in Asia. Procedures grew strongly in China, and growth was solid in Japan and Korea. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Turning to capital sales. We placed 118 systems in the quarter compared to 96 in the second quarter of 2014. The United States and Japan accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. We see interest across our product line from our multi-quadrant Xi System to our Si System, with customers choosing the system that best fits their programs' needs. 
In Japan, clearance of the Xi system unlocked some system demand, and we sold 13 systems in the quarter compared with 5 a year earlier. Procedure growth in Japan remains healthy given the current state of reimbursement. As we've said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators have submitted their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues to work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement of -- for additional procedures. We have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time.
Turning to margins. Our operating teams are focused on reducing product costs for our new products, and we're managing our fixed expenses carefully. This quarter was a step in the right direction on gross margin, though an early one. We will continue to focus on improvements over the next several quarters. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.
In summary, our operating performance for the second quarter is as follows. Procedures grew just under 14% over the second quarter of last year. We placed 118 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 96 in the second quarter of 2014. 
Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $586 million, up 16% from the prior year and up 20% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $297 million, up 13% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $228 million in the quarter compared with $196 million in the second quarter of 2014, and pro forma net income was $173 million compared to $140 million in Q2 of 2014. 
In product development, we are rounding out our Xi System offering by launching additional EndoWrist instruments, integrating table motion with Xi and developing Single-Site for Xi. 
In Europe in the second quarter, surgeons have performed the first clinical cases using integrated table motion with Xi with enthusiastic feedback. We recently submitted our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with Xi. We anticipate filing our 510(k) for Xi Single-Site in the second half of the year.
We have also broadened the rollout of our white reload for our da Vinci Xi stapler. Feedback on this utility has been positive. Additional Xi EndoWrist instruments have been released in the quarter, continuing to round out our instrument offering for Xi. For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development is progressing with system integration and laboratory testing in progress.
Stepping back and looking at the business at the midway point of the year, we're focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair, filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally, developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia, improving our gross margins and advancing our technologies to improve surgery.

I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments.",1492,"Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. 
I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Pro forma second quarter revenue was $586 million, an increase of 16% compared with $507 million for the second quarter of 2014 and an increase of 10% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the second quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. 
Second quarter procedures of approximately 162,000 grew nearly 14% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and approximately 8% compared with the first quarter of 2015.
Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 13% compared with the second quarter of 2014. It increased 7% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth in customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects procedure growth. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure, approximately the same as the second quarter of 2014 and similar to the approximately $1,840 last quarter. 
Pro forma system revenue of $176 million increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2014. It increased 25% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase compared with the first quarter primarily reflects increased unit sales. 
118 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 96 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 99 systems last quarter. 64% of the systems placed in the second quarter were Xis compared with 52% in the second quarter of 2014 and 76% in the first quarter of 2015. We sold more Sis in the quarter than the previous quarter, reflecting 7 Si system sales under a contract with the Department of Defense and 8 Si system sales in Japan. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $113 million increased 6% year-over-year and decreased $1 million compared with the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase reflects increased -- the increase in our installed base. The decrease compared with the first quarter reflects the timing of service contract renewals and changes in the foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our installed base.
Globally, our system ASP of 1,500,000 was approximately the same as the second quarter of last year. It increased relative to the first quarter ASP of 1,480,000. Relative to the second quarter of 2014, higher ASPs were primarily associated with higher mix of Xis, offset by the impact of the strengthened dollar. 
The increase in ASPs relative to last quarter reflect geographic mix and lower trade-in activity. ASPs will fluctuate on a geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in the foreign exchange rates.
Hospitals financed approximately 21% of the systems placed in the second quarter, up from 14% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which 5 were structured as operating leases. Several customers bought out previously leased systems in the quarter. Although revenue associated with the buyouts are included in total revenue, we've excluded this revenue from the computation of system ASPs. We've also excluded these buyouts from the system placement number.
In the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter compared with 61 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 63 systems in the first quarter of 2015. As previously noted, second quarter system placements in the U.S. included 7 systems sold under our Department of Defense contract. 
In general, the increase in systems placements relative to the prior year reflect growth in procedures and market acceptance of the Xi system. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Second quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. of $168 million grew 25% compared with $135 million for the second quarter of 2014 and grew 12% compared with $150 million last quarter. 
The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher Japan system revenue, higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange. The increase compared with last quarter reflects higher Japan systems placements, geographic mix of system placements and procedure growth. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 46 systems in the second quarter compared with 35 in the second quarter of 2014 and 36 systems last quarter. OUS system placements reflect 13 systems into Japan this quarter compared with 5 systems into -- in the second quarter of 2014 and 1 last quarter. We obtained Xi approval in Japan in late March and 5 of the systems sold this quarter were Xi systems.
European system placements grew to 22 systems this quarter compared with 19 last year and 18 last quarter. We placed no systems into China this quarter compared with 1 in the second quarter of 2014 and 8 last quarter. As we have indicated in the past and consistent with our history, system placements in our OUS markets will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin in the second quarter of 2015 was 68% compared with 69.2% for the second quarter of 2014 and 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015. The decline in gross margins relative to the second quarter of 2014 is primarily attributable to foreign exchange and a higher mix of newer products, including Xi and stapling. 
The sequential improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to the completion of activities that resulted in onetime charges in the first quarter and cost of sales efficiency gains.
In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we have refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $7 million in each of the first and second quarters. These charges are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process.
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 10% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 4% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses, primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2014 and 28.9% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 benefited from approximately $8 million or the equivalent of $0.21 per share of discrete items, including the release of reserves specific to tax years where we recently completed audits. 
Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated.
Our pro forma net income was $173 million or $4.57 per share compared with $140 million or $3.73 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $512 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $532 million for the first quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.9 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated by operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares for $49 million at an average purchase price of $494 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin, who'll go over our procedure and clinical highlights and provide 2015 financial guidance."
30239,306462635,835592,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marshall. Let me begin with a review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximat",1062,"Thanks, Marshall. Let me begin with a review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximately 27%. 
In the U.S., trends observed during the first quarter largely continued through the second quarter. In neurology, growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at a similar rate as the first quarter. We continue to believe that our prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader U.S. prostate surgery market. 
In U.S. gynecology, procedures were flat year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, offset by declines in benign procedures. In recent quarters, an increasing proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists. 
During the second quarter, general surgery remain the primary contributor to U.S. growth with robust growth in hernia repair and solid contribution from colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. 
During the first half of 2015, ventral and inguinal hernia repair contributed the majority of the increase in U.S. general surgery procedures. The contribution to first half U.S. growth from mature procedures in highly penetrated markets such as da Vinci Prostatectomy and da Vinci malignant and complex hysterectomy has exceeded our expectations. In the second half of 2015, growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy is likely to slow as we anniversary into higher prior year growth rates.
Looking abroad during the second quarter, international procedure growth was led by a modest acceleration in the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. During the first half of 2015, growth in international da Vinci Prostatectomy was approximately 20%.
Let me take a few moments to provide a bit more color around China. Over the past year, we've sold 20 systems under tenders from among 38 civilian hospitals authorized by the government to acquire a da Vinci system. Procedure adoption has been broad-based in urologic, gynecologic, general and thoracic procedures. While we're encouraged by these developments, future system placements are dependent on completion of the central purchasing tender under the current authorization, which is set to expire at the end of 2015. 
It is not certain whether the tender process will be completed or when future governmental authorizations and approvals may enable system placements in 2016 and beyond. Procedure growth rates are likely to be governed by the timing of additional system placements.
Moving on to clinical and economic validation. A recent publication from Saarland University by Professor Stöckle and team evaluated the cost-effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy compared to open prostatectomy from a German payer perspective in a 1,400-patient study partially supported by Intuitive. 
From a clinical perspective, the robotic patient population showed fewer positive surgical margins and required fewer intraoperative transfusions with a reduction in hospitalization of approximately 6 days. 
In the economic analysis, the study showed that the robotic patients were roughly EUR 3,000 per patient less expensive as measured by the period from date of surgery to 2 years post operation. The authors concluded that the improved clinical outcomes led to the reduction in postoperative cost.
In the quarter, there was considerable interest in colorectal clinical data with the initial outcomes reported from the ROLARR study. In addition, several other notable studies were published during the quarter.
Let me take a moment to highlight 2 studies from large-scale, statewide, general surgery registries published in Surgical Endoscopy. The first study was published by Dr. Cleary and team from St. Joseph Mercy Health System in Michigan. After reviewing over 2,700 minimally invasive colorectal surgeries from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative registry, the authors found that conversion rates were lower with robotic compared to laparoscopic procedures for rectal resections, and hospital length of stay was shorter with robotic procedures compared to conventional and hand-assisted laparoscopic colon procedures. 
The second study was published by Dr. Altieri and colleagues from Stony Brook University in a broad-based study of nearly 170,000 minimally invasive general surgeries from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. 
The authors found that robotic-assisted procedures had lower rates of complications and hospital length of stay compared to laparoscopy across several general surgeries with a lower rate of complications for colectomies. They concluded, ""Robotic approaches may facilitate safer adoption of minimally invasive approaches in areas where penetrants of conventional laparoscopy is low such as in colorectal surgery.""
This concludes my procedures and clinical commentary. I will now be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015.
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 8% to 11% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 13%.
Turning to gross profit. Our outlook for gross profit margin has modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our second half 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67% to 68% of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our second quarter gross margin as Q2 benefited from favorable product and regional system mix and Q3 and Q4 will likely face stronger foreign exchange headwinds. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.
Turning to operating expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. 
We now expect our 2015 noncash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of the $170 million to $180 million range forecast on our last call, fairly flat compared to $169 million in 2014. 
We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

I recognize that hernia is both more than one kind of procedure, abdominal hernia or ventral hernia and inguinal hernia. And even within those, there's variation in both technique and patient population. So clearly, right now, there's a mixture of sustained use by our customers and people who are learning and trialing the technology. What that mix looks like in the near term is actually very hard to determine. We do see some early evidence of a strong clinical benefit in some of the categories and segments, and we think that's long-term durable. Calling right now how big those total available markets are going to be, is still premature. So we have some basic estimates. We're working them down. As the quarters go by here, we'll be able to increase our certainty of what those long terms look like. With regard to Sp, we're not predicting the shift date at this time. We're on track in our technical developments. We're in conversations with several surgeon groups as well as regulators about where both long-term value can be and what regulatory pathways are.

And the power of the integration we've done with our partner has been that it allows it to be done quickly and efficiently. So it's fast. So the real value here is to speed up procedures. It allows them to do it seamlessly. And so we don't think it's so much opening a different market as it is making it easier on lowering barriers. The feedback to it -- they've been now used in dozens of cases in Europe, where it has CE Mark. Feedback has been really good, and the implementation done by the team is very, very good. So that looks good, and we're encouraged. We've we submitted the 510(k) just recently, so we'll answer FDA's questions as they come and work through that. It really is rounding out. It's one of the features that rounds out the Xi platform. Intraoperative table motion is a strong beneficiary for general surgery procedures, where folks are wanting to move around the abdomen, helps a lot in that setting. And so the fact that they can do that dynamically is powerful. Turning to Single-Site on Xi. Single-Site is already available, of course, as you know, on the Si. There's nothing that's a technological limitation from putting it on the Xi. It's really been doing the work and getting the clearances. What that will enable is, the midsized hospital that owns one platform, they may have an Si now, they're doing Single-Site, and they want to upgrade to an Xi, that completes the set for them so that they don't have to step away from something on their Si system when they move to Xi. And so that's really the opportunity for us there, and we're meeting our clinical milestones and our -- I'm sorry, our technical milestones and working through the set of validations that'll be required to get clearance. So we're excited about it."

One of them is upgrade for a customer who has a system and is thinking about upgrading from an S or an Si, one of the prior systems. They're really looking out and saying, ""Does Xi bring to them either outcome benefit or new service lines relative to prior products?"" That's where table motion and Single-Site can make a difference, particularly for single-system hospitals. And so we think as those product lines fill out, that will help that upgrade pipeline. There are people who just buy purely on capacity. They've used the existing capacity of their system. As procedures grow, they look to do additional procedures. They'll buy a second system or so. And the last one is really capacity again, but often, is it in the right place? If you're a larger institution or an integrated delivery network, you may be interested in moving the capacity to a different region or different part of your service network. Sometimes they do that by moving systems. Sometimes they do that by buying systems. So capital decisions are really predicated on those 3 pillars."

In terms of our competitive position, clearly, we've anticipated the increasing competitors over the years, and we've been not been idle during that time. So we've been thoughtful and have, I think, made some investments that are -- that will make our position long-term sustained."

Now remember, Xi was just introduced or just approved, I should say, just approved in late March, so we really had the opportunity to sell it in a 3-month cycle. Selling cycles in Japan are much longer than that. In fact, they take multiple quarters to get systems done. That's why you see Sis getting done in the quarter because the process for which the budget was established by the hospital in the purchase process takes a long time. And so this is just completion of deals that were already in flight months before this. And it will take time for Xi. And all of that should be caveated with the point that right now we have 1 reimbursement in terms of prostatectomy. We're hopeful to get other reimbursements, but until such time that occurs, system purchases are going to be spotty at best."

You were asking kind of what's the pivot or the inflection point there. It really comes down to accessibility, vis-à-vis the patient population you're trying to treat. So how many systems are in the neighborhood of the patients who can benefit from them. And so that's really how you have to back into it. Start with the patient population that can benefit from them and work your way backwards into systems. It's a regional model.

Overall, company performance in the quarter was solid with robust procedure growth, solid capital performance and improved operating margins. 
Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the third quarter accelerated to 15% compared with Q3 2014. Procedure performance mirrored our experience in the first half of the year, with strength in hernia repair, colon and rectal resections, solid growth in prostatectomy and stable trends in hysterectomy. Internationally, growth trends in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. Growth in Europe, China and Korea was multidisciplinary, with particular strength in urology. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
Turning to capital sales, we placed 117 systems in the quarter compared to 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Capital placements in the United States accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. Customers are preferring our most capable products and Xi Systems and dual console configurations represented a larger proportion of placement in the quarter relative to a year ago.
In Japan, procedure growth was solid and driven by growth in urology. As we've said in prior calls, the fourth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators are submitting their prostatectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues with work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement for additional procedures. While we have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time, Japanese authorities will review reimbursement submissions for [indiscernible] for inclusion in 2016 national coverage.
Conversations regarding reimbursement for other procedures are ongoing. However, inclusion of other procedures and full reimbursement guidelines in 2016 are unlikely.
Turning to operating performance, our product operations teams have been focused on reducing costs for our new products, and we have been managing our fixed expenses carefully.
This quarter was another step in the right direction on gross margins, helped by product mix and some costs coming in at the lower end of their expected ranges. We will continue to focus on improvements in direct prior cost over for the next several quarters. As we look at the long term financial position of our products, we anticipate making targeted capital investments over the next few quarters in programs that we believe will facilitate better long term and operating margins. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call. 
In summary, our operating performance for the third quarter is as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the third quarter of last year. We placed 117 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $590 million, up 10% from prior year and up 14% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. 
Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $298 million, up 10% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $240 million in the quarter compared with $197 million in the third quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $199 million compared to $145 million in Q3 of 2014.
We are deeply committed to advancing our technologies and offerings to benefit surgeons, their patients and hospitals. We have launched integrated table motion for Xi in Europe this October and have submitted our U.S. [indiscernible] application. Table motion allows surgeons to interactively use gravity for retraction and eases patient management during da Vinci Xi surgical cases. As many of you saw at the American College of Surgeons meeting earlier this month, initial customer feedback has been strong. We also submitted our 510(k) for our Single-Site instrument kit for Xi in the third quarter, with the intent of bringing our single incision tools to the Xi platform.
In addition, we submitted the 510(k) application for our 30 millimeters stapler for Xi in the third quarter. This instrument has particular utility in thoracic surgery and includes multiple stable sizes including green, blue, white and gray reloads.
Regarding our next generation single port technology, our technical teams continue to meet their development milestones for da Vinci Sp, having completed the built of our first hand Xi compatible systems, 5 of which are slated for human clinical use. We anticipate increased clinical valuations of da Vinci Sp in 2016, particularly in transoral and transabdominal applications.
Lastly, da Vinci Systems are sophisticated network computing systems. The availability of these computational resources allows for both real-time analytics that can provide surgeons relevant information, for example, the smart plan implemented in our stapler, as well as anonymized utilization data that administration can use to help to optimize robotic surgery programs. We are developing increased computational capability in both real-time and program level applications, along with the field force of workflow experts. This analytics capability allows us to aid our customers both during surgery and in optimizing their robotic surgery programs.
As we've discussed on prior calls, for 2015, we remain focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally, developing our organizational capabilities and markets in Europe and Asia, advancing our technologies to improve surgery and lower our direct costs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall will review our financial performance."

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments.
We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Pro forma third quarter revenue was $590 million, an increase of 10% compared with $534 million for the third quarter of 2014 and an increase of 1% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the third quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with the offers made in 2014 to trade out Si products for Xi product. All tradeout offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014.
Third quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 162,000 grew approximately 15% compared with the third quarter of 2014. We were approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015.
Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 10% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and was approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange in customer buying patterns. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past 4 quarters, with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of new instruments and the impact of foreign exchange.
Pro forma system revenue of $174 million increased 13% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales and higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the second quarter reflects a higher number of operating leases, partially offset by higher average system sales prices. 
117 systems were placed in the third quarter compared with 111 systems in the third quarter of 2014 and 118 systems last quarter. 77% of systems placed this quarter were Xi compared with 53% in the third quarter of 2014 and 64% in the second quarter of 2015. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. 
Globally, our average system price of $1.6 million increased compare with $1.45 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.5 million last quarter. Our third quarter 2015 ASP was our highest to date, reflecting an unusually high mix of dual consoles, including a high number of shipments to academic centers. We shipped 29 Dual Console Xis in the third quarter of 2015 compared with 13 last year and 18 last quarter. We expect to return to our historical mix of dual consoles, and therefore, expect our future ASP to be lower than the quarter. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on a geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Hospitals financed approximately 25% of the systems placed in the third quarter, up from 21% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems, including placing the most operating leases 13 since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter of 2014. 
As of the end of the quarter, there were 36 systems out in the field under the operating leases. Revenue from operating leases was less than $2 million in the third quarter. We expect the impacts of operating leases from our system -- we exclude the impacts of operating leases from our system ASP calculation. The number of systems placed under operating leases will vary quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $117 million increased 8% year-over-year. It increased approximately 4% compared with the second quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base of da Vinci systems.
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $151 million decreased 1% compared with $153 million for the third quarter of 2014 and decreased 10% compared with $168 million last quarter. The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower system sales into China and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher recurring revenue, driven by approximately 28% higher procedure volume. The decrease compared with the last quarter was driven by lower system unit sales and timing of customer instrument and accessory sales.
Outside the U.S., we placed 37 systems in the third quarter compared with 50 of the third quarter of 2014 and 46 systems last quarter. OUS system placements included 9 systems into Japan compared with 7 last year and 13 last quarter. 19 systems in Europe compared with 25 last year and 22 last quarter, and no systems into China this quarter compared with 10 last year and none last quarter. System placements will continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for third quarter 2015 was 69.3% compared with 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 68% for the third quarter of 2015, compared with both the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter 2014, the higher third quarter 2015 gross margin reflects higher system ASPs, improved efficiencies, lower inventory charges, among other factors.
The increase in gross margins relative to the third quarter of 2014 also reflects charges to cost of sales related to the Si stapler recall in 2014. In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the third quarter of 2015.
Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. At the end of the third quarter, $30 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated cost have been paid. 
Pro forma operating costs, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and the amortization of purchased IP, increased 4% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and were 1% less than the last quarter. The year-over-year increase of pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensations.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.4%, compared with an effective tax rate of 27.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 25.6% last quarter.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax quarter rolling involving an independent third party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit unless such credit is reinstated.
Our third quarter 2015 pro forma income was $199 million or $5.24 per share compared with $145 million or $3.92 per share for the third quarter of 2014, and $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter 2015. Excluding the prior period tax benefits, our third quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.47 per share.
As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. 
GAAP revenue was $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $550 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $586 million for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014. And $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 70,000 shares for $36 million and average purchase price of $509 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and highlights."

As mentioned earlier, total third quarter year-over-year procedures were approximately 15%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 28%. 
In the U.S., third quarter procedure growth were approximately 12%, accelerated modestly for the first half growth for approximately 10%, driven by an uptick in the growth of general surgery procedures with the solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration. 
It remains uncertain how sustainable the year-to-date growth in these mature procedures will be in future periods. 
In urology, trends observed during the first half of the year continued through the third quarter. Growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continue at similar rates since the first half of 2015, with da Vinci Prostatectomy growth again exceeding expectations. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. And. 
In gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, partially offset by declines in benign procedures. Similar to the first half of the year, increased proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists.
Third quarter growth in general surgery increased compared to the first half of the year, with robust growth in hernia repair and an uptick in colorectal procedures being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. Hernia repair continue to drive the majority of growth in general surgery procedures during the quarter.
Earlier this month at the American College of Surgeons Meeting, several presentation highlights emerging role of da Vinci surgery in ventral and hernia repair. Surgeons commented on the advantages of da Vinci surgery, which included precise protection, improved visualization, secure closure of the primary defect, [indiscernible] of abdominal wall, suture fixation of mesh and a reduction in postoperative pain for patients. Specific to ventral hernia repair, Dr.  [indiscernible] from the Better [indiscernible] network never compared 180 da Vinci hernia repairs to over 60,000 the lap and open hernia repair from the ACS national surgical improvement program database and found the reduction in hospital length of stay and complications approximately $550 per case compared to laparoscopic and over $700 per case compared for open surgery. We are encouraged by these early clinical and economic validation around the use of da Vinci surgery and hernia repair.
Regarding our Single-Site cholecystectomy business. As we stated in the past 4 quarters, our total cholecystectomy procedures declined through the rate of decline moderated in the third quarter as growth in multi-cholecystectomy offset much of the decline in cholecystectomies. It is our belief that customers are finding added value in a more complex population, therefore gravitating to the traditional da Vinci multi-port approach. 
Firefly technology was used in approximately 40% of da Vinci cholecystectomies in the quarter. 
Looking abroad during the third quarter, the approximate 28% international procedure growth was led by global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal receptions. Procedure growth in Europe remained steady through the first 9 months of the year, while the acceleration and procedure growth in Asia that began during the first of of the year continued in 2 the third quarter. During the quarter, the global evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy and international markets continue to build. Our recent economic analysis from the Peter [indiscernible] Cancer Center in Australia published in BJU International reviewed nearly 6,000 prostatectomy from the Victorian admitted episode data set. Their analysis found da Vinci Prostatectomy to because equivalent open prostatectomy where 140 da Vinci procedures per year will perform on a systemic well below the global third quarter annualized average of approximately 190 procedures per system. During the study period from 2010 to 2013, the rate of open prostatectomy has declined from approximately 73% to 47% among public hospitals in Victoria due to an increase in the adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy. 
This concludes my remarks, and I thank you for your remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth of between 13% and 14%.
Turning to gross profit. Our outlook for gross profit has again modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be between a range of 67.5% and 68.5% of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our third quarter gross margin as Q3 benefited from favorable product mix and other actors, which we expect to return to more typical patterns in Q 4. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates. 
Turning to operating expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of our range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. 
Also consistent with our last call, we expect our 2015 noncash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of a $170 million to $180 million range, roughly flat compared to $169 million in 2014. 
We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015.

One of them is sensor technology has been advancing rapidly around the world having to do with technology development for other things like cell phones. We can take advantage of that for applications in surgical applications by developing sensors and products that are specific to what surgeons want to do and see. That's one dimension. The other dimension is to use other types of imaging modality, sometimes other frequency bands, sometimes molecules to allow surgeons to see things that are not visible with the naked eye. So highlight structures or highlight anatomical organisms that a surgeon want to see during the surgery. And that's since firefly really the platform idea, not just a single molecule.

Overall, company performance in the quarter was solid with robust procedure growth, solid capital performance and improved operating margins.Starting with procedures. Year-over-year growth in the third quarter",892,"Thank you for joining us on the call today. Overall, company performance in the quarter was solid with robust procedure growth, solid capital performance and improved operating margins.
Starting with procedures. Year-over-year growth in the third quarter accelerated to 15% compared with Q3 2014. Procedure performance mirrored our experience in the first half of the year with strength in hernia repair, colon and rectal resections, solid growth in prostatectomy and stable trends in hysterectomy. Internationally, growth trends in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. Growth in Europe, China and Korea was multidisciplinary with particular strength in urology. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Turning to capital sales. We placed 117 systems in the quarter compared to 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Capital placements in the United States accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. Customers are preferring our most capable products and Xi Systems, and dual console configurations represented a larger proportion of placements in the quarter relative to a year ago.
In Japan, procedure growth was solid and driven by growth in urology. As we've said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators are submitting their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues with work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement for additional procedures. While we have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time, Japanese authorities will review reimbursement submissions for partial nephrectomy for inclusion in 2016 national coverage. Conversations regarding reimbursement for other procedures are ongoing. However, inclusion of other procedures and full reimbursement guidelines in 2016 are unlikely.
Turning to operating performance. Our product operations teams have been focused on reducing costs for our new products, and we have been managing our fixed expenses carefully.
This quarter was another step in the right direction on gross margins helped by product mix and some costs coming in at the lower end of their expected ranges. We will continue to focus on improvements in direct product costs over the next several quarters. As we look at the long-term financial position of our products, we anticipate making targeted capital investments over the next few quarters in programs that we believe will facilitate better long-term product and operating margins. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.
In summary, our operating performance for the third quarter is as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the third quarter of last year. We placed 117 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $590 million, up 10% from prior year and up 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $298 million, up 10% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $240 million in the quarter compared with $197 million in the third quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $199 million compared to $145 million in Q3 of 2014.
We are deeply committed to advancing our technologies and offerings to benefit surgeons, their patients and hospitals. We have launched integrated table motion for Xi in Europe this October and have submitted our U.S. 510(k) application. Table motion allows surgeons to interactively use gravity for retraction and eases patient management during da Vinci Xi surgical cases. As many of you saw at the American College of Surgeons Meeting earlier this month, initial customer feedback has been strong. We also submitted our 510(k) for our Single-Site instrument kit for Xi in the third quarter with the intent of bringing our single-incision tools to the Xi platform.
In addition, we submitted a 510(k) application for our 30-millimeter stapler for Xi in the third quarter. This instrument has particular utility in thoracic surgery and includes multiple staple sizes, including green, blue, white and gray reloads.
Regarding our next-generation single-port technology, our technical teams continue to meet their development milestones for da Vinci Sp, having completed the build of our first hand-Xi compatible systems. 5 of which are slated for human clinical use. We anticipate increased clinical valuations of da Vinci Sp in 2016, particularly in transoral and transabdominal applications.
Lastly, da Vinci Systems are sophisticated network computing systems. The availability of these computational resources allows for both real-time analytics that can provide surgeons relevant information, for example, the SmartPlant feature implemented in our stapler as well as anonymized utilization data that administration can use to help optimize the robotic surgery programs. We are developing increased computational capability in both real-time and program level applications. Along with the field force of workflow experts, this analytic capability allows us to aid our customers both during surgery and in optimizing their robotic surgery programs. As we've discussed on prior calls, for 2015, we remain focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally; developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; advancing our technologies to improve surgery and lowering our direct product costs.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who'll review our financial performance."
30239,311300785,878391,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We",1443,"Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Pro forma third quarter revenue was $590 million, an increase of 10% compared with $534 million for the third quarter of 2014 and an increase of 1% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the third quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with the offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014.
Third quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 162,000 grew approximately 15% compared with the third quarter of 2014. and were approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015.  Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 10% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and was approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange and customer buying patterns.
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past 4 quarters with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of new instruments and the impact of foreign exchange.
Pro forma system revenue of $174 million increased 13% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales and higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the second quarter reflects a higher number of operating leases partially offset by higher average system sales prices.
117 systems were placed in the third quarter compared with 111 systems in the third quarter of 2014 and 118 systems last quarter. 77% systems placed this quarter were Xis compared with 53% in the third quarter of 2014 and 64% in the second quarter of 2015. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Globally, our average system price of $1.6 million increased compare with $1.45 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.5 million last quarter. Our third quarter 2015 ASP was our highest to date, reflecting an unusually high mix of dual consoles, including a high number of shipments to academic centers. We shipped 29 dual console Xis in the third quarter of 2015 compared with 13 last year and 18 last quarter. We expect to return to our historical mix of dual consoles and therefore, expect our future ASP to be lower than this quarter. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rates.
Hospitals financed approximately 25% of the systems placed in the third quarter, up from 21% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems, including placing the most operating leases, 13, since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter of 2014. As of the end of the quarter, there were 36 systems out in the field under operating leases. Revenue from operating leases was less than $2 million in the third quarter. We expect the impacts of operating leases from our system -- we exclude the impacts of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. The number of systems placed under operating leases will vary quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $117 million increased 8% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the second quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base of da Vinci systems.
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $151 million decreased 1% compared with $153 million for the third quarter of 2014 and decreased 10% compared with $168 million last quarter. The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower system sales into China and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher revenue -- higher recurring revenue driven by approximately 28% higher procedure volume. The decrease compared with the last quarter was driven by lower system unit sales and timing of customer instrument and accessory sales.
Outside the U.S., we placed 37 systems in the third quarter compared with 50 in the third quarter of 2014 and 46 systems last quarter. OUS system placements included 9 systems into Japan compared with 7 last year and 13 last quarter; 19 systems into Europe compared with 25 last year and 22 last quarter; and no systems into China this quarter compared with 10 last year and none last quarter. System placements will continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was 69.3% compared with 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 68% for the second quarter of 2015. Compared with both the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter 2014, the higher third quarter 2015 gross margin reflects higher system ASPs, improved efficiencies, lower inventory charges among other factors.  
The increase in gross margins relative to the third quarter of 2014 also reflects charges to cost of sales related to the Si stapler recall in 2014. In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the third quarter of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. At the end of the third quarter, $30 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated cost have been paid.
Pro forma operating costs, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and the amortization of purchased IP, increased 4% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and were less -- 1% less than last quarter. The year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 25.6% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax quarter ruling involving an independent third party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit unless such credit is reinstated.
Our third quarter 2015 pro forma income was $199 million or $5.24 per share compared with $145 million or $3.92 per share for the third quarter of 2014 and $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter 2015. Excluding the prior period tax benefits, our third quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.47 per share.
As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $550 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $586 million for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 70,000 shares for $36 million in average purchase price of $509 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

As mentioned earlier, total third quarter year-over-year procedures were approximately 15% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 28%. In the U.S., third quarter procedure growth",679,"Thanks, Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total third quarter year-over-year procedures were approximately 15% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 28%. In the U.S., third quarter procedure growth of approximately 12% accelerated modestly from first half growth of approximately 10% driven by an uptick in the growth of general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration. It remains uncertain how sustainable the year-to-date growth in these mature procedures will be in future periods.
In urology, trends observed during the first half of the year continued through the third quarter. Growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at similar rates since the first half of 2015 with da Vinci Prostatectomy growth again exceeding our expectations. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market.
In gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy partially offset by declines in benign procedures. Similar to the first half of the year, increased proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists.
Third quarter growth in general surgery increased compared to the first half of the year with robust growth in hernia repair and an uptick in colorectal procedures being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. Hernia repair continued to drive the majority of growth in general surgery procedures during the quarter.
Earlier this month at the American College of Surgeons Meeting, several presentations highlighted the emerging role of da Vinci surgery in ventral and inguinal hernia repair. Surgeons commented on the advantages of da Vinci surgery, which included precise dissection, improved visualization, secure closure of the primary defect, plication of the abdominal wall, suture fixation of mesh and a reduction in post-operative pain for patients. Specific to ventral hernia repair, Dr. Ballecer from the Banner Health Network compared 180 da Vinci hernia repairs to over 60,000 lap and open hernia repairs from the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database and found that reduction in hospital length of stay and complications saved approximately $550 per case compared to laparoscopy and over $700 per case compared to open surgery. We are encouraged by these early clinical and economic validations around the use of da Vinci surgery in hernia repair.
Regarding our Single-Site cholecystectomy business, as we've stated over the past 4 quarters, our total cholecystectomy procedures declined through the rate -- though the rate of decline moderated in the third quarter, as growth in multi-cholecystectomy has offset much of the decline in Single-Site cholecystectomies. It is our belief that customers are finding added value in a more complex population, therefore, gravitating to the traditional da Vinci multi-port approach. Firefly technology was used in approximately 40% of da Vinci cholecystectomies in the quarter.
Looking abroad during the third quarter. The approximate 28% international procedure growth was led by global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. Procedure growth in Europe remained steady through the first 9 months of the year, while the acceleration in procedure growth in Asia that began during the first half of the year continued into the third quarter.
During the quarter, the global evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy in international markets continued to build. A recent economic analysis from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Australia published in BJU International reviewed nearly 6,000 prostatectomies from the Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset. Their analysis found da Vinci Prostatectomy to be cost equivalent to open prostatectomy, where 140 da Vinci procedures per year were performed on the system, well below the global third quarter annualized average of approximately 190 procedures per system. During the study period from 2010 to 2013, the rate of open prostatectomies declined from approximately 73% to 47% among public hospitals in Victoria due to an increase in the adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy.
This concludes my remarks, and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth of between 13% and 14%.
Turning to gross profit. Our outlook for gross profit has again modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be between a range of 67.5% and 68.5% of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our third quarter gross margin as Q3 benefited from favorable product mix and other factors, which we expect to return to more typical patterns in Q4. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.
Turning to operating expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels.
Also consistent with our last call, we expect our 2015 non-cash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of a $170 million to $180 million range, roughly flat compared to $169 million in 2014.
We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, for Q4, we expect our pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, consistent with our previous estimates. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.

I can't remember when in the third quarter you did not see a sequential decline, whether that was related to seasonality or some of the other factors that were influencing your business. So can you maybe just talk about what's going on in the overall environment and whether what we're seeing now is the impact of sunsetting some of the concerns that surfaced a couple of years ago and maybe what maybe materialized in the third quarter that might have made for the outsized performance?"

So from thoracis surgery to general surgery, things in the colon and others are -- in gynecology are of interest to Japanese surgeons and are in active discussion. To get into the national reimbursement, there are a couple of different pathways, wherein one of them is called Senshin Iryo B for the process that we're in for partial nephrectomy. The government has asked to see that data and is going to review it. And so we're not guaranteed what and when, but it's part of the formal process. Other ones are not yet in that formal process. The government can choose to send it down a different reimbursement process. If that happens, then we have some assurance that it's likely that we'll report that out to you.

So there are some small technical differences, but from in terms of what a surgeon can do, they are pretty similar. Xi has -- offers a couple of advantages having to do with the way the arms work. But I think, for the most part, you can think of them as equivalent. The reason people have an interest in them are a certain number of hospitals have, really, room in their program for a single robotic system. If they want that mix to include Single-Site and they want to be able to upgrade the Xi technology, this gives them that option, so for those one system sites that lets them do the full portfolio of the things they want to do."

As we've spoken before, there are a few things that I think are coming together that can really benefit surgeons. One of them is that sensor technology has been advancing rapidly around the world having to do with technology development for other things like cell phones. We can take advantage of that for applications in surgical applications by developing sensors and products that are specific to what surgeons want to do and see. That's one dimension. The other dimension is to use other types of imaging modalities, sometimes other frequency bands, sometimes molecules, to allow surgeons to see things that are not visible with the naked eye, so highlight structures or highlight anatomical organisms that a surgeon wants to see during the surgery. In that sense, Firefly is really a platform idea, not just a single molecule. And so over time, we think there are things that we can bring to market that will allow surgeons to see more and to customize their vision for the -- a procedure they want to be in."

We have a wide range from Xi down to Si-es and Si research, and that range is very large. And what we find is that the majority of our customers buy capability. I think, in the this last quarter, you can look at what the Xi to Si exchange, what that mix was. We explore and we think about where are there other positions and price points that make sense. Certainly, we hear the same kinds of customer commentary that you hear and others hear. And I think the real question is not what you show on the show floor.

And that gives us the opportunity to have them be cost effective for the customer. Those are good things to invest in. There's a point at which we believe we're early in the adoption of robotic surgery globally. And so some of that gross margin is around the cost to us, and some of it is around price. And what we want to be able to do is lower the price -- the cost point to us and that gives us flexibility with regard to the price point. And so that's what we're doing, and that's what we're focused on.

One is product mix, and the products -- the margins on I&A are greater than they are on systems, so to the extent that we have systems doing well or not doing well, that will swing the margin. Also, geographic mix where we sell in United States and in dollars, obviously, we sell to our distributors at a discount to that. We sell to -- in certain markets in foreign currencies, and depending on foreign exchange, that can have some impact on the amount of revenue that we have. And then we have expanding opportunities at -- in our newer products, and those newer products happen to have lower margins. And so to the extent that we're successful in, let's say, stapling and vessel sealing, it's a positive for the company because you're taking greater share of wallet. But in terms of the gross margin percentage, it will push down the gross margin percentage because the margins on those products are not as high as our mature products. So there's a number of different things that can affect gross margin. As far as leverage, we manage the company wisely. We try to improve margins. We have a number of programs, like we said, in place to reduce the cost of products. But we're also -- as Gary said, we're new in a lot of markets, and we will expand -- we will sacrifice a point of margin for expansion of market."

So that helped us out. As Marshall said, there were negligible inventory charges in the quarter, and other costs -- other charges to cost of sales were pretty minor. So a lot of things lined up pretty well for us in the fourth quarter -- or in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we think it'll probably revert to a more typical pattern in terms of the product mix and some of the other costs and a seasonally stronger capital quarter, get more system sales.

Overall, company performance in the quarter was solid with robust procedure growth, solid capital performance and improved operating margins.Starting with procedures. Year-over-year growth in the third quarter",894,"Thank you for joining us on the call today. Overall, company performance in the quarter was solid with robust procedure growth, solid capital performance and improved operating margins.
Starting with procedures. Year-over-year growth in the third quarter accelerated to 15% compared with Q3 2014. Procedure performance mirrored our experience in the first half of the year with strength in hernia repair, colon and rectal resections, solid growth in prostatectomy and stable trends in hysterectomy. Internationally, growth trends in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. Growth in Europe, China and Korea was multidisciplinary with particular strength in urology. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.
Turning to capital sales. We placed 117 systems in the quarter compared to 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Capital placements in the United States accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. Customers are preferring our most capable products and Xi Systems, and dual console configurations represented a larger proportion of placements in the quarter relative to a year ago.
In Japan, procedure growth was solid and driven by growth in urology. As we've said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators are submitting their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues with work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement for additional procedures. While we have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time, Japanese authorities will review reimbursement submissions for partial nephrectomy for inclusion in 2016 national coverage. Conversations regarding reimbursement for other procedures are ongoing. However, inclusion of other procedures and full reimbursement guidelines in 2016 are unlikely.
Turning to operating performance. Our product operations teams have been focused on reducing costs for our new products, and we have been managing our fixed expenses carefully.
This quarter was another step in the right direction on gross margins helped by product mix and some costs coming in at the lower end of their expected ranges. We will continue to focus on improvements in direct product costs over the next several quarters. As we look at the long-term financial position of our products, we anticipate making targeted capital investments over the next few quarters in programs that we believe will facilitate better long-term product and operating margins. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.
In summary, our operating performance for the third quarter is as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the third quarter of last year. We placed 117 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $590 million, up 10% from prior year and up 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $298 million, up 10% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $240 million in the quarter compared with $197 million in the third quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $199 million compared to $145 million in Q3 of 2014.
We are deeply committed to advancing our technologies and offerings to benefit surgeons, their patients and hospitals. We have launched integrated table motion for Xi in Europe this October and have submitted our U.S. 510(k) application. Table motion allows surgeons to interactively use gravity for retraction and eases patient management during da Vinci Xi surgical cases. As many of you saw at the American College of Surgeons Meeting earlier this month, initial customer feedback has been strong. We also submitted our 510(k) for our Single-Site instrument kit for Xi in the third quarter with the intent of bringing our single-incision tools to the Xi platform.
In addition, we submitted a 510(k) application for our 30-millimeter stapler for Xi in the third quarter. This instrument has particular utility in thoracic surgery and includes multiple staple sizes, including green, blue, white and gray reloads.
Regarding our next-generation single-port technology, our technical teams continue to meet their development milestones for da Vinci Sp, having completed the build of our first hand-Xi compatible systems, 5 of which are slated for human clinical use. We anticipate increased clinical valuations of da Vinci Sp in 2016, particularly in transoral and transabdominal applications.
Lastly, da Vinci Systems are a sophisticated network of computing systems. The availability of these computational resources allows for both real-time analytics that can provide surgeons relevant information, for example, the SmartPlant feature implemented in our stapler as well as anonymized utilization data that administration can use to help optimize the robotic surgery programs. We are developing increased computational capability in both real-time and program level applications. Along with the field force of workflow experts, this analytic capability allows us to aid our customers both during surgery and in optimizing their robotic surgery programs. As we've discussed on prior calls, for 2015, we remain focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally; developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; advancing our technologies to improve surgery and lowering our direct product costs.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who'll review our financial performance."
30239,311300785,878412,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We",1446,"Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Pro forma third quarter revenue was $590 million, an increase of 10% compared with $534 million for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 1% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the third quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with the offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014.
Third quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 162,000 grew approximately 15% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and were approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015.  Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 10% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and was approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange and customer buying patterns.
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past 4 quarters with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of new instruments and the impact of foreign exchange.
Pro forma system revenue of $174 million increased 13% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales and higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the second quarter reflects a higher number of operating leases partially offset by higher average system sales prices.
117 systems were placed in the third quarter compared with 111 systems in the third quarter of 2014 and 118 systems last quarter. Seventy-seven percent of the systems placed this quarter were Xis compared with 53% in the third quarter of 2014 and 64% in the second quarter of 2015. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Globally, our average system price of $1.6 million increased compared with $1.45 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.5 million last quarter. Our third quarter 2015 ASP was our highest to date, reflecting an unusually high mix of dual consoles, including a high number of shipments to academic centers. We shipped 29 dual console Xis in the third quarter of 2015 compared with 13 last year and 18 last quarter. We expect to return to our historical mix of dual consoles and therefore, expect our future ASP to be lower than this quarter. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rates.
Hospitals financed approximately 25% of the systems placed in the third quarter, up from 21% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems, including placing the most operating leases, 13, since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter of 2014. As of the end of the quarter, there were 36 systems out in the field under operating leases. Revenue from operating leases was less than $2 million in the third quarter. We expect the impacts of operating leases from our system -- we exclude the impacts of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. The number of systems placed under operating leases will vary quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $117 million increased 8% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the second quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base of da Vinci systems.
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $151 million decreased 1% compared with $153 million for the third quarter of 2014 and decreased 10% compared with $168 million last quarter. The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower system sales into China and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher revenue -- higher recurring revenue driven by approximately 28% higher procedure volume. The decrease compared with the last quarter was driven by lower system unit sales and timing of customer instrument and accessory sales.
Outside the U.S., we placed 37 systems in the third quarter compared with 50 in the third quarter of 2014 and 46 systems last quarter. OUS system placements included 9 systems into Japan compared with 7 last year and 13 last quarter; 19 systems into Europe compared with 25 last year and 22 last quarter; and no systems into China this quarter compared with 10 last year and none last quarter. System placements will continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was 69.3% compared with 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 68% for the second quarter of 2015. Compared with both the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter 2014, the higher third quarter 2015 gross margin reflects higher system ASPs, improved efficiencies, lower inventory charges among other factors.  
The increase in gross margins relative to the third quarter of 2014 also reflects charges to cost of sales related to the Si stapler recall in 2014. In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the third quarter of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. At the end of the third quarter, $30 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated cost have been paid.
Pro forma operating costs, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and the amortization of purchased IP, increased 4% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and were less -- 1% less than last quarter. The year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 25.6% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit unless such credit is reinstated.
Our third quarter 2015 pro forma income was $199 million or $5.24 per share compared with $145 million or $3.92 per share for the third quarter of 2014 and $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the prior period tax benefits, our third quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.47 per share.
As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $550 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $586 million for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 70,000 shares for $36 million in average purchase price of $509 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."
30239,311300785,878412,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total third quarter year-over-year procedures were approximately 15% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 28%. In the U.S., third quarter procedure growth",679,"Thanks, Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total third quarter year-over-year procedures were approximately 15% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 28%. In the U.S., third quarter procedure growth of approximately 12% accelerated modestly from first half growth of approximately 10% driven by an uptick in the growth of general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration. It remains uncertain how sustainable the year-to-date growth in these mature procedures will be in future periods.
In urology, trends observed during the first half of the year continued through the third quarter. Growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at similar rates as the first half of 2015 with da Vinci Prostatectomy growth again exceeding our expectations. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market.
In gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy partially offset by declines in benign procedures. Similar to the first half of the year, increased proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists.
Third quarter growth in general surgery increased compared to the first half of the year with robust growth in hernia repair and an uptick in colorectal procedures being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. Hernia repair continued to drive the majority of growth in general surgery procedures during the quarter.
Earlier this month at the American College of Surgeons Meeting, several presentations highlighted the emerging role of da Vinci surgery in ventral and inguinal hernia repair. Surgeons commented on the advantages of da Vinci surgery, which included precise dissection, improved visualization, secure closure of the primary defect, plication of the abdominal wall, suture fixation of mesh and a reduction in post-operative pain for patients. Specific to ventral hernia repair, Dr. Ballecer from the Banner Health Network compared 180 da Vinci hernia repairs to over 60,000 lap and open hernia repairs from the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database and found the reduction in hospital length of stay and complications saved approximately $550 per case compared to laparoscopy and over $700 per case compared to open surgery. We are encouraged by these early clinical and economic validations around the use of da Vinci surgery in hernia repair.
Regarding our Single-Site cholecystectomy business, as we've stated over the past 4 quarters, our total cholecystectomy procedures declined through the rate -- though the rate of decline moderated in the third quarter, as growth in multi-cholecystectomies offset much of the decline in Single-Site cholecystectomies. It is our belief that customers are finding added value in a more complex patient population, therefore, gravitating to the traditional da Vinci multi-port approach. Firefly technology was used in approximately 40% of da Vinci cholecystectomies in the quarter.
Looking abroad during the third quarter. The approximate 28% international procedure growth was led by global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. Procedure growth in Europe remained steady through the first 9 months of the year, while the acceleration in procedure growth in Asia that began during the first half of the year continued into the third quarter.
During the quarter, the global evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy in international markets continued to build. A recent economic analysis from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Australia published in BJU International reviewed nearly 6,000 prostatectomies from the Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset. Their analysis found da Vinci Prostatectomy to be cost equivalent to open prostatectomy, where 140 da Vinci procedures per year were performed on the system, well below the global third quarter annualized average of approximately 190 procedures per system. During the study period from 2010 to 2013, the rate of open prostatectomies declined from approximately 73% to 47% among public hospitals in Victoria due to an increase in the adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy.
This concludes my remarks, and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth of between 13% and 14%.
Turning to gross profit. Our outlook for gross profit has again modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be between a range of 67.5% and 68.5% of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our third quarter gross margin as Q3 benefited from favorable product mix and other factors, which we expect to return to more typical patterns in Q4. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.
Turning to operating expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels.
Also consistent with our last call, we expect our 2015 non-cash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of a $170 million to $180 million range, roughly flat compared to $169 million in 2014.
We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, for Q4, we expect our pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income, consistent with our previous estimates. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.

Surgical societies play a role as well as government societies in deciding what data is required and kind of in what sequence they want to address those different procedures. So from thoracic surgery to general surgery, things in the colon and others are -- in gynecology are of interest to Japanese surgeons and are in active discussion. To get into the national reimbursement, there are a couple of different pathways, wherein one of them called Senshin Iryo B for the process that we're in for partial nephrectomy. The government has asked to see that data and is going to review it. And so we're not guaranteed what and when, but it's part of the formal process. Other ones are not yet in that formal process. The government can choose to send it down a different reimbursement process. If that happens and we have some assurance that, that is likely, then we'll report that out to you. So I think, in terms of the near-term and national coverage, partial nephrectomy is the one to keep your eye on. I am not generally upset about progress. I think that there is a fair amount of interest. I think the conversations are active, and it's just continuing to push forward."

So there are some advantages there. As general surgeons get comfortable, then they start to explore other things that they can do with the tool. And sometimes it goes ventral to inguinal.

One of them is that sensor technology has been advancing rapidly around the world having to do with technology development for other things like cell phones. We can take advantage of that for applications in surgical applications by developing sensors and products that are specific to what surgeons want to do and see. That's one dimension. The other dimension is to use other types of imaging modalities, sometimes other frequency bands, sometimes molecules, to allow surgeons to see things that are not visible with the naked eye, so highlight structures or highlight anatomical organisms that a surgeon wants to see during the surgery.

And we understand the technology pretty well and have been thoughtful about it in terms of what we've developed. As you refer to in your question, and I completely agree, it's about value, not price. And the question is what are the outcomes that are going to be derived by these kinds of systems and what's the price point at which you can offer them. We have a wide range from Xi down to Si-es and Si research, and that range is very large. And what we find is that the majority of our customers buy capability. I think in the this last quarter, you can look at what the Xi to Si exchange, what that mix was. We explore and we think about where are there other positions and price points that make sense. Certainly, we hear the same kinds of customer commentary that you hear and others hear. And I think the real question is not what you show on the show floor? It's what do these systems do in surgery? And that's going to come down to what can they deliver, what can kind of outcomes can they deliver, and that's how we think about it."

So I take commentary from you and Marshall the last couple of quarters. I mean, there's 2 data points that come out. It feels like gross margins above 68% and EBIT margins above 40% are going to be challenging, but then based on this quarter, it's very clear you certainly have the ability to surpass those 2 margin objectives.

I think, just stepping in and I'll tell you what we care about and where we're headed. I think that in these technologies, there, as -- I said before, there are complex mixtures of robotics and imaging and instrumentation, and there's a certain amount of investment that's required to put them in position that they're cost effective for the company. And that gives us the opportunity to have them be cost effective for the customer. Those are good things to invest in. There's a point at which we believe we're early in the adoption of robotic surgery globally. And so some of that gross margin is around the cost to us, and some of it is around price. And what we want to be able to do is lower the price -- the cost point to us and that gives us flexibility with regard to the price point. And so that's what we're doing and that's what we're focused on. Where we'll go long term will depend a lot on, we think, both what we can do in terms of our supply chain and our design and where we think the customer value equation is."

One is product mix, and the products -- the margins on I&A are greater than they are on systems, so to the extent that we have systems doing well or not doing well, then that will swing the margin. We also have geographic mix where we sell in the United States and in dollars, obviously, we sell to our distributors at a discount to that. We sell to -- in certain markets in foreign currencies and depending on foreign exchange, that can have some impact on the amount of revenue that we have. And then we have expanding opportunities at -- in our newer products, and those newer products happen to have lower margins. And so to the extent that we're successful in, let's say, stapling and vessel sealing, it's a positive for the company because you're taking greater share of wallet. But in terms of the gross margin percentage, it will push down the gross margin percentage because the margins on those products are not as high as our mature products. So there's a number of different things that can affect gross margin. As far as leverage, we manage the company wisely. We try to improve margins. We have a number of programs, like we said, in place to reduce the cost of products. But we're also -- as Gary said, we're new in a lot of markets, and we will expand -- we will sacrifice a point of margin for expansion of market."

So that helped us out. As Marshall said, there were negligible inventory charges in the quarter, and other costs -- other charges to cost of sales were pretty minor. So a lot of things lined up pretty well for us in the fourth quarter -- or in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we think it'll probably revert to a more typical pattern in terms of the product mix and some of the other costs and a seasonally stronger capital quarter if you have more system sales. Those carry lower margins than the recurring revenue side. And we'll have more definitive comments about '16 on the next call."
