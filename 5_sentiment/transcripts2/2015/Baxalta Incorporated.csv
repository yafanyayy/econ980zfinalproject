Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We're very excited to update you on significant progress as we are delivering on our strategic plan. This includes today's announcement of strong financial results for Baxalta's first qua",766,"Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We're very excited to update you on significant progress as we are delivering on our strategic plan. This includes today's announcement of strong financial results for Baxalta's first quarter as an independent company and a compelling outlook for 2016.
Positive momentum continues across our portfolio. Sales, excluding currency, grew 13%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.56 exceeded our guidance. We're also providing a preliminary outlook for 2016. This plan reflects accelerated top line growth and strong operational performance. Our management team has increased conviction in achieving our aspiration of double-digit earnings growth beyond 2016. This confidence stems from our new product pipeline, which includes several programs with significant peak revenue potential. We remain on track to achieve our objective of 20 new product launches by 2020.
We are also executing a disciplined M&A strategy. Transactions like the recently completed ONCASPAR acquisition, reflect our strategic and financial intent, focused on generating attractive returns for shareholders. Baxalta's strong financial performance and meaningful pipeline achievements validate our company's compelling growth prospects and commitment to enhance shareholder value.
Our strength as an independent standalone company is based on multiple value drivers. Our first priority is building 3 sustainable businesses in hematology, immunology and oncology, with a focus on rare diseases and underserved conditions.
Our hematology business is delivering significant growth in an increasingly competitive environment. This quarter, strong performance was led by ADVATE with robust demand in U.S. and internationally. FEIBA continues to exceed our expectations globally, and revenues were bolstered by new products, including RIXUBIS and OBIZUR.
In immunology, we continue to capitalize on solid underlying fundamentals: enhanced supply and the successful launch of HYQVIA. And in oncology, we're successfully integrating the ONCASPAR acquisition and booked our first quarter of sales. Overall, this performance provides a solid foundation for accelerated growth and sustainability.
Our second priority is innovation. John Orloff will discuss many recent highlights in a moment. It is clear that we're making great progress on building a rich pipeline, establishing a solid track record towards our objective of launching 20 new products by 2020. This includes many late-stage assets, novel mechanisms and disruptive technologies.
Over the last 2 years, we have received 70 regulatory approvals. This includes OBIZUR, RIXUBIS, and HYQVIA. In addition, we have full products under regulatory review, ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI, 20% subQ and nal-IRI.
Success in bringing innovative treatments to market provides significant commercial opportunity. In 2015, we expect new product sales of approximately $280 million. Based on our current annualized run rate and pending approvals, we expect the contribution from new products in 2016 of approximately $750 million.
By 2020, we expect new product sales of $2.8 billion on a risk-adjusted basis. It is important to note that approximately 90% of these sales are from products that have already been approved or under regulatory review or have generated positive Phase III clinical data.
As R&D and clinical risks are minimized, the estimates provided in our initial 2020 financial outlook could prove conservative. We have risk adjusted our 2020 outlook by more than $1 billion. On a non-risk-adjusted basis, new product revenues in 2020 are projected to be approximately $4 billion.
Importantly, Baxalta's pipeline is balanced and diverse. More than a dozen new products have peak sales potential in excess of $500 million. Therapies like ADYNOVATE, BAX 826 and gene therapy treatments, HYQVIA, oncology therapy, biosimilars and those from our SuppreMol acquisition will drive meaningful value beyond 2020.
By 2025, the new product portfolio is projected to generate more than $7 billion on a risk-adjusted basis and accounts for more than 60% of Baxalta's total sales.
In addition to new product launches, another key priority and component of our strategy is M&A. Our financial flexibility is enhanced by ability to generate more than $5 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years. Our M&A strategy will be focused and targeted. Evaluation of opportunities will be based on those presenting a strong strategic fit within our core therapeutic orphan disease areas and a disciplined financial framework will be applied with focus on generating attractive returns on invested capital.
In summary, we have a strong foundation. We have sustainable leadership position across our portfolio. We are an established global leader in orphan diseases. We have significant growth prospects and are executing on our strategies. We're driving meaningful R&D innovation. Our ongoing financial strength and compelling outlook position us well to significantly enhance value for patients, customers and shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to John Orloff. John?"

We have been tapping in",571,"Thanks, Ludwig, and good morning, everyone. Our new redesigned R&D model is focused on orphan diseases, and we continue to share from life cycle management to advancing novel molecules and disruptive technologies like gene therapy. We have been tapping into strong talent to join our new R&D center in Cambridge, and we have generated momentum with the achievement of several clinical and regulatory milestones while leveraging external renovation where it makes strategic and financial sense.
I'm pleased to share the significant progress we have made since our investor conference in May of this year. In hematology, we have completed late-stage reviews of ADYNOVATE and VONVENDI and continue to expect FDA approval for both therapies before the end of the year.
During the third quarter, pivotal Phase III data for VONVENDI was published in Blood, the Journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data showed 100% of patients treated with VONVENDI are highly purified recombinant von Willebrand factor achieved success in the management of bleeding episodes.
In addition, we recently received approval of OBIZUR in Canada for patients with acquired hemophilia A, a very rare and life-threatening acute bleeding disorder. OBIZUR is the first treatment specifically designed to enable physicians to monitor treatment response by measuring factor VIII activity levels. Baxalta has also received a positive CHMP opinion on OBIZUR from the EMA, and we expect European marketing authorization later this year.
In immunology, we are expanding treatment options with a 20% subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency. The higher potency IG treatment is intended to offer faster infusions with less volume. The product is now under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe.
In partnership with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, we initiated a pivotal Phase III critical trial for BAX 923, a biosimilar version of HUMIRA in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. We are targeting the first regulatory submission of this biosimilar in 2017, and the first commercial launch is expected in 2018.
Lastly, our oncology business has made significant advances toward becoming a leader in orphan cancer treatments. In addition to the ONCASPAR leukemia portfolio acquisition completed this quarter, we have 2 late-stage assets and are preparing for launches beginning in 2016. Our partner, Merrimack, received approval in the U.S. and Taiwan last week for omnivide, or nal-IRI, for patients with pancreatic cancer following gene side to based therapy.
In addition, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial for first-line treatment of previously untreated patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Baxalta has exclusive rights for all indications outside the U.S. and Taiwan, and we are awaiting marketing authorization in Europe for omnivide as a second line of therapy.
Separately, we are seeking priority review by the FDA for pacritinib with our partners CPI Biopharma for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. A U.S. submission is planned for the fourth quarter, followed by submission in Europe.
Our R&D strategy is focused on innovating for unmet needs, placing patients at the center of everything we do. Our goal is to develop game-changing therapies that have a significant clinical impact on patients' lives. Momentum is building. The cadence of new product launches between now and 2020 is steady and balanced across all 3 businesses. We are improving our R&D credibility and making significant advances to our portfolio, and we look forward to providing you with future updates.
Thanks, and now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob Hombach."
261084576,312658375,885381,"Baxalta Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Baxalta Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our financial results for the quarter, I would like to take a few moments to discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. As you know, our 2014 and first half",2326,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our financial results for the quarter, I would like to take a few moments to discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. As you know, our 2014 and first half 2015 results are presented on a carved-out basis and, as a result, will not be directly comparable to our financial results as a standalone enterprise. These historical results are inherently limited as they exclude several items, such as capitalized interest, do not reflect actual interest and tax expense or costs associated with running Baxalta is an independent stand-alone company. Therefore, comparisons to prior periods over the next year will be challenging as they will not be on an apples-to-apples basis. For this reason, we plan to focus our upcoming quarterly discussions on a performance versus our guidance, which is based on our targeted P&L profile we communicated at our May investor conference. We feel that this will provide the most useful information to investors when trying to assess the underlying performance of Baxalta.
That being said, as we've mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.45 per diluted share include net after-tax special items totaling $76 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Special items were primarily for intangible asset amortization, expenses associated with the company's separation, certain business development and collaboration-related items and a gain from the sale of the company's Maxim business, which is classified as a discontinued operation.
As Ludwig mentioned in the third quarter, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50 per share. This performance reflects positive sales momentum across the portfolio, including enhanced value from new products and strong operational performance.
Now let me briefly walk you through the adjusted P&L before turning to the financial outlook. Starting with sales, on a pro forma basis, worldwide sales in the third quarter totaled approximately $1.6 billion, an increase 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 13%, which favorably compares to the sales guidance we previously provided of 8% to 10%. Strong momentum across our product categories contributed to the overachievement. U.S. sales accelerated, generating growth of 14%, the highest quarterly growth rate in several years.
International sales on a constant currency basis increased 12% and were bolstered by penetration in emerging markets, particularly in the BRIC countries, where sales grew more than 25%. Year-to-date, total Baxalta revenues of approximately $4.5 billion increased 2%. And on a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales advanced 10%.
Our hematology business, which includes hemophilia and inhibitor therapies, generated global sales of $935 million in the third quarter, which declined 1% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, hematology sales advanced 10%. Year-to-date, hematology sales of $2.6 billion declined 3% versus the prior year on a reported basis, but grew 7% on a constant currency basis. Sales in hemophilia, which includes recombinant and plasma-derived treatments for hemophilia A and B patients, posted sales in the third quarter of $727 million, reflecting a decline of 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7%, reflecting an accelerated rate from the first half growth of 3%.
On a global basis, we continue to focus on enhancing access and elevating standards of care with strong demand for recombinant therapies, including ADVATE and RIXUBIS. ADVATE achieved double-digit sales growth on a global basis, led by strong international performance where we derive approximately 60% of ADVATE revenues. This growth is a result of shipments to Brazil and continued conversion to recombinant therapies as part of our ongoing collaboration with Hemobrax to enhance access to recombinant factor VIII therapy. For the full year 2015, we expect to convert more than 50% of the patients to ADVATE in Brazil and generate sales of more than $120 million.
In the U.S., ADVATE growth has demonstrated resiliency and has increased sequentially over the course of 2015, achieving mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by conversions to prophylaxis treatment and enhanced adherence.
Growing demand in the U.S. more than offsets very modest patient share loss, which is beginning to level off. The cumulative patient loss is now estimated at approximately 2 to 3 share points, and the pace of losses is flowing. This reflects the well-established strong efficacy and safety profile of ADVATE as well as our deep understanding of the hemophilia market and our excellent commercial teams. These are distinct competitive advantages that will be a key driver of our long-term sustainability.
Within the inhibitor therapies category, which includes FEIBA and OBIZUR, sales totaled $208 million and rose 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inhibitor sales advanced 22%. U.S. inhibitor sales advanced by 42%, primarily driven by increased demand for FEIBA as we continued to promote the prophylaxis indication, modest price improvements and sales of OBIZUR, which was launched late last year. Sales outside the U.S., which account for about 65% of our total inhibitor sales, increased 14% on a constant currency basis. This is the result of strong FEIBA demand, particularly in developing markets and part due to the timing of certain tender sales. We continue to expect robust growth across this product category over the long term. Inhibitor patients are the most difficult to treat. They're a significant unmet medical need and only 20% of patients globally are on a prophylactic regimen, presenting a significant long-term growth opportunity.
Turning to the immunology business, which includes immunoglobulin therapies such as and HYQVIA as well as biotherapeutics, pro forma sales totaled $626 million in the third quarter, which grew 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, immunology sales advanced 13% versus the prior year. Year-to-date, immunology sales of $1.8 billion increased 7% versus last year on a reported basis and advanced 12% on a constant currency basis. Immunoglobulin sales of $435 million increased 7% on a reported basis or 12% on a constant currency basis as we are enhancing penetration in undertreated diseases and capitalizing on our broad and differentiated portfolio of immunoglobulin therapies.
Growth on a global basis has accelerated driven by higher demand for our therapies and our improved supply position. In particular, Baxalta's IG brands are capturing share in the primary immunodeficiency segment, the fastest-growing chronic indication, where our performance exceeds market growth of high single digits.
In addition, HYQVIA, our transformational subcu therapy for PI patients, is experiencing strong uptake and a very favorable reception in the market by patients and physicians. HYQVIA's annual run rate now exceeds $100 million. More than 50% of our U.S. HYQVIA patients are converting from competitive IG therapies and approximately 25% our newly diagnosed patients.
We're also very pleased with the momentum in select European markets, which is being bolstered by accelerated growth in the Netherlands and launches in additional markets.
Lastly, in the biotherapeutics category, pro forma sales totaled $191 million, which grew 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 14%, driven by growth of albumin sales in the U.S. and China, improved growth of alpha-1 therapies and increased contract manufacturing revenues.
Our third business is oncology. As previously mentioned, we completed the ONCASPAR acquisition during the third quarter. ONCASPAR is a long-acting asparaginase, an important marketed biologic treatment for first-line acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, resulting in a highly effective cure in more than 80% of pediatric ALL patients in the United States. The integration of the business is on track with sales in the quarter totaling $34 million. ONCASPAR sales are now approaching an annual run rate of approximately $200 million, exceeding our expectations with a very attractive margin profile, which allows us to reinvest in the ONCASPAR portfolio through R&D to broaden global access and expand into additional indications.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin in the quarter was 61.9%. Positive product mix was the main driver, particularly due to strong sales of higher-margin products like ADVATE, FEIBA and ONCASPAR, along with a modest benefit from foreign currency hedging. While we have seen select pricing improvements in some product areas, the overall contribution from pricing in the quarter was immaterial.
SG&A totaled $313 million, representing 19.6% of sales. We're investing in marketing initiatives to prepare for new product introductions like the upcoming launches of ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and oncology therapies in addition to adding the appropriate level of investment to support Baxalta's new corporate and international infrastructure.
R&D spending in the quarter was $176 million or 11% of sales. With our aspiration to launch 20 new products by 2020, we are balancing investments across the 3 disease areas. In particular, we expect to drive sustainability in our hemophilia business as we progress ADYNOVATE, BAX 826 and our gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B.
In immunology, emphasis continues to be on new indications for HYQVIA, in addition to advancing the SuppreMol programs. And in oncology, we're building a collection of therapies focused on orphan cancer areas, including pacritinib for myelofibrosis, nal-IRI for pancreatic answer and our ONCASPAR leukemia portfolio.
Interest expense in the quarter was $23 million, reflecting interest on the $5 billion of debt issued in June prior to the spin, which was partially offset by the impact of capitalized interest. Other income of $19 million is driven by an unexpected gain of $16 million from our Baxalta Ventures equity investment. The tax rate was 22.1% for the quarter, and as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our financial outlook for the remainder of 2015 and full year 2016. Starting with our sales guidance. Based on the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year 2015. On a constant currency basis, we expect sales growth of approximately 8%. This includes ONCASPAR revenues of approximately $80 million. At today's rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively impact sales growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Therefore, our reported sales are expected to be flat to 2014.
On a constant currency basis, our full year outlook assumes growth in hematology of approximately 5% and immunology sales growth of approximately 9%. By product category, we expect growth in the hemophilia franchise of approximately 3%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance given better-than-expected performance of ADVATE. We are now assuming a cumulative patient share loss of 3 to 4 points from increased competition.
For the inhibitors category, we expect full year sales growth of 10% to 11%. This is somewhat lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of FEIBA shipments outside the U.S., impacting the fourth quarter.
For immunoglobulin therapies, we now expect growth of approximately 9%, driven by strong market demand and the success of HYQVIA. And we expect sales of biotherapeutics to grow approximately 10%.
Now for the fourth quarter, we project adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding special items of $0.55 to $0.57. This includes sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency of 3% to 5%, which is higher than our previous expectations.
On a reported basis, we're assuming an approximately 6 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency, and therefore, expect reported sales to decline 1% to 3%. Hematology sales on a constant currency basis are expected to be flat. Immunology sales are expected to grow in the 2% to 3% range and we
[Audio Gap]
very pleased with the -- with our results. As you said, we have a very strong momentum. And yes, we exceeded our sales guidance and EPS guidance again, and we continue to make solid progress on our pipeline. And so what we see here over the last couple of quarters is strong momentum across all our business -- all our decisions. Hematology is growing at 10%. Immunology is growing 13%. And what has changed in addition to those divisions going stronger, accelerating growth, is we have now the impact of oncology division with the first quarter sales booked in the third quarter with ONCASPAR. So it's a momentum that we have across the business. The spinoff allows us to focus on our front line. And this is also -- it was one of the reasons why we went through with the spinoff. So I'm really pleased with our focus. I'm really pleased with our very strong team, and I'm really pleased with the advances of that we see in our pipeline. New products start to kick in. So for this year, as we discussed, it's $280 million. The number that we gave you is higher than the number that we gave you before, $2.8 billion by 2020. This is risk adjusted. And a couple of major events happened here, not only on the business momentum side, but also, we get more and more conviction with respect to delivering on our promise of bringing innovative therapies to the market. So it is a momentum that goes across the board. With respect to our M&A, we will be disciplined with respect to M&A moving forward as we have been disciplined for the last couple of years. I think what we've done the type of deals ONCASPAR, the gene therapy acquisition, and so on and so on. These are the types of deals that we continue to look at. And we will be disciplined. We will have criteria in place that are from a -- that are strategic, that are financial -- with a financial framework, but more importantly, also from an integration perspective. Since we have a very rich pipeline, and this could be the biggest contribution to our top line of $2.8 billion by 2020. We want to make sure whatever we do on the M&A side, we don't disrupt the momentum that we have within the organization. And I will ask Bob to talk a little bit about operating margins."

I would characterize our May guidance as somewhat conservative, but clearly, at the bulk of the outperformance here is based on the business momentum. And this really goes back to a lot of the work that happened even before the spin. When Ludwig started the transformation of the R&D group a couple of years ago, we see very strong performance versus key R&D milestones here over the last year or so. The commercial organization Ludwig referred to is put in place as of January 1 of this year, 6 months before the spin. So not only have we hit the ground running on July 1, but really without missing a beat and in fact, gaining momentum with the increased global focus by franchise given this new structure. And then finally, as Ludwig mentioned, we have identified and are implementing opportunities within our cost base, both in margin as well as SG&A to further enhance margins going forward. So as you see in our second half 2015 outlook into 2016, really a carrying forward of stronger gross margin largely dropping through to operating margin going forward. So we're very confident in the outlook."

Now the numbers that we gave you are 90%, at least for 2020, 90% of that number comes from products that either got just recently approved, or under regulatory review or has positive Phase III data. So we're not waiting for something magical to happen. For us now, it's bringing those products across the regulatory finish line and then execute flawlessly as far as launch is concerned. Inhibitors growth is very solid. For the third quarter, it was 22%. And this is further prophy the prophy indication it's critical. Bob was talking about in fact, that prophy penetration is only 20%. In the U.S., it's a little bit higher but we still have a long way to go. So we clearly see a momentum there. OBIZUR, at this moment, is U.S. only. We got the approval in Canada. We will be launching. But this is really an innovative differentiated molecule. It also helps us to strengthen our position not only short term, but long term.

And OBIZUR, which we're very excited about long term, is going to be take some time to ramp up because it's a very rare disease for acquired hemophilia. And so again, the vast majority of the inhibitor growth is being driven by volume of primarily the prophylaxis indication as Ludwig mentioned. In the bio T space, couple of dynamics. We did see a resurgence of growth in our alpha-1 therapies, which we've got renewed focus on to drive that opportunity. That is an underdiagnosed and undertreated segment of the overall market. Good contribution from albumin in China and around the world, really in the U.S. strength as well. And then finally, we did get a modest contribution from contract manufacturing revenues in bio T. But even if you back those out, we still had double-digit growth in that bio T segment, again, driven by strong growth in albumin and alpha-1. The contract manufacturing is not only for Baxter, but also we are going to be providing some transition services to Pfizer, given the sale of the vaccine business. So eventually, those will go away. But again, that contributed maybe 3 or 4 points of growth to bio T. So still double digits without that."

We're looking at additional opportunities to expand the indication there. We have planned studies for pediatric patients and prophylaxis with BAX 111 recombinant von Willebrand's factor. We haven't said too much about our gene therapy program in this call, but that is progressing well now and hemophilia B, where we maintain leadership, we dosed our eighth patient recently and should have more data to share sometime next year. And we'll be going into the clinic in hemophilia A with our lead candidate, which is now under preclinical development. In immunology, we mentioned that 20% IGS subcu is under regulatory review in the U.S. and in EU. We anticipate those approvals first in the EU in the second quarter -- at the end of the second quarter next year and in the U.S. in the late third quarter. Our differentiated product HYQVIA, which was approved recently in the U.S. and prior to that, in the EU, is about to initiate a Phase III study in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy to expand that indication.

So just that's confirm or not confirm any sort of onetime issues we should be aware of in the fourth quarter. But my bigger question really is tied to the product contribution, new product pipeline for next year. If $450 million of new product coming in '16, I just wondered if you could expand on that a little bit. Specifically granularity on the major contributors in relative value. So we're assuming ONCASPAR is included, but does ADYNOVATE reflect gross or net sales against ADVATE? And what's the relative contribution of VONVENDI and OMNIVIDE. Any help there would be helpful."

So clearly, very strong growth we anticipated in the third quarter. Somewhat at the expense of the fourth quarter just given the timing of when tender shipments happened this year. So other than that, nothing else to read. And other than what we highlighted in our commentary, which was about $85 million of timing impacts related to hemophilia and FEIBA and the comp challenge with the HYQVIA stocking order in Q4. Of course, that's about 5 points of growth rate there. So I think again, we're very confident in our ability to continue to operate at the 8% to 9% top line growth that we're projecting in '16. So Q4 really just timing. As it relates to new product contribution in 2016, so as Ludwig mentioned, about $750 million overall. I would tell you that ADYNOVATE and HYQVIA are going to contribute more than half of that in aggregate. However, there will be clearly some cannibalization, ADYNOVATE of ADVATE and HYQVIA of our base IGS. But even net of cannibalization, we still expect new product contribution to be more than $500 million in 2016. So hopefully, that helps you a bit on how that's going to play out."

But those 2 are critical. And oncology is -- will be a significant contributor next year already. Most of it will be ONCASPAR, but let's not forget that as we get review for pacritinib submissions, which will go in before the end of this year, we're going to have pacritinib on the market for 1 or 2 quarters as well as nal-IRI in Europe by the third quarter of next year.

But one element for 2016 that I would just reiterate that I mentioned back in May, we have very good hedges in place for 2015 based on hedging the euro back in 2014 when it was at above $1.3 per euro. Unfortunately, we don't have hedges at that level in 2016. We have hedges at good levels in 2016 relative to where the euro's at today. But year-over-year, that's going to cost us $0.07 to $0.08 just related to the hedge benefit we have this year that we're not going to be able to replicate next year. So those are a couple of key factors that we think about. But otherwise, if you look across the full impact of price across all of the assumptions we've made in our preliminary 2016 outlook, price is essentially flat in terms of contributor.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We're very excited to update you on significant progress that we are delivering on our strategic plan. This includes today's announcement of strong financial results for Baxalta's first q",769,"Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We're very excited to update you on significant progress that we are delivering on our strategic plan. This includes today's announcement of strong financial results for Baxalta's first quarter as an independent company and a compelling outlook for 2016.
Positive momentum continues across our portfolio. Sales, excluding currency, grew 13%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.56 exceeded our guidance. We're also providing a preliminary outlook for 2016. This plan reflects accelerated top line growth and strong operational performance. Our management team has increased conviction in achieving our aspiration of double-digit earning growth beyond 2016. This confidence stems from our new product pipeline, which includes several programs with significant peak revenue potential. We remain on track to achieve our objective of 20 new product launches by 2020.
We are also executing a disciplined M&A strategy. Transactions like the recently completed ONCASPAR acquisition reflect our strategic and financial intent focused on generating attractive returns for our shareholders. Baxalta's strong financial performance and meaningful pipeline achievements validate our company's compelling growth prospects and commitment to enhance shareholder value.
Our strength as an independent stand-alone company is based on multiple value drivers. Our first priority is building 3 sustainable businesses in hematology, immunology and oncology with a focus on rare diseases and underserved conditions.
Our hematology business is delivering significant growth in an increasingly competitive environment. This quarter, strong performance was led by ADVATE with robust demand in the U.S. and internationally. FEIBA continues to exceed our expectations globally, and revenues were bolstered by new products, including RIXUBIS and OBIZUR.
In immunology, we continue to capitalize on solid underlying fundamentals, enhanced supply and the successful launch of HYQVIA. 
And in oncology, we're successfully integrating the ONCASPAR acquisition and booked our first quarter of sales. Overall, this performance provide a solid foundation for accelerated growth and sustainability.
Our second priority is innovation. John Orloff will discuss many recent highlights in a moment. It is clear that we're making great progress on building a rich pipeline, establishing a solid track record towards our objective of launching 20 new products by 2020. This includes many late-stage assets, novel mechanisms and disruptive technologies.
Over the last 2 years, we have received 70 regulatory approvals. This includes OBIZUR, RIXUBIS, FEIBA Prophy and HYQVIA. In addition, we have 4 products under regulatory review: ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI, 20% subQ and nal-IRI.
Success in bringing innovative treatments to market provides significant commercial opportunity. In 2015, we expect new product sales of approximately $280 million. Based on our current annualized run rate and pending approvals, we expect the contribution from new products in 2016 of approximately $750 million. By 2020, we expect new product sales of $2.8 billion on a risk-adjusted basis. It is important to note that approximately 90% of these sales are from products that have already been approved or under regulatory review or have generated positive Phase III clinical data.
As R&D and clinical risks are minimized, the estimates provided in our initial 2020 financial outlook could prove conservative. We have risk-adjusted our 2020 outlook by more than $1 billion. On a nonrisk-adjusted basis, new product revenues in 2020 are projected to be approximately $4 billion.
Importantly, Baxalta's pipeline is balanced and diverse. More than a dozen new products have peak sales potential in excess of $500 million. Therapies like ADYNOVATE, BAX 826 and gene therapy treatments, HYQVIA, oncology therapies, biosimilars and those from our SuppreMol acquisition, will drive meaningful value beyond 2020.
By 2025, the new product portfolio is projected to generate more than $7 billion on a risk-adjusted basis and account for more than 50% of Baxalta's total sales.
In addition to new product launches, another key priority and component of our strategy is M&A. Our financial flexibility is enhanced by ability to generate more than $5 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years. Our M&A strategy will be focused and targeted. Evaluation of opportunities will be based on those presenting a strong strategic fit within our core therapeutic orphan disease areas, and a disciplined financial framework will be applied with focus on generating attractive returns on invested capital.
In summary, we have a strong foundation. We have sustainable leadership positions across our portfolio. We are an established global leader in orphan diseases. We have significant growth prospects and are executing on our strategies. We're driving meaningful R&D innovation. Our ongoing financial strength and compelling outlook position us well to significantly enhance value for patients, customers and shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to John Orloff. John?"

Our new redesigned R&D model is focused on orphan diseases, and we continue to shift from life cycle management to advancing novel molecules, disruptive technologies like gene therapy. We have been tapping into strong talent to join our new R&D center in Cambridge, and we have generated momentum with the achievement of several clinical and regulatory milestones while leveraging external innovation where it makes strategic and financial sense.
I'm pleased to share the significant progress we have made since our Investor Conference in May of this year. In hematology, we have completed late-stage reviews of ADYNOVATE and VONVENDI and continue to expect FDA approval for both therapies before the end of the year. During the third quarter, pivotal Phase III data for VONVENDI was published in Blood, the journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data showed 100% of patients treated with VONVENDI, a highly purified recombinant von Willebrand Factor, achieved success in the management of bleeding episodes.
In addition, we recently received approval of OBIZUR in Canada for patients with acquired hemophilia A, a very rare and life-threatening acute bleeding disorder. OBIZUR is the first treatment specifically designed to enable physicians to monitor treatment response by measuring factor VIII activity levels. Baxalta has also received a positive CHMP opinion on OBIZUR from the EMA, and we expect European marketing authorization later this year.
In immunology, we are expanding treatment options with the 20% subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency. The higher potency IG treatment is intended to offer faster infusions with less volume. The product is now under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe.
In partnership with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, we initiated a pivotal Phase III critical trial for BAX 923, a biosimilar version of HUMIRA, in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. We are targeting the first regulatory submission of this biosimilar in 2017, and the first commercial launch is expected in 2018.
Lastly, our oncology business has made significant advances toward becoming a leader in orphan cancer treatments. In addition to the ONCASPAR leukemia portfolio acquisition completed this quarter, we have 2 late-stage assets and are preparing for launches beginning in 2016. Our partner, Merrimack, received approval in the U.S. and Taiwan last week for ONIVYDE, or nal-IRI, for patients with pancreatic cancer following gemcitabine-based therapy.
In addition, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial for first-line treatment of previously untreated patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Baxalta has exclusive rights for all indications outside the U.S. and Taiwan, and we are awaiting marketing authorization in Europe for ONIVYDE as a second-line therapy.
Separately, we are seeking priority review by the FDA for pacritinib with our partner CTI BioPharma for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. A U.S. submission is planned for the fourth quarter, followed by a submission in Europe.
Our R&D strategy is focused on innovating for unmet needs, placing patients at the center of everything we do. Our goal is to develop game-changing therapies that have a significant clinical impact on patients' lives. Momentum is building. The cadence of new product launches between now and 2020 is steady and balanced across all 3 businesses. We are improving our R&D credibility and making significant advances to our portfolio, and we look forward to providing you with future updates.
Thanks, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Hombach."
261084576,312658375,885756,"Baxalta Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Baxalta Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our financial results for the quarter, I would like to take a few moments to discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. As you know, our 2014 and first half",1920,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our financial results for the quarter, I would like to take a few moments to discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. As you know, our 2014 and first half 2015 results are presented on a carved-out basis and as a result, will not be directly comparable to our financial results as a stand-alone enterprise. These historical results are inherently limited as they exclude several items, such as capitalized interest, do not reflect actual interest and tax expense or cost associated with running Baxalta as an independent stand-alone company. Therefore, comparisons to prior periods over the next year will be challenging as they will not be on an apples-to-apples basis. For this reason, we plan to focus our upcoming quarterly discussions on our performance versus our guidance, which is based on our targeted P&L profile we communicated at our May Investor Conference. We feel that this will provide the most useful information to investors when trying to assess the underlying performance of Baxalta.
That being said, as we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.45 per diluted share include net after-tax special items totaling $76 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Special items were primarily for intangible asset amortization; expenses associated with the company's separation; certain business development and collaboration-related items; and a gain from the sale of the company's vaccine business, which is classified as a discontinued operation.
As Ludwig mentioned in the third quarter, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50 per share. This performance reflects positive sales momentum across the portfolio, including enhanced value from new products and strong operational performance.
Now let me briefly walk you through the adjusted P&L before turning to the financial outlook. Starting with sales. On a pro forma basis, worldwide sales in the third quarter totaled approximately $1.6 billion and increase 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 13%, which favorably compares to the sales guidance we previously provided of 8% to 10%. Strong momentum across our product categories contributed to the overachievement. 
U.S. sales accelerated, generating growth of 14%, the highest quarterly growth rate in several years. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 12% and were bolstered by penetration in emerging markets, particularly in the BRICT countries, where sales grew more than 25%. Year-to-date, total Baxalta revenues of approximately $4.5 billion increased 2%. And on a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales advanced 10%.
Our hematology business, which includes hemophilia and inhibitor therapies, generated global sales of $935 million in the third quarter, which declined 1% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, hematology sales advanced 10%. Year-to-date, hematology sales of $2.6 billion declined 3% versus the prior year on a reported basis, but grew 7% on a constant currency basis. Sales in hemophilia, which includes recombinant and plasma-derived treatments for hemophilia A and B patients, posted sales in the third quarter of $727 million, reflecting a decline of 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7%, reflecting an accelerated rate from the first half growth of 3%.
On a global basis, we continue to focus on enhancing access and elevating standards of care with strong demand for recombinant therapies, including ADVATE and RIXUBIS. ADVATE achieved double-digit sales growth on a global basis, led by strong international performance, where we derive approximately 60% of ADVATE revenues. This growth is the result of shipments to Brazil and continued conversion to recombinant therapies as part of our ongoing collaboration with Hemobras to enhance access to recombinant factor VIII therapy. For the full year 2015, we expect to convert more than 50% of the patients to ADVATE in Brazil and generate sales of more than $120 million.
In the U.S., ADVATE growth has demonstrated resiliency and has increased sequentially over the course of 2015, achieving mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by conversions to prophylaxis treatment and enhanced adherence.
Growing demand in the U.S. more than offsets very modest patient share loss, which is beginning to level off. The cumulative patient loss is now estimated at approximately 2 to 3 share points, and the pace of losses is slowing. This reflects the well-established, strong efficacy and safety profile of ADVATE as well as our deep understanding of the hemophilia market and our excellent commercial teams. These are distinct competitive advantages that will be a key driver of our long-term sustainability.
Within the inhibitor therapies category, which includes FEIBA and OBIZUR, sales totaled $208 million and rose 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inhibitor sales advanced 22%. U.S. inhibitor sales advanced by 42%, primarily driven by increased demand for FEIBA as we continue to promote the prophylaxis indication; modest price improvements; and sales of OBIZUR, which was launched late last year. Sales outside the U.S., which account for about 65% of our total inhibitor sales, increased 14% on a constant currency basis. This is the result of strong FEIBA demand, particularly in developing markets and part due to the timing of certain tender sales. We continue to expect robust growth across this product category over the long term. Inhibitor patients are the most difficult to treat. There is significant unmet medical need, and only 20% of patients globally are on a prophylactic regimen, presenting a significant long-term growth opportunity.
Turning to the immunology business, which includes immunoglobulin therapies such as GAMMAGARD LIQUID and HYQVIA as well as biotherapeutics, pro forma sales totaled $626 million in the third quarter, which grew 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, immunology sales advanced 13% versus the prior year. Year-to-date, immunology sales of $1.8 billion increased 7% versus last year on a reported basis and advanced 12% on a constant currency basis. Immunoglobulin sales of $435 million increased 7% on a reported basis or 12% on a constant currency basis as we are enhancing penetration in undertreated diseases and capitalizing on our broad and differentiated portfolio of immunoglobulin therapies.
Growth on a global basis has accelerated, driven by higher demand for our therapies and our improved supply position. In particular, Baxalta's IG brands are capturing share in the primary immunodeficiency segment, the fastest-growing chronic indication, where our performance exceeds market growth of high single digits.
In addition, HYQVIA, our transformational subQ therapy for PI patients, is experiencing strong uptake and a very favorable reception in the market by patients and physicians. HYQVIA's annual run rate now exceeds $100 million. More than 50% of our U.S. HYQVIA patients are converting from competitive IG therapies, and approximately 25% are newly diagnosed patients.
We're also very pleased with the momentum in select European markets, which is being bolstered by accelerated growth in the Netherlands and launches in additional markets.
Lastly, in the biotherapeutics category, pro forma sales totaled $191 million, which grew 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 14%, driven by growth of albumin sales in the U.S. and China, improved growth of alpha-1 therapies and increased contract manufacturing revenues.
Our third business is oncology. As previously mentioned, we completed the ONCASPAR acquisition during the third quarter. ONCASPAR is a long-acting pegylated asparaginase, an important marketed biologic treatment for first-line acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, resulting in a highly effective cure in more than 80% of pediatric ALL patients in the United States. The integration of the business is on track, with sales in the quarter totaling $34 million. ONCASPAR sales are now approaching an annual run rate of approximately $200 million, exceeding our expectations with a very attractive margin profile, which allows us to reinvest in the ONCASPAR portfolio through R&D to broaden global access and expand into additional indications.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin in the quarter was 61.9%. Positive product mix was the main driver, particularly due to strong sales of higher-margin products like ADVATE, FEIBA and ONCASPAR, along with a modest benefit from foreign currency hedging. While we have seen select pricing improvements in some product areas, the overall contribution from pricing in the quarter was immaterial.
SG&A totaled $313 million, representing 19.6% of sales. We're investing in marketing initiatives to prepare for new product introductions like the upcoming launches of ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and oncology therapies in addition to adding the appropriate level of investment to support Baxalta's new corporate and international infrastructure.
R&D spending in the quarter was $176 million or 11% of sales. With our aspiration to launch 20 new products by 2020, we are balancing investments across the 3 disease areas. In particular, we expect to drive sustainability in our hemophilia business as we progress ADYNOVATE, BAX 826 and our gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B.
In immunology, emphasis continues to be on new indications for HYQVIA in addition to advancing the SuppreMol programs. 
And in oncology, we're building a collection of therapies focused on orphan cancer areas, including pacritinib for myelofibrosis, nal-IRI for pancreatic cancer and our ONCASPAR leukemia portfolio.
Interest expense in the quarter was $23 million, reflecting interest on the $5 billion of debt issued in June prior to the spin, which was partially offset by the impact of capitalized interest. Other income of $19 million is driven by an unexpected gain of $16 million from our Baxalta Ventures equity investment. The tax rate was 22.1% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our financial outlook for the remainder of 2015 and full year 2016. Starting with our sales guidance. Based on the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year 2015. On a constant currency basis, we expect sales growth of approximately 8%. This includes ONCASPAR revenues of approximately $80 million. At today's rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively impact sales growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Therefore, our reported sales are expected to be flat to 2014.
On a constant currency basis, our full year outlook assumes growth in hematology of approximately 5% and immunology sales growth of approximately 9%. By product category, we expect growth in the hemophilia franchise of approximately 3%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance given better-than-expected performance of ADVATE. We are now assuming a cumulative patient share loss of 3 to 4 points from increased competition.
For the inhibitors category, we expect full year sales growth of 10% to 11%. This is somewhat lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of FEIBA shipments outside the U.S. impacting the fourth quarter.
For immunoglobulin therapies, we now expect growth of approximately 9%, driven by strong market demand and the success of HYQVIA. And we expect sales of biotherapeutics to grow approximately 10%.
Now for the fourth quarter, we project adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, of $0.55 to $0.57. This includes sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 3% to 5%, which is higher than our previous expectations.
On a reported basis, we are assuming an approximately 6 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency and therefore, expect reported sales to decline 1% to 3%. Hematology sales on a constant currency basis are expected to be flat. Immunology sales are expected to grow in the 2% to 3% range, and we

And yes, we exceeded our sales guidance and EPS guidance again, and we continue to make solid progress on our pipeline. And so what we see here over the last couple of quarters is strong momentum across all our business -- all our decisions. Hematology is growing 10%. Immunology is growing 13%. And what has changed in addition to those divisions going stronger, accelerating growth, is we have now the impact of our oncology division with the first quarter sales booked in the third quarter with ONCASPAR. So it's a momentum that we have across the business. 
The spinoff allows us to focus on our front line, and this is also -- it was one of the reasons why we went through with the spinoff. So I'm really pleased with our focus. I'm really pleased with our very strong team, and I'm really pleased with the advances that we see in our pipeline. 
New products start to kick in. So for this year, as we discussed, it's $280 million. The number that we gave you is higher than the number that we gave you before. $2.8 billion by 2020, this is risk-adjusted. And a couple of major events happened here, not only on the business momentum side. But also, we get more and more conviction with respect to delivering on our promise of bringing innovative therapies to the market. So it is a momentum that goes across the board. 
With respect to M&A, we will be disciplined with respect to M&A moving forward as we have been disciplined for the last couple of years. I think what we've done, the type of deals, ONCASPAR, the Chatham gene therapy acquisition and so on and so on. These are the types of deals that we continue to look at, and we will be disciplined. We will have criteria in place that are from a -- that are strategic, that are financial -- with a financial framework, but more importantly, also from an integration perspective. Since we have a very rich pipeline and this could be the biggest contribution to our top line of $2.8 billion by 2020, we want to make sure whatever we do on the M&A side, we don't disrupt the momentum that we have within the organization. And I will ask Bob to talk a little bit about operating margins."

I would characterize our May guidance as somewhat conservative. But clearly, the bulk of the outperformance here is based on the business momentum. And this really goes back to a lot of the work that happened even before the spin. I mean, Ludwig started the transformation of the R&D group a couple of years ago. We see very strong performance versus key R&D milestones here over the last year or so. The new commercial organization Ludwig referred to is put in place as of January 1 of this year, 6 months before the spin. So not only did we hit the ground running on July 1, but really, without missing a beat and in fact, gaining momentum with the increased global focus by franchise given this new structure. And then, finally, as Ludwig mentioned, we have identified and are implementing opportunities within our cost base, both in margin as well as SG&A, to further enhance margins going forward. So you see in our second half 2015 outlook into 2016, really, a carrying forward of stronger gross margin largely dropping through to operating margin going forward. So we're very confident in the outlook."

With respect to your question on new products, we mentioned -- and maybe you missed it. We mentioned that for 2015, we expect new products contribution of $280 million and that number to increase to $750 million next year. And then for 2020, that's $2.8 billion, and that's risk-adjusted. Now the numbers that we gave you are 90% -- at least for 2020, 90% of that number comes from products that either got just recently approved or under regulatory review or have positive Phase III data. So we're not waiting for something magical to happen. For us now, it's bringing those products across the regulatory finish line, and then execute flawlessly as far as launch is concerned. The inhibitor's growth is very solid. For the third quarter, it was 22%. And this is FEIBA prophy. So the prophy indication is critical. Bob was talking about, in fact, that prophy penetration is only 20%. It's -- in the U.S., it's a little bit higher, but we still have a long way to go, so we clearly see a momentum there. OBIZUR, at this moment, is U.S.-only. We got the approval in Canada. We will be launching. But this is really an innovative, differentiated molecule that also helps us to strengthen our position not only short term, but long term. So really, this is a critical piece of the sustainability of our hemophilia franchise moving forward. Bob, do you have a couple of other [indiscernible]?"

And OBIZUR, which we're very excited about long term, is going to be -- take some time to ramp up because it's a very rare disease for acquired hemophilia. And so again, the vast majority of the inhibitor growth is being driven by volume, primarily the prophylaxis indication, as Ludwig mentioned. In the bio T space, a couple of dynamics. We did see a resurgence of growth in our alpha-1 therapies, which we've got renewed focus on to drive that opportunity. That is an underdiagnosed and undertreated segment of the overall market. Good contribution from albumin in China and around the world. Really, in the U.S., strength as well. And then, finally, we did get a modest contribution from contract manufacturing revenues in bio T. But even if you back those out, we still had double-digit growth in that bio T segment, again, driven by strong growth in albumin and alpha-1. But contract manufacturing is not only for Baxter. But also, we are going to be providing some transition services to Pfizer, given the sale of the vaccine business. So eventually, those will go away. But again, that contributed maybe 3 or 4 points of growth to bio T. So, still double digits without that."

That's a program, as you may know, that also has a pediatric program surgery study that will be the basis for a European filing in the first quarter of this year as well as a U.S. filing for the pediatric indication that will expand that label. Looking across the hematology portfolio, we have VONVENDI that's also under regulatory review in the U.S. And we anticipate that approval before the end of the year also. Completed the late-cycle review there. We're looking at additional opportunities to expand the indication there. We have planned studies for pediatric patients and prophylaxis with BAX 111 recombinant von Willebrand's Factor. We haven't said too much about our gene therapy program in this call, but that is progressing well now. And hemophilia B, where we maintain leadership, we dosed our eighth patient recently and should have more data to share sometime next year. And we'll be going into the clinic in hemophilia A with our lead candidate, which is now under preclinical development.

So that's just to confirm or not confirm if there's any sort of onetime issues we should be aware of in the fourth quarter. But my bigger question, really, is tied to the product contribution, new product pipeline for next year. You have $450 million of new product coming in '16. I just wonder if you can expand on that a little bit. And specifically, granularity on the major contributors in relative value. So -- and we're assuming ONCASPAR is included. But does ADYNOVATE reflect gross or net sales against ADVATE? And what's the relative contribution of VONVENDI and ONIVYDE? Any help there would be helpful."

As we mentioned back in July, we did have some timing dynamics really between the third and fourth quarter. So clearly, very strong growth we anticipated in the third quarter somewhat at the expense of the fourth quarter, just given the timing of when tender shipments happened this year. So other than that, nothing else to read in other than what we highlighted in our commentary, which was about $85 million of timing impacts related to hemophilia and FEIBA and the comp challenge with the HYQVIA stocking order in Q4. Of course, that's about 5 points of growth right there. So I think, again, we're very confident in our ability to continue to operate at the 8% to 9% top line growth that we're projecting at -- in '16. So Q4, really, just timing. As it relates to new product contribution in 2016, so as Ludwig mentioned, about $750 million overall. I would tell you that ADYNOVATE and HYQVIA are going to contribute more than half of that in aggregate. However, there will be clearly some cannibalization, ADYNOVATE of ADVATE and HYQVIA of our base IGs. But even net of cannibalization, we still expect new product contribution to be more than $500 million in 2016. So hopefully, that helps you a bit on how that's going to play out."

ADYNOVATE, since we do have 60% plus market share in the U.S. in this segment and we have a leadership position and ADYNOVATE, ADVATE and we have a very strong team in place, we believe that we can facilitate the conversion from ADVATE to ADYNOVATE next year. But those 2 are critical. And oncology is -- will be a significant contributor next year already. Most of it will be ONCASPAR, but let's not forget that if we get a priority review for pacritinib submission, which will go in before the end of this year, we're going to have pacritinib on the market for 1 or 2 quarters as well as nal-IRI in Europe by the third quarter of next year.

There's been a lot of discussion, obviously, in the biopharmaceutical landscape about your pricing in the last month or 2. And it certainly looks like as you had come out of the spin that you've taken a more aggressive approach to pricing some of the products. You've raised prices on ADVATE, FEIBA, HYQVIA. The pricing, looks like, went up 25%. And then you bought ONCASPAR. You've been -- you've raised the price, it looks like, about 125%. So can you talk about that? Can you talk about some of the decisions on pricing and whether you're getting pushed back from payers, particularly relative to that ONCASPAR price increase?"

You mentioned HYQVIA, 25% increase. Let me tell you that our total cost of therapy is still less than the other subQ alternatives. And this is the -- because this is a superior product as far as bioavailability is concerned. We don't need to adjust the dose by 37% -- increase the dose by 37% or 53% as described in some of the labels. So overall, we believe that the value is there, that our numbers -- or the price is immaterial for this quarter.

And that's reflected in our confidence in the number that we provided and the fact that we expect, at a minimum, to maintain margin profile of what we see here in the second half of the year. The one element for 2016 that I would just reiterate that I mentioned back in May, we have very good hedges in place for 2015 based on hedging the euro back in 2014 when it was at above $1.3 per euro. Unfortunately, we don't have hedges at that level in 2016. We have hedges at good levels in 2016 relative to where the euro is at today. But year-over-year, that's going to cost us $0.07 to $0.08 just related to the hedge benefit we have this year that we're not going to be able to replicate next year. So those are a couple of the key factors that we think about. But otherwise, if you look across the full impact of price across all the assumptions we've made in our preliminary 2016 outlook, price is essentially flat in terms of the contributor. It's volume and mix that are driving the growth."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We're very excited to update you on significant progress that we are delivering on our strategic plan. This includes today's announcement of strong financial results for Baxalta's first q",769,"Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We're very excited to update you on significant progress that we are delivering on our strategic plan. This includes today's announcement of strong financial results for Baxalta's first quarter as an independent company and a compelling outlook for 2016. 
 
Positive momentum continues across our portfolio. Sales, excluding currency, grew 13%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.56 exceeded our guidance. We're also providing a preliminary outlook for 2016. This plan reflects accelerated top line growth and strong operational performance. Our management team has increased conviction in achieving our aspiration of double-digit earning growth beyond 2016. This confidence stems from our new product pipeline, which includes several programs with significant peak revenue potential. We remain on track to achieve our objective of 20 new product launches by 2020.
We are also executing a disciplined M&A strategy. Transactions like the recently completed ONCASPAR acquisition reflect our strategic and financial intent focused on generating attractive returns for our shareholders. Baxalta's strong financial performance and meaningful pipeline achievements validate our company's compelling growth prospects and commitment to enhance shareholder value.
Our strength as an independent stand-alone company is based on multiple value drivers. Our first priority is building 3 sustainable businesses in hematology, immunology and oncology with a focus on rare diseases and underserved conditions.
Our hematology business is delivering significant growth in an increasingly competitive environment. This quarter, strong performance was led by ADVATE with robust demand in the U.S. and internationally. FEIBA continues to exceed our expectations globally, and revenues were bolstered by new products, including RIXUBIS and OBIZUR.
In immunology, we continue to capitalize on solid underlying fundamentals, enhanced supply and the successful launch of HYQVIA. 
And in oncology, we're successfully integrating the ONCASPAR acquisition and booked our first quarter of sales. Overall, this performance provides a solid foundation for accelerated growth and sustainability.
Our second priority is innovation. John Orloff will discuss many recent highlights in a moment. It is clear that we're making great progress on building a rich pipeline, establishing a solid track record towards our objective of launching 20 new products by 2020. This includes many late-stage assets, novel mechanisms and disruptive technologies.
Over the last 2 years, we have received 70 regulatory approvals. This includes OBIZUR, RIXUBIS, FEIBA Prophy and HYQVIA. In addition, we have 4 products under regulatory review: ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI, 20% subQ and nal-IRI. 
Success in bringing innovative treatments to market provides significant commercial opportunity. In 2015, we expect new product sales of approximately $280 million. Based on our current annualized run rate and pending approvals, we expect a contribution from new products in 2016 of approximately $750 million. By 2020, we expect new product sales of $2.8 billion on a risk-adjusted basis. It is important to note that approximately 90% of these sales are from products that have already been approved, are under regulatory review or have generated positive Phase III clinical data.
As R&D and clinical risks are minimized, the estimates provided in our initial 2020 financial outlook could prove conservative. We have risk-adjusted our 2020 outlook by more than $1 billion. On a nonrisk-adjusted basis, new product revenues in 2020 are projected to be approximately $4 billion.
Importantly, Baxalta's pipeline is balanced and diverse. More than a dozen new products have peak sales potential in excess of $500 million. Therapies like ADYNOVATE, BAX 826 and gene therapy treatments, HYQVIA, oncology therapies, biosimilars and those from our SuppreMol acquisition, will drive meaningful value beyond 2020.
By 2025, the new product portfolio is projected to generate more than $7 billion on a risk-adjusted basis and account for more than 50% of Baxalta's total sales.
In addition to new product launches, another key priority and component of our strategy is M&A. Our financial flexibility is enhanced by ability to generate more than $5 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years. Our M&A strategy will be focused and targeted. Evaluation of opportunities will be based on those presenting a strong strategic fit within our core therapeutic orphan disease areas, and a disciplined financial framework will be applied with focus on generating attractive returns on invested capital.
In summary, we have a strong foundation. We have sustainable leadership positions across our portfolio. We are an established global leader in orphan diseases. We have significant growth prospects and are executing on our strategies. We're driving meaningful R&D innovation. Our ongoing financial strength and compelling outlook position us well to significantly enhance value for patients, customers and shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to John Orloff. John?"

Our new redesigned R&D model is focused on orphan diseases, and we continue to shift from life cycle management to advancing novel molecules in disruptive technologies like gene therapy. We have been tapping into strong talent to join our new R&D center in Cambridge, and we have generated momentum with the achievement of several clinical and regulatory milestones while leveraging external innovation where it makes strategic and financial sense.
I'm pleased to share the significant progress we have made since our Investor Conference in May of this year. In hematology, we have completed late-stage reviews of ADYNOVATE and VONVENDI and continue to expect FDA approval for both therapies before the end of the year. During the third quarter, pivotal Phase III data for VONVENDI was published in Blood, the journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data showed 100% of patients treated with VONVENDI, a highly purified recombinant von Willebrand Factor, achieved success in the management of bleeding episodes.
In addition, we recently received approval of OBIZUR in Canada for patients with acquired hemophilia A, a very rare and life-threatening acute bleeding disorder. OBIZUR is the first treatment specifically designed to enable physicians to monitor treatment response by measuring factor VIII activity levels. Baxalta has also received a positive CHMP opinion on OBIZUR from the EMA, and we expect European marketing authorization later this year.
In immunology, we are expanding treatment options with a 20% subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency. The higher potency IG treatment is intended to offer faster infusions with less volume. The product is now under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe.
In partnership with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, we initiated a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for BAX 923, a biosimilar version of HUMIRA, in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. We are targeting the first regulatory submission of this biosimilar in 2017, and the first commercial launch is expected in 2018.
Lastly, our oncology business has made significant advances toward becoming a leader in orphan cancer treatments. In addition to the ONCASPAR leukemia portfolio acquisition completed this quarter, we have 2 late-stage assets and are preparing for launches beginning in 2016. Our partner, Merrimack, received approval in the U.S. and Taiwan last week for ONIVYDE, or nal-IRI, for patients with pancreatic cancer following gemcitabine-based therapy.
In addition, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial for first-line treatment of previously untreated patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Baxalta has exclusive rights for all indications outside the U.S. and Taiwan, and we are awaiting marketing authorization in Europe for ONIVYDE as a second-line therapy.
Separately, we are seeking priority review by the FDA for pacritinib with our partner CTI BioPharma for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. A U.S. submission is planned for the fourth quarter, followed by submission in Europe.
Our R&D strategy is focused on innovating for unmet needs, placing patients at the center of everything we do. Our goal is to develop game-changing therapies that have a significant clinical impact on patients' lives. Momentum is building. The cadence of new product launches between now and 2020 is steady and balanced across all 3 businesses. We are improving our R&D credibility and making significant advances to our portfolio, and we look forward to providing you with future updates.
Thanks, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Hombach."

Before I review our financial results for the quarter, I would like to take a few moments to discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. As you know, our 2014 and first half",1920,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our financial results for the quarter, I would like to take a few moments to discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. As you know, our 2014 and first half 2015 results are presented on a carve-out basis and as a result, will not be directly comparable to our financial results as a stand-alone enterprise. These historical results are inherently limited as they exclude several items, such as capitalized interest, do not reflect actual interest and tax expense or costs associated with running Baxalta as an independent stand-alone company. Therefore, comparisons to prior periods over the next year will be challenging as they will not be on an apples-to-apples basis. For this reason, we plan to focus our upcoming quarterly discussions on our performance versus our guidance, which is based on our targeted P&L profile we communicated at our May Investor Conference. We feel that this will provide the most useful information to investors when trying to assess the underlying performance of Baxalta.
That being said, as we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.45 per diluted share include net after-tax special items totaling $76 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Special items were primarily for intangible asset amortization; expenses associated with the company's separation; certain business development and collaboration-related items; and a gain from the sale of the company's vaccine business, which is classified as a discontinued operation.
As Ludwig mentioned, in the third quarter, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50 per share. This performance reflects positive sales momentum across the portfolio, including enhanced value from new products and strong operational performance.
Now let me briefly walk you through the adjusted P&L before turning to the financial outlook. Starting with sales. On a pro forma basis, worldwide sales in the third quarter totaled approximately $1.6 billion and increased 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 13%, which favorably compares to the sales guidance we previously provided of 8% to 10%. Strong momentum across our product categories contributed to the overachievement. 
U.S. sales accelerated, generating growth of 14%, the highest quarterly growth rate in several years. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 12% and were bolstered by penetration in emerging markets, particularly in the BRICT countries, where sales grew more than 25%. Year-to-date, total Baxalta revenues of approximately $4.5 billion increased 2%. And on a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales advanced 10%.
Our hematology business, which includes hemophilia and inhibitor therapies, generated global sales of $935 million in the third quarter, which declined 1% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, hematology sales advanced 10%. Year-to-date, hematology sales of $2.6 billion declined 3% versus the prior year on a reported basis, but grew 7% on a constant currency basis. Sales in hemophilia, which includes recombinant and plasma-derived treatments for hemophilia A and B patients, posted sales in the third quarter of $727 million, reflecting a decline of 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7%, reflecting an accelerated rate from the first half growth of 3%.
On a global basis, we continue to focus on enhancing access and elevating standards of care with strong demand for recombinant therapies, including ADVATE and RIXUBIS. ADVATE achieved double-digit sales growth on a global basis, led by strong international performance, where we derive approximately 60% of ADVATE revenues. This growth is a result of shipments to Brazil and continued conversion to recombinant therapies as part of our ongoing collaboration with Hemobras to enhance access to recombinant factor VIII therapy. For the full year 2015, we expect to convert more than 50% of the patients to ADVATE in Brazil and generate sales of more than $120 million.
In the U.S., ADVATE growth has demonstrated resiliency and has increased sequentially over the course of 2015, achieving mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by conversions to prophylaxis treatment and enhanced adherence.
Growing demand in the U.S. more than offsets very modest patient share loss, which is beginning to level off. The cumulative patient loss is now estimated at approximately 2 to 3 share points, and the pace of losses is slowing. This reflects the well-established, strong efficacy and safety profile of ADVATE as well as our deep understanding of the hemophilia market and our excellent commercial teams. These are distinct competitive advantages that will be a key driver of our long-term sustainability.
Within the inhibitor therapies category, which includes FEIBA and OBIZUR, sales totaled $208 million and rose 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inhibitor sales advanced 22%. U.S. inhibitor sales advanced by 42%, primarily driven by increased demand for FEIBA as we continue to promote the prophylaxis indication; modest price improvements; and sales of OBIZUR, which was launched late last year. Sales outside the U.S., which account for about 65% of our total inhibitor sales, increased 14% on a constant currency basis. This is the result of strong FEIBA demand, particularly in developing markets and part due to the timing of certain tender sales. We continue to expect robust growth across this product category over the long term. Inhibitor patients are the most difficult to treat. There is significant unmet medical need, and only 20% of patients globally are on a prophylactic regimen, presenting a significant long-term growth opportunity.
Turning to the immunology business, which includes immunoglobulin therapies such as GAMMAGARD LIQUID and HYQVIA as well as biotherapeutics, pro forma sales totaled $626 million in the third quarter, which grew 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, immunology sales advanced 13% versus the prior year. Year-to-date, immunology sales of $1.8 billion increased 7% versus last year on a reported basis and advanced 12% on a constant currency basis. Immunoglobulin sales of $435 million increased 7% on a reported basis or 12% on a constant currency basis as we are enhancing penetration in undertreated diseases and capitalizing on our broad and differentiated portfolio of immunoglobulin therapies.
Growth on a global basis has accelerated, driven by higher demand for our therapies and our improved supply position. In particular, Baxalta's IG brands are capturing share in the primary immunodeficiency segment, the fastest-growing chronic indication, where our performance exceeds market growth of high single digits.
In addition, HYQVIA, our transformational subQ therapy for PI patients, is experiencing strong uptake and a very favorable reception in the market by patients and physicians. HYQVIA's annual run rate now exceeds $100 million. More than 50% of our U.S. HYQVIA patients are converting from competitive IG therapies, and approximately 25% are newly diagnosed patients.
We're also very pleased with the momentum in select European markets, which is being bolstered by accelerated growth in the Netherlands and launches in additional markets.
Lastly, in the biotherapeutics category, pro forma sales totaled $191 million, which grew 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 14%, driven by growth of albumin sales in the U.S. and China, improved growth of alpha-1 therapies and increased contract manufacturing revenues.
Our third business is oncology. As previously mentioned, we completed the ONCASPAR acquisition during the third quarter. ONCASPAR is a long-acting pegylated asparaginase, an important marketed biologic treatment for first-line acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, resulting in a highly effective cure in more than 80% of pediatric ALL patients in the United States. The integration of the business is on track, with sales in the quarter totaling $34 million. ONCASPAR sales are now approaching an annual run rate of approximately $200 million, exceeding our expectations with a very attractive margin profile, which allows us to reinvest in the ONCASPAR portfolio through R&D to broaden global access and expand into additional indications.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin in the quarter was 61.9%. Positive product mix was the main driver, particularly due to strong sales of higher-margin products like ADVATE, FEIBA and ONCASPAR, along with a modest benefit from foreign currency hedging. While we have seen select pricing improvements in some product areas, the overall contribution from pricing in the quarter was immaterial.
SG&A totaled $313 million, representing 19.6% of sales. We're investing in marketing initiatives to prepare for new product introductions like the upcoming launches of ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and oncology therapies in addition to adding the appropriate level of investment to support Baxalta's new corporate and international infrastructure.
R&D spending in the quarter was $176 million or 11% of sales. With our aspiration to launch 20 new products by 2020, we are balancing investments across the 3 disease areas. In particular, we expect to drive sustainability in our hemophilia business as we progress ADYNOVATE, BAX 826 and our gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B.
In immunology, emphasis continues to be on new indications for HYQVIA in addition to advancing the SuppreMol programs. 
And in oncology, we're building a collection of therapies focused on orphan cancer areas, including pacritinib for myelofibrosis, nal-IRI for pancreatic cancer and our ONCASPAR leukemia portfolio.
Interest expense in the quarter was $23 million, reflecting interest on the $5 billion of debt issued in June prior to the spin, which was partially offset by the impact of capitalized interest. Other income of $19 million is driven by an unexpected gain of $16 million from a Baxalta Ventures equity investment. The tax rate was 22.1% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our financial outlook for the remainder of 2015 and full year 2016. Starting with our sales guidance. Based on the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year 2015. On a constant currency basis, we expect sales growth of approximately 8%. This includes ONCASPAR revenues of approximately $80 million. At today's rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively impact sales growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Therefore, our reported sales are expected to be flat to 2014.
On a constant currency basis, our full year outlook assumes growth in hematology of approximately 5% and immunology sales growth of approximately 9%. By product category, we expect growth in the hemophilia franchise of approximately 3%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance given better-than-expected performance of ADVATE. We are now assuming a cumulative patient share loss of 3 to 4 points from increased competition.
For the inhibitors category, we expect full year sales growth of 10% to 11%. This is somewhat lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of FEIBA shipments outside the U.S. impacting the fourth quarter.
For immunoglobulin therapies, we now expect growth of approximately 9%, driven by strong market demand and the success of HYQVIA. And we expect sales of biotherapeutics to grow approximately 10%.
Now for the fourth quarter, we project adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, of $0.55 to $0.57. This includes sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 3% to 5%, which is higher than our previous expectations.
On a reported basis, we are assuming an approximately 6 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency and therefore, expect reported sales to decline 1% to 3%. Hematology sales on a constant currency basis are expected to be flat. Immunology sales are expected to grow in the 2% to 3% range, and we

And yes, we exceeded our sales guidance and EPS guidance again, and we continue to make solid progress on our pipeline. And so what we see here over the last couple of quarters is strong momentum across all our business -- all our divisions. Hematology is growing 10%. Immunology is growing 13%. And what has changed in addition to those divisions going stronger, accelerating growth, is we have now the impact of our oncology division with the first quarter sales booked in the third quarter with ONCASPAR. So it's a momentum that we have across the business. 
The spinoff allows us to focus on our front line, and this is also -- it was one of the reasons why we went through with the spinoff. So I'm really pleased with our focus. I'm really pleased with our very strong team, and I'm really pleased with the advances that we see in our pipeline. 
New products start to kick in. So for this year, as we discussed, it's $280 million. The number that we gave you is higher than the number that we gave you before. $2.8 billion by 2020, this is risk-adjusted. And a couple of major events happened here, not only on the business momentum side. But also, we get more and more conviction with respect to delivering on our promise of bringing innovative therapies to the market. So it is a momentum that goes across the board. 
With respect to our M&A, we will be disciplined with respect to M&A moving forward as we have been disciplined for the last couple of years. I think what we've done, the type of deals, ONCASPAR, the Chatham gene therapy acquisition and so on and so on. These are the types of deals that we continue to look at, and we will be disciplined. We will have criteria in place that are from a -- that are strategic, that are financial -- with a financial framework, but more importantly, also from an integration perspective. Since we have a very rich pipeline and this could be the biggest contribution to our top line of $2.8 billion by 2020, we want to make sure whatever we do on the M&A side, we don't disrupt the momentum that we have within the organization. And I will ask Bob to talk a little bit about operating margins."

I would characterize our May guidance as somewhat conservative. But clearly, the bulk of the outperformance here is based on the business momentum. And this really goes back to a lot of the work that happened even before the spin. I mean, Ludwig started the transformation of the R&D group a couple of years ago. We see very strong performance versus key R&D milestones here over the last year or so. The new commercial organization Ludwig referred to was put in place as of January 1 of this year, 6 months before the spin. So not only did we hit the ground running on July 1, but really, without missing a beat and in fact, gaining momentum with the increased global focus by franchise given this new structure. And then, finally, as Ludwig mentioned, we have identified and are implementing opportunities within our cost base, both in margin as well as SG&A, to further enhance margins going forward. So as you see in our second half 2015 outlook into 2016, really, a carrying forward of stronger gross margin largely dropping through to operating margin going forward. So we're very confident in the outlook."

And then for 2020, that's $2.8 billion, and that's risk-adjusted. Now the numbers that we gave you are 90% -- at least for 2020, 90% of that number comes from products that either got just recently approved, are under regulatory review or have positive Phase III data. So we're not waiting for something magical to happen. For us now, it's bringing those products across the regulatory finish line, and then execute flawlessly as far as launch is concerned. The inhibitors growth is very solid. For the third quarter, it was 22%. And this is FEIBA Prophy. So the prophy indication is critical. Bob was talking about the fact that prophy penetration is only 20%. It's -- in the U.S., it's a little bit higher, but we still have a long way to go, so we clearly see a momentum there. OBIZUR, at this moment, is U.S.-only. We got the approval in Canada. We will be launching. But this is really an innovative, differentiated molecule that also helps us to strengthen our position not only short term, but long term. So really, this is a critical piece of the sustainability of our hemophilia franchise moving forward. Bob, do you have a couple of other things you want to add?"

And OBIZUR, which we're very excited about long term, is going to be -- take some time to ramp up because it's a very rare disease for acquired hemophilia. And so again, the vast majority of the inhibitor growth is being driven by volume, primarily the prophylaxis indication, as Ludwig mentioned. In the bio T space, a couple of dynamics. We did see a resurgence of growth in our alpha-1 therapies, which we've got renewed focus on to drive that opportunity. That is an underdiagnosed and undertreated segment of the overall market. Good contribution from albumin in China and around the world, really; in the U.S., strength as well. And then, finally, we did get a modest contribution from contract manufacturing revenues in bio T. But even if you back those out, we still had double-digit growth in that bio T segment, again, driven by strong growth in albumin and alpha-1. But contract manufacturing is not only for Baxter. But also, we are going to be providing some transition services to Pfizer, given the sale of the vaccine business. So eventually, those will go away. But again, that contributed maybe 3 or 4 points of growth to bio T. So, still double digits without that."

That's a program, as you may know, that also has a pediatric program surgery study that will be the basis for a European filing in the first quarter of this year as well as a U.S. filing for the pediatric indication that will expand that label. Looking across the hematology portfolio, we have VONVENDI that's also under regulatory review in the U.S. And we anticipate that approval before the end of the year also. Completed the late-cycle review there. We're looking at additional opportunities to expand the indication there. We have planned studies for pediatric patients and prophylaxis with BAX 111 recombinant von Willebrand's Factor. We haven't said too much about our gene therapy program in this call, but that is progressing well now. In hemophilia B, where we maintain leadership, we dosed our eighth patient recently and should have more data to share sometime next year. And we'll be going into the clinic in hemophilia A with our lead candidate, which is now under preclinical development.

But just fourth quarter guidance obviously implies some deceleration. We're assuming that's entirely driven by the much more challenging comp year-on-year. So that's just to confirm or not confirm if there's any sort of onetime issues we should be aware of in the fourth quarter. But my bigger question, really, is tied to the product contribution, new product pipeline for next year. You have $450 million of new product coming in '16. I just wonder if you can expand on that a little bit. And specifically, granularity on the major contributors in relative value. So -- and we're assuming ONCASPAR is included. But does ADYNOVATE reflect gross or net sales against ADVATE? And what's the relative contribution of VONVENDI and ONIVYDE? Any help there would be very helpful."

As we mentioned back in July, we did have some timing dynamics really between the third and fourth quarter. So clearly, very strong growth we anticipated in the third quarter somewhat at the expense of the fourth quarter, just given the timing of when tender or shipments happen this year. So other than that, nothing else to read in other than what we highlighted in our commentary, which was about $85 million of timing impacts related to hemophilia and FEIBA and the comp challenge with the HYQVIA stocking order in Q4. Of course, that's about 5 points of growth right there. So I think, again, we're very confident in our ability to continue to operate at the 8% to 9% top line growth that we're projecting at -- in '16. So Q4, really, just timing. As it relates to new product contribution in 2016, so as Ludwig mentioned, about $750 million overall. I would tell you that ADYNOVATE and HYQVIA are going to contribute more than half of that in aggregate. However, there will be clearly some cannibalization, ADYNOVATE of ADVATE and HYQVIA of our base IGs. But even net of cannibalization, we still expect new product contribution to be more than $500 million in 2016. So hopefully, that helps you a bit on how that's going to play out."

ADYNOVATE, since we do have 60% plus market share in the U.S. in this segment and we have a leadership position and ADYNOVATE is ADVATE and we have a very strong team in place, we believe that we can facilitate the conversion from ADVATE to ADYNOVATE next year. But those 2 are critical. And oncology is -- will be a significant contributor next year already. Most of it will be ONCASPAR, but let's not forget that if we get a priority review for pacritinib submission, which will go in before the end of this year, we're going to have pacritinib on the market for 1 or 2 quarters as well as nal-IRI in Europe by the third quarter of next year. So overall, we see strong momentum across the 3 divisions."

And that's reflected in our confidence in the number that we provided and the fact that we expect, at a minimum, to maintain margin profile to what we see here in the second half of the year. The one element for 2016 that I would just reiterate that I mentioned back in May, we have very good hedges in place for 2015 based on hedging the euro back in 2014 when it was at above $1.3 per euro. Unfortunately, we don't have hedges at that level in 2016. We have hedges at good levels in 2016 relative to where the euro is at today. But year-over-year, that's going to cost us $0.07 to $0.08 just related to the hedge benefit we have this year that we're not going to be able to replicate next year. So those are a couple of the key factors that we think about. But otherwise, if you look across the full impact of price across all the assumptions we've made in our preliminary 2016 outlook, price is essentially flat in terms of the contributor.

We're very excited to update you on significant progress that we are delivering on our strategic plan. This includes today's announcement of strong financial results for Baxalta's first quarter as an independent company and a compelling outlook for 2016. 
 
Positive momentum continues across our portfolio. Sales, excluding currency, grew 13%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.56 exceeded our guidance. We're also providing a preliminary outlook for 2016. This plan reflects accelerated top line growth and strong operational performance. Our management team has increased conviction in achieving our aspiration of double-digit earning growth beyond 2016. This confidence stems from our new product pipeline, which includes several programs with significant peak revenue potential. We remain on track to achieve our objective of 20 new product launches by 2020.
We are also executing a disciplined M&A strategy. Transactions like the recently completed ONCASPAR acquisition reflect our strategic and financial intent focused on generating attractive returns for our shareholders. Baxalta's strong financial performance and meaningful pipeline achievements validate our company's compelling growth prospects and commitment to enhance shareholder value.
Our strength as an independent stand-alone company is based on multiple value drivers. Our first priority is building 3 sustainable businesses in hematology, immunology and oncology with a focus on rare diseases and underserved conditions.
Our hematology business is delivering significant growth in an increasingly competitive environment. This quarter, strong performance was led by ADVATE with robust demand in the U.S. and internationally. FEIBA continues to exceed our expectations globally, and revenues were bolstered by new products, including RIXUBIS and OBIZUR.
In immunology, we continue to capitalize on solid underlying fundamentals, enhanced supply and the successful launch of HYQVIA. 
And in oncology, we're successfully integrating the ONCASPAR acquisition and booked our first quarter of sales. Overall, this performance provides a solid foundation for accelerated growth and sustainability.
Our second priority is innovation. John Orloff will discuss many recent highlights in a moment. It is clear that we're making great progress on building a rich pipeline, establishing a solid track record towards our objective of launching 20 new products by 2020. This includes many late-stage assets, novel mechanisms and disruptive technologies.
Over the last 2 years, we have received 70 regulatory approvals. This includes OBIZUR, RIXUBIS, FEIBA Prophy and HYQVIA. In addition, we have 4 products under regulatory review: ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI, 20% subQ and nal-IRI. 
Success in bringing innovative treatments to market provides significant commercial opportunity. In 2015, we expect new product sales of approximately $280 million. Based on our current annualized run rate and pending approvals, we expect a contribution from new products in 2016 of approximately $750 million. By 2020, we expect new product sales of $2.8 billion on a risk-adjusted basis. It is important to note that approximately 90% of these sales are from products that have already been approved, are under regulatory review or have generated positive Phase III clinical data.
As R&D and clinical risks are minimized, the estimates provided in our initial 2020 financial outlook could prove conservative. We have risk-adjusted our 2020 outlook by more than $1 billion. On a nonrisk-adjusted basis, new product revenues in 2020 are projected to be approximately $4 billion.
Importantly, Baxalta's pipeline is balanced and diverse. More than a dozen new products have peak sales potential in excess of $500 million. Therapies like ADYNOVATE, BAX 826 and gene therapy treatments, HYQVIA, oncology therapies, biosimilars and those from our SuppreMol acquisition, will drive meaningful value beyond 2020.
By 2025, the new product portfolio is projected to generate more than $7 billion on a risk-adjusted basis and account for more than 50% of Baxalta's total sales.
In addition to new product launches, another key priority and component of our strategy is M&A. Our financial flexibility is enhanced by ability to generate more than $5 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years. Our M&A strategy will be focused and targeted. Evaluation of opportunities will be based on those presenting a strong strategic fit within our core therapeutic orphan disease areas, and a disciplined financial framework will be applied with focus on generating attractive returns on invested capital.
In summary, we have a strong foundation. We have sustainable leadership positions across our portfolio. We are an established global leader in orphan diseases. We have significant growth prospects and are executing on our strategies. We're driving meaningful R&D innovation. Our ongoing financial strength and compelling outlook position us well to significantly enhance value for patients, customers and shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to John Orloff. John?"

Our new redesigned R&D model is focused on orphan diseases, and we continue to shift from life cycle management to advancing novel molecules in disruptive technologies like gene therapy. We have been tapping into strong talent to join our new R&D center in Cambridge, and we have generated momentum with the achievement of several clinical and regulatory milestones while leveraging external innovation where it makes strategic and financial sense.
I'm pleased to share the significant progress we have made since our Investor Conference in May of this year. In hematology, we have completed late-stage reviews of ADYNOVATE and VONVENDI and continue to expect FDA approval for both therapies before the end of the year. During the third quarter, pivotal Phase III data for VONVENDI was published in Blood, the journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data showed 100% of patients treated with VONVENDI, a highly purified recombinant von Willebrand Factor, achieved success in the management of bleeding episodes.
In addition, we recently received approval of OBIZUR in Canada for patients with acquired hemophilia A, a very rare and life-threatening acute bleeding disorder. OBIZUR is the first treatment specifically designed to enable physicians to monitor treatment response by measuring factor VIII activity levels. Baxalta has also received a positive CHMP opinion on OBIZUR from the EMA, and we expect European marketing authorization later this year.
In immunology, we are expanding treatment options with a 20% subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency. The higher potency IG treatment is intended to offer faster infusions with less volume. The product is now under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe.
In partnership with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, we initiated a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for BAX 923, a biosimilar version of HUMIRA, in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. We are targeting the first regulatory submission of this biosimilar in 2017, and the first commercial launch is expected in 2018.
Lastly, our oncology business has made significant advances toward becoming a leader in orphan cancer treatments. In addition to the ONCASPAR leukemia portfolio acquisition completed this quarter, we have 2 late-stage assets and are preparing for launches beginning in 2016. Our partner, Merrimack, received approval in the U.S. and Taiwan last week for ONIVYDE, or nal-IRI, for patients with pancreatic cancer following gemcitabine-based therapy.
In addition, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial for first-line treatment of previously untreated patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Baxalta has exclusive rights for all indications outside the U.S. and Taiwan, and we are awaiting marketing authorization in Europe for ONIVYDE as a second-line therapy.
Separately, we are seeking priority review by the FDA for pacritinib with our partner CTI BioPharma for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. A U.S. submission is planned for the fourth quarter, followed by submission in Europe.
Our R&D strategy is focused on innovating for unmet needs, placing patients at the center of everything we do. Our goal is to develop game-changing therapies that have a significant clinical impact on patients' lives. Momentum is building. The cadence of new product launches between now and 2020 is steady and balanced across all 3 businesses. We are improving our R&D credibility and making significant advances to our portfolio, and we look forward to providing you with future updates.
Thanks, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Hombach."

Before I review our financial results for the quarter, I would like to take a few moments to discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. As you know, our 2014 and first half",1920,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our financial results for the quarter, I would like to take a few moments to discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. As you know, our 2014 and first half 2015 results are presented on a carve-out basis and as a result, will not be directly comparable to our financial results as a stand-alone enterprise. These historical results are inherently limited as they exclude several items, such as capitalized interest, do not reflect actual interest and tax expense or costs associated with running Baxalta as an independent stand-alone company. Therefore, comparisons to prior periods over the next year will be challenging as they will not be on an apples-to-apples basis. For this reason, we plan to focus our upcoming quarterly discussions on our performance versus our guidance, which is based on our targeted P&L profile we communicated at our May Investor Conference. We feel that this will provide the most useful information to investors when trying to assess the underlying performance of Baxalta.
That being said, as we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.45 per diluted share include net after-tax special items totaling $76 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Special items were primarily for intangible asset amortization; expenses associated with the company's separation; certain business development and collaboration-related items; and a gain from the sale of the company's vaccine business, which is classified as a discontinued operation.
As Ludwig mentioned, in the third quarter, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50 per share. This performance reflects positive sales momentum across the portfolio, including enhanced value from new products and strong operational performance.
Now let me briefly walk you through the adjusted P&L before turning to the financial outlook. Starting with sales. On a pro forma basis, worldwide sales in the third quarter totaled approximately $1.6 billion and increased 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 13%, which favorably compares to the sales guidance we previously provided of 8% to 10%. Strong momentum across our product categories contributed to the overachievement. 
U.S. sales accelerated, generating growth of 14%, the highest quarterly growth rate in several years. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 12% and were bolstered by penetration in emerging markets, particularly in the BRICT countries, where sales grew more than 25%. Year-to-date, total Baxalta revenues of approximately $4.5 billion increased 2%. And on a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales advanced 10%.
Our hematology business, which includes hemophilia and inhibitor therapies, generated global sales of $935 million in the third quarter, which declined 1% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, hematology sales advanced 10%. Year-to-date, hematology sales of $2.6 billion declined 3% versus the prior year on a reported basis, but grew 7% on a constant currency basis. Sales in hemophilia, which includes recombinant and plasma-derived treatments for hemophilia A and B patients, posted sales in the third quarter of $727 million, reflecting a decline of 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7%, reflecting an accelerated rate from the first half growth of 3%.
On a global basis, we continue to focus on enhancing access and elevating standards of care with strong demand for recombinant therapies, including ADVATE and RIXUBIS. ADVATE achieved double-digit sales growth on a global basis, led by strong international performance, where we derive approximately 60% of ADVATE revenues. This growth is a result of shipments to Brazil and continued conversion to recombinant therapies as part of our ongoing collaboration with Hemobras to enhance access to recombinant factor VIII therapy. For the full year 2015, we expect to convert more than 50% of the patients to ADVATE in Brazil and generate sales of more than $120 million.
In the U.S., ADVATE growth has demonstrated resiliency and has increased sequentially over the course of 2015, achieving mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by conversions to prophylaxis treatment and enhanced adherence.
Growing demand in the U.S. more than offsets very modest patient share loss, which is beginning to level off. The cumulative patient loss is now estimated at approximately 2 to 3 share points, and the pace of losses is slowing. This reflects the well-established, strong efficacy and safety profile of ADVATE as well as our deep understanding of the hemophilia market and our excellent commercial teams. These are distinct competitive advantages that will be a key driver of our long-term sustainability.
Within the inhibitor therapies category, which includes FEIBA and OBIZUR, sales totaled $208 million and rose 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inhibitor sales advanced 22%. U.S. inhibitor sales advanced by 42%, primarily driven by increased demand for FEIBA as we continue to promote the prophylaxis indication; modest price improvements; and sales of OBIZUR, which was launched late last year. Sales outside the U.S., which account for about 65% of our total inhibitor sales, increased 14% on a constant currency basis. This is the result of strong FEIBA demand, particularly in developing markets and part due to the timing of certain tender sales. We continue to expect robust growth across this product category over the long term. Inhibitor patients are the most difficult to treat. There is significant unmet medical need, and only 20% of patients globally are on a prophylactic regimen, presenting a significant long-term growth opportunity.
Turning to the immunology business, which includes immunoglobulin therapies such as GAMMAGARD LIQUID and HYQVIA as well as biotherapeutics, pro forma sales totaled $626 million in the third quarter, which grew 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, immunology sales advanced 13% versus the prior year. Year-to-date, immunology sales of $1.8 billion increased 7% versus last year on a reported basis and advanced 12% on a constant currency basis. Immunoglobulin sales of $435 million increased 7% on a reported basis or 12% on a constant currency basis as we are enhancing penetration in undertreated diseases and capitalizing on our broad and differentiated portfolio of immunoglobulin therapies.
Growth on a global basis has accelerated, driven by higher demand for our therapies and our improved supply position. In particular, Baxalta's IG brands are capturing share in the primary immunodeficiency segment, the fastest-growing chronic indication, where our performance exceeds market growth of high single digits.
In addition, HYQVIA, our transformational subQ therapy for PI patients, is experiencing strong uptake and a very favorable reception in the market by patients and physicians. HYQVIA's annual run rate now exceeds $100 million. More than 50% of our U.S. HYQVIA patients are converting from competitive IG therapies, and approximately 25% are newly diagnosed patients.
We're also very pleased with the momentum in select European markets, which is being bolstered by accelerated growth in the Netherlands and launches in additional markets.
Lastly, in the biotherapeutics category, pro forma sales totaled $191 million, which grew 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 14%, driven by growth of albumin sales in the U.S. and China, improved growth of alpha-1 therapies and increased contract manufacturing revenues.
Our third business is oncology. As previously mentioned, we completed the ONCASPAR acquisition during the third quarter. ONCASPAR is a long-acting pegylated asparaginase, an important marketed biologic treatment for first-line acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, resulting in a highly effective cure in more than 80% of pediatric ALL patients in the United States. The integration of the business is on track, with sales in the quarter totaling $34 million. ONCASPAR sales are now approaching an annual run rate of approximately $200 million, exceeding our expectations with a very attractive margin profile, which allows us to reinvest in the ONCASPAR portfolio through R&D to broaden global access and expand into additional indications.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin in the quarter was 61.9%. Positive product mix was the main driver, particularly due to strong sales of higher-margin products like ADVATE, FEIBA and ONCASPAR, along with a modest benefit from foreign currency hedging. While we have seen select pricing improvements in some product areas, the overall contribution from pricing in the quarter was immaterial.
SG&A totaled $313 million, representing 19.6% of sales. We're investing in marketing initiatives to prepare for new product introductions like the upcoming launches of ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and oncology therapies in addition to adding the appropriate level of investment to support Baxalta's new corporate and international infrastructure.
R&D spending in the quarter was $176 million or 11% of sales. With our aspiration to launch 20 new products by 2020, we are balancing investments across the 3 disease areas. In particular, we expect to drive sustainability in our hemophilia business as we progress ADYNOVATE, BAX 826 and our gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B.
In immunology, emphasis continues to be on new indications for HYQVIA in addition to advancing the SuppreMol programs. 
And in oncology, we're building a collection of therapies focused on orphan cancer areas, including pacritinib for myelofibrosis, nal-IRI for pancreatic cancer and our ONCASPAR leukemia portfolio.
Interest expense in the quarter was $23 million, reflecting interest on the $5 billion of debt issued in June prior to the spin, which was partially offset by the impact of capitalized interest. Other income of $19 million is driven by an unexpected gain of $16 million from a Baxalta Ventures equity investment. The tax rate was 22.1% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our financial outlook for the remainder of 2015 and full year 2016. Starting with our sales guidance. Based on the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year 2015. On a constant currency basis, we expect sales growth of approximately 8%. This includes ONCASPAR revenues of approximately $80 million. At today's rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively impact sales growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Therefore, our reported sales are expected to be flat to 2014.
On a constant currency basis, our full year outlook assumes growth in hematology of approximately 5% and immunology sales growth of approximately 9%. By product category, we expect growth in the hemophilia franchise of approximately 3%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance given better-than-expected performance of ADVATE. We are now assuming a cumulative patient share loss of 3 to 4 points from increased competition.
For the inhibitors category, we expect full year sales growth of 10% to 11%. This is somewhat lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of FEIBA shipments outside the U.S. impacting the fourth quarter.
For immunoglobulin therapies, we now expect growth of approximately 9%, driven by strong market demand and the success of HYQVIA. And we expect sales of biotherapeutics to grow approximately 10%.
Now for the fourth quarter, we project adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, of $0.55 to $0.57. This includes sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 3% to 5%, which is higher than our previous expectations.
On a reported basis, we are assuming an approximately 6 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency and therefore, expect reported sales to decline 1% to 3%. Hematology sales on a constant currency basis are expected to be flat. Immunology sales are expected to grow in the 2% to 3% range, and we

very pleased with the -- with our results. As you said, we have a very strong momentum. And yes, we exceeded our sales guidance and EPS guidance again, and we continue to make solid progress on our pipeline. And so what we see here over the last couple of quarters is strong momentum across all our business -- all our divisions. Hematology is growing 10%. Immunology is growing 13%. And what has changed in addition to those divisions going stronger, accelerating growth, is we have now the impact of our oncology division with the first quarter sales booked in the third quarter with ONCASPAR. So it's a momentum that we have across the business. 
The spinoff allows us to focus on our front line, and this is also -- it was one of the reasons why we went through with the spinoff. So I'm really pleased with our focus. I'm really pleased with our very strong team, and I'm really pleased with the advances that we see in our pipeline. 
New products start to kick in. So for this year, as we discussed, it's $280 million. The number that we gave you is higher than the number that we gave you before. $2.8 billion by 2020, this is risk-adjusted. And a couple of major events happened here, not only on the business momentum side. But also, we get more and more conviction with respect to delivering on our promise of bringing innovative therapies to the market. So it is a momentum that goes across the board. 
With respect to our M&A, we will be disciplined with respect to M&A moving forward as we have been disciplined for the last couple of years. I think what we've done, the type of deals, ONCASPAR, the Chatham gene therapy acquisition and so on and so on. These are the types of deals that we continue to look at, and we will be disciplined. We will have criteria in place that are from a -- that are strategic, that are financial -- with a financial framework, but more importantly, also from an integration perspective. Since we have a very rich pipeline and this could be the biggest contribution to our top line of $2.8 billion by 2020, we want to make sure whatever we do on the M&A side, we don't disrupt the momentum that we have within the organization. And I will ask Bob to talk a little bit about operating margins."

I would characterize our May guidance as somewhat conservative. But clearly, the bulk of the outperformance here is based on the business momentum. And this really goes back to a lot of the work that happened even before the spin. I mean, Ludwig started the transformation of the R&D group a couple of years ago. We see very strong performance versus key R&D milestones here over the last year or so. The new commercial organization Ludwig referred to was put in place as of January 1 of this year, 6 months before the spin. So not only did we hit the ground running on July 1, but really, without missing a beat and in fact, gaining momentum with the increased global focus by franchise given this new structure. And then, finally, as Ludwig mentioned, we have identified and are implementing opportunities within our cost base, both in margin as well as SG&A, to further enhance margins going forward. So as you see in our second half 2015 outlook into 2016, really, a carrying forward of stronger gross margin largely dropping through to operating margin going forward. So we're very confident in the outlook."

The inhibitors growth is very solid. For the third quarter, it was 22%. And this is FEIBA Prophy. So the prophy indication is critical. Bob was talking about the fact that prophy penetration is only 20%. It's -- in the U.S., it's a little bit higher, but we still have a long way to go, so we clearly see a momentum there. OBIZUR, at this moment, is U.S.-only. We got the approval in Canada. We will be launching. But this is really an innovative, differentiated molecule that also helps us to strengthen our position not only short term, but long term. So really, this is a critical piece of the sustainability of our hemophilia franchise moving forward. Bob, do you have a couple of other things you want to add?"

Just to mention, as Ludwig mentioned, as it relates to inhibitors, the vast majority of the growth is being driven by volume. There is very modest price contribution related to FEIBA. And OBIZUR, which we're very excited about long term, is going to be -- take some time to ramp up because it's a very rare disease for acquired hemophilia. And so again, the vast majority of the inhibitor growth is being driven by volume, primarily the prophylaxis indication, as Ludwig mentioned. In the bio T space, a couple of dynamics. We did see a resurgence of growth in our alpha-1 therapies, which we've got renewed focus on to drive that opportunity. That is an underdiagnosed and undertreated segment of the overall market. Good contribution from albumin in China and around the world, really; in the U.S., strength as well. And then, finally, we did get a modest contribution from contract manufacturing revenues in bio T. But even if you back those out, we still had double-digit growth in that bio T segment, again, driven by strong growth in albumin and alpha-1. But contract manufacturing is not only for Baxter. But also, we are going to be providing some transition services to Pfizer, given the sale of the vaccine business. So eventually, those will go away. But again, that contributed maybe 3 or 4 points of growth to bio T. So, still double digits without that."

And number three, the LRP that we gave you was risk-adjusted for R&D risk. We've made significant progress in our pipeline, and a critical piece here, as John was saying, is ADYNOVATE.

So that's just to confirm or not confirm if there's any sort of onetime issues we should be aware of in the fourth quarter. But my bigger question, really, is tied to the product contribution, new product pipeline for next year. You have $450 million of new product coming in '16. I just wonder if you can expand on that a little bit. And specifically, granularity on the major contributors in relative value. So -- and we're assuming ONCASPAR is included.

As we mentioned back in July, we did have some timing dynamics really between the third and fourth quarter. So clearly, very strong growth we anticipated in the third quarter somewhat at the expense of the fourth quarter, just given the timing of when tender or shipments happen this year. So other than that, nothing else to read in other than what we highlighted in our commentary, which was about $85 million of timing impacts related to hemophilia and FEIBA and the comp challenge with the HYQVIA stocking order in Q4. Of course, that's about 5 points of growth right there. So I think, again, we're very confident in our ability to continue to operate at the 8% to 9% top line growth that we're projecting at -- in '16. So Q4, really, just timing. As it relates to new product contribution in 2016, so as Ludwig mentioned, about $750 million overall. I would tell you that ADYNOVATE and HYQVIA are going to contribute more than half of that in aggregate. However, there will be clearly some cannibalization, ADYNOVATE of ADVATE and HYQVIA of our base IGs. But even net of cannibalization, we still expect new product contribution to be more than $500 million in 2016. So hopefully, that helps you a bit on how that's going to play out."

ADYNOVATE, since we do have 60% plus market share in the U.S. in this segment and we have a leadership position and ADYNOVATE is ADVATE and we have a very strong team in place, we believe that we can facilitate the conversion from ADVATE to ADYNOVATE next year. But those 2 are critical. And oncology is -- will be a significant contributor next year already. Most of it will be ONCASPAR, but let's not forget that if we get a priority review for pacritinib submission, which will go in before the end of this year, we're going to have pacritinib on the market for 1 or 2 quarters as well as nal-IRI in Europe by the third quarter of next year.

And that's reflected in our confidence in the number that we provided and the fact that we expect, at a minimum, to maintain margin profile to what we see here in the second half of the year. The one element for 2016 that I would just reiterate that I mentioned back in May, we have very good hedges in place for 2015 based on hedging the euro back in 2014 when it was at above $1.3 per euro. Unfortunately, we don't have hedges at that level in 2016. We have hedges at good levels in 2016 relative to where the euro is at today. But year-over-year, that's going to cost us $0.07 to $0.08 just related to the hedge benefit we have this year that we're not going to be able to replicate next year. So those are a couple of the key factors that we think about.

You see the -- you've seen in the presentation the long list of new products that we have. As a matter of fact, we have more than 20 opportunities of new product launches in the next couple of years, so I hope that's helping for setting the definition clear, Matt."

So we have a strong BRICT strategy, and the team is delivering on this. Just to give you one example of a key contributor to that is, first of all, we have a very wide geographical footprint for FEIBA. FEIBA is a blockbuster product that is growing year after year. FEIBA is a critical contributor in Brazil, in Russia and so on and so on. In addition to that, ADVATE is being launched in Russia. We are in a launch phase in Turkey since -- not that long ago, end of last year. And we're still launching in China as well as Brazil, where we have the exclusive arrangement with the government. So overall, these are key contributors for us to drive accelerated growth in EGM."

From a strategic perspective, we are an orphan disease company in the hematology, immunology and oncology. So that's where our focus is. That doesn't mean that we're going to put all our money on oncology. No. We're going to go broader than that with a very strong financial framework. As well, as I said, the integration piece is a critical one since we don't want to disrupt our pipeline. So what we've done over the last 18 months, I think, is a good sample of the way we're thinking. And this could go from products or companies that have commercial products all the way to technology that could be disruptive like gene therapy. And that's the way we're thinking about M&A. As I said before, you will not see us do defensive M&A. We don't believe that this is in the best interest of anybody. Clearly, if we have a target and we want to go for it, we will put shareholders' value as central in everything."

And in fact, as we've discussed here today, we were somewhat conservative in our outlook in May on the P&L, but that also -- that conservatism also carries over into our cash flow assumption. So both that operating cash flow, given the strength in the underlying performance, our forward-looking trends will be stronger. And we're increasingly confident in our ability to bring down CapEx even below what we projected at the investor conference, which, at the Investor Conference, we talked about $5 billion of free cash flow generation. And in the next 5 years, after funding CapEx, we expect to be able to exceed that outlook here going forward."
