This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. 
Before Fran goes through our performance results, I'd like to cover our earnings reconciliation for the fourth quarter and highlight a few special items. These are displayed on Slide 3. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported a loss of $0.54 per share on a GAAP basis. This reported result includes several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. The largest item is our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. 
This year, we recorded a pretax expense of $7 billion to increase our pension and OPEB liability. 
This adjustment, which was primarily non-cash, was caused by changes in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions. 
We also incurred pretax expenses of $502 million related to severance costs under our existing separation plans.  On an after-tax basis, these 2 charges amounted to $4.7 billion or $1.12 per share. 
We also incurred nonoperational expenses of $872 million in connection with early debt redemption and other calls.  On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $528 million or $0.13 per share. Details regarding the income statement line item effects for these items are available on our website in the financial and operating information and non-GAAP reconciliation schedules. 
Excluding the nonoperational charges of $1.25 per share, adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the fourth quarter. This compares with adjusted EPS of $0.66 a year ago, an increase of 7.6%. 
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.35 compared with $2.84 in 2013, an increase of 18%. 
Keep in mind that the $3.35 adjusted EPS does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of 2014 since the transaction closed on February 21. 
The results in growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and remarks exclude the effects of the nonoperational items and are, therefore, on an adjusted basis. 
Also, the growth rates we provide on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted, as sequential. 
I would like to remind everyone that due to the FCC's rules, we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. When the rules permit, we do plan to provide you with an update on our participation. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. 2014 was a great year of execution and achievement for Verizon, from both the strategic and financial perspective.

2014 was a great year of execution and achievement for Verizon, from both the strategic and financial perspective. We delivered strong operating and financial performance and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in any environment. 
Strategically, our most notable accomplishment was completing the transaction for full ownership of Verizon Wireless. We closed the deal in late February, providing immediate earnings accretion and full access to the cash flows of what we believe is the best wireless asset in the world. 
Throughout the year, we continued our steady and consistent investment in our networks and platforms, which are critical to driving profitable growth in the future. 
Our strong cash generation enabled us to invest $17.2 billion of capital and return value to shareholders through dividend payments, which totaled $7.8 billion for the year. 
Last September, our Board of Directors approved a 3.8% dividend increase, raising the annual amount to $2.20 per share. 
At the same time, we are investing and innovating for the future through new growth businesses and integrated product development efforts in rapidly evolving markets like mobile video and the Internet of Things. 
The foundation of our continued success is network excellence, which is the hallmark of the Verizon brand. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services, which will fuel profitable growth. 
The depth and breadth of our networks provide the fundamental strength and basis for our competitive advantage. Our industry is strong and demand is growing, with customers using Wireless and broadband even more and in different ways than ever before. 
Our competitive position is very strong, and we are well positioned from a strategic standpoint to capitalize on these market trends. 
In Wireless, we had another exceptional year of quality connections, growth and profitability. Retail postpaid net adds totaled 5.5 million for the year, with 2 million coming in a highly competitive fourth quarter that featured heavy promotional activity. 
Postpaid activations, gross additions, upgrade and net adds all grew by double-digit percentages in 2014. Total operating revenues grew 8.2% for the year, and our EBITDA service margin was 48.5% even with the short-term pressure of significant device volumes in the fourth quarter. 
In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 5% for the year, driven by our FiOS platform. 
In 2014, we continued to increase penetration in existing markets and ended the year at 41% for Internet and just under 36% for video. 
Our shared focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in an 80 basis point expansion of our EBITDA margin to 23.2% for the full year. 
Now let's get into the fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. 
On a reported basis, total operating revenue grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we added $6.5 billion to our top line, representing 5.4% growth, which exceeded our guidance of 4% consolidated revenue growth for 2014. 
If we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold, the compared double growth rates would have been 7.3% for the fourth quarter and 5.7% for the full year. 
Our consolidated revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. In the fourth quarter, growth was favorably impacted by increased Wireless equipment revenue due to the significant 4G device activations. 
New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics are beginning to emerge. In 2014, these revenues totaled about $585 million with growth of more than 45%. There are countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things ecosystem across multiple industries. A great example of this unveiled last week at the North American International Auto Show where we announced Verizon Vehicle, a powerful new connected-vehicle service. 
This unique aftermarket solution modernizes traditional roadside assistance while enhancing driver safety and convenience. We expect this service to launch commercially in the second quarter. The addressable market is more than 200 million vehicles on the roads today that are not connected to the Internet or have a GPS unit. 
We believe that this large unserved market stands greatly benefit from this new car Wireless connectivity solution. 
In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program. 
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $43.3 billion in 2014, an increase of 2.9% and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 34.1%. 
Let's take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 6. As I previously noted, the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless created a lack of comparability between the current and prior purpose in our [Technical Difficulty] 
cash flows from operation totaled $30.6 billion. 
In addition, the incremental cash interest and tax payments, we made $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not have to fund in 2013. 
In spite of these additional cash outlays and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $13.4 billion for the year. Our capital program was consistent with our guidance of around $17 billion for the year with improving capital efficiency. 
In total, capital expenditure were $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.2 billion for the full year, up 3.5% from the 2013. 
Our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio was 13.5%, an improvement from 13.8% in 2013. 
The pace of capital spending in Wireless was very consistent throughout all 4 quarters of the year. Wireless CapEx was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the full year. We continue to invest the necessary capital to proactively stay ahead of demand. Our investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. 
As I am sure you have seen from our advertising, we now have deployed AWS or XLTE as we have branded it in more than 400 markets effectively doubling our existing capacity. And despite what others claim about certain aspects of their networks, when you look across the entire nation and consider all the relevant performance metrics, Verizon has the nation's largest and most reliable 4G LTE network. 
We are consistently acknowledged as the performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. 
In Wireline, capital spending totaled $1.6 billion in the quarter and $5.8 billion for the year, down 7.7% from 2013. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. 
We ended the year with $113.3 billion of gross debt and $102.7 billion of net debt. We significantly improved the maturity profile of our debt portfolio during 2014 through various debt market transactions. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x.  We remain committed to getting back to our pre-transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's go to a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing the compelling value proposition to our customers. Our investment strategy is focused on adding network capacity ahead of accelerating demand, which is driven by increasing 4G device adoption and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. 
In 2014, we strengthened the overall quality of our customer accounts. We added 24.7 million 4G devices into our postpaid connections base, representing annual growth of about 58%. 
In addition, we increased the number of More Everything share data plans to 61% of total accounts. The average connections per account grew 4% and ARPA, plus Edge installment billings, increased by more than 5% in 2014. 
As I stated coming out of the third quarter, we expected and closed the year with a very high-volume quarter. Total postpaid device activations in the fourth quarter were unprecedented, totaling 15.3 million, up nearly 34% over last year. More than 13 million were phones, driven by iconic smartphone launches from both Apple and Samsung. 
To give some historical perspective, these phone activations were 1.5 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, which at that time was a record high because it was the first time a 4G iPhone or a free 3G iPhone was available on our network. 
The usage characteristics of these iconic 4G smartphones also generate strong returns and a higher MPV. 
Our fourth quarter promotions were successful, driving a sequential and year-over-year increase in gross adds, net as and upgrades. This customer growth sets us up very well for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond as we drive usage and leverage the efficiencies of our LTE network. 
Total Wireless operating revenues were $23.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11%. For the full year, operating revenues totaled $87.6 billion, representing growth of $6.6 billion or 8.2%. 
Total service revenues grew 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year. Verizon Edge installments billings totaled $443 million in the quarter and $976 million for the full year. 
Service revenues plus Edge installment billings grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 6.6% for the full year. 
As we expected, the percentage of phone activations on the Edge program increased to about 25% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with slightly more than 7 million phones on Edge, which is just over 8% of our postpaid phone base. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and $35.2 billion for the full year, an increase of more than $1 billion or 3%. Our EBITDA service margin for the fourth quarter was 42% due to the significant device volumes. 
For the full year, the EBITDA service margin was 48.5% compared with 49.5% in 2013. The full year EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 40.2% compared with 42.2% for 2013. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 8. Retail postpaid service revenue per account or ARPA grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. If you add the Edge installment billings to ARPA, the growth rates increased to 3.5% for the quarter and 5.3% for the full year. We ended the year with 35.6 million postpaid accounts, an increase of 1.5%. The number of postpaid connections per account grew to 2.87, up 4% from a year ago. 
As I said, the number of customers accounts on More Everything share data plans increased from 46% to 61% of total. 
As you would expect, the average number of connections in More Everything plans are higher at 3.06 per account, and grew faster, up more than 7%. And the average data usage in these accounts has increased by about 50% in the past year. 
Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9. We ended the year with 108.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to 102.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million. 
As we said, 2014 was a year of historical connections growth. Postpaid gross additions were 5.4 million in the quarter, up 25.5%. 
For the year, postpaid gross adds totaled 17.8 million, up 18% from 2013 and 20% higher than 2012. 
In terms of the gross ad mix in the quarter, 55% were smartphones and about 37% were Internet devices, primarily tablets. About 6% were basic phones. This percentage mix was also representative of the full year. 
As we said in our updates, we did experience an elevated rate of retail postpaid churn in the fourth quarter at 1.14%. Throughout the year, we maintained a disciplined approach to customer acquisition and retention with a focus on attracting and retaining high-quality customers. Within the heightened amount of phone activity in the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the overall improvement in the quality of our phone base. 
Our retail postpaid net additions of 2 million in the fourth quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Our 5.5 million postpaid net additions for the year compared favorably with a 4.1 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012. 
As far as the postpaid net add mix, the fourth quarter included 1.5 million new 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets. 
Postpaid phone net adds totaled 672,000 as the 1.5 million 4G smartphones were offset in part by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. 
Full year net adds of 5.5 million included 4.6 million 4G smartphones and 4.3 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet Internet devices. 
Let's now turn to Slide 10 and take a look at the vice activations and our success in driving 4G adoption and usage. Total postpaid device activations totaled 15.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 34%. 
For the full year, postpaid activations totaled 48.1 million, up 16% from 2013, about 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. 
4G LTE devices now comprise 66% of our retail postpaid connections base. This strong device adoption continue to drive increased usage. We ended the year with 67.7 million smartphones in total, about 80% of which were 4G. Smartphone penetration increased to 79% of total phones.  About 75% of our phone activations in the quarter were customer upgrades. 
In total, about 9.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter. 
As you would expect, a vast majority of these upgrades were 4G smartphones. 
Most of our smartphone upgrades represent an incremental revenue opportunity for us. 1.2 million were upgrades from basic phones. About 46% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G, which we monetized through higher data usage and a lower cost to serve. 
We also continued to successfully identify and retain a high percentage of where we call high risk high-value accounts. 
Looking ahead, we still have a sizable quality upgrade opportunity with about 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones remaining in our postpaid connections base. We are very focused on this opportunity to upgrade customers and protect our high-quality postpaid base. 
In addition, we also have a profitable growth opportunity with further penetration of tablets. We ended the year with about 8 million postpaid tablets in our connections space. Tablets have expanded the market for postpaid devices and provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. 
Data and video usage in our network continues to rise. About 84% of our total data traffic was on the 4G LTE network. We are handling this demand and by our own measures, the network performance continues to improve. 
Let's move next our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and Mass Markets revenue performance on Slide 11. 
In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In fact, we have posted 10 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in excess of 4%. 
In the fourth quarter, consumer revenues grew 4.1%, and for the full year, were up 5% exceeding our guidance of at least 4% growth. 
Mass Markets, which includes small business, grew 3% in the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. FiOS now represents 77% of consumer revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 11.1%, driven by a combination of customer growth, pricing actions and increased FiOS Quantum penetration. 
At the end of the year, 59% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to the data speeds higher than 50 megabits per second. This is up from 46% at the end of 2013. 
Throughout the year, we continue to improve the customer value proposition, driving better investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. 
During 2014, we introduced FiOS Quantum TV. Another differentiated offer was our SpeedMatch service, which increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds. 
In December, we introduced the FiOS Quantum Gateway, our new router that delivers America's fastest WiFi. You will begin to see more marketing of this router and its capability shortly. 
Looking ahead, our focus will remain on driving higher penetration in existing markets, which in turn will generate profitable growth and further improve our investment returns. 
In broadband, we added 145,000 net FiOS customers in the quarter and 544,000 for the year. We have a total of 6.6 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.1% penetration, which is up 160 basis points for the year. 
Overall net broadband subscribers increased 59,000 in the quarter and 190,000 for the full year. 
In FiOS Video, we added 116,000 net customers in the quarter and 387,000 for the year. We have a total of 5.6 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.8% penetration, an increase of 80 basis points in 2014. 
In terms of our network evolution initiative, we converted an additional 52,000 copper customers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to around 255,000. 
In total, we have converted more than 800,000 customers to fiber since we started this initiative in 2011. 
Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services, which result in additional recurring revenue. 
In 2015, we plan to convert another 200,000 copper customers to fiber.  During 2014, we also continued our consolidation efforts around central offices, which will create additional efficiencies. 
We have a strong commitment to customer service and have implemented several new frontline tools that are improving efficiency and increasing customer satisfaction. While we benchmark well against the competition, we have more work to do in 2015 to take our performance to the next level. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and the wholesale business. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. 
In the fourth quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 4.6%, which included about $30 million of pressure from FX. 
For the full year, revenue of $13.7 billion was down 3.5%. The overall story is unchanged as the clients and legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. 
Strategic services grew 1.5% in the quarter and 2.3% for the year. This category includes both of IP layer and application such as data center cloud security and manage and professional services. 
Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in application services. 
In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.8% in the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. On the positive side, healthy demand for Ethernet services continues while revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. 
Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment were down 1.6% in the quarter and 0.5% for the full year. 
In terms of profitability, EBITDA increased 4.3% in the quarter and 3% for the full year. The EBITDA margin was 23.9% in the quarter and 23.2% for the year, up 80 basis points from 2013. 
While we are making steady progress in the Wireline business and achieved our goal of expanding margins, we are far from satisfied. There is more work to do to drive sustainable improvements in both revenue growth and profitability. Our path to improve profitable growth includes driving further FiOS penetration and improving operating and capital efficiency. 
In the Enterprise and Wholesale business, we are changing our revenue mix towards newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services. 
On the cost side of the equation, we have realized many noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. We are confident that this continued focus will improve our overall cost structure, ultimately resulting in a much stronger Wireline business. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. Our operating and financial performance in 2014 demonstrated once again that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength in which we will build our competitive advantage. 
2014 was a remarkable year from a financial viewpoint. We delivered 18% growth and adjusted earnings per share with very strong cash flows. We executed a strategically important $130 billion transaction through a combination of debt and equity. Our strong cash generation allowed us to invest $17.2 billion in capital, pay $7.8 billion in dividends, make incremental cash interest and tax payments and redeemed higher coupon notes in the course of restructuring our debt maturity schedule. 
In addition, we declared a 3.8% dividend increase and improved our cash position since the closing of the Vodafone transaction.  
Our customer growth in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Wireless, gives us a great confidence heading into 2015. 
In terms of our 2015 outlook, it is difficult to predict the competitive intensity of routers, particularly in the Wireless. However, we have faced highly competitive environments before and have always been successfully and profitably grow the business because our customers understand the value of our services. 
In this environment, we will continue to protect our base by focusing on net adds and upgrades that make financial sense for our business. We will also continue to focus on growing in the right customer segments, while at the same time creating new revenue streams for the future. 
Over a sustained period of time, our industry is governed by a free cash flow dynamic. To be successful, companies need to generate free cash flow, which can be invested in their networks to attract and retain customers by providing a quality experience. 
In that context, we are targeting the following for 2015. Consolidated revenue growth of at least 4%; sustain profitability with a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin at a level consistent with our full year 2014 performance; strong free cash flow generation with consolidated capital spending of between $17.5 and $18 billion; and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $700 million. 
In terms of income taxes, we realize the cash benefit in 2014 due to the extension of bonus depreciation, which will also have a carryover benefit in 2015. However, with the full year of 100% Wireless net income, we expect total cash income taxes to increase in 2015. We also expect our effective tax rate for book purposes to be in the area of 34% to 36%. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions."

Some of that will be equipment revenue. But I think what you have to focus in on is if you look at the service revenue component, you look at the recurring revenue of FiOS. So if you look at the recurring revenues of this business, 4%-plus is an achievable metric. But obviously equipment revenue will play at factor in that. But keep in mind as we start to go out into future on the installment sales, the installment sales will really neutralize themselves over a 2-year period of time if you think of it that way. So as we collect more on the installment sales, we're putting more on, but the cash flow is starting to catch up with it. So I would keep that on mind.

So look, I think it's important to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014, around price competition and the intensity of the competition and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time. So we had top line growth of",744,"All right. So look, I think it's important to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014, around price competition and the intensity of the competition and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time. So we had top line growth of 5.7%, we expanded the EBITDA by $1 billion in wireless, we expanded the EBITDA in Wireline of $200 million, we had net phone ads, which seems to be the big issue of 1.3 million in this competitive environment, and we grew our overall net adds year-over-year by 24%. So I think the basic point here is that we will continue to compete, and we will continue to compete at a positive profitable value. I felt also it's important to enter into 2015 with the competition we are also doing a lot of different things. So number one, based on our base as I said in my comments, we still have 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones that we will pursue to upgrade into our 4G LTE network that is more efficient, generates more revenue. Tablets are only 8% of our base, and as I said in the past, tablets will continue to be a very large piece of our growth into the future. Tablets are very, very good because: One, they make it more sticky at the account level; two, we get a recurring revenue stream albeit lower than a smartphone, but the subsidy on that is much reduced; and then also, it also increases the amounts of usage and video uptake on the network, which is what we're driving to as the more usage to benefit on the bundles. The other thing is as you look out to us and directions retaking, obviously as we state it, Internet of Things is going to be a very important category, $585 million, up 45% year-over-year, and we don't really disclose it, but we have over 15 million connections now of Internet of Things. We announced the Verizon Vehicle, as I said. You should look at us as launching over-the-top mobile first sometime this summer as Lowell has talked about in the past. And on the Wireline side, we just launched a new router which I think is going to improve, both the intake of video into the home, but it's also very important because it has to sustain the ability of Wireless products within the home. And as you know, when you got 4 to 5 devices running on that router today that can only deliver up to 75 megabits, you're really not getting 75 megabits. So this router will be able to produce significant higher throughput, and we believe it's the fastest in the industry today. So putting that all in context from a competitive standpoint and what we can deliver, the guidance we're giving you is based on all the strategic actions that we will be taking in the future. The other two things I would talk about is, if you look at our prepaid base, again, another positive quarter, up 7.5% on ARPU growth, and then, of course, our own reseller rate base with our own strategic initiatives with that, whether you call it a reseller base or MVNO is all positive and growing positively. So that leads me into the Google discussion. I guess, what I would say right off the bat, number one, is this not another very prime example of the intensity and the competition around this industry, the availability of the open networks and access to the networks, and this is why another reason of why this industry does not need to be regulated. I would also say on this one is, if you look at Google, they have entered fiber, they've done other initiatives, their whole purpose is to increase speeds so that people can do more search. What I would say is we'll have to wait and see how the execute on the MVNO. But listen, MVNO or resellers or people leasing from networks from carriers have been around for 15 years. It's a complex issue. You have to deal directly with the consumer. There's a whole infrastructure that's needed to do that. So I think this is another example of where Google is going to enter the market under a platform basis to do what they want to do. And it's just another competitor as we look at it. So I'll leave it at that."

So I think this is what we need to look at as we said in the remarks and follow the words carefully is that we will pursue our base, we will pursue net adds, and we will pursue upgrades that are financially beneficial to the company. So what that means is at a 1.14% churn rate, you should take that as we did not go to places where we do not financially want to go to save a customer. And there's going to be certain customers will leave us for a price, and we're not just going to compete with that because it doesn't make financial sense for us to do that. As far as why upgrades were so high, I think you have to go back a little bit and reflect on what we did in the past. So if you look at 2013, we made a lot of policy changes around upgrades. It pushed the upgrade view back into '14. So in '14, we took probably more upgrades than we generally would have taken because of those policy changes. But as we came out of the third quarter, I said that we had about 3.2 million iPhones in our base that are coming out of contract and that was a signal that we were going to aggressively go after those 3.2 million customers, and we did. We are very satisfied with the quality of the upgrades. So if you look at it from that perspective in the remarks I made, look at it on a percentage basis, 78% of our upgrades are what we would call strategic quality upgrades and that means a 3G to 4G, a basic to 4G or a high-value type customers who deliver solid value to us, and we appreciate their business, and we want to keep them as a customer. So that's how you should view this, John. And I think with the competition and some of the pricing that's out there, you should think that we're going to have a higher churn rate because some customers were just not going to financially keep."

So on a competitive consolidated margin, look, I think it's important again that you focus on the words, we said at least top line 4% growth. We said that we would have at least a consolidated margin consistent with 2014. But I think you need to put that in perspective that we had an extremely heavy fourth quarter in 2014. So I would not expect that to repeat in 2015 given the iconic devices that hit and given the level of competition at this point in time versus what we would expect next year. I think the other important thing to is that you're focusing in on this, I think it's important to focus on 2014 earnings per share. So we grew at 18%. I know most of you will subtract out the 10% for the accretion of Vodafone. So when you look at it, the core business in this highly competitive environment grew at 8%. I would also say that don't get ahead of yourselves on the Wireline accretion of margin. As Lowell and I said before, this will be a slow progression of Wireline accretion, so we grew 80 basis points this year, we will continue to focus in on top line growth and continue to take out those costs, continue our copper to fiber migration efforts and continue to become more efficient of a company. So I wouldn't read too much into we expect Wireline to jump off the charts and Wireless to go down. On the over-the-top strategy, I guess, I'm no t going to disclose as to too much what we're going to do. But I think if you look at the environment, there's a lot of positive things coming out of the environment. So if you look at what -- what Dish has done around some of their recent launches, if you look at CBS and their own launch of over-the-top with their own programming, this just leads us to a path of content owners that are willing to open up their content to different models, and that's exactly what we're going to execute on, and we're working with many content providers to join that model. And we'll have a lot more to say about that and obviously Lowell will talk more about that when we launch our first product come this summer."

I think this becomes a more tricky question because obviously, ARPA is around service. And with the Edge program, we're kind of convoluting that now, that it's a tougher metric to get your hands around, which is why we're giving out there the recurring installment buildings to get that in a apples-to-apples comparison. But if you think about that, we grew that ARPA by 5.2%. So look, I think given everything that's going on and given the fact that I said we would have a top line growth of 4%, obviously, we believe that we can continue to accrete the ARPA of this business given everything I said about the additional growth things that we're keying in on, just the jumpoff point that we came into this year. So the other thing to is that if you go back to 2012, the fourth quarter of '12 was very much like this quarter of '14. We really placed the bet on growth and upgrades and solidifying our base in '12, albeit, we added a lot more smartphones net adds back then. But it's pretty much the same quarter that gives us a great basis to jump off into 2015. So that's how I would think about the ARPA metrics. On CapEx, Mike, it goes directly to what you said. I've been pretty consistent with this and the fact that we will spend more CapEx in the Wireless side, and we will continue to curtail CapEx on the Wireline side. And some of that is because we're going to the end of our committed build around FiOS, penetration is getting higher, we're reconnecting homes that we've already connected, so it's not additional capital that we have to outlay and we're very focused on those what we call connected homes that are not our customers to go back after them. That is a very good return for us because we already spent the capital to connect that home. So it's a lot of combination around that. But yes, this is around densification, this is around our projection of growth for the Wireless industry and staying ahead of that. So again, it's all about encompassing. So we're looking at a slight increase from where we ended 2014."

Number one, it's obviously, the more and more we convert 3G customers to 4G that affords us the ability to get on a much more efficient network, it affords us the ability reappropriate our spectrum, and it affords us to actually start to rundown, if you will, the higher cost network of 3G. So all of that plays into this. The other thing is that as we said before, we have a very high cost structure in servicing our customers, and you're going to see some things different of how we approach customers, mainly around getting more around self-serve so that we can do more of the handsets. And we saw over the last 2 years starting in 2013 into 2014 that this played a big role in how we take cost out of the Wireless cost structure. On the Wireline side, it's just continuing to do more the same. So we really don't play up the fact that all the copper to fiber migration, but this is really starting to pay benefits to us. And as we've said, we've been doing this for the last 3 years. We are now in the position of starting to shut down central offices, which free up real estate for us to monetize and get out of, it reduces the property tax around this. So there's a lot of fishing efficiencies that come from this. The other thing is that within the onetime charges you probably picked up severance accrual. And in December, the Wireline company already has reduced about 2,300 headcount, including about 1,300 representative workforce who took an additional incentive for them to voluntarily retire. So we are setting the company up, once again, to produce a very beneficial efficient cost structure going into 2015."

Because I personally have been misquoted both in the press and in Congress on what I've said. So this is a good question for me to clear this up. So first of all, this is not an issue about Internet rules, it's about an issue of FCC reclassifying broadband upward service. And this will absolutely affect us in the industry on long-term investment in our networks. And that can be seen factually as to what happened in the rest of the world where you have high regulation, the networks are not invested in, they're not good quality of service networks, and that's where this will put us. I guess, I would emphasize also that the approach in whole or in part on Title II is as extreme and risky bet that will jeopardize our investment and development of innovation and broadband Internet and related services. It will also tie up the industry in a very uncertain time and cause all types of litigation. So when I said before and misquoted on the fact that it would not hurt our investment, I was talking about 2015. But as this piece of Title II was to pass, I can absolutely assure you, it would certainly change the way we view our investment in our networks. The other thing, too, is that if I think it's important to show that this industry on a high level basis has invested about $50 billion a year in networks and improving the quality of service and open network to everyone. And that's what the industry believes that this is an open Internet basis. If we curtail the investment of this industry, it will definitely trickle down to what we would consider middle class jobs. And it's because most of at least for Verizon Wireless a lot of our builds are done by thousands of contractors across the United States, that will impact those small businesses and impact their employees. So from that perspective, I guess, what we would say, Kevin, is we would encourage Congress to adopt the legislative solution. Congress has the authority to adopt peer rules of though world that allow policymakers and industry to move to more important things. So I think that summarizes the position about Title II."

And even with those higher plants, we still see a large portion of those customers breaking their bundles because of video consumption and the increase in video consumption. So yes, there is an offset here. It is not all just dilution there is an upgrade of what customers are using.

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. 
Before Fran goes through our performance results, I'd like to cover our earnings reconciliation for the fourth quarter and highlight a few special items. These are displayed on Slide 3. For the fourth quarter, we reported a loss of $0.54 per share on a GAAP basis. This reported result includes several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. The largest item is our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This year, we recorded a pretax expense of $7 billion to increase our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily noncash, was caused by changes in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions. 
We also incurred pretax expenses of $502 million related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these 2 charges amounted to $4.7 billion or $1.12 per share. We also incurred nonoperational expenses of $872 million in connection with early debt redemption and other costs. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $528 million or $0.13 per share. Details regarding the income statement line item effects for these items are available on our website in the financial and operating information and non-GAAP reconciliation schedules. 
Excluding the nonoperational charges of $1.25 per share, adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the fourth quarter. This compares with adjusted EPS of $0.66 a year ago, an increase of 7.6%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.35 compared with $2.84 in 2013, an increase of 18%. Keep in mind that the $3.35 adjusted EPS does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of 2014 since the transaction closed on February 21. The results in growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and remarks exclude the effects of the nonoperational items and are, therefore, on an adjusted basis. Also the growth rates we provide are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
I would like to remind everyone that due to the FCC's rules, we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. When the rules permit, we do plan to provide you with an update on our participation. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. 2014 was a great year of execution and achievement for Verizon from both a strategic and financial perspective.

Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. 2014 was a great year of execution and achievement for Verizon from both a strategic and financial perspective. We delivered strong operating and financial performance and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in any environment. Strategically, our most notable accomplishment was completing the transaction for full ownership of Verizon Wireless. We closed the deal in late February, providing immediate earnings accretion and full access to the cash flows of what we believe is the best wireless asset in the world. Throughout the year, we continued our steady and consistent investment in our networks and platforms, which are critical to driving profitable growth in the future. 
Our strong cash generation enabled us to invest $17.2 billion of capital and return value to shareholders through dividend payments, which totaled $7.8 billion for the year. Last September, our Board of Directors approved a 3.8% dividend increase, raising the annual amount to $2.20 per share. At the same time, we are investing and innovating for the future through new growth businesses and integrated product development efforts in rapidly evolving markets, like mobile video and the Internet of Things. 
The foundation of our continued success is network excellence, which is the hallmark of the Verizon brand. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services, which will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our networks provide the fundamental strength and basis for our competitive advantage. Our industry is strong and demand is growing, with customers using wireless and broadband even more and in different ways than ever before. Our competitive position is very strong, and we are well positioned from a strategic standpoint to capitalize on these market trends. 
In Wireless, we had another exceptional year of quality connections, growth and profitability. Retail postpaid net adds totaled 5.5 million for the year, with 2 million coming in a highly competitive fourth quarter that featured heavy promotional activity. Postpaid activations, gross additions, upgrades and net adds all grew by double-digit percentages in 2014. Total operating revenues grew 8.2% for the year and our EBITDA service margin was 48.5% even with the short-term pressure of significant device volumes in the fourth quarter. 
In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 5% for the year, driven by our FiOS platform. In 2014, we continued to increase penetration in existing markets and ended the year at 41% for Internet and just under 36% for video. Our sharp focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in an 80 basis point expansion of our EBITDA margin to 23.2% for the full year. 
Now let's get into the fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. On a reported basis, total operating revenue grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we added $6.5 billion to our top line, representing 5.4% growth, which exceeded our guidance of 4% consolidated revenue growth for 2014. If we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rates would have been 7.3% for the fourth quarter and 5.7% for the full year. 
Our consolidated revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. In the fourth quarter, growth was favorably impacted by increased Wireless equipment revenue due to the significant 4G device activations. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics are beginning to emerge. In 2014, these revenues totaled about $585 million with growth of more than 45%. 
There are countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things ecosystem across multiple industries. A great example of this unveiled last week at the North American International Auto Show, where we announced Verizon Vehicle, a powerful new connected vehicle service. This unique aftermarket solution modernizes traditional roadside assistance while enhancing driver safety and convenience. We expect this service to launch commercially in the second quarter. The addressable market is more than 200 million vehicles on the road today that are not connected to the Internet or have a GPS unit. We believe that this large unserved market stands to greatly benefit from this new car wireless connectivity solution. 
In addition to top line growth, we continued to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $43.3 billion in 2014, an increase of 2.9%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 34.1%. 
Let's take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 6. As I previously noted, the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless created a lack of comparability between the current and prior periods in our
[Audio Gap] 
cash flows from operation totaled $30.6 billion. In addition to incremental cash interest and tax payments, we made $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not have to fund in 2013. In spite of these additional cash outlays and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $13.4 billion for the year. 
Our capital program was consistent with our guidance of around $17 billion for the year with improving capital efficiency. In total, capital expenditure were $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.2 billion for the full year, up 3.5% from 2013. Our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio was 13.5%, an improvement from 13.8% in 2013. 
The pace of capital spending in Wireless was very consistent throughout all 4 quarters of the year. Wireless CapEx was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the full year. We continue to invest the necessary capital to proactively stay ahead of demand. Our investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. 
As I am sure you have seen from our advertising, we now have deployed AWS or XLTE, as we have branded it, in more than 400 markets, effectively doubling our existing capacity. And despite what others claim about certain aspects of their networks, when you look across the entire nation and consider all the relevant performance metrics, Verizon has the nation's largest and most reliable 4G LTE network. We are consistently acknowledged as the performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. 
In Wireline, capital spending totaled $1.6 billion in the quarter and $5.8 billion for the year, down 7.7% from 2013. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the year with $113.3 billion of gross debt and $102.7 billion of net debt. We significantly improved the maturity profile of our debt portfolio during 2014 through various debt market transactions. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x. We remain committed to getting back to our pretransaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. 
Now let's move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. Our investment strategy is focused on adding network capacity ahead of accelerating demand, which is driven by increasing 4G device adoption and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. 
In 2014, we strengthened the overall quality of our customer accounts. We added 24.7 million 4G devices into our postpaid connections base, representing annual growth of about 58%. In addition, we increased the number of More Everything shared data plans to 61% of total accounts. The average connections per account grew 4% and ARPA plus Edge installment billings increased by more than 5% in 2014. 
As I stated coming out of the third quarter, we expected and closed the year with a very high-volume quarter. Total postpaid device activations in the fourth quarter were unprecedented, totaling 15.3 million, up nearly 34% over last year. More than 13 million were phones, driven by iconic smartphone launches from both Apple and Samsung. To give some historical perspective, these phone activations were 1.5 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, which at that time was a record-high because it was the first time a 4G iPhone or a free 3G iPhone was available on our network. The usage characteristics of these iconic 4G smartphones also generate strong returns and a higher NPV. Our fourth quarter promotions were successful, driving a sequential and year-over-year increase in gross adds, net adds and upgrades. This customer growth sets us up very well for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond as we drive usage and leverage the efficiencies of our LTE network. 
Total Wireless operating revenues were $23.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11%. For the full year, operating revenues totaled $87.6 billion, representing growth of $6.6 billion or 8.2%. Total service revenues grew 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year. Verizon Edge installment billings totaled $443 million in the quarter and $976 million for the full year. Service revenues plus Edge installment billings grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 6.6% for the full year. As we expected, the percentage of phone activations on the Edge program increased to about 25% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with slightly more than 7 million phones on Edge, which is just over 8% of our postpaid phone base. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and $35.2 billion for the full year, an increase of more than $1 billion or 3%. Our EBITDA service margin for the fourth quarter was 42% due to the significant device volumes. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin was 48.5% compared with 49.5% in 2013. The full year EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 40.2% compared with 42.2% for 2013. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 8. Retail postpaid service revenue per account or ARPA grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. If you add the Edge installment billings to ARPA, the growth rates increased to 3.5% for the quarter and 5.3% for the full year. We ended the year with 35.6 million postpaid accounts, an increase of 1.5%. The number of postpaid connections per account grew to 2.87, up 4% from a year ago. 
As I said, the number of customers accounts on More Everything shared data plans increased from 46% to 61% of total. As you would expect, the average number of connections in More Everything plans are higher at 3.06 per account and grew faster, up more than 7%. And the average data usage in these accounts has increased by about 50% in the past year. 
Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9. We ended the year with 108.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to 102.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million. As we said, 2014 was a year of historical connections growth. Postpaid gross additions were 5.4 million in the quarter, up 25.5%. For the year, postpaid gross adds totaled 17.8 million, up 18% from 2013 and 20% higher than 2012. In terms of the gross add mix in the quarter, 55% were smartphones and about 37% were Internet devices, primarily tablets. About 6% were basic phones. This percentage mix was also representative of the full year. 
As we said in our updates, we did experience an elevated rate of retail postpaid churn in the fourth quarter at 1.14%. Throughout the year, we maintained a disciplined approach to customer acquisition and retention with a focus on attracting and retaining high-quality customers. Within the heightened amount of phone activity in the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the overall improvement in the quality of our phone base. 
Our retail postpaid net additions of 2 million in the fourth quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Our 5.5 million postpaid net additions for the year compared favorably with a 4.1 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012. As far as the postpaid net add mix, the fourth quarter included 1.5 million new 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled 672,000 as the 1.5 million 4G smartphones were offset in part by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. Full year net adds of 5.5 million included 4.6 million 4G smartphones and 4.3 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet Internet devices. 
Let's now turn to Slide 10 and take a look at device activations and our success in driving 4G adoption and usage. Total postpaid device activations totaled 15.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 34%. For the full year, postpaid activations totaled 48.1 million, up 16% from 2013. About 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. 4G LTE devices now comprise 66% of our retail postpaid connections base. This strong device adoption continues to drive increased usage. We ended the year with 67.7 million smartphones in total, about 80% of which were 4G. Smartphone penetration increased to 79% of total phones. About 75% of our phone activations in the quarter were customer upgrades. In total, about 9.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter. As you would expect, a vast majority of these upgrades were 4G smartphones. 
Most of our smartphone upgrades represent an incremental revenue opportunity for us. 1.2 million were upgrades from basic phones. About 46% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G, which we monetized through higher data usage and a lower cost to serve. We also continued to successfully identify and retain a high percentage of what we call high-risk, high-value accounts. Looking ahead, we still have a sizable quality upgrade opportunity with about 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones remaining in our postpaid connections base. We are very focused on this opportunity to upgrade customers and protect our high-quality postpaid base. 
In addition, we also have a profitable growth opportunity with further penetration of tablets. We ended the year with about 8 million postpaid tablets in our connections base. Tablets have expanded the market for postpaid devices and provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. Data and video usage on our network continues to rise. About 84% of our total data traffic was on the 4G LTE network. We are handling this demand and by our own measures, the network performance continues to improve. 
Let's move next our Wireline segment, starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11. In the consumer business, we continued to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In fact, we have posted 10 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in excess of 4%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenues grew 4.1% and for the full year, were up 5%, exceeding our guidance of at least 4% growth. Mass markets, which includes small business, grew 3% in the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. FiOS now represents 77% of consumer revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 11.1%, driven by a combination of customer growth, pricing actions and increased FiOS Quantum penetration. At the end of the year, 59% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to the data speeds higher than 50 megabits per second. This is up from 46% at the end of 2013. Throughout the year, we continued to improve the customer value proposition, driving better investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. 
During 2014, we introduced FiOS Quantum TV. Another differentiated offer was our SpeedMatch service, which increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds. In December, we introduced the FiOS Quantum Gateway, our new router that delivers America's fastest WiFi. You will begin to see more marketing of this router and its capability shortly. Looking ahead, our focus will remain on driving higher penetration in existing markets, which in turn will generate profitable growth and further improve our investment returns. 
In broadband, we added 145,000 net FiOS customers in the quarter and 544,000 for the year. We have a total of 6.6 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.1% penetration, which is up 160 basis points for the year. Overall net broadband subscribers increased 59,000 in the quarter and 190,000 for the full year. In FiOS Video, we added 116,000 net customers in the quarter and 387,000 for the year. We have a total of 5.6 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.8% penetration, an increase of 80 basis points in 2014. 
In terms of our network evolution initiative, we converted an additional 52,000 copper customers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to around 255,000. In total, we have converted more than 800,000 customers to fiber since we started this initiative in 2011. Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services, which result in additional recurring revenue. In 2015, we plan to convert another 200,000 copper customers to fiber. 
During 2014, we also continued our consolidation efforts around central offices, which will create additional efficiencies. We have a strong commitment to customer service and have implemented several new frontline tools that are improving efficiency and increasing customer satisfaction. While we benchmark well against the competition, we have more work to do in 2015 to take our performance to the next level. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and the wholesale business. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 4.6%, which included about $30 million of pressure from FX. For the full year, revenue of $13.7 billion was down 3.5%. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continued to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Strategic services grew 1.5% in the quarter and 2.3% for the year. This category includes both the IP layer and application, such as data center cloud security and managed and professional services. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in application services. 
In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.8% in the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. On the positive side, healthy demand for Ethernet services continues while revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment were down 1.6% in the quarter and 0.5% for the full year. In terms of profitability, EBITDA increased 4.3% in the quarter and 3% for the full year. The EBITDA margin was 23.9% in the quarter and 23.2% for the year, up 80 basis points from 2013. 
While we are making steady progress in the Wireline business and achieved our goal of expanding margins, we are far from satisfied. There is more work to do to drive sustainable improvements in both revenue growth and profitability. Our path to improve profitable growth includes driving further FiOS penetration and improving operating and capital efficiency. In the enterprise and wholesale business, we are changing our revenue mix towards newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services. On the cost side of the equation, we have realized many noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. We are confident that this continued focus will improve our overall cost structure, ultimately resulting in a much stronger Wireline business. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. Our operating and financial performance in 2014 demonstrated once again that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. 
2014 was a remarkable year from a financial viewpoint. We delivered 18% growth in adjusted earnings per share with very strong cash flows. We executed a strategically important $130 billion transaction through a combination of debt and equity. Our strong cash generation allowed us to invest $17.2 billion in capital, pay $7.8 billion in dividends, make incremental cash interest and tax payments and redeem higher coupon notes in the course of restructuring our debt maturity schedule. In addition, we declared a 3.8% dividend increase and improved our cash position since the closing of the Vodafone transaction. Our customer growth in the fourth quarter, particularly in Wireless, gives us a great confidence heading into 2015. 
In terms of our 2015 outlook, it is difficult to predict the competitive intensity of others, particularly in the Wireless. However, we have faced highly competitive Wireless environments before and have always been able to successfully and profitably grow the business because our customers understand the value of our services. In this environment, we will continue to protect our base by focusing on net adds and upgrades that make financial sense for our business. We will also continue to focus on growing in the right customer segments while at the same time creating new revenue streams for the future. Over a sustained period of time, our industry is governed by a free cash flow dynamic. To be successful, companies need to generate free cash flow, which can be invested in their networks to attract and retain customers by providing a quality experience. 
In that context, we are targeting the following for 2015: consolidated revenue growth of at least 4%; sustained profitability with a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin at a level consistent with our full year 2014 performance; strong free cash flow generation with consolidated capital spending of between $17.5 billion and $18 billion; and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $700 million. In terms of income taxes, we realized a cash benefit in 2014 due to the extension of bonus depreciation, which will also have a carryover benefit in 2015. However, with the full year of 100% Wireless net income, we expect total cash income taxes to increase in 2015. We also expect our effective tax rate for book purposes to be in the area of 34% to 36%. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

But obviously, equipment revenue will play at factor in that. But keep in mind as we start to go out into the future on the installment sales, the installment sales will really neutralize themselves over a 2-year period of time if you think of it that way. So as we collect more on installment sales, we're putting more on, but the cash flow is starting to catch up with it. So I would keep that on mind. The other thing, too, is from a cash flow perspective, we're looking at alternatives around the receivable as this grows. So you could see us do things around securitization in the future, not that we're announcing anything today, but that is a possibility that we're looking at as we continue to grow that mix on the Edge program."

So look, I think it's important just to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014 around price competition and the intensity of the competition and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time. So we had top line growth",745,"All right. So look, I think it's important just to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014 around price competition and the intensity of the competition and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time. So we had top line growth of 5.7%. We expanded the EBITDA by $1 billion in Wireless. We expanded the EBITDA in Wireline of $200 million. We had net phone adds, which seems to be the big issue, of 1.3 million in this competitive environment. And we grew our overall net adds year-over-year by 24%. So I think the basic point here is that we will continue to compete and we will continue to compete at a positive profitable value. I felt also it's important to enter into 2015 with the competition, we are also doing a lot of different things. So number one, based on our base, as I said in my comments, we still have 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones that we will pursue to upgrade into our 4G LTE network that is more efficient, generates more revenue. Tablets are only 8% of our base. And as I said in the past, tablets will continue to be a very large piece of our growth into the future. Tablets are very, very good because: one, they make it more sticky at the account level; two, we get a recurring revenue stream, albeit lower than a smartphone, but the subsidy on that is much reduced; and then also it also increases the amount of usage and video uptake on the network, which is what we're driving to as the more usage to benefit on the bundles. The other thing is as you look out to us and directions we're taking, obviously as we stated, Internet of Things is going to be a very important category, $585 million, up 45% year-over-year. And we don't really disclose it, but we have over 15 million connections now of Internet of Things. We announced the Verizon Vehicle, as I said. You should look at us as launching over-the-top mobile-first sometime this summer, as Lowell has talked about in the past. And on the Wireline side, we just launched a new router, which we think is going to improve both the intake of video into the home, but it's also very important because it has to sustain the ability of Wireless products within that home. And as you know, when you get 4 to 5 devices running on that router today that it can only deliver up to 75 megabits, you're really not getting 75 megabits. So this router will be able to produce significant higher throughput, and we believe it's the fastest in the industry today. So putting that all in context from a competitive standpoint and what we can deliver, the guidance we're giving you is based on all the strategic actions that we will be taking in the future. The other 2 things I would talk about is if you look at our prepaid base, again another positive quarter, up 7.5% on ARPU growth, and then of course, our own reseller base with our own strategic initiatives with that, whether you call it a reseller base or MVNO, is all positive and growing positively. So that leads me into the Google discussion. I guess, what I would say right off the bat, number one, is this is just another very prime example of the intensity and the competition around this industry, the availability of the open networks and access to the networks. And this is why another reason of why this industry does not need to be regulated. I would also say on this one is if you look at Google, they've entered the fiber, they've done other initiatives, their whole purpose is to increase speeds so that people can do more search. What I would say is we'll have to wait to see how they execute on the MVNO. But listen, MVNOs or resellers or people leasing the network from carriers has been around for 15 years. It's a complex issue. You have to deal directly with the consumer. There's a whole infrastructure that's needed to do that. So I think this is another example of where Google is going to enter the market under a platform basis to do what they want to do. And it's just another competitor as we look at it, so I'll leave it at that."

So I think this is what we need to look at, as we said in the remarks, and follow the words carefully is that we will pursue our base, we will pursue net adds and we'll pursue upgrades that are financially beneficial to the company. So what that means is at a 1.14% churn rate, you should take that as we did not go to places where we did not financially want to go to save a customer. And there's going to be certain customers who leave us for a price, and we're just not going to compete with that because it doesn't make financial sense for us to do that. As far as why upgrades were so high, I think you have to go back a little bit and reflect on what we did in the past. So if you look at 2013, we made a lot of policy changes around upgrades. It pushed the upgrade view back into '14. So in '14, we took probably more upgrades than we generally would have taken because of those policy changes. But as we came out of the third quarter, I said that we had about 3.2 million iPhones in our base that were coming out of contract. And that was a signal that we were going to aggressively go after those 3.2 million customers, and we did. We are very satisfied with the quality of the upgrades. So if you look at it from that perspective in the remarks I made, look at it on a percentage basis, 78% of our upgrades are what we would call strategic quality upgrades. And that means a 3G to 4G, a basic to 4G or a high value-type customer who delivers a lot of value to us and we appreciate their business and we want to keep them as a customer. So that's how you should view this, John. And I think that with the competition and some of the pricing that's out there, you should think that we're going to have a higher churn rate because of some customers we're just not going to financially keep."

So on a competitive consolidated margin, look, I think it's important again that you focus on the words, we said at least top line 4% growth. We said that we would have at least a consolidated margin consistent with 2014. But I think you need to put in perspective that we had an extremely heavy fourth quarter in 2014. So I would not expect that to repeat in 2015, given the iconic devices that hit and given the level of competition at this point in time versus what we would expect next year. I think the other important thing, too, is as you're focusing in on this, I think it's important to focus on 2014 earnings per share. So we grew at 18%. I know most of you will subtract out the 10% for the accretion of Vodafone. So when you look at it, the core business in this highly competitive environment grew at 8%. I would also say that don't get ahead of yourselves on the Wireline accretion of margin. As Lowell and I said before, this will be a slow progression of Wireline accretion. So we grew 80 basis points this year, we will continue to focus in on top line growth and continue to take out those cost, continue our copper-to-fiber migration efforts and continue to become more efficient of a company. So I wouldn't read too much into we expect Wireline to jump off the charts and Wireless to go down. On the over-the-top strategy, I guess, I'm not going to disclose as to too much what we're going to do. But I think if you look at the environment, there's a lot of positive things coming out of the environment. So if you look at DISH has done around some of their recent launches, look at CBS and their own launch of over-the-top with their own programming, this just leads us to a path of content owners are willing to open up their content to different models. And that's exactly what we're going to execute on and we're working with many content providers to join that model. And we'll have a lot more to say about that, and Marni and obviously Lowell will talk more about that when we launch our first product come this summer."

So on the VZW margin, the follow-up question on around the ARPA, I think this becomes a more tricky question because obviously ARPA is around service. And with the Edge program, we're kind of convoluting that now that it's a tougher metric to get your hands around, which is why we're giving out the recurring installment billings to try to get it on an apples-to-apples comparison. But if you think about that, we grew that ARPA by 5.2%. So look, I think given everything that's going on and given the fact that I said we would have a top line growth of 4%, obviously we believe that we can continue to accrete the ARPA of this business, given everything I said about the additional growth things that we're keying in on, just the jumpoff point that we came into this year. So the other thing, too, is if you go back to 2012, the fourth quarter of '12 was very much like this quarter of '14. We really placed the bet on growth and upgrades and solidifying our base in '12, albeit we added a lot more smartphone net adds back then. But it's pretty much the same quarter that gives us a great basis to jump off into 2015. So that's how I would think about the ARPA metric. On CapEx, Mike, it goes directly to what you said. I've been pretty consistent with this in the fact that we will spend more CapEx in the Wireless side and we will continue to curtail CapEx on the Wireline side. And some of that is because we're getting to the end of our committed build around FiOS, penetration is getting higher, we're reconnecting homes that we've already connected, so it's not additional capital that we have to outlay and we're very focused on those what we call connected homes that are not our customers to go back after them. That is a very good return for us because we already spent the capital to connect that home. So it's a lot of combination around that. But yes, this is around densification, this is around our projection of growth for the Wireless industry and staying ahead of that. So again it's all about encompassing, so we're looking at a slight increase from where we ended 2014."

And I know you touched upon this with some of the questions in your prepared remarks. But is there any sense that you can give us sort of the scope of opportunities over a multiyear period? And I guess, just the question is really if we find ourselves in an intensely competitive environment as you've mentioned, how much opportunity is there for you folks to continue to drive down cost in order to retain this sort of industry-leading margin profile and cash-generation ability that you guys have delivered for the last couple of years?"

Number one is obviously the more and more we convert 3G customers to 4G, that affords us the ability to get on a much more efficient network, it affords us the ability reappropriate our spectrum and it affords us",300,"So just a couple of thoughts around that. Number one is obviously the more and more we convert 3G customers to 4G, that affords us the ability to get on a much more efficient network, it affords us the ability reappropriate our spectrum and it affords us to actually start to run down, if you will, the higher-cost network of 3G. So all of that plays into this. The other thing is that, as we said before, we have a very high-cost structure in servicing our customers, and you're going to see some things different of how we approach customers, mainly around getting more around self-serve so that we can do more of the handsets. And we saw over the last 2 years, starting in 2013 into 2014, that this played a big role in how we take cost out of the Wireless cost structure. On the Wireline side, it's just continuing to do more of the same. So we really don't play up the fact of all the copper-to-fiber migration, but this is really starting to pay benefits to us. And as we've said, we've been doing this for the last 3 years. We are now in the position of starting to shut down central offices, which free up real estate for us to monetize and get out of. It reduces the property tax around this. So there's a lot of efficiencies that come from this. The other thing is that within the one-time charges, you probably picked up a severance accrual. And in December, the Wireline company already has reduced about 2,300 headcount, including about 1,300 representative workforce, who took an additional incentive for them to voluntarily retire. So we are setting the company up once again to produce a very beneficial, efficient cost structure going into 2015."

So this is a good question for me to clear this up. So first of all, this is not an issue about Internet rules, it's about an issue of FCC reclassifying broadband to Title II service. And this will absolutely affect us and the industry on long-term investment in our networks. And that can be seen factually as to what happened in the rest of the world, where you have high regulation, the networks are not invested in, they're not good quality of service networks. And that's where this will put us. I guess, I would emphasize also that the approach in whole or in part on Title II is an extreme and risky path that will jeopardize our investment and the development of innovation in broadband Internet and related services. It will also tie up the industry in a very uncertain time and cause all types of litigation. So when I said before and misquoted on the fact that it would not hurt our investment, I was talking about 2015. But if this piece of Title II was to pass, I can absolutely assure you it would certainly change the way we then view our investment in our networks. The other thing, too, is as I think it's important to show that this industry on a high-level basis has invested about $50 billion a year in networks and improving the quality of service and open network to everyone. And that's what the industry believes is that this is an open Internet basis. If we curtail the investment of this industry, it will definitely trickle down to what we would consider middle-class jobs. And it's because most of, at least for Verizon Wireless, a lot of our build are done by thousands of contractors across the United States, that will impact those small businesses and impact their employees. So from that perspective, I guess, what we would say, Kevin, is we would encourage Congress to adopt the legislative solution. Congress has the authority to adopt clear rules of the road that allow policymakers in the industry to move on to more important things. So I think that summarizes the position about Title II."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. 
Before Fran goes through our performance results, I'd like to cover our earnings reconciliation for the fourth quarter and highlight a few special items. These are displayed on Slide 3. For the fourth quarter, we reported a loss of $0.54 per share on a GAAP basis. This reported result includes several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. The largest item is our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This year, we recorded a pretax expense of $7 billion to increase our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily noncash, was caused by changes in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions. 
We also incurred pretax expenses of $502 million related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these 2 charges amounted to $4.7 billion or $1.12 per share. We also incurred nonoperational expenses of $872 million in connection with early debt redemption and other costs. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $528 million or $0.13 per share. Details regarding the income statement line-item effects for these items are available on our website in the financial and operating information and non-GAAP reconciliation schedules. 
Excluding the nonoperational charges of $1.25 per share, adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the fourth quarter. This compares with adjusted EPS of $0.66 a year ago, an increase of 7.6%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.35 compared with $2.84 in 2013, an increase of 18%. Keep in mind that the $3.35 adjusted EPS does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of 2014, since the transaction closed on February 21. The results and growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and remarks exclude the effects of the nonoperational items and are, therefore, on an adjusted basis. Also the growth rates we provide are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
I would like to remind everyone that due to the FCC's rules, we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. When the rules permit, we do plan to provide you with an update on our participation. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. 2014 was a great year of execution and achievement for Verizon from both a strategic and financial perspective. We delivered strong operating and financial performance and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in any environment. Strategically, our most notable accomplishment was completing the transaction for full ownership of Verizon Wireless. We closed the deal in late February, providing immediate earnings accretion and full access to the cash flows of what we believe is the best wireless asset in the world. Throughout the year, we continued our steady and consistent investment in our networks and platforms, which are critical to driving profitable growth in the future. 
Our strong cash generation enabled us to invest $17.2 billion of capital and return value to shareholders through dividend payments, which totaled $7.8 billion for the year. Last September, our Board of Directors approved a 3.8% dividend increase, raising the annual amount to $2.20 per share. At the same time, we are investing and innovating for the future through new growth businesses and integrated product development efforts in rapidly evolving markets, like mobile video and the Internet of Things. 
The foundation of our continued success is network excellence, which is the hallmark of the Verizon brand. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services, which will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our networks provide the fundamental strength and basis for our competitive advantage. Our industry is strong and demand is growing, with customers using wireless and broadband even more, and in different ways than ever before. Our competitive position is very strong, and we are well positioned from a strategic standpoint to capitalize on these market trends. 
In Wireless, we had another exceptional year of quality connections, growth and profitability. Retail postpaid net adds totaled 5.5 million for the year, with 2 million coming in a highly competitive fourth quarter that featured heavy promotional activity. Postpaid activations, gross additions, upgrades and net adds all grew by double-digit percentages in 2014. Total operating revenues grew 8.2% for the year and our EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, even with the short-term pressure of significant device volumes in the fourth quarter. 
In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 5% for the year, driven by our FiOS platform. In 2014, we continued to increase penetration in existing markets and ended the year at 41% for Internet and just under 36% for video. Our sharp focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in an 80-basis-point expansion of our EBITDA margin to 23.2% for the full year. 
Now let's get into the fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. On a reported basis, total operating revenue grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we added $6.5 billion to our top line, representing 5.4% growth, which exceeded our guidance of 4% consolidated revenue growth for 2014. If we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rates would have been 7.3% for the fourth quarter and 5.7% for the full year. 
Our consolidated revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. In the fourth quarter, growth was favorably impacted by increased Wireless equipment revenue due to the significant 4G device activations. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics are beginning to emerge. In 2014, these revenues totaled about $585 million with growth of more than 45%. 
There are countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things ecosystem across multiple industries. A great example of this was unveiled last week at the North American International Auto Show, where we announced Verizon Vehicle, a powerful new connected vehicle service. This unique aftermarket solution modernizes traditional roadside assistance while enhancing driver safety and convenience. We expect this service to launch commercially in the second quarter. The addressable market is more than 200 million vehicles on the road today that are not connected to the Internet or have a GPS unit. We believe that this large unserved market stands to greatly benefit from this new car wireless connectivity solution. 
In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $43.3 billion in 2014, an increase of 2.9%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 34.1%. 
Let's take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 6. As I previously noted, the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless created a lack of comparability between the current and prior periods in our
[Audio Gap] 
cash flows from operation totaled $30.6 billion. In addition to incremental cash interest and tax payments, we made $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not have to fund in 2013. In spite of these additional cash outlays and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $13.4 billion for the year. 
Our capital program was consistent with our guidance of around $17 billion for the year, with improving capital efficiency. In total, capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.2 billion for the full year, up 3.5% from 2013. Our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio was 13.5%, an improvement from 13.8% in 2013. 
The pace of capital spending in Wireless was very consistent throughout all 4 quarters of the year. Wireless CapEx was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the full year. We continue to invest the necessary capital to proactively stay ahead of demand. Our investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. 
As I am sure you have seen from our advertising, we now have deployed AWS or XLTE, as we have branded it, in more than 400 markets, effectively doubling our existing capacity. And despite what others claim about certain aspects of their networks, when you look across the entire nation and consider all the relevant performance metrics, Verizon has the nation's largest and most reliable 4G LTE network. We are consistently acknowledged as the performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. 
In Wireline, capital spending totaled $1.6 billion in the quarter and $5.8 billion for the year, down 7.7% from 2013. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the year with $113.3 billion of gross debt and $102.7 billion of net debt. We significantly improved the maturity profile of our debt portfolio during 2014 through various debt market transactions. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x. We remain committed to getting back to our pretransaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. 
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. Our investment strategy is focused on adding network capacity ahead of accelerating demand, which is driven by increasing 4G device adoption and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. 
In 2014, we strengthened the overall quality of our customer accounts. We added 24.7 million 4G devices into our postpaid connections base, representing annual growth of about 58%. In addition, we increased the number of More Everything shared data plans to 61% of total accounts. The average connections per account grew 4% and ARPA plus Edge installment billings increased by more than 5% in 2014. 
As I stated coming out of the third quarter, we expected and closed the year with a very high-volume quarter. Total postpaid device activations in the fourth quarter were unprecedented, totaling 15.3 million, up nearly 34% over last year. More than 13 million were phones, driven by iconic smartphone launches from both Apple and Samsung. To give some historical perspective, these phone activations were 1.5 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, which at that time was a record-high because it was the first time a 4G iPhone or a free 3G iPhone was available on our network. The usage characteristics of these iconic 4G smartphones also generate strong returns and a higher NPV. Our fourth quarter promotions were successful, driving a sequential and year-over-year increase in gross adds, net adds and upgrades. This customer growth sets us up very well for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond as we drive usage and leverage the efficiencies of our LTE network. 
Total Wireless operating revenues were $23.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11%. For the full year, operating revenues totaled $87.6 billion, representing growth of $6.6 billion or 8.2%. Total service revenues grew 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year. Verizon Edge installment billings totaled $443 million in the quarter and $976 million for the full year. Service revenues plus Edge installment billings grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 6.6% for the full year. As we expected, the percentage of phone activations on the Edge program increased to about 25% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with slightly more than 7 million phones on Edge, which is just over 8% of our postpaid phone base. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and $35.2 billion for the full year, an increase of more than $1 billion or 3%. Our EBITDA service margin for the fourth quarter was 42% due to the significant device volumes. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin was 48.5% compared with 49.5% in 2013. The full year EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 40.2% compared with 42.2% for 2013. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account, beginning on Slide 8. Retail postpaid service revenue per account or ARPA grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. If you add the Edge installment billings to ARPA, the growth rates increased to 3.5% for the quarter and 5.3% for the full year. We ended the year with 35.6 million postpaid accounts, an increase of 1.5%. The number of postpaid connections per account grew to 2.87, up 4% from a year ago. 
As I said, the number of customer's accounts on More Everything shared data plans increased from 46% to 61% of total. As you would expect, the average number of connections in More Everything plans are higher at 3.06 per account and grew faster, up more than 7%. And the average data usage in these accounts has increased by about 50% in the past year. 
Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9. We ended the year with 108.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to 102.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million. As we said, 2014 was a year of historical connections growth. Postpaid gross additions were 5.4 million in the quarter, up 25.5%. For the year, postpaid gross adds totaled 17.8 million, up 18% from 2013 and 20% higher than 2012. In terms of the gross add mix in the quarter, 55% were smartphones and about 37% were Internet devices, primarily tablets. About 6% were basic phones. This percentage mix is also representative of the full year. 
As we said in our updates, we did experience an elevated rate of retail postpaid churn in the fourth quarter at 1.14%. Throughout the year, we maintained a disciplined approach to customer acquisition and retention with a focus on attracting and retaining high-quality customers. Within the heightened amount of phone activity in the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the overall improvement in the quality of our phone base. 
Our retail postpaid net additions of 2 million in the fourth quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Our 5.5 million postpaid net additions for the year compare favorably with the 4.1 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012. As far as the postpaid net add mix, the fourth quarter included 1.5 million new 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled 672,000, as the 1.5 million 4G smartphones were offset in part by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. Full year net adds of 5.5 million included 4.6 million 4G smartphones and 4.3 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet Internet devices. 
Let's now turn to Slide 10 and take a look at device activations and our success in driving 4G adoption and usage. Total postpaid device activations totaled 15.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 34%. For the full year, postpaid activations totaled 48.1 million, up 16% from 2013. About 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. 4G LTE devices now comprise 66% of our retail postpaid connections base. This strong device adoption continues to drive increased usage. We ended the year with 67.7 million smartphones in total, about 80% of which were 4G. Smartphone penetration increased to 79% of total phones. About 75% of our phone activations in the quarter were customer upgrades. In total, about 9.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter. As you would expect, a vast majority of these upgrades were 4G smartphones. 
Most of our smartphone upgrades represent an incremental revenue opportunity for us. 1.2 million were upgrades from basic phones. About 46% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G, which we monetized through higher data usage and a lower cost to serve. We also continued to successfully identify and retain a high percentage of what we call high-risk, high-value accounts. Looking ahead, we still have a sizable quality upgrade opportunity, with about 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones remaining in our postpaid connections base. We are very focused on this opportunity to upgrade customers and protect our high-quality postpaid base. 
In addition, we also have a profitable growth opportunity with further penetration of tablets. We ended the year with about 8 million postpaid tablets in our connections base. Tablets have expanded the market for postpaid devices and provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. Data and video usage on our network continues to rise. About 84% of our total data traffic was on the 4G LTE network. We are handling this demand and by our own measures, the network performance continues to improve. 
Let's move next our Wireline segment, starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends, driven by FiOS. In fact, we have posted 10 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in excess of 4%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenues grew 4.1% and for the full year, were up 5%, exceeding our guidance of at least 4% growth. Mass markets, which include small business, grew 3% in the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. FiOS now represents 77% of consumer revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 11.1%, driven by a combination of customer growth, pricing actions and increased FiOS Quantum penetration. At the end of the year, 59% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to the data speeds higher than 50 megabits per second. This is up from 46% at the end of 2013. Throughout the year, we continued to improve the customer value proposition, driving better investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. 
During 2014, we introduced FiOS Quantum TV. Another differentiated offer was our SpeedMatch service, which increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds. In December, we introduced the FiOS Quantum Gateway, our new router that delivers America's fastest WiFi. You will begin to see more marketing of this router and its capability shortly. Looking ahead, our focus will remain on driving higher penetration in existing markets, which in turn will generate profitable growth and further improve our investment returns. 
In broadband, we added 145,000 net FiOS customers in the quarter and 544,000 for the year. We have a total of 6.6 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.1% penetration, which is up 160 basis points for the year. Overall net broadband subscribers increased 59,000 in the quarter and 190,000 for the full year. In FiOS Video, we added 116,000 net customers in the quarter and 387,000 for the year. We have a total of 5.6 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.8% penetration, an increase of 80 basis points in 2014. 
In terms of our network evolution initiative, we converted an additional 52,000 copper customers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to around 255,000. In total, we have converted more than 800,000 customers to fiber since we started this initiative in 2011. Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services, which result in additional recurring revenue. In 2015, we plan to convert another 200,000 copper customers to fiber. 
During 2014, we also continued our consolidation efforts around central offices, which will create additional efficiencies. We have a strong commitment to customer service and have implemented several new frontline tools that are improving efficiency and increasing customer satisfaction. While we benchmark well against the competition, we have more work to do in 2015 to take our performance to the next level. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and the wholesale business. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 4.6%, which included about $30 million of pressure from FX. For the full year, revenue of $13.7 billion was down 3.5%. The overall story is unchanged, as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continued to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Strategic services grew 1.5% in the quarter and 2.3% for the year. This category includes both the IP layer and applications, such as data center, cloud security and managed and professional services. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in application services. 
In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.8% in the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. On the positive side, healthy demand for Ethernet services continues, while revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment were down 1.6% in the quarter and 0.5% for the full year. In terms of profitability, EBITDA increased 4.3% in the quarter and 3% for the full year. The EBITDA margin was 23.9% in the quarter and 23.2% for the year, up 80 basis points from 2013. 
While we are making steady progress in the Wireline business and achieved our goal of expanding margins, we are far from satisfied. There is more work to do to drive sustainable improvements in both revenue growth and profitability. Our path to improve profitable growth includes driving further FiOS penetration and improving operating and capital efficiency. In the enterprise and wholesale business, we are changing our revenue mix towards newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services. On the cost side of the equation, we have realized many noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. We are confident that this continued focus will improve our overall cost structure, ultimately resulting in a much stronger Wireline business. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. Our operating and financial performance in 2014 demonstrated once again that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. 
2014 was a remarkable year from a financial viewpoint. We delivered 18% growth in adjusted earnings per share with very strong cash flows. We executed a strategically important $130 billion transaction through a combination of debt and equity. Our strong cash generation allowed us to invest $17.2 billion in capital, pay $7.8 billion in dividends, make incremental cash interest and tax payments and redeem higher coupon notes in the course of restructuring our debt maturity schedule. In addition, we declared a 3.8% dividend increase and improved our cash position since the closing of the Vodafone transaction. Our customer growth in the fourth quarter, particularly in Wireless, gives us a great confidence heading into 2015. 
In terms of our 2015 outlook, it is difficult to predict the competitive intensity of others, particularly in the Wireless. However, we have faced highly competitive Wireless environments before and have always been able to successfully and profitably grow the business because our customers understand the value of our services. In this environment, we will continue to protect our base by focusing on net adds and upgrades that make financial sense for our business. We will also continue to focus on growing in the right customer segments, while at the same time, creating new revenue streams for the future. Over a sustained period of time, our industry is governed by a free cash flow dynamic. To be successful, companies need to generate free cash flow, which can be invested in their networks to attract and retain customers by providing a quality experience. 
In that context, we are targeting the following for 2015: consolidated revenue growth of at least 4%, sustained profitability with a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin at a level consistent with our full year 2014 performance, strong free cash flow generation with consolidated capital spending of between $17.5 billion and $18 billion, and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $700 million. In terms of income taxes, we realized a cash benefit in 2014 due to the extension of bonus depreciation, which will also have a carryover benefit in 2015. However, with the full year of 100% Wireless net income, we expect total cash income taxes to increase in 2015. We also expect our effective tax rate for book purposes to be in the area of 34% to 36%. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

But I think what you have to focus in on is if you look at the service revenue component, you look at the recurring revenue of FiOS, so if you look at the recurring revenues of this business, 4% plus is an achievable metric. But obviously, equipment revenue will play at factor in that. But keep in mind as we start to go out into the future on the installment sales, the installment sales will really neutralize themselves over a 2-year period of time if you think of it that way. So as we collect more on installment sales, we're putting more on, but the cash flow is starting to catch up with it. So I would keep that on mind. The other thing, too, is from a cash flow perspective, we're looking at alternatives around the receivable as this grows. So you could see us do things around securitization in the future, not that we're announcing anything today, but that is a possibility that we're looking at as we continue to grow that mix on the Edge program."

So look, I think it's important just to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014 around price competition and the intensity of the competition, and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time. So we had top line growt",746,"All right. So look, I think it's important just to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014 around price competition and the intensity of the competition, and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time. So we had top line growth of 5.7%. We expanded the EBITDA by $1 billion in Wireless. We expanded the EBITDA in Wireline of $200 million. We had net phone adds, which seems to be the big issue, of 1.3 million in this competitive environment. And we grew our overall net adds year-over-year by 24%. So I think the basic point here is that we will continue to compete, and we will continue to compete at a positive profitable value. I felt also it's important as we enter into 2015, with the competition, we are also doing a lot of different things. So number one, based on our base, as I said in my comments, we still have 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones that we will pursue to upgrade into our 4G LTE network that is more efficient, generates more revenue. Tablets are only 8% of our base. And as I said in the past, tablets will continue to be a very large piece of our growth into the future. Tablets are very, very good because: one, they make it more sticky at the account level; two, we get a recurring revenue stream, albeit lower than a smartphone, but the subsidy on that is much reduced; and then also it also increases the amount of usage and video uptake on the network, which is what we're driving to, is the more usage to benefit on the bundles. The other thing is as you look out to us and directions we're taking, obviously as we stated, Internet of Things is going to be a very important category, $585 million, up 45% year-over-year. And we don't really disclose it, but we have over 15 million connections now of Internet of Things. We announced the Verizon Vehicle, as I said. You should look at us as launching over-the-top mobile-first sometime this summer, as Lowell has talked about in the past. And on the Wireline side, we just launched a new router, which we think is going to improve both the intake of video into the home, but it's also very important because it has to sustain the ability of Wireless products within that home. And as you know, when you get 4 to 5 devices running on that router today that can only deliver up to 75 megabits, you're really not getting 75 megabits. So this router will be able to produce significant higher throughput, and we believe it's the fastest in the industry today. So putting that all in context from a competitive standpoint and what we can deliver, the guidance we're giving you is based on all the strategic actions that we will be taking in the future. The other 2 things I would talk about is, if you look at our prepaid base, again another positive quarter, up 7.5% on ARPU growth. And then of course, our own reseller base with our own strategic initiatives with that, whether you call it a reseller base or MVNO, is all positive and growing positively. So that leads me into the Google discussion. I guess, what I would say right off the bat, number one, is this is just another very prime example of the intensity and the competition around this industry, the availability of the open networks and access to the networks. And this is why -- another reason of why this industry does not need to be regulated. I would also say on this one is if you look at Google, they've entered the fiber, they've done other initiatives, their whole purpose is to increase speeds so that people can do more search. What I would say is we'll have to wait to see how they execute on the MVNO. But listen, MVNOs or resellers or people leasing the network from carriers has been around for 15 years. It's a complex issue. You have to deal directly with the consumer. There's a whole infrastructure that's needed to do that. So I think this is another example of where Google is going to enter the market under a platform basis to do what they want to do. And it's just another competitor as we look at it, so I'll leave it at that."

So I think this is what we need to look at, as we said in the remarks, and follow the words carefully, is that we will pursue our base, we will pursue net adds and we'll pursue upgrades that are financially beneficial to the company.

So I think this is what we need to look at, as we said in the remarks, and follow the words carefully, is that we will pursue our base, we will pursue net adds and we'll pursue upgrades that are financially beneficial to the company. So what that means is at a 1.14% churn rate, you should take that as we did not go to places where we did not financially want to go to save a customer. And there's going to be certain customers who leave us for price, and we're just not going to compete with that because it doesn't make financial sense for us to do that. As far as why upgrades were so high, I think you have to go back a little bit and reflect on what we did in the past. So if you look at 2013, we made a lot of policy changes around upgrades. It pushed the upgrade view back into '14. So in '14, we took probably more upgrades than we generally would have taken because of those policy changes. But as we came out of the third quarter, I said that we had about 3.2 million iPhones in our base that were coming out of contract. And that was a signal that we were going to aggressively go after those 3.2 million customers, and we did. We are very satisfied with the quality of the upgrades. So if you look at it from that perspective and the remarks I made, look at it on a percentage basis, 78% of our upgrades are what we would call strategic quality upgrades. And that means a 3G to 4G, a basic to 4G or a high value-type customer who delivers a lot of value to us and we appreciate their business and we want to keep them as a customer. So that's how you should view this, John. And I think that with the competition and some of the pricing that's out there, you should think that we're going to have a higher churn rate, because some customers we're just not going to financially keep."

We said that we would have at least a consolidated margin consistent with 2014. But I think you need to put in perspective that we had an extremely heavy fourth quarter in 2014. So I would not expect that to repeat in 2015, given the iconic devices that hit and given the level of competition at this point in time versus what we would expect next year. I think the other important thing, too, is as you're focusing in on this, I think it's important to focus on 2014 earnings per share. So we grew at 18%. I know most of you will subtract out the 10% for the accretion of Vodafone. So when you look at it, the core business in this highly competitive environment grew at 8%. I would also say that don't get ahead of yourselves on the Wireline accretion of margin. As Lowell and I said before, this will be a slow progression of Wireline accretion. So we grew 80 basis points this year, we will continue to focus in on top line growth and continue to take out those costs, continue our copper-to-fiber migration efforts and continue to become more efficient of a company. So I wouldn't read too much into we expect Wireline to jump off the charts and Wireless to go down. On the over-the-top strategy, I guess, I'm not going to disclose as to too much what we're going to do. But I think if you look at the environment, there's a lot of positive things coming out of the environment. So if you look at what DISH has done around some of their recent launches, look at CBS and their own launch of over-the-top with their own programming, this just leads us to a path of content owners are willing to open up their content to different models. And that's exactly what we're going to execute on, and we're working with many content providers to join that model. And we'll have a lot more to say about that, and Marni and, obviously, Lowell will talk more about that when we launch our first product come this summer."

Obviously, you're talking about some potential, I guess, save retention tools on your base, the competitive landscape. Do we still think you can get some modest growth on ARPA in '15? And then secondly, the CapEx level, I think, is a bit above what prior commentary had been. Not dramatically, but I'm trying to get a sense for what that is, whether it's Wireline, Wireless. I know you and I had spoken about densification back in December. I'm assuming it's probably related to that."

So on the VZW margin, the follow-up question on -- around the ARPA, I think this becomes a more tricky question because obviously ARPA is around service. And with the Edge program, we're kind of convoluting that now, that it's a tougher metric to get your hands around, which is why we're giving out the recurring installment billings to try to get it on an apples-to-apples comparison. But if you think about that, we grew that ARPA by 5.2%. So look, I think given everything that's going on and given the fact that I said we would have a top line growth of 4%, obviously we believe that we can continue to accrete the ARPA of this business, given everything I said about the additional growth things that we're keying in on, just the jump-off point that we came into this year. So the other thing, too, is if you go back to 2012, the fourth quarter of '12 was very much like this quarter of '14. We really placed the bet on growth and upgrades and solidifying our base in '12, albeit we added a lot more smartphone net adds back then. But it's pretty much the same quarter that gives us a great basis to jump off into 2015. So that's how I would think about the ARPA metric. On CapEx, Mike, it goes directly to what you said. I've been pretty consistent with this in the fact that we will spend more CapEx in the Wireless side and we will continue to curtail CapEx on the Wireline side. And some of that is because we're getting to the end of our committed build around FiOS, penetration is getting higher, we're reconnecting homes that we've already connected, so it's not additional capital that we have to outlay, and we're very focused on those, what we call, connected homes that are not our customers to go back after them. That is a very good return for us because we already spent the capital to connect that home. So it's a lot of combination around that. But yes, this is around densification, this is around our projection of growth for the Wireless industry and staying ahead of that. So again, it's all about encompassing, so we're looking at a slight increase from where we ended 2014."

Number one is obviously the more and more we convert 3G customers to 4G, that affords us the ability to get on a much more efficient network, it affords us the ability reappropriate our spectrum and it affords us",301,"So just a couple of thoughts around that. Number one is obviously the more and more we convert 3G customers to 4G, that affords us the ability to get on a much more efficient network, it affords us the ability reappropriate our spectrum and it affords us to actually start to run down, if you will, the higher-cost network of 3G. So all of that plays into this. The other thing is that, as we said before, we have a very high cost structure in servicing our customers, and you're going to see some things different of how we approach customers, mainly around getting more around self-serve so that we can do more off the handsets. And we saw over the last 2 years, starting in 2013 into 2014, that this played a big role in how we take cost out of the Wireless cost structure. On the Wireline side, it's just continuing to do more of the same. So we really don't play up the fact of all the copper-to-fiber migration, but this is really starting to pay benefits to us. And as we've said, we've been doing this for the last 3 years. We are now in the position of starting to shut down central offices, which free up real estate for us to monetize and get out of. It reduces the property tax around this. So there's a lot of efficiencies that come from this. The other thing is that within the onetime charges, you probably picked up a severance accrual. And in December, the Wireline company already has reduced about 2,300 headcount, including about 1,300 representative workforce, who took an additional incentive for them to voluntarily retire. So we are setting the company up once again to produce a very beneficial, efficient cost structure going into 2015."

So this is a good question for me to clear this up. So first of all, this is not an issue about Internet rules, it's about an issue of FCC reclassifying broadband to Title II service. And this will absolutely affect us and the industry on long-term investment in our networks. And that can be seen factually as to what happened in the rest of the world, where you have high regulation, the networks are not invested in, they're not good quality-of-service networks. And that's where this will put us. I guess, I would emphasize also that the approach, in whole or in part, on Title II is an extreme and risky path that will jeopardize our investment and the development of innovation in broadband Internet and related services. It will also tie up the industry in a very uncertain time and cause all types of litigation. So when I said before and misquoted on the fact that it would not hurt our investment, I was talking about 2015. But if this piece of Title II was to pass, I can absolutely assure you it would certainly change the way we then view our investment in our networks. The other thing, too, is as I think it's important to show that this industry on a high-level basis has invested about $50 billion a year in networks and improving the quality of service and open network to everyone. And that's what the industry believes is that this is an open Internet basis. If we curtail the investment of this industry, it will definitely trickle down to what we would consider middle-class jobs. And it's because most of, at least for Verizon Wireless, a lot of our builds are done by thousands of contractors across the United States. That will impact those small businesses and impact their employees. So from that perspective, I guess, what we would say, Kevin, is we would encourage Congress to adopt a legislative solution. Congress has the authority to adopt clear rules of the road that will allow policymakers in the industry to move on to more important things. So I think that summarizes the position about Title II."

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. 
The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran goes through our results, I would like to highlight a few items related to our earnings. GAAP reported earnings were $1.02 per share, and there were no special items of a nonoperational nature. This compares with adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 21.4%. As a reminder, the adjusted EPS of $0.84 last year did not reflect 100% ownership of Wireless for the full quarter since the Vodafone transaction closed on February 21, 2014. As we indicated a year ago, on a non-GAAP illustrated basis, adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $0.91 per share if we assume 100% Wireless ownership with the full quarter. On this more comparable basis, growth in the first quarter earnings per share was 12.1%. 
I would also like to make a few points about our Wireline segment reporting. Our Wireline results include the operations we are selling the Frontier until the transaction closes, which is targeted for the first half of 2016. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities associated with those operations as being held for sale. This is important because accounting rules require that depreciation expense not be recorded on assets held for sale. Therefore, Wireline depreciation expense will be lower in 2015 due to the classification of these assets. The first quarter included $146 million pretax benefit, which equates to roughly $0.02 per share. Going forward until closing, the full quarter benefit will be approximately $200 million pretax or $0.03 per share. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015, with an eventful few first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth.",2974,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015, with an eventful few first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth. We delivered very strong financial and operating results in the first quarter with strong cash generation. 
To review our active start to the year, we were successful in the AWS-3 Spectrum option, improving our mid-band spectrum position while maintaining sound financial discipline. As we stated on our conference call in mid-February, we are very pleased with the licenses we won and are confident that they will enable us to execute efficiently on our network strategy of adding capacity through a combination of spectrum deployment and small cell technology. Our early experiences with small cell deployment have been very favorable, and we believe that the industry is making good progress on standards for utilizing unlicensed spectrum with LTE, which is already being tested in our vendor labs. 
We also executed several value-creating transaction that underline our commitment to extend our industry leadership in the markets we serve by being strategically focused and returning value to shareholders. We successfully monetized our tower portfolio in a $5 billion transaction with American Tower, which closed at the end of the first quarter. We signed a definitive agreement to sell our wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California to Frontier for $10.5 billion, and we implemented a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an immediate reduction of about 86 million shares in mid-February. Final settlement of this transaction, including delivery of the remaining shares that we expect to receive, is scheduled to occur in the second quarter. Collectively, these transactions provide immediate value for shareholders. 
Now let's move on to our primary focus, which is executing our day-to-day strategy for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our first quarter results reflect strong top and bottom line performance. We posted solid revenue growth, high quality earnings growth of 12% and generated substantial free cash flow. In Wireless, we had a solid quarter of quality connections growth and profitability. We had 565,000 retail postpaid net adds in a seasonably low-volume quarter. Total Wireless revenue grew 6.9%, and EBITDA was up 6.6%. As expected, our Wireless EBITDA margin returned to more historical levels. In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 4%, and we continued to increase our FiOS penetration with quality customer growth. Total Wireline revenue was impacted by foreign exchange pressure, but our continued focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in EBITDA margin expansion. 
Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue grew 3.8% in the first quarter, continuing our consistent top line growth trend. If we excluded the first quarter 2014 revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.2%. Our consolidated revenue growth continues to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. In the first quarter, these revenues totaled approximately $150 million, an increase of 25%. We continue to build upon our Internet of Things and video platforms. In particular, innovation within the transportation industry presents a great opportunity for us. Through Verizon telematics, we are already providing a platform of manufacturer, aftermarket and fleet services through 2-way broadband connectivity to vehicle. Additionally, we will be launching Verizon Vehicle, our direct-to-consumer aftermarket product, which modernizes traditional roadside assistance and enhances driver safety and convenience. 
In terms of video, we are on track to launch our mobile-first OTT video product this summer, and we have already announced some initial content partners. We are excited about these new growth opportunities, which you will hear more about during the year. In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on process and operating efficiencies and improving our cost structure. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion in the quarter, up 5.8%, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points on an adjusted basis to 37.4%. As Mike indicated, we reported $1.02 in earnings per share in the quarter for a comparable growth rate of about 12%. So we are off to a strong start from an earnings perspective. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Consistent with capital allocation model we have been executing the last several years, our priorities are to invest in our networks through capital spending and spectrum acquisitions, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our strong cash flows enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and delever the balance sheet. The monetization of our tower portfolio enable us to execute the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. In the first quarter, cash flows from operations totaled $10.2 billion. This included approximately $2.4 billion related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. The remaining portion of the $5 billion of cash proceeds is reflected in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement. We also securitized a portion of our Wireless equipment installment receivables and received $1.3 billion in cash proceeds during the quarter. Free cash flow, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled about $4.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in the quarter. Although spending was slightly lower in the first quarter, we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. 
In Wireless, we continue investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. In the first quarter, Wireless CapEx totaled $2.4 billion. As we have previously stated, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS Spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology and building solutions and distributed antenna systems. We are also beginning to re-farm our 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G EV-DO to 4G LTE in select markets. Despite what others claim about certain network metrics, we are consistently acknowledged as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent performance and continue to be the largest and most reliable 4G LTE network in the nation. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Our financial deleveraging plan had always assumed the purchase of new spectrum. In the first quarter, we paid the remaining balance of $9.5 billion for the AWS-3 licenses we won in the auction. During the past 6 months, we've been very active in the debt capital markets, managing our maturities and taking advantage of the interest rate environment. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of gross debt, net debt of $109 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x. We are on track with the plans to delever and remain committed to returning through our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's move into our review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless strategy is to provide the best customer experience while continuing to invest in our network to stay ahead of accelerating demand and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues were $22.3 billion in the first quarter, up 6.9%. Total service revenue, up $17.9 billion, declined 0.4%. Keep in mind that lower service revenue from Edge customers have shifted to equipment revenue. Service revenue, plus Edge installment billings, were up 3.1%. During the quarter, customer demand for our Edge equipment installment plan continue to increase. The percentage of phone activations on the Edge program was about 39% compared with about 25% in the fourth quarter. We expect the percentage of phone activations on Edge to increase in the second quarter, as we are currently running near 50%. Edge phone activations totaled 3.4 million in the quarter, and we now have an Edge phone base of 10 million, representing 11.7% of our postpaid phone base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 55.8%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. As customer acceptance of equipment installment plans evolves and the percentage of Edge adoption increases, equipment revenue is increasing. Therefore, you should look at EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue rather than Wireless service revenue. On this basis, our EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 44.8% in the quarter, which was similar to a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 108.6 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection space grew 5.5% to 102.6 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.9 million. As expected, first quarter seasonality resulted in lower volume. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, up 2.3% compared to a year ago. A majority of the gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. Retail postpaid churn improved both sequentially and year-over-year coming in at 1.03% for the quarter. We are maintaining a disciplined approach with a focus on retaining high-value customers. We are seeing good results with our postpaid smartphone churn, less than 0.9%, as compared to our basic phone churn at more than 1.2% in the quarter. Our retail postpaid net additions of 565,000 were up 4.8%. The quality of the net adds was very good. We added 621,000 new 4G smartphones, and total net smartphone adds were 247,000 in the quarter. We also added 820,000 new 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds were a negative 138,000, as the smartphone adds were more than offset by a net decline of 385,000 basic phones. Additionally, net prepaid devices declined by 188,000 in the quarter. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 10.3 million in the quarter, up 4.4%. About 84% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 68.7 million smartphones in total, about 85% of which were 4G. Our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 80% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 70% of our retail postpaid connections base. About 86% of total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continue to drive increased data and video usage. Within More Everything accounts, average data usage continues to rise, up 54% year-over-year. This is beneficial to us because increasing consumption of content will ultimately drive higher revenue with a lower cost to serve due to the efficiency of our LTE network. In terms of our upgrade rate, about 6.5% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter. This represents a sharp sequential decline in the percentage of customers upgrading, which was expected due to seasonality and the extraordinary volumes we experienced in the fourth quarter. We continue to have an opportunity to upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly 17 million basic phones and about 11 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base. We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets. We ended the quarter with about 8.8 million tablets in our postpaid connection space, so overall penetration is still under 10%. Tablets provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our Consumer and Mass Markets revenue a performance on Slide 9. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the first quarter, consumer revenues were up 4%, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of 4%-or-better growth. Mass Markets, which include small business, grew 2.9%. FiOS now represents 78% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8%, driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and some pricing actions. Our FiOS Quantum broadband service is scaling well and has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 62% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to a data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75-megabit speed tier where just over 20% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In broadband, we added 133,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.5% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 41,000 in the quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 90,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.7 million FiOS Video subscribers, which represents 36% penetration. One of the ways we strive to improve the customer value proposition is by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. Last year, we introduced Quantum TV, SpeedMatch and our Quantum Gateway router. As part of the evolution of customer choice for the video consumption, we just introduced FiOS Custom TV within the last few days. The custom TV option is a creative approach to the changing landscape, allowing customers to better choose the type of content they want to watch. Customers will get a base package of preselected and local broadcast channels and choose at least 2 channel packs out of 7. This new option, coupled with our traditional programming packages, provides more choice, more control and more value in an easy self-serve manner. In terms of our ongoing network evolution initiative, we converted about 47,000 copper customers in the quarter. For the year, we plan to convert a total of 200,000 copper customers to fiber. We are also in the process of decommissioning 10 central offices. Post-conversion, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. These conversions also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services from us. Our focus in 2015 will be to continue adding quality customers, driving higher penetration in existing markets and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are highly competitive markets, and we will be disciplined and rational in our approach to customer acquisition. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline would have been more in line with trends we experienced in the second half of 2014. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications and services. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 3.7% in the first quarter. Healthy demand for Ethernet services continues, but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. We also had a favorable contract settlement, which improved revenue this quarter and which will not reoccur. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2%, which included the FX pressure. In terms of profitability, the EBITDA margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. 
Our path to a stronger and more profitable Wireline business includes driving further FiOS penetration and continued improvements in operating and capital efficiency. On the enterprise business side, we are changing the revenue mix to higher growth areas like cloud, security and professional services. In terms of our cost structure, we are realizing a number of noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. However, we are far from satisfied and will continue working to improve our overall cost structure. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. We're off to a strong start to 2015. From a strategic standpoint, we were successful in the spectrum auction, executed the tower portfolio monetization and signed a definitive agreement to sell certain wireline properties. At the same time, we returned value to shareholders with an accelerated share repurchase program. We also delivered strong operating and financial performance with 12% growth in earnings per share on an adjusted basis. Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are on a strong market position, with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are on track to achieve our targets of at least 4% consolidated revenue growth, sustained profitability and capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015. Consolidated EBITDA grew by 5.8%, and our EBITDA margin expanded to 37.4%. In addition to our ability to deliver strong financial metrics, we are very focused on developing new products and services in the Internet of Things and video. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. 
Our deleveraging plans are on track, and we remain committed to getting back to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions."

And with the establish in the [indiscernible] organization around new products and services, this is where we get into the Internet of Things and over-the-top video. She runs Verizon Digital Media Services and some of the other incubation companies we have. So the focus is running the day-to-day operations out of John's organization and streamlining, implementing Verizon Lean Six Sigma and driving those cost benefits and efficiencies that we're looking for. With Marnie's organization, it's creating the new products and services that we can launch to grow the future of the business. And then with Roger and the consolidation of the network and the IT organization, it just makes sense as we move into more software-developed network areas and more of the network is riffing out of data centers, it makes sense that Roger would take over the entire thing from an efficiency and consistency of management perspective. So I think what you're seeing here is more well organized within the company, more cohesiveness and more direct relationship between growing revenue and cost reduction."

If you look at Wireline alone, Wireline is down over 5,400 people from the beginning of last year, so continuing to streamline that business and become more efficient.

Yes, so look, I think if you look at the service revenue in ARPA, it all goes to the same issue, which is as we start to elevate Edge and we start to increase the take rate of Edge and customers move, you're shifting revenue out of service and into equipment. So you're going to continue to see a decline in service revenue. You're going to continue to see a decline in ARPA. But I think what I would center around is what we said in the script, which was the crew overall revenue by 6.9%. And also, if you look at the EBITDA margin, which kind of normalizes out the Edge impact, I mean not 100% of it, but if you look at $1 of revenue and $1 of cost, there were 0 margin. So if you look at total revenue, 44.8% versus last year of 44.9%, so it's a very consistent profitability measure. The other thing, too, is if you look at the Edge benefits, you're getting the benefits from both lower commissions, and so forth, so that is also impacting the SG&A line because your indirects before if you think about how that worked, we were refunding the indirect through our commission payment for the subsidy of the handset. That all goes away. So you are going to see a decline in the commission expense line, which is impacting the SG&A line. But overall, if you look at the profitability of Wireless, and I think this is important, if you look at the service margin of 55.8%, if you were to normalize out Edge, the Wireless service margin would still have been in over 50%. So the profitability of Wireless continues to be extremely strong. And again, I would go back to what Simon brought up, I would not discount all of the cost reductions and efficiencies that we're creating in the environment."

I think that obviously, as Edge continues to escalate, you're going to get some benefit there. We highlighted the depreciation benefit. But I think as far as Wireless goes, I think we need to be careful here a little bit because January normally is a slow promotional, slow seasonal quarter. As you go into the second quarter and you enter into Mother's Day and Father's Day, I would expect that the promotional activity and competitiveness is going to heat up here, so that will offset some of the benefits that you're going to see. So look, I think that service revenue and ARPA will continue to decline as the Edge rate takes up, but it's really about the overall revenue growth and profitability of the business, and we feel good about that."

So on the accounts receivable, I'm not going to get too much detail on this on this call, but if you look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter, with the securitization that we did, it's relatively flat. On early migration on Edge customers, obviously, we have an Edge up feature, but you must pay 75% of the phone off. So if you decide to pay 75% of your balance off, you can upgrade at any point in time you want and we do have customers who are taking back and edging up. But there is no ""early migration"" other than what's instituted in the price plans. On the Wireline strategy, look, I mean, if you look at the 3 properties that we announced the cell, Florida, Texas and California, there were more or less islands to us. They were some of the first properties we built out with FiOS. They're heavily penetrated properties, but the majority of those properties are still copper. And as we look at that strategically, when we laid this out, it just made sense based on the offer that Frontier have in front of us to actually sell those properties. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than the fact that they were not project properties because they were islands. But if you look at the rest of our Wireline footprint from D.C. all the way up through Boston, it's very contiguous. It's highly populated. We have almost 20 million homes passed now with FiOS. So it's extremely viable for us to continue to penetrate these properties. And if you look at the penetration rates, New York is still the lowest-penetrated market that we have and still has the highest growth opportunity that we have. So we're holding onto some of the markets that we believe are contiguous. You'll see more and more with Wireless and Wireline combined under John's leadership. So there's more that we can do strategically with the footprint that we have, and again, it's just made financial sense to return that back to our shareholder and bring that cash into delever the balance sheet. So that's really all there is to it, Michael."

I guess couple of things here. So we still have 17 million basic and 11 million 3G phones. And coming out of the fourth quarter, you heard me say that we were going to protect our base, and that was a key ingredient going in to the first quarter. And I think with the churn rate you've seen, if you look at the basic phone losses on a year-over-year basis, we actually improved that by over 400,000. So last year, we had almost double the number of basic phone loss customers than we did this year. And as you noted, we came out with some strong promotional pricing that was targeted towards the basic phones customer and the 3G customer. Now having said all that, look, the environment is, is that there -- if you look at prepaid on a standalone basis, our prepaid retail pricing is slightly at a premium to some of the other competitors' postpaid pricing. So we're in a competitive pricing standpoint. And as I said, coming out the fourth quarter, we will not -- we have to be rational and we will not chase every customer, but we're making every effort to maintain our base and keep our customers and upgrade them into a price plan that's fitting for them. And we made improvement in that, but I will tell you, we still have some more improvement to do. But we're not satisfied with any losses, but then again, we will not chase every add either based on just cheap price. So I think that's the balanced equation that we showed in the first quarter."

We have a very strong quality base, but there are certain segment of our customers, as I just discussed, around basic we're we're trying to bring them up into a price plan that's meaningful for them. But if you look at, again, if you look at the lay of the land around price plans, as I said, our prepaid pricing is a little bit of a premium versus some of the other postpaid pricing in the marketplace. And as you saw this quarter, we lost 188,000 prepaid retail customers. I can't answer specifically where they went, but I would say that they probably made the choice to go to a price -- postpaid price plan because it's actually slightly lower on some competitors than it is with us on prepaid. So I can't factually state that, but I think that's some of the migration. But also, I would also say that on the reseller side, which we don't talk much about, we had a very strong growth through our TracFone relationship, over 400-and-some thousand net adds this quarter. So it could have been a migration from retail to wholesale, but I do think there is a migration from the prepaid base into some other postpaid basis. And I think others will have to talk to that, but we're not seeing a lot of that within our base."

Now you're actually putting up a receivable that has dollar for dollar loss if the customer does not pay. And again, we're very comfortable with the credit models we use.

Obviously, we've done this because of consumer benefit, give the consumer a better choice. So let's see what happens here as we go and then we can address that later. On EBITDA margins, look, I'm kind of reiterating our guidance that we came out of the fourth quarter from an outlook perspective. And I think that you have to be cognizant of the fact that this is the first quarter of the year. If you look at last year's trending, as we said, coming out of the Vodafone transaction, our earnings profile would be more consistent across the quarters. We wouldn't be as bumpy as we have been in the past. I think that you have to look at the whole thing in retrospect. And also, the other thing is that I would not give workers an under serviced margin side, and as I said, I really prefer us to look at the total margin total revenue and the EBITDA margin. And if you saw the EBITDA margin was very, very strong for Wireless this quarter. And that kind of normalizes out a little bit of what the Edge take rate is. And then again, I also can speak to what we're in for a competitive standpoint on additional pricing moves through the year. So I'm kind of reserving on that side of the equation as well from an outlook perspective. So on outlook and profitability, I would say reiterating what we said in the fourth quarter and more consistent earnings profile moving forward. So I think that's where we'll leave it."

And if you look at it, 86% of the usages on the LTE network. And if you look at More Everything accounts, they're up 54% in consumption year-over-year. So obviously, consumers are willing to consume the content on their Wireless devices, which is why we were so optimistic around Internet of Things and, of course, over-the-top mobile-first. Now as you start to look at the densification and the efficiency of the network, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're already starting to reform the 1900 PCF licenses in certain markets, and we still have a long way to go there. Also, we are looking at, as I said, the LTE unlicensed, which is a really good fit with the license LTE piece, which will give us a lot more download capability and a managed network comparability. So there's a lot that we can still do around our spectrum and efficiency. And obviously, with the LTE network, as you have seen, with 86% of that traffic running on it, with the 54% overall year-over-year increase, the cost structure of the business really has not changed because the ability to deliver this on a very cost-efficient network is there. So I would just continue to say that as we continue to grow on the consumption model, what we did in the AWS spectrum in buying the licenses and our plan to build out intensify, I think we're in a very good financial position to execute on that in a very financially disciplined manner and continue to generate the returns that are expected of us."

So I would not read into the custom TV package as a precursor to the over-the-top video. It's not. These are 2 very distinct ecosystems. As far as the monetization model, when you think about the monetization, there's many different avenues we can do on this. There could be premium subscriptions. They could be pay per views using the multi-cast technology. There can be advertising models so that the consumer does not pay for the content consumption or as others would call sponsored data.

And then all of a sudden, the usage track started up again and revenue took a turn, and I think that's the piece that we are in with right now with the data world.

The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran goes through our results, I would like to highlight a few items related to our earnings. GAAP reported earnings were $1.02 per share, and there were no special items of a nonoperational nature. This compares with adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 21.4%. As a reminder, the adjusted EPS of $0.84 last year did not reflect 100% ownership of Wireless for the full quarter since the Vodafone transaction closed on February 21, 2014. As we indicated a year ago, on a non-GAAP illustrated basis, adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $0.91 per share if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the full quarter. On this more comparable basis, growth in the first quarter earnings per share was 12.1%. 
I would also like to make a few points about our Wireline segment reporting. Our Wireline results include the operations we are selling to Frontier until the transaction closes, which is targeted for the first half of 2016. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities associated with those operations as being held for sale. This is important because accounting rules require that depreciation expense not be recorded on assets held for sale. Therefore, Wireline depreciation expense will be lower in 2015 due to the classification of these assets. The first quarter included a $146 million pretax benefit, which equates to roughly $0.02 per share. Going forward until closing, the full quarter benefit will be approximately $200 million pretax or $0.03 per share. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015 with an eventful first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth. We d",2968,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015 with an eventful first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth. We delivered very strong financial and operating results in the first quarter with strong cash generation. 
To review our active start to the year, we were successful in the AWS-3 spectrum auction, improving our mid-band spectrum position while maintaining sound financial discipline. As we stated on our conference call in mid-February, we are very pleased with the licenses we won and are confident that they will enable us to execute efficiently on our network strategy of adding capacity through a combination of spectrum deployment and small cell technology. Our early experiences with small cell deployment have been very favorable, and we believe that the industry is making good progress on standards for utilizing unlicensed spectrum with LTE, which is already being tested in our vendor labs. 
We also executed several value-creating transaction that underline our commitment to extend our industry leadership in the markets we serve by being strategically focused and returning value to shareholders. We successfully monetized our tower portfolio in a $5 billion transaction with American Tower, which closed at the end of the first quarter. We signed a definitive agreement to sell our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California to Frontier for $10.5 billion, and we implemented a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an immediate reduction of about 86 million shares in mid-February. Final settlement of this transaction, including delivery of the remaining shares that we expect to receive, is scheduled to occur in the second quarter. Collectively, these transactions provide immediate value for shareholders. 
Now let's move on to our primary focus, which is executing our day-to-day strategy for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our first quarter results reflect strong top and bottom line performance. We posted solid revenue growth, high-quality earnings growth of 12% and generated substantial free cash flow. In Wireless, we had a solid quarter of quality connections growth and profitability. We had 565,000 retail postpaid net adds in a seasonably low-volume quarter. Total Wireless revenue grew 6.9% and EBITDA was up 6.6%. As expected, our Wireless EBITDA margin returned to more historical levels. In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 4%, and we continued to increase our FiOS penetration with quality customer growth. Total Wireline revenue was impacted by foreign exchange pressure, but our continued focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in EBITDA margin expansion. 
Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue grew 3.8% in the first quarter, continuing our consistent top line growth trend. If we excluded the first quarter 2014 revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.2%. 
Our consolidated revenue growth continues to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. In the first quarter, these revenues totaled approximately $150 million, an increase of 25%. 
We continue to build upon our Internet of Things and video platforms. In particular, innovation within the transportation industry presents a great opportunity for us. Through Verizon telematics, we are already providing a platform of manufacturer, aftermarket and fleet services through 2-way broadband connectivity to vehicle. Additionally, we will be launching Verizon Vehicle, our direct-to-consumer aftermarket product, which modernizes traditional roadside assistance and enhances driver safety and convenience. 
In terms of video, we are on track to launch our mobile-first OTT video product this summer, and we have already announced some initial content partners. We are excited about these new growth opportunities, which you will hear more about during the year. 
In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on process and operating efficiencies and improving our cost structure. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion in the quarter, up 5.8%, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points on an adjusted basis to 37.4%. As Mike indicated, we reported $1.02 in earnings per share in the quarter for a comparable growth rate of about 12%. So we are off to a strong start from an earnings perspective. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Consistent with capital allocation model we have been executing the last several years, our priorities are to invest in our networks through capital spending and spectrum acquisitions, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our strong cash flows enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and delever the balance sheet. The monetization of our tower portfolio enable us to execute the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. 
In the first quarter, cash flows from operations totaled $10.2 billion. This included approximately $2.4 billion related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. The remaining portion of the $5 billion of cash proceeds is reflected in the Financing Activities section of the cash flow statement. We also securitized a portion of our wireless equipment installment receivables and received $1.3 billion in cash proceeds during the quarter. Free cash flow, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled about $4.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in the quarter. Although spending was slightly lower in the first quarter, we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. 
In Wireless, we continue investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. In the first quarter, Wireless CapEx totaled $2.4 billion. As we have previously stated, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. We are also beginning to re-farm our 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G EV-DO to 4G LTE in select markets. 
Despite what others claim about certain network metrics, we are consistently acknowledged as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent performance, and continue to be the largest and most reliable 4G LTE network in the nation. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Our financial deleveraging plan had always assumed the purchase of new spectrum. In the first quarter, we paid the remaining balance of $9.5 billion for the AWS-3 licenses we won in the auction. During the past 6 months, we have been very active in the debt capital markets, managing our maturities and taking advantage of the interest rate environment. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of gross debt, net debt of $109 billion and a ratio of net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x. We are on track with the plans to delever and remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's move into our review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our wireless strategy is to provide the best customer experience while continuing to invest in our network to stay ahead of accelerating demand and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues were $22.3 billion in the first quarter, up 6.9%. Total service revenue, up $17.9 billion, declined 0.4%. Keep in mind that lower service revenue from Edge customers have shifted to equipment revenue. Service revenue plus Edge installment billings were up 3.1%. 
During the quarter, customer demand for our Edge equipment installment plan continued to increase. The percentage of phone activations on the Edge program was about 39% compared with about 25% in the fourth quarter. We expect the percentage of phone activations on Edge to increase in the second quarter as we are currently running near 50%. Edge phone activations totaled 3.4 million in the quarter, and we now have an Edge phone base of 10 million, representing 11.7% of our postpaid phone base. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $10 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 55.8%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. As customer acceptance of equipment installment plans evolves and the percentage of Edge adoption increases, equipment revenue is increasing. Therefore, you should look at EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue rather than Wireless service revenue. On this basis, our EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 44.8% in the quarter, which was similar to a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 108.6 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to 102.6 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.9 million. As expected, first quarter seasonality resulted in lower volume. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, up 2.3% compared to a year ago. A majority of the gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. 
Retail postpaid churn improved both sequentially and year-over-year, coming in at 1.03% for the quarter. We are maintaining a disciplined approach with a focus on retaining high-value customers. We are seeing good results with our postpaid smartphone churn, less than 0.9% as compared to our basic phone churn at more than 1.2% in the quarter. Our retail postpaid net additions of 565,000 were up 4.8%. The quality of the net adds was very good. We added 621,000 new 4G smartphones, and total net smartphone adds were 247,000 in the quarter. We also added 820,000 new 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds were a negative 138,000 as the smartphone adds were more than offset by a net decline of 385,000 basic phones. Additionally, net prepaid devices declined by 188,000 in the quarter. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 10.3 million in the quarter, up 4.4%. About 84% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 68.7 million smartphones in total, about 85% of which were 4G. Our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 80% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 70% of our retail postpaid connections base. 
About 86% of total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continued to drive increased data and video usage. Within More Everything accounts, average data usage continues to rise, up 54% year-over-year. This is beneficial to us because increasing consumption of content will ultimately drive higher revenue with a lower cost to serve due to the efficiency of our LTE network. 
In terms of our upgrade rate, about 6.5% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter. This represents a sharp sequential decline in the percentage of customers upgrading, which was expected due to seasonality and the extraordinary volumes we experienced in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to have an opportunity to upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly 17 million basic phones and about 11 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base. 
We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets. We ended the quarter with about 8.8 million tablets in our postpaid connection base, so overall penetration is still under 10%. Tablets provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the first quarter, consumer revenues were up 4%, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of 4%-or-better growth. Mass markets, which include small business, grew 2.9%. 
FiOS now represents 78% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8%, driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and some pricing actions. Our FiOS Quantum broadband service is scaling well and has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 62% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to a data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75-megabit speed tier where just over 20% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. 
We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In broadband, we added 133,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.5% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 41,000 in the quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 90,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.7 million FiOS Video subscribers, which represents 36% penetration. One of the ways we strive to improve the customer value proposition is by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. Last year, we introduced Quantum TV, SpeedMatch and our Quantum Gateway router. As part of the evolution of customer choice for video consumption, we just introduced FiOS custom TV within [ph] the last few days. The custom TV option is a creative approach to the changing landscape, allowing customers to better choose the type of content they want to watch. Customers will get a base package of preselected and local broadcast channels and choose at least 2 channel packs out of 7. This new option, coupled with our traditional programming packages, provides more choice, more control and more value in an easy self-serve manner. In terms of our ongoing network evolution initiative, we converted about 47,000 copper customers in the quarter. For the year, we plan to convert a total of 200,000 copper customers to fiber. We are also in the process of decommissioning 10 central offices. Post-conversion, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. These conversions also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services from us. 
Our focus in 2015 will be to continue adding quality customers, driving higher penetration in existing markets and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are highly competitive markets, and we will be disciplined and rational in our approach to customer acquisition. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline would have been more in line with trends we experienced in the second half of 2014. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continued to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications and services. 
In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 3.7% in the first quarter. Healthy demand for Ethernet services continues, but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. We also had a favorable contract settlement, which improved revenue this quarter and which will not reoccur. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2%, which included the FX pressure. In terms of profitability, the EBITDA margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. 
Our path to a stronger and more profitable Wireline business includes driving further FiOS penetration and continued improvements in operating and capital efficiency. On the enterprise business side, we are changing the revenue mix to higher-growth areas like cloud, security and professional services. In terms of our cost structure, we are realizing a number of noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. However, we are far from satisfied and will continue working to improve our overall cost structure. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. We're off to a strong start to 2015. From a strategic standpoint, we were successful in the spectrum auction, executed the tower portfolio monetization and signed a definitive agreement to sell certain wireline properties. At the same time, we returned value to shareholders with an accelerated share repurchase program. We also delivered strong operating and financial performance with 12% growth in earnings per share on an adjusted basis. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are on track to achieve our targets of at least 4% consolidated revenue growth, sustained profitability and capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015. Consolidated EBITDA grew by 5.8%, and our EBITDA margin expanded to 37.4%. 
In addition to our ability to deliver strong financial metrics, we are very focused on developing new products and services in the Internet of Things and video. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. 
Our deleveraging plans are on track, and we remain committed to getting back to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions."

So as we have moved into our next phase as Lowell has consolidated the operational performance under John, this gives us a better breadth of consolidation, if you will, post the Vodafone acquisition. And if you go back to when we did the acquisition, we stated that there were some internal walls that could be broken down and we could become more efficient. And with the establishing of Marni Walden's organization around new products and services, this is where we get into the Internet of Things and over-the-top video. She runs Verizon Digital Media Services and some of the other incubation companies we have. So the focus is running the day-to-day operations out of John's organization and streamlining, implementing Verizon Lean Six Sigma and driving those cost benefits and efficiencies that we're looking for. With Marni's organization, it's creating the new products and services that we can launch to grow the future of the business. And then with Roger and the consolidation of the network and the IT organization, it just makes sense. As we move into more software-developed network areas and more of the network is driven out of data centers, it makes sense that Roger would take over the entire thing from an efficiency and consistency of management perspective. So I think what you're seeing here is more well organized within the company, more cohesiveness and a more direct relationship between growing revenue and cost reduction."

And as far as cost reductions, you've seen some of the measures we took at the end of the fourth quarter. If you look at Wireline alone, Wireline is down over 5,400 people from beginning of last year, so continuing to streamline that business and become more efficient. And for Wireless, as John has taken over, we're starting to see some streamlining around customer service and some of the other things that we've talked about in the past.

So look, I mean, I think that if you look at the service revenue and ARPA, it all goes to the same issue, which is as we start to elevate Edge and we start to increase the take rate of Edge and customers move, you're shifting revenue out of service and into equipment. So you're going to continue to see a decline in service revenue. You're going to continue to see a decline in ARPA. But I think what I would center around is what we said in the script, which was we grew overall revenue by 6.9%. And also, if you look at the EBITDA margin, which kind of normalizes out the Edge impact, I mean, not 100% of it, but if you look at $1 of revenue and $1 of cost, there was 0 margin. So if you look at total revenue, 44.8% versus last year of 44.9%, so it's a very consistent profitability measure. The other thing, too, is, if you look at the Edge benefits, you're getting the benefits from both lower commissions and so forth. So that is also impacting the SG&A line because your indirects before, if you think about how that worked, we were refunding the indirect through a commission payment for the subsidy of the handset. That all goes away. So you are going to see a decline in the commission expense line, which is impacting the SG&A line. But overall, if you look at the profitability of Wireless, and I think this is important, if you look at the service margin of 55.8%, if you were to normalize out Edge, the Wireless service margin would still have been over 50%. So the profitability of Wireless continues to be extremely strong. And again, I would go back to what Simon brought up. I would not discount all of the cost reductions and efficiencies that we're creating in the environment."

I think that obviously, as Edge continues to escalate, you're going to get some benefit there. We highlighted the depreciation benefit. But I think as far as Wireless goes, I think we need to be careful here a little bit because January normally is a slow promotional, slow seasonal quarter. As you go into the second quarter and you enter into Mother's Day and Father's Day, I would expect that the promotional activity in competitives [ph] is going to heat up here. So that will offset some of the benefits that you're going to see. So look, I think that service revenue and ARPA will continue to decline as the Edge rate takes up. But it's really about overall revenue growth and the profitability of the business, and we feel good about that."

So the store channel by far is very heavily weighted towards Edge. Indirect is starting to come up as time goes. But also, keep in mind the business channel and our enterprise channel are not really taking the Edge product. So if you're asking me we'll get to 100%, the answer is no. I can't tell you exactly what that percent will be, but we do see that the second quarter, we will probably be in the neighborhood of a 50% take rate."

So on the accounts receivable, I'm not going to get too much detail here on this call. But if you look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter, with the securitization that we did, it's relatively flat. On early migration on Edge customers, obviously we have an edge up feature, but you must pay 75% of the phone off. So if you decide to pay 75% of your balance off, you can upgrade at any point in time you want, and we do have customers who are taking that and edging up. But there is no ""early migration"" other than what's in -- instituted in the price plan. On the Wireline strategy, look, I mean, if you looked at the 3 properties that we announced to sell, Florida, Texas and California, they were more or less islands to us. They were some of the first properties we built out with FiOS. They're heavily penetrated properties, but the majority of those properties are still copper. And as we looked at that strategically, when we laid this out, it just made sense, based on the offer that Frontier had in front of us, to actually sell those properties. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than the fact that they were not strategic properties because they were islands. But if you look at the rest of our Wireline footprint from D.C. all the way up through Boston, it's very contiguous. It's highly populated. We have almost 20 million homes passed now with FiOS. So it's extremely viable for us to continue to penetrate these properties. And if you look at the penetration rates, New York is still the lowest-penetrated market that we have and still has the highest growth opportunity that we have. So we're holding on to some of the markets that we believe are contiguous. You'll see more and more with Wireless and Wireline combined under John's leadership. So there's more that we can do strategically with the footprint that we have. And again, it just made financial sense to return that back to our shareholders and bring that cash in to delever the balance sheet. So that's really there all is to it, Michael."

Well, I guess a couple of things here. So we still have 17 million basic and 11 million 3G phones. And coming out of the fourth quarter, you heard me say that we were going to protect our base, and that was a key ingredient going into the first quarter. And I think with the churn rate you've seen, if you look at the basic phone losses on a year-over-year basis, we actually improved that by over 400,000. So last year, we had almost double the number of basic phone lost customers than we did this year. And as you noticed, we came out with some strong promotional pricing that was targeted towards the basic phone customer and the 3G customer. Now having said all that, look, the environment is, is that there -- if you look at prepaid on a stand-alone basis, our prepaid retail pricing is slightly at a premium to some of the other competitors' postpaid pricing. So we're in a competitive pricing standpoint. And as I said, coming out of the fourth quarter, we will not -- we have to be rational and we will not chase every customer, but we're making every effort to maintain our base and keep our customers and upgrade them into a price plan that's fitting for them. And we made improvement in that, but I will tell you we still have some more improvement to do. But we're not satisfied with any losses, but then again, we will not chase every add either based on just cheap price. So I think that's the balanced equation that we showed in the first quarter."

But there are -- a certain segment of our customers, as I just discussed, around basic where we're trying to bring them up into a price plan that's meaningful for them. But if you look at -- again, if you look at the lay of the land around price trends, our -- as I said, our prepaid pricing is a little bit of a premium to some other postpaid pricing in the marketplace. And as you saw this quarter, we lost 188,000 prepaid retail customers. I can't answer specifically where they went, but I would say that they probably made a choice to go to a price -- a postpaid price plan because it's actually slightly lower on some competitors than it is with us on prepaid. So I can't factually state that, but I think that's some of the migration. But also, I would also say that on the reseller side, which we don't talk much about, we had a very strong growth through our TracFone relationship, over 400-and-some thousand net adds this quarter. So it could have been a migration from retail to wholesale, but I do think there is a migration from the prepaid base into some other postpaid bases. And I think others will have to talk to that, but we're not seeing a lot of that within our base."

On the EBITDA margins, look, I mean, I'm kind of reiterating our guidance that we came out of the fourth quarter from an outlook perspective. And I think that you have to be cognizant of the fact that this is the first quarter of the year. If you look at last year's trending, as we said, coming out of the Vodafone transaction, our earnings profile would be more consistent across the quarters. We wouldn't be as bumpy as we had been in the past. I think that you have to look at the whole thing in retrospect. And also, the other thing is, is that I would not get focused in on the service margin side. And as I said, I'd really prefer us to look at the total revenue and the EBITDA margin. And if you saw, the EBITDA margin was very, very strong for Wireless this quarter. And that kind of normalizes out a little bit of what the Edge take rate is. And then again, I also can speak to what we're in for from a competitive standpoint on additional pricing moves through the year. So I'm kind of reserving on that side of the equation as well from an outlook perspective.

So obviously, consumers are willing to consume the content on their wireless devices, which is why we were so optimistic around Internet of Things and, of course, over-the-top mobile. Now as you start to look at the densification and the efficiency of the network, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're already starting to reform the 1900 PCS licenses in certain markets, and we still have a long way to go there. Also, we are looking at, as I said, the LTE unlicensed, which is a really good fit with the licensed LTE piece, which will give us a lot more download capability and a managed network comparability. So there's a lot that we can still do around our spectrum and efficiency. And obviously, with the LTE network, as you have seen, with 86% of that traffic running on it with a 54% overall year-over-year increase, the cost structure of the business really has not changed because the ability to deliver this on a very cost-efficient network is there. So I would just continue to say that as we continue to grow on the consumption model, what we did in the AWS spectrum in buying the licenses and our plan to build out and densify, I think we're in a very good financial position to execute on that in a very financially disciplined manner and continue to generate the returns that are expected of us."

Obviously, we're in a period of time where we see this service pricing dilution because of the installment sale, and I think that will continue. And of course, we're increasing bundle, so more data for the same price. But this is no different than what we saw in the voice world way back where we had a price and then all of a sudden everybody started seeing dilution on the minute -- per minute price because more minutes were being given away in the bundle. And we saw a little bit of access accretion but overall pricing was coming down. And then all of a sudden, the usage tracks started up again and revenue took a turn, and I think that's the piece that we're in with -- right now with the data world. But the key to this is, is to develop these other ecosystems to create more monetization around customer usage, whether that's premium subscription, pay per view or advertising models.

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. 
The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran goes through our results, I would like to highlight a few items related to our earnings. GAAP reported earnings were $1.02 per share, and there were no special items of a nonoperational nature. This compares with adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 21.4%. As a reminder, the adjusted EPS of $0.84 last year did not reflect 100% ownership of Wireless for the full quarter since the Vodafone transaction closed on February 21, 2014. As we indicated a year ago, on a non-GAAP illustrated basis, adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $0.91 per share if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the full quarter. On this more comparable basis, growth in the first quarter earnings per share was 12.1%. 
I would also like to make a few points about our Wireline segment reporting. Our Wireline results include the operations we are selling to Frontier until the transaction closes, which is targeted for the first half of 2016. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities associated with those operations as being held for sale. This is important because accounting rules require that depreciation expense not be recorded on assets held for sale. Therefore, Wireline depreciation expense will be lower in 2015 due to the classification of these assets. The first quarter included a $146 million pretax benefit, which equates to roughly $0.02 per share. Going forward until closing, the full quarter benefit will be approximately $200 million pretax or $0.03 per share. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015 with an eventful first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth. We d",2967,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015 with an eventful first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth. We delivered very strong financial and operating results in the first quarter with strong cash generation. 
To review our active start to the year, we were successful in the AWS-3 spectrum auction, improving our mid-band spectrum position while maintaining sound financial discipline. As we stated on our conference call in mid-February, we are very pleased with the licenses we won and are confident that they will enable us to execute efficiently on our network strategy of adding capacity through a combination of spectrum deployment and small cell technology. Our early experiences with small cell deployment have been very favorable, and we believe that the industry is making good progress on standards for utilizing unlicensed spectrum with LTE, which is already being tested in our vendor labs. 
We also executed several value-creating transaction that underline our commitment to extend our industry leadership in the markets we serve by being strategically focused and returning value to shareholders. We successfully monetized our tower portfolio in a $5 billion transaction with American Tower, which closed at the end of the first quarter. We signed a definitive agreement to sell our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California to Frontier for $10.5 billion, and we implemented a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an immediate reduction of about 86 million shares in mid-February. Final settlement of this transaction, including delivery of the remaining shares that we expect to receive, is scheduled to occur in the second quarter. Collectively, these transactions provide immediate value for shareholders. 
Now let's move on to our primary focus, which is executing our day-to-day strategy for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our first quarter results reflect strong top and bottom line performance. We posted solid revenue growth, high-quality earnings growth of 12% and generated substantial free cash flow. In Wireless, we had a solid quarter of quality connections growth and profitability. We had 565,000 retail postpaid net adds in a seasonably low-volume quarter. Total Wireless revenue grew 6.9% and EBITDA was up 6.6%. As expected, our Wireless EBITDA margin returned to more historical levels. In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 4%, and we continued to increase our FiOS penetration with quality customer growth. Total Wireline revenue was impacted by foreign exchange pressure, but our continued focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in EBITDA margin expansion. 
Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue grew 3.8% in the first quarter, continuing our consistent top line growth trend. If we excluded the first quarter 2014 revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.2%. 
Our consolidated revenue growth continues to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. In the first quarter, these revenues totaled approximately $150 million, an increase of 25%. 
We continue to build upon our Internet of Things and video platforms. In particular, innovation within the transportation industry presents a great opportunity for us. Through Verizon telematics, we are already providing a platform of manufacturer, aftermarket and fleet services through 2-way broadband connectivity to vehicle. Additionally, we will be launching Verizon Vehicle, our direct-to-consumer aftermarket product, which modernizes traditional roadside assistance and enhances driver safety and convenience. 
In terms of video, we are on track to launch our mobile-first OTT video product this summer, and we have already announced some initial content partners. We are excited about these new growth opportunities, which you will hear more about during the year. 
In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on process and operating efficiencies and improving our cost structure. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion in the quarter, up 5.8%, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points on an adjusted basis to 37.4%. As Mike indicated, we reported $1.02 in earnings per share in the quarter for a comparable growth rate of about 12%. So we are off to a strong start from an earnings perspective. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Consistent with capital allocation model we have been executing the last several years, our priorities are to invest in our networks through capital spending and spectrum acquisitions, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our strong cash flows enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and delever the balance sheet. The monetization of our tower portfolio enables us to execute the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. 
In the first quarter, cash flows from operations totaled $10.2 billion. This included approximately $2.4 billion related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. The remaining portion of the $5 billion of cash proceeds is reflected in the Financing Activities section of the cash flow statement. We also securitized a portion of our wireless equipment installment receivables and received $1.3 billion in cash proceeds during the quarter. Free cash flow, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled about $4.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in the quarter. Although spending was slightly lower in the first quarter, we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. 
In Wireless, we continue investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. In the first quarter, Wireless CapEx totaled $2.4 billion. As we have previously stated, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. We are also beginning to re-farm our 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G EV-DO to 4G LTE in select markets. 
Despite what others claim about certain network metrics, we are consistently acknowledged as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. We lead in what matters most to customers: coverage and consistent performance, and continue to be the largest and most reliable 4G LTE network in the nation. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Our financial deleveraging plan had always assumed the purchase of new spectrum. In the first quarter, we paid the remaining balance of $9.5 billion for the AWS-3 licenses we won in the auction. During the past 6 months, we have been very active in the debt capital markets, managing our maturities and taking advantage of the interest rate environment. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of gross debt, net debt of $109 billion and a ratio of net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x. We are on track with the plans to delever and remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's move into our review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our wireless strategy is to provide the best customer experience while continuing to invest in our network to stay ahead of accelerating demand and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues were $22.3 billion in the first quarter, up 6.9%. Total service revenue, up $17.9 billion, declined 0.4%. Keep in mind that lower service revenue from Edge customers have shifted to equipment revenue. Service revenue plus Edge installment billings were up 3.1%. 
During the quarter, customer demand for our Edge equipment installment plan continued to increase. The percentage of phone activations on the Edge program was about 39% compared with about 25% in the fourth quarter. We expect the percentage of phone activations on Edge to increase in the second quarter as we are currently running near 50%. Edge phone activations totaled 3.4 million in the quarter, and we now have an Edge phone base of 10 million, representing 11.7% of our postpaid phone base. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $10 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 55.8%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. As customer acceptance of equipment installment plans evolves and the percentage of Edge adoption increases, equipment revenue is increasing. Therefore, you should look at EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue rather than Wireless service revenue. On this basis, our EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 44.8% in the quarter, which was similar to a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 108.6 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to 102.6 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.9 million. As expected, first quarter seasonality resulted in lower volume. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, up 2.3% compared to a year ago. A majority of the gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. 
Retail postpaid churn improved both sequentially and year-over-year, coming in at 1.03% for the quarter. We are maintaining a disciplined approach with a focus on retaining high-value customers. We are seeing good results with our postpaid smartphone churn, less than 0.9% as compared to our basic phone churn at more than 1.2% in the quarter. Our retail postpaid net additions of 565,000 were up 4.8%. The quality of the net adds was very good. We added 621,000 new 4G smartphones, and total net smartphone adds were 247,000 in the quarter. We also added 820,000 new 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds were a negative 138,000 as the smartphone adds were more than offset by a net decline of 385,000 basic phones. Additionally, net prepaid devices declined by 188,000 in the quarter. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 10.3 million in the quarter, up 4.4%. About 84% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 68.7 million smartphones in total, about 85% of which were 4G. Our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 80% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 70% of our retail postpaid connections base. 
About 86% of total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continued to drive increased data and video usage. Within More Everything accounts, average data usage continues to rise, up 54% year-over-year. This is beneficial to us because increasing consumption of content will ultimately drive higher revenue with a lower cost to serve due to the efficiency of our LTE network. 
In terms of our upgrade rate, about 6.5% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter. This represents a sharp sequential decline in the percentage of customers upgrading, which was expected due to seasonality and the extraordinary volumes we experienced in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to have an opportunity to upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly 17 million basic phones and about 11 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base. 
We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets. We ended the quarter with about 8.8 million tablets in our postpaid connection base, so overall penetration is still under 10%. Tablets provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the first quarter, consumer revenues were up 4%, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of 4%-or-better growth. Mass markets, which include small business, grew 2.9%. 
FiOS now represents 78% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8%, driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and some pricing actions. Our FiOS Quantum broadband service is scaling well and has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 62% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to a data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75-megabit speed tier where just over 20% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. 
We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In broadband, we added 133,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.5% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 41,000 in the quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 90,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.7 million FiOS Video subscribers, which represents 36% penetration. One of the ways we strive to improve the customer value proposition is by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. Last year, we introduced Quantum TV, SpeedMatch and our Quantum Gateway router. 
As part of the evolution of customer choice for video consumption, we just introduced FiOS Custom TV within the last few days. The Custom TV option is a creative approach to the changing landscape, allowing customers to better choose the type of content they want to watch. Customers will get a base package of preselected and local broadcast channels and choose at least 2 channel packs out of 7. This new option, coupled with our traditional programming packages, provides more choice, more control and more value in an easy self-serve manner. 
In terms of our ongoing network evolution initiative, we converted about 47,000 copper customers in the quarter. For the year, we plan to convert a total of 200,000 copper customers to fiber. We are also in the process of decommissioning 10 central offices. Post-conversion, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. These conversions also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services from us. 
Our focus in 2015 will be to continue adding quality customers, driving higher penetration in existing markets and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are highly competitive markets, and we will be disciplined and rational in our approach to customer acquisition. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline would have been more in line with trends we experienced in the second half of 2014. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continued to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications and services. 
In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 3.7% in the first quarter. Healthy demand for Ethernet services continues, but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. We also had a favorable contract settlement, which improved revenue this quarter and which will not reoccur. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2%, which included the FX pressure. In terms of profitability, the EBITDA margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. 
Our path to a stronger and more profitable Wireline business includes driving further FiOS penetration and continued improvements in operating and capital efficiency. On the enterprise business side, we are changing the revenue mix to higher-growth areas like cloud, security and professional services. In terms of our cost structure, we are realizing a number of noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. However, we are far from satisfied and will continue working to improve our overall cost structure. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. We're off to a strong start to 2015. From a strategic standpoint, we were successful in the spectrum auction, executed the tower portfolio monetization and signed a definitive agreement to sell certain wireline properties. At the same time, we returned value to shareholders with an accelerated share repurchase program. We also delivered strong operating and financial performance with 12% growth in earnings per share on an adjusted basis. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are on track to achieve our targets of at least 4% consolidated revenue growth, sustained profitability and capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015. Consolidated EBITDA grew by 5.8%, and our EBITDA margin expanded to 37.4%. 
In addition to our ability to deliver strong financial metrics, we are very focused on developing new products and services in the Internet of Things and video. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. 
Our deleveraging plans are on track, and we remain committed to getting back to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions."

So as we have moved into our next phase as Lowell has consolidated the operational performance under John, this gives us a better breadth of consolidation, if you will, post the Vodafone acquisition. And if you go back to when we did the acquisition, we stated that there were some internal walls that could be broken down and we could become more efficient. And with the establishing of Marni Walden's organization around new products and services, this is where we get into the Internet of Things and over-the-top video. She runs Verizon Digital Media Services and some of the other incubation [ph] companies we have. So the focus is running the day-to-day operations out of John's organization and streamlining, implementing Verizon Lean Six Sigma and driving those cost benefits and efficiencies that we're looking for. With Marni's organization, it's creating the new products and services that we can launch to grow the future of the business. And then with Roger and the consolidation of the network and the IT organization, it just makes sense. As we move into more software-developed network areas and more of the network is driven out of data centers, it makes sense that Roger would take over the entire thing from an efficiency and consistency of management perspective.

So look, I mean, I think that if you look at the service revenue and ARPA, it all goes to the same issue, which is as we start to elevate Edge and we start to increase the take rate of Edge and customers move, you're shifting revenue out of service and into equipment. So you're going to continue to see a decline in service revenue. You're going to continue to see a decline in ARPA. But I think what I would center around is what we said in the script, which was we grew overall revenue by 6.9%. And also, if you look at the EBITDA margin, which kind of normalizes out the Edge impact, I mean, not 100% of it, but if you look at $1 of revenue and $1 of cost, there was 0 margin. So if you look at total revenue, 44.8% versus last year of 44.9%, so it's a very consistent profitability measure. The other thing, too, is, if you look at the Edge benefits, you're getting the benefits from both lower commissions and so forth. So that is also impacting the SG&A line because your indirects before, if you think about how that worked, we were refunding the indirect through a commission payment for the subsidy of the handset. That all goes away. So you are going to see a decline in the commission expense line, which is impacting the SG&A line. But overall, if you look at the profitability of Wireless, and I think this is important, if you look at the service margin of 55.8%, if you were to normalize out Edge, the Wireless service margin would still have been over 50%. So the profitability of Wireless continues to be extremely strong. And again, I would go back to what Simon brought up. I would not discount all of the cost reductions and efficiencies that we're creating in the environment."

I think that obviously, as Edge continues to escalate, you're going to get some benefit there. We highlighted the depreciation benefit. But I think as far as Wireless goes, I think we need to be careful here a little bit because January normally is a slow promotional, slow seasonal quarter. As you go into the second quarter and you enter into Mother's Day and Father's Day, I would expect that the promotional activity in competitives is going to heat up here. So that will offset some of the benefits that you're going to see. So look, I think that service revenue and ARPA will continue to decline as the Edge rate takes up. But it's really about overall revenue growth and the profitability of the business, and we feel good about that."

So on the accounts receivable, I'm not going to give too much detail here on this call. But if you look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter, with the securitization that we did, it's relatively flat. On early migration on Edge customers, obviously we have an edge up feature, but you must pay 75% of the phone off. So if you decide to pay 75% of your balance off, you can upgrade at any point in time you want, and we do have customers who are taking that and edging up. But there is no ""early migration"" other than what's in -- instituted in the price plan. On the Wireline strategy, look, I mean, if you looked at the 3 properties that we announced to sell, Florida, Texas and California, they were more or less islands to us. They were some of the first properties we built out with FiOS. They're heavily penetrated properties, but the majority of those properties are still copper. And as we looked at that strategically, when we laid this out, it just made sense, based on the offer that Frontier had in front of us, to actually sell those properties. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than the fact that they were not strategic properties because they were islands. But if you look at the rest of our Wireline footprint from D.C. all the way up through Boston, it's very contiguous. It's highly populated. We have almost 20 million homes passed now with FiOS. So it's extremely viable for us to continue to penetrate these properties. And if you look at the penetration rates, New York is still the lowest-penetrated market that we have and still has the highest growth opportunity that we have. So we're holding on to some of the markets that we believe are contiguous. You'll see more and more with Wireless and Wireline combined under John's leadership. So there's more that we can do strategically with the footprint that we have. And again, it just made financial sense to return that back to our shareholders and bring that cash in to delever the balance sheet. So that's really there all is to it, Michael."

And coming out of the fourth quarter, you heard me say that we were going to protect our base, and that was a key ingredient going into the first quarter. And I think with the churn rate you've seen, if you look at the basic phone losses on a year-over-year basis, we actually improved that by over 400,000. So last year, we had almost double the number of basic phone lost customers than we did this year. And as you noticed, we came out with some strong promotional pricing that was targeted towards the basic phone customer and the 3G customer. Now having said all that, look, the environment is, is that there -- if you look at prepaid just on a stand-alone basis, our prepaid retail pricing is slightly at a premium to some of the other competitors' postpaid pricing. So we're in a competitive pricing standpoint. And as I said, coming out of the fourth quarter, we will not -- we have to be rational and we will not chase every customer, but we're making every effort to maintain our base and keep our customers and upgrade them into a price plan that's fitting for them. And we made improvement in that, but I will tell you we still have some more improvement to do. But we're not satisfied with any losses, but then again, we will not chase every add either based on just cheap price. So I think that's the balanced equation that we showed in the first quarter."

But if you look at -- again, if you look at the lay of the land around price trends, our -- as I said, our prepaid pricing is a little bit of a premium to some other postpaid pricing in the marketplace. And as you saw this quarter, we lost 188,000 prepaid retail customers. I can't answer specifically where they went, but I would say that they probably made a choice to go to a price -- a postpaid price plan because it's actually slightly lower on some competitors than it is with us on prepaid. So I can't factually state that, but I think that's some of the migration. But also, I would also say that on the reseller side, which we don't talk much about, we had a very strong growth through our TracFone relationship, over 400-and-some thousand net adds this quarter. So it could have been a migration from retail to wholesale, but I do think there is a migration from the prepaid base into some other postpaid bases.

And I think that you have to be cognizant of the fact that this is the first quarter of the year. If you look at last year's trending, as we said, coming out of the Vodafone transaction, our earnings profile would be more consistent across the quarters. We wouldn't be as bumpy as we had been in the past. I think that you have to look at the whole thing in retrospect. And also, the other thing is, is that I would not get focused in on the service margin side. And as I said, I'd really prefer us to look at the total revenue and the EBITDA margin.

So obviously, consumers are willing to consume the content on their wireless devices, which is why we were so optimistic around Internet of Things and, of course, over-the-top mobile. Now as you start to look at the densification and the efficiency of the network, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're already starting to reform the 1900 PCS licenses in certain markets, and we still have a long way to go there. Also, we are looking at, as I said, the LTE unlicensed, which is a really good fit with the licensed LTE piece, which will give us a lot more download capability and a managed network comparability. So there's a lot that we can still do around our spectrum and efficiency. And obviously, with the LTE network, as you have seen, with 86% of that traffic running on it with a 54% overall year-over-year increase, the cost structure of the business really has not changed because the ability to deliver this on a very cost-efficient network is there. So I would just continue to say that as we continue to grow on the consumption model, what we did in the AWS spectrum in buying the licenses and our plan to build out and densify, I think we're in a very good financial position to execute on that in a very financially disciplined manner and continue to generate the returns that are expected of us."

So I think that's still a little bit ways out before we can make that decision.

We know what the [ph] viewership is. And this is appealing to mobile content, and let's not confuse that with linear TV content. So I would not read into the Custom TV package as a precursor to the over-the-top video. It's not. These are 2 very distinct ecosystems. As far as the monetization model, when you think about the monetization, there's many different avenues we can do on this. There could be premium subscriptions. There could be pay per views using the multicast technology. There can be advertising models so that the consumer does not pay for the content consumption or, as others would call, sponsored data. So I think there's a lot of models that we can use. And I hate to say this, but let's wait until Marni and team are ready to make the big splash here this summer and then we can have more discussion around what it means."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted, as sequential. 
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. GAAP reported earnings for the quarter were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the second quarter of last year. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of this year. The second quarter of last year include a $0.10 per share from the gain on the sale of spectrum. So on an adjusted basis, EPS growth was 14.3%. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter, excluding this prior year gain, was 6%. Through the first half of the year, earnings totaled $2.06 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would have been about $0.07 higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. 
On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate for the first half of this year was 12.6%. 
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting Wireless equipment revenue and Wireless cost of equipment in our consolidated statements of income. In our Wireless segment, we are reporting the cost of equipment and the cost of service, which were previously combined as cost to service and sales. 
Prior period detail at both the consolidated and Wireless segment level is included in the financial and operating information schedules on our website. 
I would also remind you that our Wireline results include the operations that we agreed to sell to Frontier. This will be the case until the transaction closes, which is on track for the first half of 2016. 
As we pointed out last quarter, the assets and liabilities associated with these operations have been classified in the balance sheet as held for sale. And as such, we're no longer recording depreciation expense. 
For the full year, we continue to estimate the earnings benefit to be about $0.12 to $0.13 per share. The acquisition of AOL, which we announced in mid-May, closed on June 23. Our balance sheet at June 30 includes the AOL assets and liabilities. Our income statement for the second quarter does not reflect any results of AOL operations for the last 7 days of the month due to immateriality. The AOL results of operations will be fully included in the third quarter. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to compete effectively and execute our strategy, which is focused on providing consistent network reliability and a great customer experience. 
Once again, we delivered strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provides the foundation for innovative products and services for future profitable growth. We are committed to building the business for the future through a disciplined capital allocation model that we outlined almost 2 years ago and continue to execute. 
Through the first half of this year, we have invested approximately $18 billion in spectrum licenses and capital for future network capacity. We also invested more than $4 billion to acquire new capabilities with the AOL transaction, which supports our long-term video strategy. 
In addition, we returned more than $9 billion shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program was completed in early June, resulting in an overall reduction of 101.6 million shares. 
We facilitated these initiatives, while keeping our leverage ratio essentially unchanged and remaining on track with our deleverage plan. 
On the execution front, we had a strong quarter of quality connections growth and profitability in Wireless. We had more than 1.1 million retail postpaid net adds, which included 321,000 net phone additions. 
We also had very strong customer retention with postpaid churn of 0.90%, down 4 basis points year-over-year. This was our lowest churn rate in 3 years. 
Total Wireless revenue grew 5.3% and EBITDA increased by 9.1%. Our EBITDA margin on both service and total Wireless revenue expanded on a year-over-year basis. 
Our Wireline results were once again highlighted by growth in the consumer market where revenues were up over 4%. Our segment EBITDA margin expanded modestly on a sequential and year-over-year basis. 
Now let's get into our second quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue was $32.2 billion in the quarter, and if we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold last year, the compatible growth rate would have been 2.8%. 
Consolidated topline revenue growth continue to be driven by Wireless and FiOS usage. We believe that future revenue growth will come from video and the Internet of Things at both the network and platform layers. 
Over the past several years, we have been investing in these platforms and positioning ourselves to capitalize on these new sources of growth. 
In terms of video, we will introduce our mobile-first OTT video product in late summer. As you know, we have already announced some initial content partners. 
Our acquisition of AOL further enhances our video strategy through its digital media and advertising platform capabilities. A portfolio of content brands with a domestic average of about 190 million unique visitors per month, and its loyal email subscription customer base. 
We are excited to have a very talented people of AOL on the Verizon team and look forward to their contributions to our success. 
As far as Internet of Things, we think that the transportation, health care and energy industries, in particular, present great opportunities for us  and we are very active fostering innovation in these areas. 
We are very well positioned to capitalize on these new growth opportunities, and we will continue to develop business models to monetize usage on our network and at the platform level. 
Within our current results, new revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. These revenues totaled approximately $165 million in the quarter and about $320 million year-to-date. 
We continue to be focused on reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies, while improving the overall customer experience. 
Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.8 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis and our EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points to 36.6%. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. As highlighted a few minutes ago, our capital allocation model is disciplined and consistent. The priorities are to invest necessary capital in our networks to stay ahead of demand, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. The cash flows we generate enables us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and deleverage to further strengthen the balance sheet. 
In the second quarter, cash flows from operations were $8.7 billion. Through the first half, cash flow from operations totaled $18.9 billion, but included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. 
We also continued to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $1.2 billion in cash proceeds in the second quarter. 
Free cash flow for the first half of the year, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $8.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $8.2 billion for the first half of the year. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of gross debt, net debt of $110.7 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x. 
As I said earlier, our deleveraging plans remain on track. 
Now let's move into our review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. 
As I said earlier, total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.3% in the quarter to $22.6 billion. Service revenue of $17.7 billion declined 2.2%, while equipment revenue increased to $3.9 billion, up nearly 62%. 
Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3%. For customers who select device installment plans, lower service pricing is exchanged for higher device payments. Equipment revenue, which is largely recognized upfront, is much higher than in the subsidy model. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more customers choose unsubsidized devices and equipment revenues will continue to increase with installment plan adoption. 
Customer demand for device installment plans has increased. The percentage of phone activations on installments grew to 49% in the quarter compared with 39% in the first quarter and only 18% a year ago. 
Phone activations on device installment plans totaled 4.7 million in the quarter, and we now have more than 14 million customers on these plans, representing roughly 16% of our postpaid phone based. 
Looking ahead, we believe that the percentage of phone activations on installments will continue to increase, and will likely be around 60% in the third quarter. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.1%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.1%, up 580 basis points. The EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue expanded to 43.9% in the quarter, up from 42.3% a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 109.5 million total retail connections. This does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.2% to 103.7 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.8 million. 
Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 3.9 million or down year-over-year due primarily to lower tablet volumes. 
As I highlighted earlier, we had a very strong customer retention in the quarter, with postpaid churn improving both sequentially and year-over-year to 0.90%. 
One of our priority this year was to improve customer retention, and we are doing so with a disciplined approach, focusing on high-value customers. 
Our retail postpaid net additions of more than 1.1 million were nearly twice the net additions in the first quarter. The quality of the net adds remained very strong with 842,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter. Postpaid phone additions totaled 321,000 as net phone ads of 588,000 were partially offset by a net decline of 266,000 basic phones. 
Tablet net adds totaled 852,000 in the quarter and net prepay devices declined by 126,000. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 2%, about 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 70.1 million smartphones in total and our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 81% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 73% of our retail postpaid connections base. 
As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage. Approximately 87% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network and overall traffic on LTE has essentially doubled in the past year. About 7.2% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. The quality of our phone based continues to improve as we add new 4G customers and upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices as part of our retention efforts. 
In the past year, our 4G smartphone connections have increased by 17.8 million or about 40% to 61.6 million. We still have a sizable opportunity remaining with roughly 16 million basic phones and about 9 million 3G smartphones in our postpaid connections space. 
We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets as they provide good value through increased data consumption and lower churn rate at the account level. We ended the quarter with 9.6 million tablets in our postpaid connection space. So overall penetration is still under 10%. 
In terms of capital spending, we continue investing for the capacity to further optimize our 4G LTE network and position the network for the future. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter and $5.5 billion for the first half of the year, about 4% higher on a year-to-date basis. National studies consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance. 
Currently, our 700 AWS-1 spectrum brands, which represents approximately 40% of our licensed spectrum portfolio are utilized in our LTE network. We are just beginning to reform 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G to 4G LTE in select markets, representing the next phase of spectrum to be deployed to serve our growing LTE usage. 
Our network densification plans, which includes small cells, DAS nodes and in-building solutions are on schedule. In New York City, we are well into our deployment and continue to scale and develop a healthy pipeline. Downtown Chicago is another large urban markets with small cell densification plans well underway. Consistent with what we outlined on our post-auction conference call. 
Let's move next our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9. 
In the Consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of our positive revenue trends, resulting in revenue growth of 4.5%. Mass markets, which includes small business, grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 79% of consumer revenue. 
In the second quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8%, driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and higher pay-per-view sales due to the price fight in early May. 
Our FiOS Quantum broadband service continues to scale, and with a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 64% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speeds here, where 23% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. 
In broadband, we added 72,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.8 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.4% penetration. 
Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 25,000 in the quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 26,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS Video subscribers, which represents 35.7% penetration. 
We have strong customer interest in our custom TV offering. More than 1/3 of our FiOS Video gross adds this quarter opted for a custom TV package, and we also saw migration demand from existing customers. We will continue to work with content providers on this new product, which so far is ahead of our expectations. 
While adoption of custom TV may initially have a negative impact on revenue growth, it should improve profitability. 
In the second quarter, we experienced a slowing of FiOS customer growth, which we attribute to triple play offer changes at the time of increased competitive intensity. We have since made some adjustments and our exit rate sales volumes have shown improvement. 
We are focused on the continued evolution of our Wireline network. In the second quarter, we converted 51,000 copper customers, bringing our first half total to 98,000. As I have previously noted, post-conversion, we experienced significant improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. 
Our agreement with Frontier for the sale of Wireline assets in the non-contiguous states of Florida, Texas and California, is also part of our network evolution, as it will enable us to better focus on our efforts in a highly dense markets in the Northeast. We are working closely with Frontier to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and assure a seamless transition. We are making progress and remain on track to close the transaction in the first half of 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. 
In the second quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6.4%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline was similar to the first quarter. 
Declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by the competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications. 
In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.5% in the second quarter, which was better than expected due to some nonrecurring items. We expect continued price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges to pressure wholesale revenues, which we expect a decline in the 5% to 6% range for the full year. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.2%, which included some FX pressure. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, up 10 basis points. We are very committed to reducing our cost structure, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The Wireline headcount was down 10% year-over-year, and we continue to strive for gains in operational efficiency. 
As I've said, we are far from satisfied, and we will continue to work on our cost structure. 
Capital spending in the Wireline for the first half of the year totaled $2.2 billion, down 19%. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. We've had a good first half of 2015, delivering strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. As always, we continue to invest in our networks and platforms to position us for future growth. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our acquisition of AOL will be a key piece in our over-the-top mobile video strategy, accelerating our capabilities in digital media and advertising. 
We are confident in our ability to sustain profitability. Consolidated EBITDA for the first half of the year was up nearly 6% on an adjusted basis and our EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 37%. 
In terms of consolidated revenue outlook, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be higher than this quarter. For the full year, our consolidated revenue guidance is for growth of at least 3%. These growth estimates exclude revenue from AOL, which will become part of our results in the third quarter. We continue to target overall capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

There's the impact of EIP, there's the impact of mix change, but I think the markets are also trying to seize those and figure out what the net movement is in terms of people pricing themselves up in the buckets and generating more ARPU versus some of the gift bags and the competitive pressure we're seeing inside the system at Verizon. If you could give us more color on kind of how the net is moving on pricing inside the base, that would be helpful."

And I think if you look at the results of the first quarter and the second quarter, the churn sp",748,"Sure. Good. Thanks, David. So first on the revenue guidance. so look, I mean, coming into this year, we set a priority that we said we would protect our base. And I think if you look at the results of the first quarter and the second quarter, the churn speaks for itself with 4 basis points improvement from the first quarter year-over-year and then the second quarter year-over-year with a 0.90% being the lowest churn rate in the last 3 years that we posted up. In addition, some of the other changes in the assumption fact is that take rate of Edge. I would tell you, we never anticipated that Edge would accelerate as much as it has and looking forward, in the 3Q being at 60%, that's much higher than we had anticipated, but the market has moved us there. And quite honestly, it's getting more and more confusing at the frontline. So this really translates into simplicity for our customers in choosing the Edge plan, and that's where the market has gone. So that's where we need to compete. And then finally, from an upgrade perspective, going back to protection of our base, we're up 800,000 upgrades year-over-year, so more people are selecting the new price plans when they get a new handset, and that's puts us on the Edge, which, obviously, generates more equipment revenue and puts pressure on the service revenue. And coming into this year, we knew this service revenue would dilute. We're seeing more dilution than we anticipated because more customers are selecting that Edge plan. But I think just a couple of things to keep in check here because when you 0 in on one metric, you're walking away with the wrong impression as to what's happening in the overall P&L. So first off, we generated growth and revenue of 5.3% in Wireless this quarter. So if you look at the first half of the year, that's $2.5 billion of revenue growth just in the first half. You annualized that, that's growth that's bigger than some Fortune 500 companies generate in the full year of revenue. So this is still a very healthy business, and it goes to what the overall industry is as well. So there's a lot going on in the industry that generate more usage in the future. So if you look at the IARPA, which is the installment plus the revenue per account, we're up 2.3%. So if you just focus in on the service revenue, of course that's going to dilute year-over-year, but I think you have to step up and look at the overall financials of Verizon Wireless. In addition, if you look at the connections, we're up 4.3% year-over-year in connections, and we're also up in accounts. So when you look out to the future, you're adding accounts, you're adding devices, that's also going to be more usage on the network. And obviously, the whole future of the industry is based on generating more usage on the network so that people want to use more, and we know from a fact that more people are consuming more video on wireless today than they were a year ago. So that's all part of the strategy. You look at tablets, we're still less than 10% of the base in penetration of tablets, that's still another growth area for us. Then you look at Internet of Things. Internet of Things is still in early stages for the entire industry. There's more and more devices coming out that's going to generate revenue into the future. And then, of course, if you just look at Verizon, we have the whole AOL and OTT launch, which I'm sure we'll get to. We just launched custom TV and Wireline, and that in itself will also put pressure on the topline. So if you think about the custom TV package, customers are now only paying for what they want to view, and we're only paying the content providers for what our customers want to view. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a decrease in revenue, but you're also seeing a decrease in content cost that actually improves the profitability. So again, I think if you step back, and you look at the entire portfolio of what's going on, I think you walk away with a very different conclusion that if you just look at the ARPU because we know that ARPU is going to get condensed with the new EIP plan."

So on productivity and cost, look, I mean, we've been active now for 3 years in our VLSS program, Verizon Lean Six Sigma Program continues to generate savings. I mean, if you just look at Wireline year-over-year down almost 8,000 employees from a year-over-year basis, we're still generating the great customer service and the volumes that we have there. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're getting both in the network efficiency side, reduction of overtime and of course, as the industry matures now, you're looking at a lot of houses that already have ONT on the side of the house, so it's less labor because you're just activating the house that now doesn't really need much of a truck roll to go to, so there's a lot of efficiency there. In the Wireless side, a lot of concentration around self-serve and customer service centers. And then we go the structure around the wireless units. So we're still on that whole productivity cost routine, and we still believe that we have a very full runway in front of us and you're  going to continue to see us take cost out of the structure. If you just look at year-over-year on cash cost to loan, if you look at our revenue growth versus cash cost, we're really maintain cash cost at a very slow incremental increase. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're driving through all of our initiatives. On the Frontier side, we still have -- we're expecting to close this transaction tour was the end of the first quarter, so we still have about 8 to 9 months of planning activity. We're well on our way. And I think what we've done in the past speaks for itself as to how we'll we address in the future and obviously I'll talk more about this as we get closer, but we're still designing those plans. Obviously, you know Dan Mead is leading that team and he's very diligent on what he's doing to prepare us for the separation of that unit and getting our cost within alignment to offset the stranded cost perspective. On the union side of the house, just as we know, there are in total 27 collective bargaining agreements covering about 38,000 people in 9 Eastern states. We began formal negotiations on June 22 and to jump start the negotiations, the company put forth a comprehensive offer on the table, which include a wage increases and changes to current contracts to help us manage our cost and increase our flexibility to better serve our customers. Simply stated, we will need to monetize at our legacy contracts to better position us to complete in the digital age. Given the level of change we're seeking with respect to benefit cost management as well as work rules, our expectation that the negotiation process will take some time. As you know, it is not unusual for negotiations to continue well beyond the expiration date of the contract, which is August 1. We intend to work through the process until we achieve a new agreement that addresses the needs of our business and preserves the high quality of our jobs for our employees. So I think, David, as far as that goes, that's probably all I'm going to say around the union negotiations, it's early on and we still have a lot of work to do."

So on custom TV, I mean, obviously, we know we were paving the path to a new venture here to give customers what they wanted. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on any litigation matters currently, in the fact with Disney and ESPN. As everyone knows that we're being sued on the contractual arrangement there, so I'm really not going to talk about that. But look, I mean, we continue to have a great partnership with Disney and ESPN, and we will continue to work through that disagreement in our business relationships. And I will tell you, if you just look at the over-the-top products, I mean, ESPN is participating with colleges sports in that product, so we will continue to work with ESPN and the lawsuit will take its own course of action. And again, we believe we're in our contractual rights to offer what we're offering. From a customer selection perspective, I will tell you, this is certainly exceeded our expectations. As we saw through the quarter once we launch this, we saw the uptake rate increase, as I said, in my prepared remarks over 1/3 of the customers now coming in select a custom TV package. I would tell you that as far as the number of genres that they take, it's less than what we anticipated, but they are selecting based on their own favorability, and I'm not going to get into who selects what and how many we're doing there. But I will tell you that it is -- it will put pressure on the topline, but it, obviously, it's going to improve our profitability here from a programming standpoint. So we will continue to work through that. The other thing I wanted to mention on just the growth metrics of FiOS here. As you know, given the disputes that we've had in custom TV, we also were black out from many content providers in advertising this product during the quarter, and in 2 of the biggest markets, both New York and Philadelphia, we were unable to advertise the custom TV package for approximately 45 days until we worked through that. So that also contributed to some of the slower growth in FiOS because it took us out of market for that period of time during the quarter. And then, of course, in addition to that, we had the Time Warner Cable separation of the merger, which both entrance came back into the market pretty competitively. So that put some pressure on this as well. But even with that, we saw some great progress with the custom TV package. On the second piece, Phil, of AOL, there is nothing included in AOL from a P&L perspective this quarter. We closed at the end of the quarter. It was totally immaterial and from a cut off perspective, it just wasn't materially enough, for us, to include. However, we did include the opening balance sheet. We've done a preliminary assessment on the fair value of the assets that we acquired. We had an independent third-party do that on a preliminary basis, and that is included in the balance sheet. So you'll  see goodwill has increased for the acquisition as well as our customer list because it was value assigned to the subscription business of AOL. But from a P&L standpoint, there is no revenue or expenses included this quarter. That will be included for the first time in the third quarter. And at this point, we will be including that in our overall corporate results for the remainder of this year. And then, as I said before, we'll have to wait to see where we go at this -- whether we included as a separate renewable, or we disclose revenues are how we're going to do that in the future. And I don't have an answer yet on that these, so we'll wait till first quarter and enter into 2016 to give you more of a view into what happens going forward."

So we are maintaining those basic phone customers and converting them into a 4G LTE smartphone device, and we're seeing really good progress on that. And that's part of the $80 price point that we have in the market, it's been very, very successful for us and the retention of our customer base. But speaking on the churn piece, I just want to caution everybody, be careful because there's seasonality and the churn. So generally, third quarter is a little bit higher than the second quarter, but we do believe that we will still be able to improve on a year-over-year basis. As far as the over-the-top lunch, we are absolutely going to be ready to go by late summer. It won't be the full entire of everything that we contemplate within the products set, it will be an initial launch. And as the year goes on, it will progress. So more to come on that. But as you know, we have signed up a number of content providers, Sport Channels, DreamWorks, Awesomeness TV, Vice media, scripts and of course, we can't leave out the AOL content that's coming with the acquisition, including Hub Post and TechCrunch. So we have a very good lineup. This is a line of that is really around all live play newsclips and sports and events. So very different than what anyone else is bringing to the marketplace. So more to come on that this summer from Marnee and Tim Armstrong and his team who now owns this product set. And then on the multicast. Again, as we go through this, all the phones that we sold in the fourth quarter have the capability of multicast other than the 6 and the 6 Plus, and we continue to feed the market with those multicast devices. And I can't speak to exactly what the next iconic device will have in it, so we'll have to wait and see what that comes out with. But this will continue to grow over the next year to have the proliferation of units in the marketplace to make this matter as we continue on with our OTT launch."

So it's consistently flat between $2.5 billion to $3 billion, so it really hasn't changed much. On the overall Wireline perspective, look, I mean, we have sold the 3 properties in the South Texas, California, Florida because they were islands to us, very difficult properties to operate from our scale perspective. There's still a lot of copper in those footprints. And Frontier does a much better job with that and strategically, it that didn't fit, for us. But look, I think if anyone were to enter the broadband market, the East Coast would be the first place that they would go. I mean, we have an incredible footprint that stretches from Washington, D.C. up through Boston. The broadband connection to those homes, along with our Wireless product and the population of that segment is critical to us. And it is a strategic asset for us to continue to market and lunch with our Wireless product. And over-the-top is going to feed into more of that as we go here strategically.

So Michael, on the margin pricing, look, I think that the financials speak for themselves and of course, we'll get a lot of flavor around how EIP helped the profitability in all this. But again, as Mike and I continue to say, if you look at total revenue and the total EBITDA margin, that kind of neutralizes out the impact of the EIT. And you see that we're increasing this year-over-year. And even if you look at the Wireless margin at 56% in this quarter, even if you normalize out the EIT benefit, you're still over 50% margins for that business. So I think it speaks to itself of the -- we continue to be AND company. We're going to grow and we're going to generate the profitability, and we're going to do this in a very disciplined, manageable approach. And we've said that we felt that coming into the year that we will hold our margins given all the competitive pressures, and we're still on track to do that. So I think the margin itself speaks for itself. And from a seasonality standpoint, the one thing I would say going back to the change in the revenue guidance is that as we look out into the fourth quarter, keep in mind, fourth quarter  last year was an unusually very high-volume quarter that generated a lot of equipment revenue and the bulk of our sales we're still in the equipment subsidy model, and that hovered around the new 6 and 6 Plus that came out. I just don't see it over the next iconic device is going to be substantially different, and therefore, I don't see -- and this is just me speaking, I don't see the volume there in the fourth quarter that we had last year from a total iconic change of the 6 and the 6 Plus. So I think that will also benefit us from just a margin perspective. On Wireless and leasing plans, look, this is -- the leasing plan is just a fancy way to do installment plans. But, of course, you get another accounting benefit by putting assets up on your book and being able to amortize them below the EBITDA line. So at this point, we have no plans to do any type of leasing arrangement. And then on the enterprise side, look, as I've said before, '15 would look like '14. I still do see some glimmers of hope here especially in the government sector where we're starting to sign some large contracts. But as you know in this business, I sign a large contract today, it takes me at least 12 months to implement that before I start to see the revenue benefit. So I'm looking that there could be some positives here going into '16 on the enterprise side. Obviously, its biggie impacted by FX right now, but this is very competitive environment with thousands of players who have niches. We do very well in the security side of the house, we're doing well in the data center side, on the whole cloud services. But these revenue streams are just not large enough to offset the price compression that we're seeing in IP. But again, I see some glimmers of hope and IP where maybe it's starting to stabilize again. And if that happens, then we should see some improvement. But right now, it will be a cautious outlook for me."

So I think that this all proves to, again, the basis of how Verizon Wireless has been successful, and we'll continue to be successful is the quality of our network, the consistent performance that our network gives our customers. And the breadth of that network across the United States. So that's really what comes to. And as I said before, the #1 reason a customer leaves you is because of the quality of the network, price is #2. So the quality of the network still is overwhelmingly more important than price. Not to say that customers are not price-sensitive, but we think that we can continue to be very competitive and protect our high-value base. So yes, I do think that we'll continue on this track."

And how should we think about your strategy around the need for low band spectrum? And sort of a bigger question here. I mean, clearly, focus remains on providing a compelling network experience from your side, particularly if I think about your CapEx and thus, the shifting towards Wireless. Was wondering if you could talk a bit more about some of the technology evolutions you folks are embracing. Clearly, when we speak to folks some of the push to small cells, perhaps some of the software-defined networking, [indiscernible] which we haven't seen from many other players and stuff along those lines to really try and optimize the network throughput.

So on the network side, as far as the incentive option goes, yes, the FCC is now saying that they're going to hold an auction first quarter of '16, probably at the end of the first quarter '16.

So on the network side, as far as the incentive option goes, yes, the FCC is now saying that they're going to hold an auction first quarter of '16, probably at the end of the first quarter '16. As you know, they had a meeting on July 16 where they were going to set the rules but that actually got postponed. So we'll have to wait to look at where the auction rules are decide whether we're going to participate at the appropriate time. The only thing, I would say, is that based on the AWS-3 auction, hopefully, we have some lessons learned on what we shouldn't do with the multibillion companies getting favorable treatment. So we'll have to see where these assessments come out. As far as our strategy here, the need for low band spectrum for us is not a great need. As you know, we build out our LTE on the 700 megahertz, which is contiguous across the United States, which is a competitive advantage for us. We then launched our AWS-1 spectrum for capacity, and now, we're in the process of revamping our 1900 PCS. So the key here is to keep in mind that of our licensed portfolio, only 40% of our license portfolio supports LTE and 87% of the data traffic is now running through LTE. So if you look at our 1900 megahertz yet to be deployed AWS-3, which we bought and will be deployed over the next probably 2.5 years out, and then our built strategy, which we came out of the auction with in Chicago and New York, we have plenty of capacity to deal with the ramping of what we believe will happen with our OTT product and the continued pursuit of volume in the industry. So our build-out is on track. We do not necessarily need low band spectrum, but that doesn't mean that we would not participate in the incentive auction. Again, we'll have to wait for the the rules to come out. But, obviously, we are continuing down the track that we set on coming out of the AWS-3 auction. So at that point, we have to wait to see what happens with the FCC."

Well, I would say, you never say never, right? So look, I mean, we're open to any options. But as far as the leasing of spectrum goes, as I said before, in order to protect the viability of our network and our planning and our capital allocation, this would have to be almost a leasing perpetuity so that you could never be held hostage by anybody. Because once you deploy a spectrum in your network, if somebody turn around 10 years from now and said, I think I'm not going to lease that to you anymore, that would be detrimental to your business, and you can't just -- you just can't let that happen. So I guess under the right terms and conditions, it would be something that we could look at, but I would tell you, I think that's very, very difficult given the asset that you're leasing here. So I think that's the perspective, and we're concentrating on our build. The one thing I didn't answer on Amir's question was that's the end we're well into that. I mean, obviously, LTE in itself is a software developer network, and it gives you the scalability of giving richer network experiences and our team is working on that, and we've been working on that for quite some time. So there is a lot of things that will bring efficiency to the network. I mean, there's see RAM out there, we are in the initial, obviously, talked about in the industry of coarse Asia is involved in 5G and, of course, we will start to get involved in the standard-setting around 5G. So there's a lot happening in this industry from a technology standpoint, so spectrum is important it will always be important, but it's not the only tool we have in our toolbox. So from that perspective, be concentrating on the strategy that we outlined coming out the AWS-3 auction."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. GAAP reported earnings for the quarter were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the second quarter of last year. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of this year. The second quarter of last year included $0.10 per share from the gain on the sale of spectrum. So on an adjusted basis, EPS growth was 14.3%. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter, excluding this prior year gain, was 6%. Through the first half of the year, earnings totaled $2.06 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would have been about $0.07 higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate for the first half of this year was 12.6%. 
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting Wireless equipment revenue and Wireless cost of equipment in our consolidated statements of income. In our Wireless segment, we are reporting the cost of equipment and the cost of service, which were previously combined as cost to service and sales. Prior period detail at both the consolidated and Wireless segment level is included in the financial and operating information schedules on our website. 
I would also remind you that our Wireline results include the operations that we agreed to sell to Frontier. This will be the case until the transaction closes, which is on track for the first half of 2016. As we pointed out last quarter, the assets and liabilities associated with these operations have been classified on the balance sheet as held for sale. And as such, we are no longer recording depreciation expense. 
For the full year, we continue to estimate the earnings benefit to be about $0.12 to $0.13 per share. The acquisition of AOL, which we announced in mid-May, closed on June 23. Our balance sheet at June 30 includes the AOL assets and liabilities. Our income statement for the second quarter does not reflect any results of AOL operations for the last 7 days of the month due to immateriality. The AOL results of operations will be fully included in the third quarter. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to compete effectively and execute our strategy, which is focused on providing consistent network reliability and a great customer experience.
Once again, we delivered strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investment provides the foundation for innovative products and services for future profitable growth. We are committed to building the business for the future through a disciplined capital allocation model that we outlined almost 2 years ago and continue to execute. 
Through the first half of this year, we have invested approximately $18 billion in spectrum licenses and capital for future network capacity. We also invested more than $4 billion to acquire new capabilities with the AOL transaction, which supports our long-term video strategy. 
In addition, we returned more than $9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program was completed in early June, resulting in an overall reduction of 101.6 million shares. We facilitated these initiatives, while keeping our leverage ratio essentially unchanged and remaining on track with our deleverage plan. 
On the execution front, we had a strong quarter of quality connections growth and profitability in Wireless. We had more than 1.1 million retail postpaid net adds, which included 321,000 net phone additions. We also had very strong customer retention with postpaid churn of 0.90%, down 4 basis points year-over-year. This was our lowest churn rate in 3 years. 
Total Wireless revenue grew 5.3% and EBITDA increased by 9.1%. Our EBITDA margin on both service and total Wireless revenue expanded on a year-over-year basis. 
Our Wireline results were once again highlighted by growth in the consumer market where revenues were up over 4%. Our segment EBITDA margin expanded modestly on a sequential and year-over-year basis. 
Now let's get into our second quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue was $32.2 billion in the quarter, and if we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold last year, the compatible growth rate would have been 2.8%. 
Consolidated top line revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS usage. We believe that future revenue growth will come from video and the Internet of Things at both the network and platform layers. Over the past several years, we have been investing in these platforms and positioning ourselves to capitalize on these new sources of growth. 
In terms of video, we will introduce our mobile-first OTT video product in late summer. As you know, we have already announced some initial content partners. 
Our acquisition of AOL further enhances our video strategy through its digital media and advertising platform capabilities, a portfolio of content brands with a domestic average of about 190 million unique visitors per month, and its loyal e-mail subscription customer base. We are excited to have a very talented people of AOL on the Verizon team and look forward to their contributions to our success. 
As far as Internet of Things, we think that the transportation, health care and energy industries, in particular, present great opportunities for us and we are very active fostering innovation in these areas. We are very well positioned to capitalize on these new growth opportunities, and we will continue to develop business models to monetize usage on our network and at the platform level. 
Within our current results, new revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. These revenues totaled approximately $165 million in the quarter and about $320 million year-to-date. 
We continue to be focused on reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies, while improving the overall customer experience. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.8 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points to 36.6%. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. As highlighted a few minutes ago, our capital allocation model is disciplined and consistent. The priorities are to invest necessary capital in our networks to stay ahead of demand, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. The cash flows we generate enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and deleverage to further strengthen the balance sheet. 
In the second quarter, cash flows from operations were $8.7 billion. Through the first half, cash flow from operations totaled $18.9 billion, but included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. We also continued to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $1.2 billion in cash proceeds in the second quarter. 
Free cash flow for the first half of the year, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $8.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $8.2 billion for the first half of the year. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of gross debt, net debt of $110.7 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x. As I said earlier, our deleveraging plans remain on track. 
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. As I said earlier, total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.3% in the quarter to $22.6 billion. Service revenue of $17.7 billion declined 2.2%, while equipment revenue increased to $3.9 billion, up nearly 62%. 
Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3%. For customers who select device installment plans, lower service pricing is exchanged for higher device payments. Equipment revenue, which is largely recognized upfront, is much higher than in the subsidy model. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more customers choose unsubsidized devices, and equipment revenues will continue to increase with installment plan adoption. 
Customer demand for device installment plans has increased. The percentage of phone activations on installments grew to 49% in the quarter compared with 39% in the first quarter and only 18% a year ago. 
Phone activations on device installment plans totaled 4.7 million in the quarter, and we now have more than 14 million customers on these plans, representing roughly 16% of our postpaid phone base.  Looking ahead, we believe that the percentage of phone activations on installment will continue to increase and will likely be around 60% in the third quarter. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.1%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.1%, up 580 basis points. The EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue expanded to 43.9% in the quarter, up from 42.3% a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 109.5 million total retail connections. This does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.2% to 103.7 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.8 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 3.9 million but were down year-over-year due primarily to lower tablet volumes.
As I highlighted earlier, we had a very strong customer retention in the quarter, with postpaid churn improving both sequentially and year-over-year to 0.90%. One of our priorities this year was to improve customer retention, and we are doing so with a disciplined approach, focusing on high-value customers. 
Our retail postpaid net additions of more than 1.1 million were nearly twice the net additions in the first quarter. The quality of the net adds remained very strong with 842,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter. Postpaid phone additions totaled 321,000 as net phone adds of 588,000 were partially offset by a net decline of 266,000 basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 852,000 in the quarter and net prepaid devices declined by 126,000. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 2%. About 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 70.1 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 81% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 73% of our retail postpaid connections base. 
As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continue to drive increased data and video usage. Approximately 87% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has essentially doubled in the past year. About 7.2% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. The quality of our phone base continues to improve as we add new 4G customers and upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices as part of our retention efforts. In the past year, our 4G smartphone connections have increased by 17.8 million or about 40% to 61.6 million. We still have a sizable opportunity remaining with roughly 16 million basic phones and about 9 million 3G smartphones in our postpaid connections base. 
We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets as they provide good value through increased data consumption and lower churn rate at the account level. We ended the quarter with 9.6 million tablets in our postpaid connection base, so overall penetration is still under 10%. 
In terms of capital spending, we continue investing for the capacity to further optimize our 4G LTE network and position the network for the future. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter and $5.5 billion for the first half of the year, about 4% higher on a year-to-date basis. National studies consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers: coverage and consistent reliable performance. 
Currently, our 700 and AWS-1 spectrum bands, which represent approximately 40% of our licensed spectrum portfolio, are utilized in our LTE network. We are just beginning to refarm 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G to 4G LTE in select markets, representing the next phase of spectrum to be deployed to serve our growing LTE usage. 
Our network densification plans, which includes small cells, DAS nodes and in-building solutions, are on schedule. In New York City, we are well into our deployment and continue to scale and develop a healthy pipeline. Downtown Chicago is another large urban market with small cell densification plans well underway, consistent with what we outlined on our post-auction conference call. 
Let's move next our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9. In the consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of our positive revenue trends, resulting in revenue growth of 4.5%. Mass markets, which includes small business, grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 79% of consumer revenue. 
In the second quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8%, driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and higher pay-per-view sales due to the prizefight in early May. 
Our FiOS Quantum broadband service continues to scale and with a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 64% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75-megabit-speed tier where 23% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. 
In broadband, we added 72,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.8 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.4% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 25,000 in the quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 26,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS Video subscribers, which represents 35.7% penetration. We have strong customer interest in our custom TV offering. More than 1/3 of our FiOS Video gross adds this quarter opted for a custom TV package, and we also saw migration demand from existing customers. We will continue to work with content providers on this new product, which so far is ahead of our expectations. While adoption of custom TV may initially have a negative impact on revenue growth, it should improve profitability. 
In the second quarter, we experienced a slowing of FiOS customer growth, which we attribute to triple play offer changes at a time of increased competitive intensity. We have since made some promotional adjustments and our exit rate sales volumes have shown improvement. 
We are focused on the continued evolution of our Wireline network. In the second quarter, we converted 51,000 copper customers, bringing our first half total to 98,000. As I have previously noted, post-conversion, we experience significant improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. 
Our agreement with Frontier for the sale of Wireline assets in the noncontiguous states of Florida, Texas and California, is also part of our network evolution, as it will enable us to better focus our efforts on the highly dense markets in the Northeast. We are working closely with Frontier to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and assure a seamless transition. We are making progress and remain on track to close the transaction in the first half of 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the second quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6.4%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline was similar to the first quarter. 
Declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by the competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications. 
In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.5% in the second quarter, which was better than expected due to some nonrecurring items. We expect continued price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges to pressure wholesale revenues, which we expect to decline in the 5% to 6% range for the full year. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.2%, which included some FX pressure. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, up 10 basis points. We are very committed to reducing our cost structure, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The Wireline headcount was down 10% year-over-year, and we continue to strive for gains in operational efficiency. As I've said, we are far from satisfied, and we will continue to work on our cost structure. Capital spending in the Wireline for the first half of the year totaled $2.2 billion, down 19%. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. We've had a good first half of 2015, delivering strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. As always, we continue to invest in our networks and platforms to position us for future growth. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our acquisition of AOL will be a key piece in our over-the-top mobile video strategy, accelerating our capabilities in digital media and advertising. 
We are confident in our ability to sustain profitability. Consolidated EBITDA for the first half of the year was up nearly 6% on an adjusted basis and our EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 37%. 
In terms of consolidated revenue outlook, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be higher than this quarter. For the full year, our consolidated revenue guidance is for growth of at least 3%. These growth estimates exclude revenue from AOL, which will become part of our results in the third quarter. We continue to target overall capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

Obviously, what's different between when you were expecting 4% versus 3%? And then, obviously, what the moving parts are to get accelerated revenue growth in the second half. 
And then I think the second question would be, if the market's reacting to something today, I think it's the sequential movement in the ARPA or the ARPU. And obviously, there's lots of moving parts in there: There's the impact of EIP. There's the impact of mix change. But I think the markets are also trying to seize those and figure out what the net movement is in terms of people pricing themselves up in the buckets and generating more ARPU versus some of the givebacks and the competitive pressure we're seeing inside the system at Verizon. If you could give us more color on kind of how the net is moving on pricing inside the base, that would be helpful."

So look, I mean, coming into this year, we set a priority that we said we would protect our base. And I think if you look at the results of the first quarter and the second quarter, the churn speaks for itself with 4 basis points improvement from the first quarter year-over-year and then the second quarter year-over-year, with the 0.90% being the lowest churn rate in the last 3 years that we posted up. In addition, some of the other changes in the assumption fact is that take rate of Edge. I would tell you, we never anticipated that Edge would accelerate as much as it has. And looking forward into 3Q being at 60%, that's much higher than we had anticipated, but the market has moved us there. And quite honestly, it's getting more and more confusing at the frontline. So this really translates into simplicity for our customers in choosing the Edge plan, and that's where the market has gone. So that's where we need to compete. And then finally, from an upgrade perspective, going back to protection of our base, we're up 800,000 upgrades year-over-year. So more people are selecting the new price plans when they get a new handset, and that puts us on the Edge, which, obviously, generates more equipment revenue and puts pressure on the service revenue. And coming into this year, we knew that service revenue would dilute. We're seeing more dilution than we anticipated because more customers are selecting that Edge plan. But I think just a couple of things to keep in check here, because when you zero in on one metric, you're walking away with the wrong impression as to what's happening in the overall P&L. So first off, we generated growth in revenue of 5.3% in Wireless this quarter. So if you look at the first half of the year, that's $2.5 billion of revenue growth just in the first half. You annualize that, that's growth that's bigger than some Fortune 500 companies generate in the full year of revenue. So this is still a very healthy business, and it goes to what the overall industry is as well. So there's a lot going on in the industry that generate more usage in the future. So if you look at the IARPA, which is the installment plus the revenue per account, we're up 2.3%. So if you just focus in on the service revenue, of course that's going to dilute year-over-year, but I think you have to step up and look at the overall financials of Verizon Wireless. In addition, if you look at the connections, we're up 4.3% year-over-year in connections, and we're also up in accounts. So when you look out to the future, you're adding accounts, you're adding devices, that's also going to be more usage on the network. And obviously, the whole future of the industry is based on generating more usage on the network so that people want to use more. And we know from a fact that more people are consuming more video on wireless today than they were a year ago. So that's all part of the strategy. You look at tablets, we're still less than 10% of the base in penetration of tablets. That's still another growth area for us. Then you look at Internet of Things. Internet of Things is still in early stages for the entire industry. There's more and more devices coming out that's going to generate revenue in the future. And then, of course, if you just look at Verizon, we have the whole AOL and OTT launch, which I'm sure we'll get to. We just launched custom TV in Wireline, and that in itself will also put pressure on the top line. So if you think about the custom TV package, customers are now only paying for what they want to view, and we're only paying the content providers for what our customers want to view. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a decrease in revenue, but you're also seeing a decrease in content cost that actually improves the profitability. So again, I think if you step back and you look at the entire portfolio of what's going on, I think you walk away with a very different conclusion that if you just look at the ARPU, because we know that ARPU is going to get condensed with the new EIP plan. So thanks, David, for the question."

So on productivity and cost, look, I mean, we've been at this now for 3 years and our VLSS program, Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, continues to generate savings. I mean, if you just look at Wireline year-over-year, down almost 8,000",568,"Sure. Thanks, Simon. So on productivity and cost, look, I mean, we've been at this now for 3 years and our VLSS program, Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, continues to generate savings. I mean, if you just look at Wireline year-over-year, down almost 8,000 employees from a year-over-year basis and still generating the great customer service and the volumes that we have there. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're getting both in the network efficiency side, reduction of overtime and of course, as the industry matures now, you're looking at a lot of houses that already have an ONT on the side of the house, so it's less labor because you're just activating the house that now doesn't really need much of a truck roll to go to, so there's a lot of efficiency there. 
In the Wireless side, a lot of concentration around self-serve and customer service centers and then we go to structure around the wireless units. So we're still on that whole productivity cost routine, and we still believe that we have a very full runway in front of us and you're going to continue to see us take cost out of the structure. If you just look at year-over-year on cash cost to loan, if you look at our revenue growth versus cash cost, we're really maintaining cash cost at a very slow incremental increase. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're driving through all of our initiatives. 
On the Frontier side, we still have -- we're expecting to close this transaction towards the end of the first quarter, so we still have about 8 to 9 months of planning activity. We're well on our way. And I think what we've done in the past speaks for itself as how we'll address this in the future. And obviously, I'll talk more about this as we get closer, but we're still designing those plans. Obviously, you know Dan Mead is leading that team and he's very diligent on what he's doing to prepare us for the separation of that unit and getting our cost within alignment to offset the stranded-cost perspective. 
On the union side of the house, just as we know, there are, in total, 27 collective bargaining agreements covering about 38,000 people in 9 Eastern states. We began formal negotiations on June 22. And to jump-start the negotiations, the company put forth a comprehensive offer on the table, which included wage increases and changes to current contracts to help us manage our cost and increase our flexibility to better serve our customers. Simply stated, we will need to monetize at our legacy contracts to better position us to complete in the digital age. Given the level of change we are seeking with respect to benefit cost management as well as work rules, our expectation is that the negotiation process will take some time. As you know, it is not unusual for negotiations to continue well beyond the expiration date of the contract, which is August 1. We intend to work through the process until we achieve a new agreement that addresses the needs of our business and preserves the high quality of our jobs for our employees. So I think, David, as far as that goes, that's probably all I'm going to say around the union negotiations. It's early on and we still have a lot of work to do."

So on custom TV, I mean, obviously, we know we were paving the path to a new venture here to give customers what they wanted. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on any litigation matters currently in effect with Disney and ESPN. As everyone knows, that we're being sued on the contractual arrangement there, so I'm really not going to talk about that. But look, I mean, we continue to have a great partnership with Disney and ESPN, and we will continue to work through that disagreement in our business relationships. And I will tell you, if you just look at the over-the-top product, I mean, ESPN is participating with colleges sports in that product, so we will continue to work with ESPN, and the lawsuit will take its own course of action. And again, we believe we're in our contractual rights to offer what we're offering. 
From a customer selection perspective, I will tell you, this has certainly exceeded our expectations. As we saw through the quarter once we launched this, we saw the uptake rate increase. As I said, in my prepared remarks, over 1/3 of the customers now coming in are selecting a custom TV package. I will tell you that as far as the number of genres that they take, it's less than what we anticipated, but they are selecting based on their own favorability. And I'm not going to get into who selects what and how many we're doing there. But I will tell you that it is -- it will put pressure on the top line. But it, obviously, is going to improve our profitability here from a programming standpoint. So we will continue to work through that. 
The other thing I wanted to mention on just the growth metrics of FiOS here. As you know, given the disputes that we had in custom TV, we also were blacked out from many content providers in advertising this product during the quarter. And in 2 of the biggest markets, both New York and Philadelphia, we were unable to advertise the custom TV package for approximately 45 days until we worked that. So that also contributed to some of the slower growth in FiOS because it took us out of market for that period of time during the quarter. And then, of course, in addition to that, we had the Time Warner Cable separation of the merger, which both entrants came back into the market pretty competitively. So that put some pressure on this as well. But even with that, we saw some great progress with the custom TV package. 
On the second piece, Phil, of AOL, there is nothing included in AOL from a P&L perspective this quarter. We closed at the end of the quarter. It was totally immaterial and from a cut-off perspective, it just wasn't materially enough for us to include. However, we did include the opening balance sheet. We've done a preliminary assessment on the fair value of the assets that we acquired. We had an independent third party do that on a preliminary basis, and that is included in the balance sheet. So you'll see goodwill has increased for the acquisition as well as our customer list, because it was value assigned to the subscription business of AOL. But from a P&L standpoint, there is no revenue or expenses included this quarter. That will be included for the first time in the third quarter. And at this point, we will be including that in our overall corporate results for the remainder of this year. And then, as I said before, we'll have to wait to see where we go at this -- whether we include it as a separate renewable, or we disclose revenues are how we're going to do that in the future. And I don't have an answer yet on that piece. So we'll wait till first quarter and enter into 2016 to give you more of a view into what happens going forward."

If you just look at them, we don't really disclose this, but if you just look at the basic churn rate, we've seen even double what we've seen in the overall churn rate improvement. So we are maintaining those basic phone customers and converting them into a 4G LTE smartphone device, and we're seeing really good progress on that. And that's part of the $80 price point that we have in the market. It's been very, very successful for us on the retention of our customer base. But speaking on the churn piece, I just want to caution everybody, be careful because there is seasonality in the churn. So generally, third quarter is a little bit higher than the second quarter, but we do believe that we will still be able to improve on a year-over-year basis. 
As far as the over-the-top launch, we are absolutely going to be ready to go by late summer. It won't be the full entire of everything that we contemplate within the product set. It will be an initial launch. And as the year goes on, it will progress, so more to come on that. But as you know, we have signed up a number of content providers: sport channels, DreamWorks, Awesomeness TV, Vice Media, scripts and, of course, we can't leave out the AOL content that's coming with the acquisition, including Huff Post and TechCrunch. So we have a very good lineup. This is a lineup that is really around all live-type news clips and sports and events. So very different than what anyone else is bringing to the marketplace. So more to come on that this summer from Marni and Tim Armstrong and his team, who now owns this product set. And then on the multicast. Again, as we go through this, all the phones that we sold in the fourth quarter have the capability of multicast, other than the 6 and the 6 Plus. And we continue to feed the market with those multicast devices. And I can't speak to exactly what the next iconic device will have in it, so we'll have to wait to see what that comes out with. But this will continue to grow over the next year to have the proliferation of units in the marketplace to make this matter as we continue on with our OTT launch."

On the overall Wireline perspective, look, I mean, we've sold the 3 properties in the South, Texas, California and Florida, because they were islands to us, very difficult properties to operate on -- from our scale perspective. There's still a lot of copper in those footprints. And Frontier does a much better job with that. And strategically, it just didn't fit for us. But look, I think if anyone was to enter the broadband market, the East Coast would be the first place that they would go. I mean, we have an incredible footprint that stretches from Washington, D.C. up through Boston. The broadband connection to those homes, along with our Wireless product and the population of that segment is critical to us. And it is a strategic asset for us to continue to market and launch with our Wireless product. And over-the-top is going to feed into more of that as we go in here strategically.

So Michael, on the margin pricing, look, I think that the financials speak for themselves and of course, we'll get a lot of flavor around how EIP helped the profitability in all this. But again, as Mike and I continue to say, if you look at total revenue and the total EBITDA margin, that kind of neutralizes out the impact of the EIP and you see that we're increasing this year-over-year. And even if you look at Wireless margin at 56% in this quarter, even if you normalize out the EIP benefit, you're still over 50% margins for that business. So I think it speaks to itself of the -- we continue to be an AND [ph] company. We're going to grow and we're going to generate the profitability, and we're going to do this in a very disciplined, manageable approach. And we've said that we felt that coming into the year, that we would hold our margins given all the competitive pressures, and we're still on track to do that. So I think the margin itself speaks for itself. And from a seasonality standpoint, the one thing I would say going back to the change in the revenue guidance is as we look out into the fourth quarter, keep in mind, fourth quarter last year was an unusually very high-volume quarter that generated a lot of equipment revenue. And the bulk of our sales were still in the equipment subsidy model, and that hovered around the new 6 and 6 Plus that came out. I just don't see that the next iconic device is going to be substantially different and, therefore, I don't see that -- and this is just me speaking, I don't see the volume there in the fourth quarter that we had last year from a total iconic change of the 6 and the 6 Plus. So I think that will also benefit us from just a margin perspective. 
On Wireless and leasing plans, look, this is -- the leasing plan is just a fancy way to do installment plans. But of course, you get another accounting benefit by putting assets up on your books and being able to amortize them below the EBITDA line. So at this point, we have no plans to do any type of leasing arrangement. 
And then on the enterprise side, look, as I've said before, '15 would look like '14. I still do see some glimmers of hope here especially in the government sector where we're starting to sign some large contracts. But as you know in this business, I sign a large contract today, it takes me at least 12 months to implement that before I start to see the revenue benefit. So I'm looking that there could be some positives here going into '16 on the enterprise side. Obviously, it's being impacted by FX right now, but this is a very competitive environment with thousands of players who have niches. We do very well in the security side of the house. We're doing well in the data center side, on the whole cloud services. But these revenue streams are just not large enough to offset the price compression that we're seeing in IP. But again, I see some glimmers of hope in IP where maybe it's starting to stabilize again. And if that happens, then we should see some improvement. But right now, it would be a cautious outlook for me."

They're not going to take an installment-type plan, so I don't think we ever get to quote 100% in our base. But from a consumer standpoint, yes, I could see us getting to where we're more heavily, very heavily concentrated on the installment side of the house. And quite honestly, as I said, from a front line perspective, it would be much easier for them to just sell one product so simplicity is important to us. So you're going to see us, as we gradually move through here, that the market is moving us there, so we're eventually going to get there. 
From a churn perspective, as I said, I think with all the programs we have going, we're making very good progress in our base. Our customers are loyal. You've seen us running our new ads and some of our customers are coming back to us because they were dissatisfied with where they went. So I think that this all proves to, again, the basis of how Verizon Wireless has been successful and will continue to be successful, is the quality of our network, the consistent performance that our network gives to our customers and the breadth of that network across the United States. So that's really what it comes to. And as I said before, the #1 reason a customer leaves you is because of quality of the network. Price is #2. So the quality of the network still is overwhelmingly more important than price. Not to say that customers are not price sensitive, but we think that we can continue to be very competitive and protect our high-value base. So yes, I do think that we'll continue on this track."

And how should we think about your strategy around the need for low band spectrum? And then sort of a bigger question here. I mean, clearly, focus remains on providing a compelling network experience from your side, particularly if I think about your CapEx investment and shifting towards wireless. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about some of the technology evolutions that you folks are embracing. Clearly, when we speak to folks, so the push to small cells, perhaps some of the software-defined networking at [indiscernible], which we haven't seen from many other players, and stuff along those lines to really try and optimize the network throughput. Any additional color would be most helpful here."

So on the network side, as far as the incentive auction goes, yes, the FCC is now saying that they're going to hold the auction first quarter of '16, probably at the end of the first quarter of '16. As you know, they had a meeting on July 16 where they were going to set the rules but that actually got postponed. So we'll have to wait to look at what the auction rules are and decide whether we're going to participate at the appropriate time. The only thing, I would say, is that based on the AWS-3 auction, hopefully that we have some lessons learned on what we shouldn't do with multibillion companies getting favorable treatment. So we'll have to see where these assessments come out. 
As far as our strategy here, the need for low band spectrum for us is not a great need. As you know, we build out our LTE on the 700 megahertz, which is contiguous across the United States, which is a competitive advantage for us. We then launched our AWS-1 spectrum for capacity, and now, we're in the process of revamping our 1900 PCS. So the key here is to keep in mind that, of our license portfolio, only 40% of our license portfolio supports LTE and 87% of the data traffic is now running through LTE. So if you look at our 1900 megahertz, the ""yet to be deployed"" AWS-3, which we bought and will be deployed over the next probably 2.5 years out, and then our built strategy, which we came out of the auction with in Chicago and New York, we have plenty of capacity to deal with the ramping of what we believe will happen with our OTT product and the continued pursuit of volume in the industry. So our build-out is on track. We do not necessarily need low band spectrum, but that doesn't mean that we would not participate in the incentive auction. Again, we'll have to wait for the rules to come out. But obviously, we are continuing down the track that we set on coming out of the AWS-3 auction. So at that point, we have to wait to see what happens with the FCC."

Well, I always say, ""You never say never,"" right? So look, I mean, we're open to any options. But as far as the leasing of spectrum goes, as I said before, in order to protect the viability of our network and our planning and our capital allocation, this would have to be almost a leasing perpetuity so that you could never be held hostage by anybody. Because once you deploy a spectrum in your network, if somebody turned around 10 years from now and said, ""I think I'm not going to lease that to you anymore,"" that would be detrimental to your business, and you can't just -- you just can't let that happen. So I guess under the right terms and conditions, it would be something that we could look at. But I would tell you, I think that's very, very difficult given the asset that you're leasing here. So I think that's the perspective and we're concentrating on our build. The one thing I didn't answer on Amir's question was SDN and we're well into that. I mean, obviously, LTE in itself is a software developed network, and it gives you the scalability of giving richer network experiences. And our team is working on that and we've been working on that for quite some time. So there's a lot of things that will bring efficiency to the network. I mean, there's CRAM out there. We are in the initial -- obviously, 5G is being talked about in the industry. Of course, Asia is involved in 5G and, of course, we will start to get involved in the standard setting around 5G. So there's a lot happening in this industry from a technology standpoint. So spectrum's important. It will always be important, but it's not the only tool we have in our toolbox. So from that perspective, we're concentrating on the strategy that we outlined coming out the AWS-3 auction."

Just like to end though at -- through the first half of '15, we continue to execute on the fundamentals. We position our business for the future and we always return value to our shareholders. 
On a comparable basis, first half's consolidated revenues grew 3.5%. Earnings grew 12.6%. Cash flow from operations was up 11.9%. Wireless revenues increased over $2.5 billion to just under $45 billion. 
To position ourselves for future growth, we acquired valuable mid-band spectrum in the FCC auction, invested $8 billion in capital year-to-date and made a very strategic acquisition in AOL. AOL acquisition greatly accelerates our digital media and advertising platform capabilities, which will become a critical element of our OTT strategy and our revenue growth for the feature. 
We returned $9 billion to our shareholders through the first half of this year: $4 billion in dividends and $5 billion in an ASR program.

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. GAAP reported earnings for the quarter were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the second quarter of last year. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of this year. The second quarter of last year included $0.10 per share from a gain on the sale of spectrum. So on an adjusted basis, EPS growth was 14.3%. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter, excluding this prior year gain, was 6%. Through the first half of the year, earnings totaled $2.06 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would have been about $0.07 higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate for the first half of this year was 12.6%. 
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting Wireless equipment revenue and Wireless cost of equipment in our consolidated statements of income. In our Wireless segment, we are reporting the cost of equipment and the cost of service, which were previously combined as cost of service and sales. Prior period detail at both the consolidated and Wireless segment level is included in the financial and operating information schedules on our website. 
I would also remind you that our Wireline results include the operations that we agreed to sell to Frontier. This will be the case until the transaction closes, which is on track for the first half of 2016. As we pointed out last quarter, the assets and liabilities associated with these operations have been classified on the balance sheet as held for sale. And as such, we are no longer recording depreciation expense. 
For the full year, we continue to estimate the earnings benefit to be about $0.12 to $0.13 per share. The acquisition of AOL, which we announced in mid-May, closed on June 23. Our balance sheet at June 30 includes the AOL assets and liabilities. Our income statement for the second quarter does not reflect any results of AOL operations for the last 7 days of the month due to immateriality. The AOL results of operations will be fully included in the third quarter. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to compete effectively and execute our strategy, which is focused on providing consistent network reliability and a great customer experience.
Once again, we delivered strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investment provides the foundation for innovative products and services for future profitable growth. We are committed to building the business for the future through a disciplined capital allocation model that we outlined almost 2 years ago and continue to execute. 
Through the first half of this year, we have invested approximately $18 billion in spectrum licenses and capital for future network capacity. We also invested more than $4 billion to acquire new capabilities with the AOL transaction, which supports our long-term video strategy. 
In addition, we returned more than $9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program was completed in early June, resulting in an overall reduction of 101.6 million shares. We facilitated these initiatives, while keeping our leverage ratio essentially unchanged and remaining on track with our deleverage plan. 
On the execution front, we had a strong quarter of quality connections growth and profitability in Wireless. We had more than 1.1 million retail postpaid net adds, which included 321,000 net phone additions. We also had very strong customer retention with postpaid churn of 0.90%, down 4 basis points year-over-year. This was our lowest churn rate in 3 years. 
Total Wireless revenue grew 5.3% and EBITDA increased by 9.1%. Our EBITDA margin on both service and total Wireless revenue expanded on a year-over-year basis. 
Our Wireline results were once again highlighted by growth in the consumer market where revenues were up over 4%. Our segment EBITDA margin expanded modestly on a sequential and year-over-year basis. 
Now let's get into our second quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue was $32.2 billion in the quarter, and if we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold last year, the comparatable growth rate would have been 2.8%. 
Consolidated top line revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS usage. We believe that future revenue growth will come from video and the Internet of Things at both the network and platform layers. Over the past several years, we have been investing in these platforms and positioning ourselves to capitalize on these new sources of growth. 
In terms of video, we will introduce our mobile-first OTT video product in late summer. As you know, we have already announced some initial content partners. 
Our acquisition of AOL further enhances our video strategy through its digital media and advertising platform capabilities, a portfolio of content brands with a domestic average of about 190 million unique visitors per month, and its loyal email subscription customer base. We are excited to have the very talented people of AOL on the Verizon team and look forward to their contributions to our success. 
As far as Internet of Things, we think that the transportation, health care and energy industries, in particular, present great opportunities for us and we are very active fostering innovation in these areas. We are very well positioned to capitalize on these new growth opportunities, and we will continue to develop business models to monetize usage on our network and at the platform level. 
Within our current results, new revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. These revenues totaled approximately $165 million in the quarter and about $320 million year-to-date. 
We continue to be focused on reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies, while improving the overall customer experience. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.8 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points to 36.6%. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. As highlighted a few minutes ago, our capital allocation model is disciplined and consistent. The priorities are to invest necessary capital in our networks to stay ahead of demand, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. The cash flows we generate enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and deleverage to further strengthen the balance sheet. 
In the second quarter, cash flows from operations were $8.7 billion. Through the first half, cash flow from operations totaled $18.9 billion, but included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. We also continued to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $1.2 billion in cash proceeds in the second quarter. 
Free cash flow for the first half of the year, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $8.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $8.2 billion for the first half of the year. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of gross debt, net debt of $110.7 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x. As I said earlier, our deleveraging plans remain on track. 
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. As I said earlier, total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.3% in the quarter to $22.6 billion. Service revenue of $17.7 billion declined 2.2%, while equipment revenue increased to $3.9 billion, up nearly 62%. 
Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3%. For customers who select device installment plans, lower service pricing is exchanged for higher device payments. Equipment revenue, which is largely recognized upfront, is much higher than in the subsidy model. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more customers choose unsubsidized devices, and equipment revenues will continue to increase with installment plan adoption. 
Customer demand for device installment plans has increased. The percentage of phone activations on installments grew to 49% in the quarter compared with 39% in the first quarter and only 18% a year ago. 
Phone activations on device installment plans totaled 4.7 million in the quarter, and we now have more than 14 million customers on these plans, representing roughly 16% of our postpaid phone base.  Looking ahead, we believe that the percentage of phone activations on installment will continue to increase and will likely be around 60% in the third quarter. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.1%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.1%, up 580 basis points. The EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue expanded to 43.9% in the quarter, up from 42.3% a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 109.5 million total retail connections. This does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.2% to 103.7 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.8 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 3.9 million but were down year-over-year due primarily to lower tablet volumes.
As I highlighted earlier, we had a very strong customer retention in the quarter, with postpaid churn improving both sequentially and year-over-year to 0.90%. One of our priorities this year was to improve customer retention, and we are doing so with a disciplined approach, focusing on high-value customers. 
Our retail postpaid net additions of more than 1.1 million were nearly twice the net additions in the first quarter. The quality of the net adds remained very strong with 842,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter. Postpaid phone additions totaled 321,000 as net phone adds of 588,000 were partially offset by a net decline of 266,000 basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 852,000 in the quarter and net prepaid devices declined by 126,000. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 2%. About 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 70.1 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 81% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 73% of our retail postpaid connections base. 
As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continued to drive increased data and video usage. Approximately 87% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has essentially doubled in the past year. About 7.2% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. The quality of our phone base continues to improve as we add new 4G customers and upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices as part of our retention efforts. In the past year, our 4G smartphone connections have increased by 17.8 million or about 40% to 61.6 million. We still have a sizable opportunity remaining with roughly 16 million basic phones and about 9 million 3G smartphones in our postpaid connections base. 
We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets as they provide good value through increased data consumption and lower churn rate at the account level. We ended the quarter with 9.6 million tablets in our postpaid connection base, so overall penetration is still under 10%. 
In terms of capital spending, we continue investing for the capacity to further optimize our 4G LTE network and position the network for the future. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter and $5.5 billion for the first half of the year, about 4% higher on a year-to-date basis. National studies consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers: coverage and consistent reliable performance. 
Currently, our 700 and AWS-1 spectrum bands, which represent approximately 40% of our licensed spectrum portfolio, are utilized in our LTE network. We are just beginning to refarm 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G to 4G LTE in select markets, representing the next phase of spectrum to be deployed to serve our growing LTE usage. 
Our network densification plans, which include small cells, DAS nodes and in-building solutions, are on schedule. In New York City, we are well into our deployment and continue to scale and develop a healthy pipeline. Downtown Chicago is another large urban market with small cell densification plans well underway, consistent with what we outlined on our post-auction conference call. 
Let's move next our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9. In the consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of our positive revenue trends, resulting in revenue growth of 4.5%. Mass markets, which includes small business, grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 79% of consumer revenue. 
In the second quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8%, driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and higher pay-per-view sales due to the prizefight in early May. 
Our FiOS Quantum broadband service continues to scale and with a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 64% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75-megabit-speed tier where 23% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. 
In broadband, we added 72,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.8 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.4% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 25,000 in the quarter. 
In FiOS Video, we added 26,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS Video subscribers, which represents 35.7% penetration. We have strong customer interest in our custom TV offering. More than 1/3 of our FiOS Video gross adds this quarter opted for a custom TV package, and we also saw migration demand from existing customers. We will continue to work with content providers on this new product, which so far is ahead of our expectations. While adoption of custom TV may initially have a negative impact on revenue growth, it should improve profitability. 
In the second quarter, we experienced a slowing of FiOS customer growth, which we attribute to triple play offer changes at a time of increased competitive intensity. We have since made some promotional adjustments and our exit rate sales volumes have shown improvement. 
We are focused on the continued evolution of our Wireline network. In the second quarter, we converted 51,000 copper customers, bringing our first half total to 98,000. As I have previously noted, post-conversion, we experience significant improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. 
Our agreement with Frontier for the sale of Wireline assets in the noncontiguous states of Florida, Texas and California, is also part of our network evolution, as it will enable us to better focus our efforts on the highly dense markets in the Northeast. We are working closely with Frontier to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and assure a seamless transition. We are making progress and remain on track to close the transaction in the first half of 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the second quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6.4%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline was similar to the first quarter. 
Declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by the competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications. 
In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.5% in the second quarter, which was better than expected due to some nonrecurring items. We expect continued price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges to pressure wholesale revenues, which we expect to decline in the 5% to 6% range for the full year. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.2%, which included some FX pressure. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, up 10 basis points. We are very committed to reducing our cost structure, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The Wireline headcount was down 10% year-over-year, and we continue to strive for gains in operational efficiency. As I've said, we are far from satisfied, and we will continue to work on our cost structure. Capital spending in the Wireline for the first half of the year totaled $2.2 billion, down 19%. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. We've had a good first half of 2015, delivering strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. As always, we continue to invest in our networks and platforms to position us for future growth. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our acquisition of AOL will be a key piece in our over-the-top mobile video strategy, accelerating our capabilities in digital media and advertising. 
We are confident in our ability to sustain profitability. Consolidated EBITDA for the first half of the year was up nearly 6% on an adjusted basis and our EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 37%. 
In terms of consolidated revenue outlook, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be higher than this quarter. For the full year, our consolidated revenue guidance is for growth of at least 3%. These growth estimates exclude revenue from AOL, which will become part of our results in the third quarter. We continue to target overall capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

Obviously, what's different between when you were expecting 4% versus 3%? And then, obviously, what the moving parts are to get accelerated revenue growth in the second half. 
And then I think the second question would be, if the market's reacting to something today, I think it's the sequential movement in the ARPA or the ARPU. And obviously, there's lots of moving parts in there: there's the impact of EIP, there's the impact of mix change. But I think the market's also trying to sift those and figure out what the net movement is in terms of people pricing themselves up in the buckets and generating more ARPU versus some of the givebacks and the competitive pressure we're seeing inside the system at Verizon. If you could give us more color on kind of how the net is moving on pricing inside the base, that would be helpful."

So look, I mean, coming into this year, we set a priority that we said we would protect our base. And I think if you look at the results of the first quarter and the second quarter, the churn speaks for itself with 4 basis points improvement from the first quarter year-over-year and then the second quarter year-over-year, with the 0.90% being the lowest churn rate in the last 3 years that we've posted up. In addition, some of the other changes in the assumption fact is that take rate of Edge. I would tell you, we never anticipated that Edge would accelerate as much as it has. And looking forward into 3Q being at 60%, that's much higher than we had anticipated, but the market has moved us there. And quite honestly, it's getting more and more confusing at the frontline. So this really translates into simplicity for our customers in choosing the Edge plan, and that's where the market has gone. So that's where we need to compete. And then finally, from an upgrade perspective, going back to protection of our base, we're up 800,000 upgrades year-over-year. So more people are selecting the new price plans when they get a new handset, and that puts us on the Edge, which, obviously, generates more equipment revenue and puts pressure on the service revenue. And coming into this year, we knew that service revenue would dilute. We're seeing more dilution than we anticipated because more customers are selecting that Edge plan. But I think just a couple of things to keep in check here, because when you zero in on one metric, you're walking away with the wrong impression as to what's happening in the overall P&L. So first off, we generated growth in revenue of 5.3% in Wireless this quarter. So if you look at the first half of the year, that's $2.5 billion of revenue growth just in the first half. You annualize that, that's growth that's bigger than some Fortune 500 companies generate in the full year of revenue. So this is still a very healthy business, and it goes to what the overall industry is as well. So there's a lot going on in the industry to generate more usage in the future. So if you look at the IARPA, which is the installment plus the revenue per account, we're up 2.3%. So if you just focus in on the service revenue, of course that's going to dilute year-over-year, but I think you have to step up and look at the overall financials of Verizon Wireless. In addition, if you look at the connections, we're up 4.3% year-over-year in connections, and we're also up in accounts. So when you look out to the future, you're adding accounts, you're adding devices, that's also going to be more usage on the network. And obviously, the whole future of the industry is based on generating more usage on the network so that people want to use more. And we know from a fact that more people are consuming more video on wireless today than they were a year ago. So that's all part of the strategy. You look at tablets, we're still less than 10% of the base in penetration of tablets. That's still another growth area for us. Then you look at Internet of Things. Internet of Things is still in early stages for the entire industry. There's more and more devices coming out that's going to generate revenue in the future. And then, of course, if you just look at Verizon, we have the whole AOL and OTT launch, which I'm sure we'll get to. We just launched custom TV in Wireline, and that in itself will also put pressure on the top line. So if you think about the custom TV package, customers are now only paying for what they want to view, and we're only paying the content providers for what our customers want to view. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a decrease in revenue, but you're also seeing a decrease in content cost that actually improves the profitability. So again, I think if you step back and you look at the entire portfolio of what's going on, I think you walk away with a very different conclusion that if you just look at the ARPU, because we know that ARPU is going to get condensed with the new EIP plan. So thanks, David, for the question."

So on productivity and cost, look, I mean, we've been at this now for 3 years and our VLSS program, Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, continues to generate savings. I mean, if you just look at Wireline year-over-year, down almost 8,000",569,"Sure. Thanks, Simon. So on productivity and cost, look, I mean, we've been at this now for 3 years and our VLSS program, Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, continues to generate savings. I mean, if you just look at Wireline year-over-year, down almost 8,000 employees from a year-over-year basis and still generating the great customer service and the volumes that we have there. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're getting both in the network efficiency side, reduction of overtime and of course, as the industry matures now, you're looking at a lot of houses that already have an ONT on the side of the house, so it's less labor because you're just activating the house that now doesn't really need much of a truck roll to go to it, so there's a lot of efficiency there. 
In the Wireless side, a lot of concentration around self-serve and customer service centers and then we go to structure around the wireless units. So we're still on that whole productivity cost routine, and we still believe that we have a very full runway in front of us and you're going to continue to see us take cost out of the structure. If you just look at year-over-year on cash cost to loan, if you look at our revenue growth versus cash cost, we're really maintaining cash cost at a very slow incremental increase. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're driving through all of our initiatives. 
On the Frontier side, we still have -- we're expecting to close this transaction towards the end of the first quarter, so we still have about 8 to 9 months of planning activity. We're well on our way. And I think what we've done in the past speaks for itself as how we'll address this in the future. And obviously, I'll talk more about this as we get closer, but we're still designing those plans. Obviously, you know Dan Mead is leading that team and he's very diligent on what he's doing to prepare us for the separation of that unit and getting our cost within alignment to offset the stranded-cost perspective. 
On the union side of the house, just as we know, there are, in total, 27 collective bargaining agreements covering about 38,000 people in 9 Eastern states. We began formal negotiations on June 22. And to jump-start the negotiations, the company put forth a comprehensive offer on the table, which included wage increases and changes to current contracts to help us manage our cost and increase our flexibility to better serve our customers. Simply stated, we will need to monetize at our legacy contracts to better position us to complete in the digital age. Given the level of change we are seeking with respect to benefit cost management as well as work rules, our expectation is that the negotiation process will take some time. As you know, it is not unusual for negotiations to continue well beyond the expiration date of the contract, which is August 1. We intend to work through the process until we achieve a new agreement that addresses the needs of our business and preserves the high quality of our jobs for our employees. So I think, David, as far as that goes, that's probably all I'm going to say around the union negotiations. It's early on and we still have a lot of work to do."

So on custom TV, I mean, obviously, we know we were paving the path to a new venture here to give customers what they wanted. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on any litigation matters currently in effect with Disney and ESPN. As everyone knows that we're being sued on the contractual arrangement there, so I'm really not going to talk about that. But look, I mean, we continue to have a great partnership with Disney and ESPN, and we will continue to work through that disagreement in our business relationships. And I will tell you, if you just look at the over-the-top product, I mean, ESPN is participating with college sports in that product, so we will continue to work with ESPN, and the lawsuit will take its own course of action. And again, we believe we're in our contractual rights to offer what we're offering. 
From a customer selection perspective, I will tell you, this has certainly exceeded our expectations. As we saw through the quarter once we launched this, we saw the uptake rate increase. As I said, in my prepared remarks, over 1/3 of the customers now coming in are selecting a custom TV package. I will tell you that as far as the number of genres that they take, it's less than what we anticipated, but they are selecting based on their own favorability. And I'm not going to get into who selects what and how many we're doing there. But I will tell you that it is -- it will put pressure on the top line. But it, obviously, is going to improve our profitability here from a programming standpoint. So we will continue to work through that. 
The other thing I wanted to mention on just the growth metrics of FiOS here. As you know, given the disputes that we had in custom TV, we also were blacked out from many content providers in advertising this product during the quarter. And in 2 of the biggest markets, both New York and Philadelphia, we were unable to advertise the custom TV package for approximately 45 days until we worked through that. So that also contributed to some of the slower growth in FiOS because it took us out of market for that period of time during the quarter. And then, of course, in addition to that, we had the Time Warner Cable separation of the merger, which both entrants came back into the market pretty competitively. So that put some pressure on this as well. But even with that, we saw some great progress with the custom TV package. 
On the second piece, Phil, of AOL, there is nothing included in AOL from a P&L perspective this quarter. We closed at the end of the quarter. It was totally immaterial and from a cut-off perspective, it just wasn't material enough for us to include. However, we did include the opening balance sheet. We've done a preliminary assessment on the fair value of the assets that we acquired. We had an independent third party do that on a preliminary basis, and that is included in the balance sheet. So you'll see goodwill has increased for the acquisition as well as our customer list, because it was value assigned to the subscription business of AOL. But from a P&L standpoint, there is no revenue or expenses included this quarter. That will be included for the first time in the third quarter. And at this point, we will be including that in our overall corporate results for the remainder of this year. And then, as I said before, we'll have to wait to see where we go at this -- whether we include it as a separate renewable [ph], or we disclose revenues or how we're going to do that in the future. And I don't have an answer yet on that piece. So we'll wait till first quarter and entering into 2016 to give you more of a view into what happens going forward."

If you just look -- and we don't really disclose this, but if you just look at our basic churn rate, we've seen even double what we've seen in the overall churn rate improvement. So we are maintaining those basic phone customers and converting them into a 4G LTE smartphone device, and we're seeing really good progress on that. And that's part of the $80 price point that we have in the market. It's been very, very successful for us in the retention of our customer base. But speaking on the churn piece, I just want to caution everybody, be careful because there is seasonality in the churn. So generally, third quarter is a little bit higher than the second quarter, but we do believe that we will still be able to improve on a year-over-year basis. 
As far as the over-the-top launch, we are absolutely going to be ready to go by late summer. It won't be the full entire of everything that we contemplate within the product set. It will be an initial launch. And as the year goes on, it will progress, so more to come on that. But as you know, we have signed up a number of content providers: sports channels, DreamWorks, Awesomeness TV, Vice Media, Scripps and, of course, we can't leave out the AOL content that's coming with the acquisition, including Huff Post and TechCrunch. So we have a very good lineup. This is a lineup that is really around all live-type news clips and sports and events. So very different than what anyone else is bringing to the marketplace. So more to come on that this summer from Marni and Tim Armstrong and his team, who now owns this product set. And then on the multicast. Again, as we go through this, all the phones that we sold in the fourth quarter have the capability of multicast, other than the 6 and the 6 Plus. And we continue to feed the market with those multicast devices. And I can't speak to exactly what the next iconic device will have in it, so we'll have to wait to see what that comes out with. But this will continue to grow over the next year to have the proliferation of units in the marketplace to make this matter as we continue on with our OTT launch."

So it's consistently flat between $2.5 billion to $3 billion, so it really hasn't changed much. 
On the overall Wireline perspective, look, I mean, we've sold the 3 properties in the South, Texas, California and Florida, because they were islands to us, very difficult properties to operate on -- from our scale perspective. There's still a lot of copper in those footprints. And Frontier does a much better job with that. And strategically, it just didn't fit for us. But look, I think if anyone was to enter the broadband market, the East Coast would be the first place that they would go. I mean, we have an incredible footprint that stretches from Washington, D.C. up through Boston. The broadband connection to those homes, along with our Wireless product and the population of that segment is critical to us. And it is a strategic asset for us to continue to market and launch with our Wireless product. And over-the-top is going to feed into more of that as we go in here strategically.

So Michael, on the margin pricing, look, I think that the financials speak for themselves and of course, we'll get a lot of flavor around how EIP helped the profitability in all this. But again, as Mike and I continue to say, if you look at total revenue and the total EBITDA margin, that kind of neutralizes out the impact of the EIP and you see that we're increasing this year-over-year. And even if you look at Wireless margin at 56% in this quarter, even if you normalize out the EIP benefit, you're still over 50% margins for that business. So I think it speaks to itself of the -- we continue to be an ""and"" company. We're going to grow and we're going to generate the profitability, and we're going to do this in a very disciplined, manageable approach. And we've said that we felt that coming into the year, that we would hold our margins given all the competitive pressures, and we're still on track to do that. So I think the margin itself speaks for itself. And from a seasonality standpoint, the one thing I would say going back to the change in the revenue guidance is as we look out into the fourth quarter, keep in mind, fourth quarter last year was an unusually very high-volume quarter that generated a lot of equipment revenue. And the bulk of our sales were still in the equipment subsidy model, and that hovered around the new 6 and 6 Plus that came out. I just don't see that the next iconic device is going to be substantially different and, therefore, I don't see that -- and this is just me speaking, I don't see the volume there in the fourth quarter that we had last year from a total iconic change of the 6 and the 6 Plus. So I think that will also benefit us from just a margin perspective. 
On Wireless and leasing plans, look, this is -- the leasing plan is just a fancy way to do installment plans. But of course, you get another accounting benefit by putting assets up on your books and being able to amortize them below the EBITDA line. So at this point, we have no plans to do any type of leasing arrangement. 
And then on the enterprise side, look, as I've said before, '15 would look like '14. I still do see some glimmers of hope here especially in the government sector where we're starting to sign some large contracts. But as you know in this business, I sign a large contract today, it takes me at least 12 months to implement that before I start to see the revenue benefit. So I'm looking that there could be some positives here going into '16 on the enterprise side. Obviously, it's being impacted by FX right now, but this is a very competitive environment with thousands of players who have niches. We do very well in the security side of the house. We're doing well in the data center side, on the whole cloud services. But these revenue streams are just not large enough to offset the price compression that we're seeing in IP. But again, I see some glimmers of hope in IP where maybe it's starting to stabilize again. And if that happens, then we should see some improvement. But right now, it would be a cautious outlook from me."

But do you see a time where in the not too distant future, you could sort of phase out subsidized plans and move all towards these Edge plans? And then the other number that stuck out was the lower churn. You talked about some of the efforts to lower churn. Do you think you can maintain this level of sort of below 1% going forward?"

If you look at all the advertising in the market, it's around the access point and this is where we're at. So I think that where we're going to end up here is you'll never get to 100% overall because of corporate accounts, and so forth. They're not going to take an installment-type plan, so I don't think we ever get to, quote, 100% in our base. But from a consumer standpoint, yes, I could see us getting to where we're more heavily, very heavily concentrated on the installment side of the house. And quite honestly, as I said, from a front line perspective, it would be much easier for them to just sell one product so simplicity is important to us. So you're going to see us, as we gradually move through here, that the market is moving us there, so we're eventually going to get there. 
From a churn perspective, as I said, I think with all the programs we have going, we're making very good progress in our base. Our customers are loyal. You've seen us running our new ads and some of our customers are coming back to us because they were dissatisfied with where they went. So I think that this all proves to, again, the basis of how Verizon Wireless has been successful and will continue to be successful, is the quality of our network, the consistent performance that our network gives to our customers and the breadth of that network across the United States. So that's really what it comes to. And as I've said before, the #1 reason a customer leaves you is because of quality of the network. Price is #2. So the quality of the network still is overwhelmingly more important than price. Not to say that customers are not price sensitive, but we think that we can continue to be very competitive and protect our high-value base. So yes, I do think that we'll continue on this track."

And then sort of a bigger question here. I mean, clearly, focus remains on providing a compelling network experience from your side, particularly if I think about your CapEx investment and shifting towards wireless. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about some of the technology evolutions that you folks are embracing. Clearly, when we speak to folks, some the push to small cells, perhaps some of the software-defined networking at RAN mobile [ph], which we haven't seen from many other players, and stuff along those lines to really try and optimize the network throughput.

So on the network side, as far as the incentive auction goes, yes, the FCC is now saying that they're going to hold the auction first quarter of '16, probably at the end of the first quarter of '16. As you know, they had a meeting on July 16 where they were going to set the rules but that actually got postponed. So we'll have to wait to look at what the auction rules are and decide whether we're going to participate at the appropriate time. The only thing, I would say, is that based on the AWS-3 auction, hopefully that we have some lessons learned on what we shouldn't do with multibillion companies getting favorable treatment. So we'll have to see where these assessments come out. 
As far as our strategy here, the need for low band spectrum for us is not a great need. As you know, we build out our LTE on the 700 megahertz, which is contiguous across the United States, which is a competitive advantage for us. We then launched our AWS-1 spectrum for capacity, and now, we're in the process of revamping our 1900 PCS. So the key here is to keep in mind that, of our license portfolio, only 40% of our license portfolio supports LTE and 87% of the data traffic is now running through LTE. So if you look at our 1900 megahertz, the ""yet to be deployed"" AWS-3, which we bought and will be deployed over the next probably 2.5 years out, and then our build strategy, which we came out of the auction with in Chicago and New York, we have plenty of capacity to deal with the ramping of what we believe will happen with our OTT product and the continued pursuit of volume in the industry. So our build-out is on track. We do not necessarily need low band spectrum, but that doesn't mean that we would not participate in the incentive auction. Again, we'll have to wait for the rules to come out. But obviously, we are continuing down the track that we set on coming out of the AWS-3 auction. So at that point, we'll have to wait to see what happens with the FCC."

Well, I always say, ""You never say never,"" right? So look, I mean, we're open to any options. But as far as the leasing of spectrum goes, as I said before, in order to protect the viability of our network and our planning and our capital allocation, this would have to be almost a lease in perpetuity so that you could never be held hostage by anybody. Because once you deploy a spectrum in your network, if somebody turned around 10 years from now and said, ""Oh, I think I'm not going to lease that to you anymore,"" that would be detrimental to your business, and you can't just -- you just can't let that happen. So I guess under the right terms and conditions, it would be something that we could look at. But I would tell you, I think that's very, very difficult given the asset that you're leasing here. So I think that's the perspective and we're concentrating on our build. The one thing I didn't answer on Amir's question was SDN and we're well into that. I mean, obviously, LTE in itself is a software developed network, and it gives you the scalability of giving richer network experiences. And our team is working on that and we've been working on that for quite some time. So there's a lot of things that will bring efficiency to the network. I mean, there's CRAM out there. We are in the initial -- obviously, 5G is being talked about in the industry. Of course, Asia is involved in 5G and, of course, we will start to get involved in the standard setting around 5G. So there's a lot happening in this industry from a technology standpoint. So spectrum's important. It will always be important, but it's not the only tool we have in our toolbox. So from that perspective, we're concentrating on the strategy that we outlined coming out of the AWS-3 auction."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on the website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted, as sequential. 
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $0.99 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a noncash, pretax charge of $342 million or $0.05 per share for a pension remeasurement adjustment due to a settlement accounting threshold that was met in the third quarter. 
Excluding the effect of this nonoperational item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.04 for the third quarter compared with $0.89 a year ago, or growth of 16.9%.  There were no special items of nonoperational nature in the third quarter of 2014. 
Through the first 9 months, adjusted earnings totaled $3.10 per share compared with $2.65 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would've been higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assume 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. 
On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate was about 14% for the first 9 months of 2015. 
As a reminder, our Wireline results include the operations in the 3 states that we agreed to sell the Frontier. These operations will be included until the transaction closes, which we expect at the end of the first quarter of 2016. 
Also as previously noted, we are no longer recording depreciation expense on these assets as they are classified as held for sale. 
We continue to estimate that the full year 2015 earnings benefit of lower depreciation expense will be about $0.13 per share. 
In terms of the AOL acquisition, which closed in late June, our third quarter consolidated results include the operations of AOL, which were reported as part of Corporate and Other. 
We have not restated prior history superior to part of the third quarter of 2015 will not include AOL results. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our business and deliver strong financial performance, while actively positioning the business for future growth and profitability. We are very committed to building the business for the future, and we are doing so through investments in our existing networks as well as the platforms that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new areas like mobile, video and the Internet of Things. 
We continue to execute a disciplined capital allocation model. In addition to our consistent investment strategy, we are also committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
We've had a very active year with capital investments and spectrum purchases, which positioned us for the future growth, the strategic acquisition of AOL and the return of more than $11 billion in value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while remaining on track with our previously stated deleveraging plan. 
In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. 
This was the ninth consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows. 
On the operational front, our focus is to provide customers with consistent network reliability and a great customer experience, and we are competing very effectively in all parts of the business. 
We, once again, delivered strong earnings growth and free cash flows. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability, with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net adds as well as net phone additions. 
Postpaid net adds totaled 1.3 million, which does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. 
Net phone add additions were 430,000. 
Customer retention was also a highlight, with postpaid churn of 0.93%, down 7 basis points from last year. 
Total Wireless revenue grew 5.4% and our EBITDA margin expanded. Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by fios revenue and customer growth with sequential increases in both Internet and video subscribers.  Our segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 50 basis points. 
Now let's get into our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue was $33.2 billion, an increase of 5%, which as Mike indicated, includes revenues from AOL. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 3.1%. 
Our consolidated revenues have been consistently driven by customer and usage growth in both Wireless and fios. Our overall revenue mix continues to change, driven by the unsubsidized equipment model, increasing video demand in Wireless and a higher mix of broadband and fios. 
As these trends evolve over the near term, we expect future revenue growth to result from increased video and Internet of Things traffic, enabling new business models in Wireless and continued broadband demand in Wireline. 
In terms of our mobile video strategy, earlier this month, we were the first to market with the commercial launch of Go90, a differentiated mobile first social entertainment platform. 
Go90 includes a broad selection of premium content and social engagement features and the capability for sharing and conversation around the content. The initial feedback has been strong but increasing engagement with our significant promotion, and we have received positive industry recognition. 
As Go90 develops, we will be adding more great content, features and advertising opportunities. You can expect the flow of product enhancements, creating a new ecosystem for digital creators and advertisers and a video consumption model that we can monetize in multiple ways. 
AOL is expected to play a key role in the success of our video strategy. The acquisition of AOL significantly improves our digital media and advertising capabilities. These capabilities will be a key component of our video business model, which will be driven by digital mobile advertising in the future. 
We are taking a strong leadership position in the Internet of Things, with our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we are creating an ecosystem that will foster innovation and expand the entire IoT market. 
Here are a few examples of our earlier initiatives. In August, we announced the commercial availability of Hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service, creating a connected car driving experience that can operate in more than 150 million vehicles in the United States. 
We are very active in smart city solutions market and we've announced a partnership with the city of Savannah, Georgia. Municipalities like Savannah are looking to take advantage of our intelligence solutions to integrate systems, monitor traffic and safety conditions in real time to improve efficiency and public safety. These are just a few examples of the many opportunities we are pursuing. 
We are very well positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both the ubiquity of mobile service and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity linear. This will enable us to monetize usage through new commercial models, included data analytics and applications. 
New revenue streams from the Internet of Things continue to emerge and grow, with revenues of $175 million in the quarter and about $495 million year-to-date. 
As our revenue mix expands, we are focused on improving the customer experience, while reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. The focus on cost structure has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile. 
Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion, up 7.5% on an adjusted basis and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 80 basis points to 35.8%. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Cash flows from operations were $9.5 billion in the third quarter and totaled $28.4 billion year-to-date. The 9-month total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. 
In the third quarter, we continue to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $2 billion in cash proceeds. 
Free cash flow for the first 9 months, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.4 billion in the quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date. 
We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $112.3 billion of gross debt, net debt of $108.4 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4x. 
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. 
In the Wireless business, revenue growth,  profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.4% in the quarter to $23 billion. Service revenue up $17.6 billion, declined 4.1%, while equipment revenue increased to $4.3 billion, up 73%. 
Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.2%. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured and equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device installment plans increase and more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing. 
In early August, we simplified our pricing structure centered on the device installment model. The pricing change simplified the customer experience at the point-of-sale and provided a cleaner structure for managing their accounts. Existing customers can still choose to sign a 2-year service contract and remain on subsidized pricing when upgrading to a new device. 
Additionally, business customers do not generally select device installment plans. 
Consistent with our expectations, the percentage of phone activations on installment plans grew to about 58% in the third quarter compared with 49% in the second quarter and 12% in the third quarter of last year. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect the percentage of phone activations on device installment plans to increase to around 70%. 
During the quarter, 5.6 million phones were activated on device installment plans. We have about 19 million device payment phone connections in total, representing approximately 22% of our postpaid phone base. 
Overall, more than 30% of our postpaid phone customers are on unsubsidized service pricing. 
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.2%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.4%, up from 49.5%. 
As we have said before, we believe a more relevant measure of profitability is EBITDA as a percentage of total Wireless revenue, which expanded to 43.2%, up 160 basis points. 
On a year-to-date basis, our EBITDA margin was 43.9%, up 100 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 110.8 million total retail connections. This total does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.9% to 105 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.7 million. 
Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.93% in the quarter compared with 1% a year ago. 
Each quarter this year, we have improved our year-over-year postpaid churn rate between 4 and 7 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience from simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction. Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.3 million were high-quality with the sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 889,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 694,000 net new smartphones. 
Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 430,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 818,000. Net prepay devices declined by 80,000. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.6 million in the quarter, down about 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations.  
We ended the quarter with 71.5 million smartphones in total and our smartphone penetration increased to more than 82% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 76% of our retail postpaid connections base. 
As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage. Approximately 89% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network and overall traffic on LTE has increased by about 75% in the past year. 
About 7% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. The quality of our overall postpaid phone base continues to improve. Through gross adds and upgrades, our 4G smartphone base have increased by roughly 34% in the past 12 months to 64.6 million. We still have a sizable 4G upgrade opportunity with roughly 15 million basic phones and nearly 7 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections space. 
Tablets are also underpenetrated in our postpaid base at only 10%. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.9 billion in the quarter and $8.5 billion year-to-date, up 8.4% from a year ago. 
We continue to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's best reliability and to position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are focused on improving our network capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effective management of our spectrum inventory and further densification in urban markets. 
Our densification program is progressing well and is achieving the capacity gains that we expected on this spectrum that is in service. For example, in Chicago, we are on our plan for small cell deployments, covering key locations with distributed antenna systems and expanding our in-building coverage. This has helped support approximately 75% data growth on the network while maintaining our #1 ranking in network quality, according to both internal and external competitive benchmark studies. 
National studies continue to consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance. 
Densification is just one aspect of our network evolution strategy. We are working on centralizing network radio control to enhance capacity and provide operational efficiencies, while beginning to implement a software-defined network architecture, laying the groundwork for new innovative services and applications. 
We are extending our network leadership into 5G with our announcement several weeks ago that we are leading a technology forum with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standard development and the corporate requirements for the next generation of Wireless technology. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass market revenue performance on Slide 9. 
In the consumer business, fios continues to be the driver of revenue growth and now represents 79% of consumer revenue. 
In the third quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.8% and mass markets, which includes small business, grew 1.8%. 
As we expected, there was a change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory. The primary reason for the decline is driven by lower pay-TV subscriber growth and an increase in customers rightsizing their existing bundles. 
While fios broadband continues to grow, we are seeing a decline in the percentage of triple play customers. 
In addition, we continue to see interest in our Custom TV offering, which offers more choice in control at a lower price point. 
We expect the continued adoption of Custom TV will pressure revenue growth, but result in a higher contribution margin. 
In the third quarter, fios consumer revenue grew 7.1%, driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. Our Quantum broadband service continues to scale and because there are no content costs, has a higher profitability contribution. 
At the end of the quarter, roughly 2/3 of our consumer fios Internet customers subscribe to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speed tier where 1/4 of Quantum customers currently subscribed. 
As I highlighted earlier, fios subscriber growth improve sequentially in the third quarter. In broadband, we added 114,000 net fios customers and now have a total of 6.9 million fios Internet subscribers, representing 41.7% penetration. 
Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by ,2,000 in the quarter. In video, we added 42,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million fios Video subscribers, which represents 35.6% penetration. 
We are working closely with Frontier to finalize the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California and to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and ensure a seamless transition. 
We are making good progress and have secured for approvals from the DOJ, FCC and the State of Texas. We expect to close the deal at the end of the first quarter 2016. 
As we prepare to divest these properties, we are focused on reducing our shared cost structure post transaction. 
In addition, we will also take this opportunity to significantly reduce the broader cost structure of the entire Wireline business. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. 
In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 4.9%. And that a constant-currency basis was down about 3%. 
In our Global Wholesale business, revenues declined 5.1% in the third quarter. In both businesses, we continue to see similar trends impacting growth, with secular declines in legacy transport revenue and competitive price compression in other services. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.3% in the quarter. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5%, up 50 basis points. And on a year-to-date basis, expanded 20 basis points to 23.2%. 
As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on expanding margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We will continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs with some of the features savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations. 
Capital spending in the Wireline was $1.2 billion in the third quarter and totaled $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 18.6%. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. To wrap 2015, we have executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high-value customers and delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. 
We have also continued to consistently invest in our networks and platforms to position us for the future growth. 
Our year-to-date consolidated revenue growth was 3.3% after adjusting for the inclusion of AOL this quarter and the sale of the public sector business in 2014. 
On the same basis, we continue to expect revenue growth of at least 3% for the full year 2015. 
Our adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4% with margin expansion of 80 basis points to 36.6%. Excluding the tower proceeds, cash flows from operations were up about 13% year-to-date and free cash flow totaled $13.5 billion. We have added 3 million net postpaid Wireless subscribers, including total phone net adds of 613,000. 
Our new customer growth is high quality with 2.4 million new 4G smartphone customers and 2.5 million new 4G tablets. 
We have also improved the quality of our postpaid base through upgrades and effective customer retention and have approximately 10 million more 4G smartphone customers than we did at the beginning of this year. 
In fios broadband, we have added 319,000 new subscribers and 158,000 in fios video. 
We are very focused on the developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things to monetize usage on our networks and expand our revenue mix. 
In time, these incremental revenues will become more meaningful to our overall top line growth. The launch of new products like Go90 and Hum are examples of where we can monetize usage at the network and platforms layers, providing more diversity to future revenue streams. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

415798,311053914,877965,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Sure. Good morning, Simon. So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess, it's -- first of, let's start with a simple piece, which is some of it is just pure math. So when you look at this Wireless model and converting from a subsidized phone m",924,"Sure. Good morning, Simon. So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess, it's -- first of, let's start with a simple piece, which is some of it is just pure math. So when you look at this Wireless model and converting from a subsidized phone model to an installment plan model, as we've been pretty transparent with all of you, there was a GAAP accounting that increased the earnings of any company who adopted this model. And we try to be as transparent as possible giving you the baseline in the beginning, but that became more complicated. And what we said going forward is, look, the better measurement here is not service margin EBITDA, but regular EBITDA percent on total revenue because that kind of normalizes out the fact that we're now recording 100% of the revenue up front for the sales equipment rather than a subsidy and then recouping that through service pricing over a period of time. So when you take that into consideration, as you plan out the curve on the installment sale and penetration of a base, and I said in my prepared comments, our base is -- 30% of our base is already on this new pricing. So as you go into '16 and your you get into that 50%, it starts to normalize out the earnings impact that has accelerated through the year 2015. So I guess, what I would say is if you took out the impact of that in '15, and you look at '14 to '15 earnings growth, you probably get a more normal growth trend than what we're delivering in double-digit growth now. And then if you put that normalization to the '16, we actually would have grown earnings, but because of the math exercise here, you're getting the flatness in that GAAP accounting. So that's part of it. The next piece of it is as we've said also with the divestiture of the Frontier properties in the South, these are classified as properties for discontinued operations. And for the year, we're anticipating that's going to be a $0.13 to $0.14 EPS lift because we discontinued the depreciation of those properties. So again, that has to get normalized out as we go into '16. So if you look at it today, we're reporting $3.10 to date. We have about $0.11 of benefit, so it will be around a $2.99 versus $2.65 of last year. The next thing is, if you look at the divestiture of those properties, as we've said, these are higher-margin properties. And since we are more of a centralized cost base company, we have a lot of allocations into those properties. So as we've said before, when we announced the sale, we have this what we call stranded costs that we need to work out of the business since the time that we announced this. And look, I mean, I think we've proven a great track record here in Wireline that we know how to do this. I mean, if you look at year-over-year, we are down over 8,000 resources because of all the system enhancements and process improvements that we've made through processes and frontline execution on more online billing and so forth. So we know how to do this, and we've got about 5 more months to go. But we also have to consider the fact that we're in the middle of a labor negotiations and some of those benefits won't be realized until we come to an agreement with the labor. So this is more of a timing issue on this one. We will realize those benefits. As you know, the last time we entered into a labor negotiation, we said that we would incur about $500 million worth of savings over the 3 years. And you can see that coming through the EBITDA Wireline. So I think that's important. And then, of course, the last piece of this is as you can see in our results this quarter, you're seeing more of a ramp incorporate for the start-up businesses. So as any start up business goes, you incur losses up front because you're investing in the product development, you're investing in the marketing and the promotional event of that new business, and that's going to be a drag on earnings through '16 because the revenue will not catch up with the cost. So when you take all that into consideration, that's where Lowell mentioning and forecasting more about a flat, if you will, or plateau for 2016. We updated the 600 megahertz, look, as you know, applications, participants and buyers, the FCC did some forward part of the auction, which are expected to be due in January. And the whole purpose of this was to give the broadcasters a sense of what the bid would be that they would receive. And now the broadcasters have the chance to look at that and decide whether they're going to participate or not. I think one important thing here though too is that after we saw the abuse in the AWS auction by DISH, I think the FCC should learn from this and not give preferences to large corporations, award credit or set asides and the government shouldn't be in the business of picking one of them losers, let the consumers do that. So we'll have to see how the rules play out  here. But at this point, we do plan to participate, but we'll see how the rules play out and then we'll go from there."

And then just second on the kind of -- as we kind of unfold the Go90 strategy and think about content acquisition, now that AT&T and DTV are together, is there any thought about revisiting Verizon's historical kind of conversations with the cable industry about maybe joining forces to try to work together on content and distribution and allocation of resources?"

Obviously, as customers have fulfilled their contract over the 2-period, year period of time under the old subsidize model, those customers are free and always have been free to select whatever price plan they want, and we are allowing them to move to the new pricing because they fulfilled their contractual obligation under the old pricing. So in essence, they're bringing their previous device into the new pricing. So that's part of it. The other thing is there is a little bit of forward pricing here with current customers. And as we've talked before on calls, we have pretty diligent exercise where we go through our customer base, and we attack the high-value customers, so we think we have higher propensity to churn from us. So there is some pro-activeness there and I think you're seeing that come through on the reduction of churn through this year of 4 to 7 basis points. And I would anticipate that going into the fourth quarter, you should consider us to be within that improvement on a year-over-year basis. Now given the fourth quarter is always a -- generally, a higher churn quarter as it was last year, but we do believe that we will see a consistent improvement as we have seen through the beginning of this year. Well, as far as Go90, look, Go90 is a very, very different product set. It's mobile first, a social entertainment platform. Yes, let me just talk a little bit about where we are here. But this really is just a totally different perspective in linear TV and content deals. And we know how to do that, and we've been doing that for 10 years with fios. But this is a very, very different platform. Keep in mind, we're 20 days into this. We actually haven't done any advertising or promotion activity around this product. So far, the only stages of you seeing very good platform stability, we're seeing very encouraging feedback and of course, we're looking at some very specific metrics here of what's the viewership, how many times do people revisit the site and what do the new shows capture. And if you haven't downloaded, I would encourage you to because we now have over 10,000 assets in the product, we have 2 exclusive episodes, one is called Top 5 Live and other one is Betch, Betch, and this are really starting to take form with the millennials, and we're starting to see a number of encouraging revisits to the platform on a daily basis to see what Top 5 live and Betch are doing. And we have 48 more exclusive content deals coming that will be on this product before the end of the quarter. So Go90 right now, we're seeing very, very good up stage, but again, we really haven't started to advertise the platform. We do have entertainers tweeting the platform who are part of the platform like Kanye West on his live show. So there's a lot happening in this platform, so we are really pleased with the initial stages, but this is very, very different than the legacy linear TV model. And so I'll stop there, David. Thanks for the question."

So look, I mean, the TV environment this past quarter was extremely competitive and continues to be. Custom TV though, actually, within the portfolio is performing similar to what it did last quarter with the number of people choosing the product and the number of migrations that we have within the product. And of course, as we've said, this is going to put a little bit of top line pressure on fios' growth. And the reason for that is the way you have to think about this, is the new bundle is about $20 less than the average normal fios bundle. But the offset to that is we're also getting an incremental benefit in the content cost. So we're seeing an incremental margin gain by people selecting the Custom TV package. I think what's more important though is that consumers are speaking to the total linear environment that says they only want to pay for what they want to watch, and they don't want to pay for 300 channels when they watch only about 10% of those channels. So I think that's more important as to where the ecosystem is going. We will continue to support Custom TV as we said. We know we have some disputes that we're working through but Custom TV right now is doing what we thought it would to. As far as the growth perspective, I think if you look at last quarter with the negative 625,000 negative ads, we continue to be positive, so we're gaining share. But look, the environment is millennials don't want linear TV content. They're disconnecting their cable for just Internet content and mobile content, and that goes to why we are launching Go90 with the mobile first perspective, and that's attacking that entire segment that a fios brand does not attack today through a linear TV product."

We're not seeing any impact from those programs from the competitors and our base and I think our results speak to that this quarter and I think they'll speak to that in the fourth quarter as well. I think what you'll see is, if you speak to the rating agencies, they're becoming very concerned with the balance sheet risks of some of the industry on putting up rental phones on the balance sheet with what the residual value will be with those rental phones. So again, as I've said before, that's not something that we're entertaining at this point. Again, I never say, never say never, but that is not something that I would have an appetite for. On the prepaid decline, I think, look, generally, if you look at how postpaid and the price points of postpaid and I talked about this before, postpaid pricing is more or less mirroring what prepaid pricing was in the past. And we are seeing some migration of our prepaid product customers to postpaid, but it's more probably limited than some others because of our intense credit models. And you have the past the credit in order to become postpaid. But there is a segment of prepaid customers that are good credit customers that now that the price point is closer to affordability for them on postpaid, they're moving into the postpaid products. So I don't really look into the prepaid product decline as a problem set for us at this point. We generally really compete with prepaid in our reseller model with companies like TracFone and Straight Talk and Straight Wireless, and that's where we really drive home the lower end product without our brand connected to it. Although we don't disclose much in reseller anymore, that segment continues to perform well for us."

Obviously, some of the metropolitan areas like New York and Chicago are higher than that. I mean, Chicago, we said is up 75%, but New York, San Francisco, some others are higher than that in growth rate. So it depends where you're at and then we have markets obviously lower than that because of more of rural areas. So that's generally what we're seeing in the network right now. On the installment sale billings of 1.2%, yes, I do believe that will go lower as we make this transition into 50% of our base for installment sale. So the trend of service revenue and the installment billings, plus the service is going to continue to decline until we get into that middle part, latter part of '16 where the curve will reverse and then you'll  start to see that flatten out, start trending back up just like the math would dictate."

For sometime, of course, we've seen the impact of increased competition in the market in respect to how devices are sold, pricing of services, et cetera, and at least from our end, the most colonial peers have yet to be realized. As we head into 2016, both competitive smaller carriers seem to be positioning themselves to be levering up here, albeit one of them synthetically through the lease company. With that in mind, are we potentially entering a period in which the focus may increasingly shift towards increased returns versus one that's overly emphasizing competition? And if so, how do you believe you can fair in that type of environment?"

And even through all these competitiveness, the industry itself continues to grow even though everyone thinks that the industry is slowing, we continue to have net adds overall, tablets become a bigger piece, data continues to grow. So the industry overall, although very competitive continues to grow despite all of that. Our focus has always been competing on a network quality, reliability and simplicity, and that's how we have been winning for the past 18 years, and that's our focus going forward. And you can see that with our new brand campaign, Better Matters, because what we believe with our brand and our campaign is we're trying to send a message that although some say video and data are not as important and people are willing to get disrupted, I think if you talk to the millennials, the thing that frustrates them the most at the spinning wheel when they want to watch a video or download something. So our focus on our brand is better does matter. We have the best network. We are the most reliable, and we become a more simple company to deal with, with our simplicity of pricing. So that's where we look to compete. I think the fourth quarter will be a competitive quarter as it always is every year. I think you're going to see promotions in the marketplace and this industry is going to compete as we always have. But I think our differentiation is how we differentiated ourselves through this whole entire process of installment sale and now rental. And as I said before, the rental programs don't seem to be having any impact or appeasing to our customers. So I would say that we will continue to do the same. As far as how the industry changes, I think what you're seeing from us is we're going in a different direction with our Go90 launch. I mean, we're appealing to a millennial population with our network and our products and I do think that as we said before, you can only price down so much and then you need to generate cash. And I think as you said, some have to start generating cash in order to invest in their networks to support the growth of the data Or Else Things are going to start to fall apart and I think you're starting to see some of that some of the national room metrics drive test where some of the networks are starting to feel pressure and starting to fall down in the ranking. We continue to invest heavily in our networks, as I said before. You should continue to see us as a flat overall capital company, but Wireless continues to trend up, and that's important for the product set that we're launching. So I do think there will be more focused on returns and profitability, and that's good for the industry."

I think, again, though what I would say is we truly believe that WiFi is a complementary Wireless network, if you will, with LTE, and we don't believe one replaces the other just like when we launched LTE, we said, look, it's not going to replace WiFi, it's not going to replace broadband into the home. Similar, WiFi is not going to replace LTE. So I think that's where it stands right now, so I really won't interject any more around the MVNO."

And then if you could also just talk about on the Wireline side. How do you think about your commitment to the Wireline business in fires going forward with LTE coming into the New York market, but you're divesting some properties outside of the Northeast.

And as you know, we deployed LTE contiguously on 700 megahertz. That doesn't mean that we can't operate with 600 megahertz, but 600 and 700 don't well together, there's a lot of interference. So where we have 700, there will be a lot of work to deploy a 600 megahertz spectrum. But there is areas where we could use lower band spectrum, but it's probably not the top priority. We like the higher brand like AWS. We said that all along the Charlie is sitting on very good spectrum. It's very good for capacity, which is why we spent $10.4 billion in the auction, but we also can do things like we've done in Chicago and New York, where we felt the license costs was way too high, and we instead decided to deploy small cells and get capacity in a more reasonable, cheaper way, if you will. Now some of this spectrum will come back to market. We don't know how that FCC will treat that yet so we'll wait and see. So yes, higher frequency spectrum is capacity and that's really what we need at this point in time. As far as the Wireline commitment, look, I think with the 3 divestitures in the South, they were more or less footprints, which were not to anything else. Most of that property was copper, not fiber. So when we look at the East Coast, it's a much different footprint. I mean, we'll have to cover over 70% of the footprint with our fios product. This is a -- we are very committed to it. We're investing over $4 billion into the Wireline company a year, so that shows our commitment from a capital investment perspective. We've already passed 20 million homes when we committed to originally 18 million. So we are very committed to the fios product. It goes hand-in-hand with our Wireless strategy and I think if you've asked anybody like if you're going to come in and compete for fiber into the home, you certainly would either pick the East Coast or the West Coast and they started with Cablevision in the East Coast. So we have a very viable footprint and we're committed to that. Now, again, as I've always said, you never say never. And of course, Lowell and I are always open to new options and we always keep our eyes open for that. But at this point, we're very committed to the Wireline business."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on the website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $0.99 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a noncash, pretax charge of $342 million or $0.05 per share for a pension remeasurement adjustment due to a settlement accounting threshold that was met in the third quarter.
Excluding the effect of this nonoperational item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.04 for the third quarter, compared with $0.89 a year ago, or growth of 16.9%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the third quarter of 2014.
Through the first 9 months, adjusted earnings totaled $3.10 per share, compared with $2.65 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would have been higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter.
On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate was about 14% for the first 9 months of 2015.
As a reminder, our Wireline results include the operations in the 3 states that we agreed to sell to Frontier. These operations will be included until the transaction closes, which we expect at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Also, as previously noted, we are no longer recording depreciation expense on these assets as they are classified as held for sale.
We continue to estimate that the full year 2015 earnings benefit of lower depreciation expense will be about $0.13 per share.
In terms of the AOL acquisition, which closed in late June, our third quarter consolidated results include the operations of AOL, which were reported as part of Corporate and Other. We have not restated prior history, so periods prior to the third quarter of 2015 will not include AOL results.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our business and deliver strong financial performance, while actively positioning the business for future growth and profitability. We are very committed to building the business for the future, and we are doing so through investments in our existing networks as well as the platforms that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new areas like mobile video and the Internet of Things.
We continue to execute a disciplined capital allocation model. In addition to our consistent investment strategy, we are also committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
We've had a very active year with capital investments and spectrum purchases, which positioned us for the future growth, the strategic acquisition of AOL and the return of more than $11 billion in value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while remaining on track with our previously stated deleveraging plan.
In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.
On the operational front, our focus is to provide customers with consistent network reliability and a great customer experience, and we are competing very effectively in all parts of the business.
We once again delivered strong earnings growth and free cash flows. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability, with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net adds as well as net phone additions. Postpaid net adds totaled 1.3 million, which does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Net phone add additions were 430,000.
Customer retention was also a highlight, with postpaid churn of 0.93%, down 7 basis points from last year.
Total Wireless revenue grew 5.4%, and our EBITDA margin expanded. Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by fios revenue and customer growth, with sequential increases in both Internet and video subscribers. Our segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 50 basis points.
Now let's get into our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue was $33.2 billion, an increase of 5%, which as Mike indicated, includes revenues from AOL. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 3.1%.
Our consolidated revenues have been consistently driven by customer and usage growth in both Wireless and fios. Our overall revenue mix continues to change, driven by the unsubsidized equipment model, increasing video demand in Wireless and a higher mix of broadband and fios. As these trends evolve over the near term, we expect future revenue growth to result from increased video and Internet of Things traffic, enabling new business models in Wireless and continued broadband demand in Wireline.
In terms of our mobile video strategy, earlier this month, we were the first to market with the commercial launch of Go90, a differentiated mobile-first social entertainment platform. Go90 includes a broad selection of premium content and social engagement features and the capability for sharing and conversation around the content. The initial feedback has been strong with increasing engagement without significant promotion, and we have received positive industry recognition.
As Go90 develops, we will be adding more great content, features and advertising opportunities. You can expect a flow of product enhancements, creating a new ecosystem for digital creators and advertisers and a video consumption model that we can monetize in multiple ways.
AOL is expected to play a key role in the success of our video strategy. The acquisition of AOL significantly improves our digital media and advertising capabilities. These capabilities will be a key component of our video business model, which will be driven by digital mobile advertising in the future.
We are taking a strong leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we are creating an ecosystem that will foster innovation and expand the entire IoT market.
Here are a few examples of our early initiatives. In August, we announced the commercial availability of hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service, creating a connected-car driving experience that can operate in more than 150 million vehicles in the United States.
We are very active in smart city solutions market, and we have announced a partnership with the City of Savannah, Georgia. Municipalities like Savannah are looking to take advantage of our intelligent solutions to integrate disparate systems, monitor traffic and safety conditions in real time to improve efficiency and public safety. These are just a few examples of the many opportunities we are pursuing.
We are very well-positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both the ubiquity of mobile service and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. This will enable us to monetize usage through new commercial models, including data analytics and applications. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things continue to emerge and grow, with revenues of $175 million in the quarter and about $495 million year-to-date.
As our revenue mix expands, we are focused on improving the customer experience while reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. The focus on cost structure has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile.
Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion, up 7.5% on an adjusted basis, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 80 basis points to 35.8%.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Cash flows from operations were $9.5 billion in the third quarter and totaled $28.4 billion year-to-date. The 9-month total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring.
In the third quarter, we continue to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $2 billion in cash proceeds. Free cash flow for the first 9 months, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.4 billion in the quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date.
We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $112.3 billion of gross debt, net debt of $108.4 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4x.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless, on Slide 6.
In the Wireless business, revenue growth,  profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.4% in the quarter to $23 billion. Service revenue up $17.6 billion, declined 4.1%, while equipment revenue increased to $4.3 billion, up 73%. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.2%. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured, and equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device installment plans increase and more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing.
In early August, we simplified our pricing structure, centered on the device installment model. The pricing change simplified the customer experience at the point-of-sale and provided a cleaner structure for managing their accounts. Existing customers can still choose to sign a 2-year service contract and remain on subsidized pricing when upgrading to a new device. Additionally, business customers do not generally select device installment plans.
Consistent with our expectations, the percentage of phone activations on installment plans grew to about 58% in the third quarter, compared with 49% in the second quarter and 12% in the third quarter of last year.
In the fourth quarter, we expect the percentage of phone activations on device installment plans to increase to around 70%. During the quarter, 5.6 million phones were activated on device installment plans. We have about 19 million device payment phone connections in total, representing approximately 22% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 30% of our postpaid phone customers are on unsubsidized service pricing.
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.2%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.4%, up from 49.5%. 
As we have said before, we believe a more relevant measure of profitability is EBITDA as a percentage of total Wireless revenue, which expanded to 43.2%, up 160 basis points. 
On a year-to-date basis, our EBITDA margin was 43.9%, up 100 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 110.8 million total retail connections. This total does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.9% to 105 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.7 million.
Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.93% in the quarter, compared with 1% a year ago.
Each quarter this year, we have improved our year-over-year postpaid churn rate between 4 and 7 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction.
Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.3 million were high-quality, with the sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 889,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 694,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 430,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 818,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 80,000.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.6 million in the quarter, down about 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations.
We ended the quarter with 71.5 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to more than 82% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 76% of our retail postpaid connections base.
As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage. Approximately 89% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by about 75% in the past year.
About 7% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. The quality of our overall postpaid phone base continues to improve. Through gross adds and upgrades, our 4G smartphone base has increased by roughly 34% in the past 12 months to 64.6 million. We still have a sizable 4G upgrade opportunity with roughly 15 million basic phones and nearly 7 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base.
Tablets are also underpenetrated in our postpaid base at only 10%. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.9 billion in the quarter and $8.5 billion year-to-date, up 8.4% from a year ago.
We continued to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's best reliability and to position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are focused on improving our network capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effective management of our spectrum inventory and further densification in urban markets.
Our densification program is progressing well and is achieving the capacity gains that we expected on the spectrum that is in service. For example, in Chicago, we are on our plan for small cell deployments, covering key locations with distributed antenna systems and expanding our in-building coverage. This has helped support approximately 75% data growth on the network while maintaining our #1 ranking in network quality, according to both internal and external competitive benchmark studies.
National studies continued to consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance.
Densification is just one aspect of our network evolution strategy. We are working on centralizing network radio control to enhance capacity and provide operational efficiencies while beginning to implement a software-defined network architecture, laying the groundwork for new innovative services and applications.
We are extending our network leadership into 5G with our announcement several weeks ago that we are leading a technology forum with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standard development and appropriate requirements for the next generation of Wireless technology.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9.
In the consumer business, fios continues to be the driver of revenue growth and now represents 79% of consumer revenue. In the third quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.8% and mass markets, which includes small business, grew 1.8%.
As we expected, there was a change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory. The primary reason for the decline is driven by lower pay-TV subscriber growth and an increase in customers rightsizing their existing bundles.
While FiOS Broadband continues to grow, we are seeing a decline in the percentage of triple play customers. 
In addition, we continue to see interest in our Custom TV offering, which offers more choice and control at a lower price point. We expect the continued adoption of Custom TV will pressure revenue growth, but result in a higher contribution margin.
In the third quarter, fios consumer revenue grew 7.1%, driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. Our Quantum broadband service continues to scale, and because there are no content costs, has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, roughly 2/3 of our consumer fios Internet customers subscribe to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75-megabit speed tier where 1/4 of our Quantum customers currently subscribe.
As I highlighted earlier, fios subscriber growth improved sequentially in the third quarter. In broadband, we added 114,000 net fios customers and now have a total of 6.9 million fios Internet subscribers, representing 41.7% penetration.
Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 2,000 in the quarter. In video, we added 42,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS Video subscribers, which represents 35.6% penetration.
We are working closely with Frontier to finalize the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California and to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and ensure a seamless transition.
We are making good progress and have secured for approvals from the DOJ, FCC and the State of Texas. We expect to close the deal at the end of the first quarter 2016. 
As we prepare to divest these properties, we are focused on reducing our shared cost structure post-transaction.
In addition, we will also take this opportunity to significantly reduce the broader cost structure of the entire Wireline business.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. 
In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 4.9%. And on a constant-currency basis was down about 3%. 
In our Global Wholesale business, revenues declined 5.1% in the third quarter. In both businesses, we continue to see similar trends impacting growth, with secular declines in legacy transport revenue and competitive price compression in other services. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.3% in the quarter. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5%, up 50 basis points. And on a year-to-date basis, expanded 20 basis points to 23.2%.
As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on expanding margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We will continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the features savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
Capital spending in the Wireline was $1.2 billion in the third quarter and totaled $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 18.6%. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. To wrap 2015, we have executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high-value customers and delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. We have also continued to consistently invest on our networks and platforms to position us for the future growth.
Our year-to-date consolidated revenue growth was 3.3% after adjusting for the inclusion of AOL this quarter and the sale of the public sector business in 2014. On the same basis, we continue to expect revenue growth of at least 3% for the full year 2015.
Our adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4%, with margin expansion of 80 basis points to 36.6%. Excluding the tower proceeds, cash flows from operations were up about 13% year-to-date, and free cash flow totaled $13.5 billion. We have added 3 million net postpaid Wireless subscribers, including total phone net adds of 613,000. Our new customer growth is high-quality, with 2.4 million new 4G smartphone customers and 2.5 million new 4G tablets.
We have also improved the quality of our postpaid base through upgrades and effective customer retention and have approximately 10 million more 4G smartphone customers than we did at the beginning of this year. In FiOS Broadband, we have added 319,000 new subscribers and 158,000 in FiOS video.
We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things to monetize usage on our networks and expand our revenue mix. In time, these incremental revenues will become more meaningful to our overall top line growth.
The launch of new products like Go90 and hum are examples of where we can monetize usage at the network and platforms layers, providing more diversity to future revenue streams.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess it's -- first of, let's start with the simple piece, which is some of it is just pure math. So when you look at this Wireless model and converting from a subsidized phone model to an in",927,"Sure, Simon. So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess it's -- first of, let's start with the simple piece, which is some of it is just pure math. So when you look at this Wireless model and converting from a subsidized phone model to an installment plan model, as we've been pretty transparent with all of you, there was a GAAP accounting that falsely increased the earnings of any company who adopted this model. And we've tried to be as transparent as possible, giving you the base line in the beginning, but that became more complicated. And what we said going forward is, look, the better measurement here is not service margin EBITDA, but regular EBITDA percent on total revenue because that kind of normalizes out the fact that we're now recording 100% of the revenue up front for the sale of equipment rather than a subsidy and then recouping that through service pricing over a period of time. So when you take that into consideration, as you plan out the curve on the installment sale and penetration of the base, and I said in my prepared comments, our base is -- 30% of our base is already on this new pricing. So as you go into '16 and your you get into that 50%, it starts to normalize out the earnings impact that has -- was accelerated through the year 2015. So I guess what I would say is, if you took out the impact of that in '15 and you look at '14 to '15 earnings growth, you probably get a more normal growth trend than what we're delivering in double-digit growth now. And then if you put that normalization to the '16, we've actually would have grown earnings, but because of the math exercise here, you're getting the flatness in that GAAP accounting. So that's part of it. The next piece of it is, as we've said also, with the divestiture of the Frontier properties in the South, these are classified as properties for discontinued operations. And for the year, we're anticipating that's going to be a $0.13 to $0.14 EPS lift because we discontinued the depreciation of those properties. So again, that has to get normalized out as we go into '16. So if you looked at it today, we're reporting $3.10 to date. We have about $0.11 of benefit, so it will be around $2.99 versus $2.65 of last year. The next thing is, if you look at the divestiture of those properties, as we've said, these are higher-margin properties. And since we are more of a centralized-cost-base company, we have a lot of allocations into those 3 properties. So as I've said before, when we announced the sale, we have this what we call stranded costs that we need to work out of the business since the time that we announced this. And look, I mean, I think we've proven a great track record here in Wireline that we know how to do this. I mean, if you look at year-over-year, we are down over 8,000 resources because of all the system enhancements and process improvements that we've made through processes and frontline execution on more online billing and so forth. So we know how to do this, and we've got about 5 more months to go. But we also have to consider the fact that we're in the middle of a labor negotiation, and some of those benefits won't be realized until we come to an agreement with the labor. So this is more of a timing issue on this one. We will realize those benefits. As you know, the last time we entered into a labor negotiation, we said that we would incur about $500 million worth of savings over the 3 years. And you can see that coming through the EBITDA of Wireline, so I think that's important. And then, of course, the last piece of this is, as you can see in our results this quarter, you're seeing more of a ramp incorporate for the start-up businesses. So as any start-up business goes, you'll incur losses up front because you're investing in the product development, you're investing in the marketing and the promotional event of that new business. And that's going to be a drag on earnings through '16 because the revenue will not catch up with the cost. So when you take all that into consideration, that's where Lowell was mentioning and forecasting more of a flat, if you will, or plateau for 2016. And just, Simon, on the update of the 600 megahertz, look, as you know, [indiscernible] buyers, the FCC did some forward part of the auction, which are expected to be due in January. And the whole purpose of this was to give the broadcasters a sense of what the bid would be that they would receive. And now the broadcasters have the chance to look at that and decide whether they're going to participate or not. I think one important thing here, though, too, is that after we saw the abuse in the AWS-3 auction by DISH, I think the FCC should learn from this and not give preferences to large corporations, award credits or set-asides, and the government shouldn't be in the business of picking winners and losers, let the consumer do that. So we'll have to see how the rules play out here. But at this point, we do plan to participate, but we'll see how the rules play out and then we'll go from there."

And then just second on the kind of -- as we kind of unfold the Go90 strategy and think about content acquisition, now that AT&T and DTV are together, is there any thought about revisiting Verizon's historical kind of conversations with the cable industry about maybe joining forces to try to work together on content and distribution and allocation of resources?"

So on the difference between the 22% on edge and the 30% on pricing. Obviously, as customers have fulfilled their contract over the 2-year period of time under the old subsidized model, those customers are free and always have been free to select whatever price plan they want, and we're allowing them to move to the new pricing because they fulfilled their contractual obligation under the old pricing. So in essence, they're bringing their previous device into the new pricing. So that's part of it. The other thing is that there is a little bit of a forward pricing here with current customers. And as we've talked before on calls, we have pretty diligent exercise where we go through our customer base, and we attack the high-value customers who we think will have a higher propensity to churn from us. So there is some proactiveness there, and I think you're seeing that come through on the reduction of churn through this year of 4 to 7 basis points. And I would anticipate that, going into the fourth quarter, you should consider us to be within that improvement on a year-over-year basis. Now given the fourth quarter is always generally a higher-churn quarter as it was last year, but we do believe that we will see a consistent improvement, as we have seen through the beginning of this year. Well, as far as Go90, look, Go90 is a very, very different product set. It's mobile-first, a social entertainment platform. Let me just talk a little bit about where we are here. But this really is just a totally different perspective than linear TV and content deals. And we know how to do that, and we've been doing that for 10 years with fios. But this is a very, very different platform. Keep in mind, we're 20 days into this. We actually haven't done any advertising or promotion activity around this product. So for early stages, we're seeing very good platform stability, we're seeing very encouraging feedback. And of course, we're looking at some very specific metrics here of what's the viewership, how many times do people revisit the site and what do the new shows capture. And if you haven't downloaded, I would encourage you to, because we now have over 10,000 assets in the product, we have 2 exclusive episodes, one is called Top Five Live, and the other one is called BETCH, B-E-T-C-H, and these are really starting to take form with the millennials. And we're starting to see a number of encouraging revisits to the platform on a daily basis to see what Top Five Live and BETCH are doing. And we have 48 more exclusive content deals coming that will be on this product before the end of the quarter. So Go90, right now, we're seeing very, very good up stage, but again, we really haven't started to advertise the platform. We do have entertainers tweeting the platform who are part of the platform, like Kanye West on his live show. So there's a lot happening in this platform. So we are really pleased with the initial stages, but this is very, very different than the legacy linear TV model. So I'll stop there, David. Thanks for the question."

So look, I mean, the TV environment this past quarter was extremely competitive and continues to be. Custom TV, though, actually, within the portfolio, is performing similar to what it did last quarter with the number of people choosing the product and the number of migrations that we have within the product. And of course, as we've said, this is going to put a little bit of top line pressure on fios growth. And the reason for that is the way you have to think about this is the new bundle is about $20 less than the average normal fios bundle. But the offset to that is we're also getting an incremental benefit in the content costs. So we're seeing an incremental margin gain by people selecting the Custom TV package. I think what's more important, though, is that consumers are speaking to the total linear environment that says they only want to pay for what they want to watch, and they don't want to pay for 300 channels when they watch only about 10% of those channels. So I think that's more important as to where the ecosystem is going. We will continue to support Custom TV. As we said, we know we have some disputes that we're working through. But Custom TV, right now, is doing what we thought it would do. As far as the growth perspective, I think, if you look at last quarter with the negative 625,000 negative ads, we continue to be positive, so we're gaining share. But look, the environment is millennials don't want linear TV content. They're disconnecting their cable for just Internet content and mobile content, and that goes to why we are launching Go90 with a mobile-first perspective, and that's attacking that entire segment that a fios brand does not attack today through a linear TV product."

So on the handset piece for upgrades, what I would say is we're anticipating a little less volume than last year because of the total iconic launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. But this quarter, I mean, we're still anticipating a fairly heavy volume quarter, as every fourth quarter is. But I would anticipate a little less than what we saw last year. So I would think that upgrades would be a little less than what we ran last year. As far as what we see from a take rate on installments going into 2016, look, at this point, we're guiding to 70% in the fourth quarter. We are now 100% at the point of sale with Edge only. Of course, we have an exemption for current customers who are on the subsidy model who can opt to take a new subsidized handset. So we'll have to see how that works going into 2016, and that may keep us around that 70% to 75% take rate, but it's too early to tell. So I don't really want to give guidance yet on what the take rate will be. Let's see how we come out of the fourth quarter, I'll readjust that in the first quarter."

So on the EIP, I mean, look, we've gone to the full Edge product. As I've said before, I'm not interested in a rental program. We're not seeing any impact from those programs from the competitors and our base and I think our results speak to that this quarter, and I think they'll speak to that in the fourth quarter as well. I think what you'll see is, if you speak to the rating agencies, they're becoming very concerned with the balance sheet risk of some of the industry on putting up rental phones on the balance sheet with what the residual value will be with those rental phones. So again, as I've said before, that's not something that we're entertaining at this point. Again, I never say, ""Never say never."" But that is not something that I would have an appetite for. On the prepaid decline, I think, look, generally, if you look at how postpaid and the price points of postpaid, and I've talked about this before, postpaid pricing is more or less mirroring what prepaid pricing was in the past. And we are seeing some migration of our prepaid product customers to postpaid, but it's more probably limited than some others because of our intense credit models. And you have to past the credit in order to become postpaid. But there is a segment of prepaid customers that are good credit customers that, now that the price point is closer to affordability for them on postpaid, they're moving into the postpaid products. So I don't really look into the prepaid product decline as a problem set for us at this point. We generally really compete with prepaid in our reseller model with companies like TracFone and Straight Talk and Straight Wireless. And that's where we really drive home the lower-end product without our brand connected to it. So -- and that -- although we don't disclose much in reseller anymore, that segment continues to perform well for us."

On the installment sale billings of 1.2%, yes, I do believe that will go lower as we make this transition into 50% of our base for installment sale. So the trend of service revenue and the installment billings plus the service is going to continue to decline until we get into that middle part, latter part of '16, where the curve will reverse, and then you'll  start to see that flatten down and start trending back up, just like the math would dictate."

As we head into 2016, both of the comparatively smaller carriers seem to be positioning themselves to be levering up here, albeit one of them synthetically through the lease company.

And even through all this competitiveness, the industry itself continues to grow. Even though everyone thinks that the industry is slowing, we continue to have net adds overall, tablets become a bigger piece, data continues to grow. So the industry, overall, although very competitive, continues to grow despite all of that. Our focus has always been competing on a network quality, reliability and simplicity, and that's how we have been winning for the past 18 years, and that's our focus going forward. And you can see that with our new brand campaign, Better Matters, because what we believe with our brand and our campaign is we're trying to send a message that although some say video and data are not as important and people are willing to get disrupted, I think if you talk to the millennials, the thing that frustrates them the most is the spinning wheel when they want to watch a video or download something. So our focus on our brand is better does matter. We have the best network. We are the most reliable, and we've become a more simple company to deal with, with our simplicity of pricing. So that's where we look to compete. I think the fourth quarter will be a competitive quarter as it always is every year. I think you're going to see promotions in the marketplace. And this industry is going to compete, as we always have. But I think our differentiation is how we differentiated ourselves through this whole entire process of installment sale and now rental. And as I said before, the rental programs don't seem to be having any impact or appeasing to our customers. So I would say that we will continue to do the same. As far as how the industry changes, I think what you're seeing from us is we're going in a different direction with our Go90 launch. I mean, we're appealing to a millennial population with our network and our products, and I do think that, as we said before, you can only price down so much and then you need to generate cash. And I think, as you said, some have to start generating cash in order to invest in their networks to support the growth of the data, or else, things are going to start to fall apart. And I think you're starting to see some of that in some of the national group metrics drive test on where some of the networks are starting to feel pressure and starting to fall down in the ranking. We continue to invest heavily in our networks, as I said before. You should continue to see us as a flat overall capital company, but Wireless continues to trend up, and that's important for the product set that we're launching. So I do think there will be more focus on returns and profitability, and that's good for the industry."

I think that, again, though, what I would say is we truly believe that WiFi is a complementary Wireless network, if you will, with LTE, and we don't believe one replaces the other. Just like when we launched LTE, we said, ""Look, it's not going to replace WiFi. It's not going to replace broadband into the home."" Similar, WiFi is not going to replace LTE.

And as you know, we deployed LTE contiguously on 700 megahertz. That doesn't mean that we can't operate with 600 megahertz, but 600 and 700 don't play well together, there's a lot of interference. So where we have 700, there will be a lot of work to deploy a 600 megahertz spectrum. But there is areas where we could use lower-band spectrum, but it's probably not the top priority. We like the higher brand like AWS. We've said that all along that Charlie is sitting on very good spectrum. It's very good for capacity, which is why we spent $10.4 billion in the auction. But we also can do things like we've done in Chicago and New York, where we felt the license cost was way too high, and we instead decided to deploy small cells and get capacity in a more reasonable, cheaper way, if you will. Now some of this spectrum will come back to market. We don't know how the FCC will treat that yet, so we'll just wait and see. But higher-frequency spectrum, it's capacity, and that's really what we need at this point in time. As far as the Wireline commitment, look, I think, with the 3 divestitures in the South, they were more or less footprints which were not contiguous to anything else. Most of that property was copper, not fiber. So when we look at the East Coast, it's a much different footprint. I mean, we'll have covered over 70% of the footprint with our fios product. This is a -- we are very committed to it. We're investing over $4 billion into the Wireline company a year, so that shows our commitment from a capital investment perspective. We've already passed 20 million homes when we committed to originally 18 million. So we are very committed to the fios product. It goes hand-in-hand with our Wireless strategy. And I think if you've asked anybody like [indiscernible], if you were going to come in and compete for fiber-into-the-home, you certainly would either pick the East Coast or the West Coast, and they've started with Cablevision in the East Coast. So we have a very viable footprint, and we're committed to that. Now, again, as I've always said, you never say never. And of course, Lowell and I are always open to new options, and we always keep our eyes open for that. But at this point, we're very committed to the Wireline business."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on the website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $0.99 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a noncash, pretax charge of $342 million or $0.05 per share for a pension remeasurement adjustment due to a settlement accounting threshold that was met in the third quarter.
Excluding the effect of this nonoperational item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.04 for the third quarter, compared with $0.89 a year ago, or growth of 16.9%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the third quarter of 2014.
Through the first 9 months, adjusted earnings totaled $3.10 per share, compared with $2.65 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would have been higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter.
On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate was about 14% for the first 9 months of 2015.
As a reminder, our Wireline results include the operations in the 3 states that we agreed to sell to Frontier. These operations will be included until the transaction closes, which we expect at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Also, as previously noted, we are no longer recording depreciation expense on these assets as they are classified as held for sale.
We continue to estimate that the full year 2015 earnings benefit of lower depreciation expense will be about $0.13 per share.
In terms of the AOL acquisition, which closed in late June, our third quarter consolidated results include the operations of AOL, which were reported as part of Corporate and Other. We have not restated prior history, so periods prior to the third quarter of 2015 will not include AOL results.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our business and deliver strong financial performance, while actively positioning the business for future growth and profitability. We are very committed to building the business for the future, and we are doing so through investments in our existing networks as well as the platforms that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new areas, like mobile video and the Internet of Things.
We continue to execute a disciplined capital allocation model. In addition to our consistent investment strategy, we are also committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
We've had a very active year with capital investments and spectrum purchases, which positioned us for the future growth, the strategic acquisition of AOL and the return of more than $11 billion in value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while remaining on track with our previously stated deleveraging plan.
In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.
On the operational front, our focus is to provide customers with consistent network reliability and a great customer experience, and we are competing very effectively in all parts of the business.
We once again delivered strong earnings growth and free cash flows. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability, with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net adds as well as net phone additions. Postpaid net adds totaled 1.3 million, which does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Net phone add additions were 430,000.
Customer retention was also a highlight, with postpaid churn of 0.93%, down 7 basis points from last year.
Total Wireless revenue grew 5.4%, and our EBITDA margin expanded. Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by fios revenue and customer growth, with sequential increases in both Internet and video subscribers. Our segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 50 basis points.
Now let's get into our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue was $33.2 billion, an increase of 5%, which as Mike indicated, includes revenues from AOL. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 3.1%.
Our consolidated revenues have been consistently driven by customer and usage growth in both Wireless and fios. Our overall revenue mix continues to change, driven by the unsubsidized equipment model, increasing video demand in Wireless and a higher mix of broadband and fios. As these trends evolve over the near term, we expect future revenue growth to result from increased video and Internet of Things traffic, enabling new business models in Wireless and continued broadband demand in Wireline.
In terms of our mobile video strategy, earlier this month, we were the first to market with the commercial launch of Go90, a differentiated mobile-first social entertainment platform. Go90 includes a broad selection of premium content and social engagement features and the capability for sharing and conversation around the content. The initial feedback has been strong with increasing engagement without significant promotion, and we have received positive industry recognition.
As Go90 develops, we will be adding more great content, features and advertising opportunities. You can expect a flow of product enhancements, creating a new ecosystem for digital creators and advertisers and a video consumption model that we can monetize in multiple ways.
AOL is expected to play a key role in the success of our video strategy. The acquisition of AOL significantly improves our digital media and advertising capabilities. These capabilities will be a key component of our video business model, which will be driven by digital mobile advertising in the future.
We are taking a strong leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we are creating an ecosystem that will foster innovation and expand the entire IoT market.
Here are a few examples of our early initiatives. In August, we announced the commercial availability of hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service, creating a connected-car driving experience that can operate in more than 150 million vehicles in the United States.
We are very active in smart city solutions market, and we have already announced a partnership with the City of Savannah, Georgia. Municipalities like Savannah are looking to take advantage of our intelligent solutions to integrate disparate systems, monitor traffic and safety conditions in real time to improve efficiency and public safety. These are just a few examples of the many opportunities we are pursuing.
We are very well positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both the ubiquity of mobile service and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. This will enable us to monetize usage through new commercial models, including data analytics and applications. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things continue to emerge and grow, with revenues of $175 million in the quarter and about $495 million year-to-date.
As our revenue mix expands, we are focused on improving the customer experience while reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. The focus on cost structure has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile.
Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion, up 7.5% on an adjusted basis, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 80 basis points to 35.8%.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Cash flows from operations were $9.5 billion in the third quarter and totaled $28.4 billion year-to-date. The 9-month total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring.
In the third quarter, we continue to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $2 billion in cash proceeds. Free cash flow for the first 9 months, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.4 billion in the quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date.
We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $112.3 billion of gross debt, net debt of $108.4 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4x.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless, on Slide 6.
In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.4% in the quarter to $23 billion. Service revenue up $17.6 billion, declined 4.1%, while equipment revenue increased to $4.3 billion, up 73%. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.2%. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured, and equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device installment plans increase and more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing.
In early August, we simplified our pricing structure, centered on the device installment model. The pricing change simplified the customer experience at the point-of-sale and provided a cleaner structure for managing their accounts. Existing customers can still choose to sign a 2-year service contract and remain on subsidized pricing when upgrading to a new device. Additionally, business customers do not generally select device installment plans.
Consistent with our expectations, the percentage of phone activations on installment plans grew to about 58% in the third quarter, compared with 49% in the second quarter and 12% in the third quarter of last year.
In the fourth quarter, we expect the percentage of phone activations on device installment plans to increase to around 70%. During the quarter, 5.6 million phones were activated on device installment plans. We have about 19 million device payment phone connections in total, representing approximately 22% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 30% of our postpaid phone customers are on unsubsidized service pricing.
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.2%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.4%, up from 49.5%. 
As we have said before, we believe a more relevant measure of profitability is EBITDA as a percentage of total Wireless revenue, which expanded to 43.2%, up 160 basis points. 
On a year-to-date basis, our EBITDA margin was 43.9%, up 100 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 110.8 million total retail connections. This total does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.9% to 105 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.7 million.
Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.93% in the quarter, compared with 1% a year ago.
Each quarter this year, we have improved our year-over-year postpaid churn rate between 4 and 7 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction.
Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.3 million were high-quality, with the sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 889,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 694,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 430,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 818,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 80,000.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.6 million in the quarter, down about 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations.
We ended the quarter with 71.5 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to more than 82% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 76% of our retail postpaid connections base.
As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage. Approximately 89% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by about 75% in the past year.
About 7% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. The quality of our overall postpaid phone base continues to improve. Through gross adds and upgrades, our 4G smartphone base has increased by roughly 34% in the past 12 months to 64.6 million. We still have a sizable 4G upgrade opportunity with roughly 15 million basic phones and nearly 7 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base.
Tablets are also underpenetrated in our postpaid base at only 10%. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.9 billion in the quarter and $8.5 billion year-to-date, up 8.4% from a year ago.
We continued to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's best reliability and to position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are focused on improving our network capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effective management of our spectrum inventory and further densification in urban markets.
Our densification program is progressing well and is achieving the capacity gains that we expected on the spectrum that is in service. For example, in Chicago, we are on our plan for small cell deployments, covering key locations with distributed antenna systems and expanding our in-building coverage. This has helped support approximately 75% data growth on the network while maintaining our #1 ranking in network quality, according to both internal and external competitive benchmark studies.
National studies continued to consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers: coverage and consistent reliable performance.
Densification is just one aspect of our network evolution strategy. We are working on centralizing network radio control to enhance capacity and provide operational efficiencies while beginning to implement a software-defined network architecture, laying the groundwork for new innovative services and applications.
We are extending our network leadership into 5G with our announcement several weeks ago that we are leading a technology forum with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standard development and appropriate requirements for the next generation of Wireless technology.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9.
In the consumer business, fios continues to be the driver of revenue growth and now represents 79% of consumer revenue. In the third quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.8% and mass markets, which includes small business, grew 1.8%.
As we expected, there was a change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory. The primary reason for the decline is driven by lower pay-TV subscriber growth and an increase in customers rightsizing their existing bundles.
While FiOS Broadband continues to grow, we are seeing a decline in the percentage of triple play customers. 
In addition, we continue to see interest in our Custom TV offering, which offers more choice and control at a lower price point. We expect the continued adoption of Custom TV will pressure revenue growth, but result in a higher contribution margin.
In the third quarter, fios consumer revenue grew 7.1%, driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. Our Quantum broadband service continues to scale, and because there are no content costs, has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, roughly 2/3 of our consumer fios Internet customers subscribe to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75-megabit speed tier, where 1/4 of our Quantum customers currently subscribe.
As I highlighted earlier, fios subscriber growth improved sequentially in the third quarter. In broadband, we added 114,000 net fios customers and now have a total of 6.9 million fios Internet subscribers, representing 41.7% penetration.
Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 2,000 in the quarter. In video, we added 42,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS Video subscribers, which represents 35.6% penetration.
We are working closely with Frontier to finalize the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California and to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and ensure a seamless transition.
We are making good progress and have secured for approvals from the DOJ, FCC and the State of Texas. We expect to close the deal at the end of the first quarter of 2016. 
As we prepare to divest of these properties, we are focused on reducing our shared cost structure post-transaction.
In addition, we will also take this opportunity to significantly reduce the broader cost structure of the entire Wireline business.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. 
In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 4.9%, and on a constant-currency basis was down about 3%. 
In our Global Wholesale business, revenues declined 5.1% in the third quarter. In both businesses, we continue to see similar trends impacting growth, with secular declines in legacy transport revenue and competitive price compression in other services. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.3% in the quarter. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5%, up 50 basis points, and on a year-to-date basis, expanded 20 basis points to 23.2%.
As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on expanding margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We will continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the features savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
Capital spending in the Wireline was $1.2 billion in the third quarter and totaled $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 18.6%. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. To wrap 2015, we have executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high-value customers and delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. We have also continued to consistently invest on our networks and platforms to position us for the future growth.
Our year-to-date consolidated revenue growth was 3.3% after adjusting for the inclusion of AOL this quarter and the sale of the public sector business in 2014. On the same basis, we continue to expect revenue growth of at least 3% for the full year 2015.
Our adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4%, with margin expansion of 80 basis points to 36.6%. Excluding the tower proceeds, cash flows from operations were up about 13% year-to-date, and free cash flow totaled $13.5 billion. We have added 3 million net postpaid Wireless subscribers, including total phone net adds of 613,000. Our new customer growth is high-quality, with 2.4 million new 4G smartphone customers and 2.5 million new 4G tablets.
We have also improved the quality of our postpaid base through upgrades and effective customer retention and have approximately 10 million more 4G smartphone customers than we did at the beginning of this year. In FiOS Broadband, we have added 319,000 new subscribers and 158,000 in FiOS video.
We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things to monetize usage on our networks and expand our revenue mix. In time, these incremental revenues will become more meaningful to our overall top line growth.
The launch of new products like Go90 and hum are examples of where we can monetize usage at the network and platforms layers, providing more diversity to future revenue streams.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess it's -- first off, let's start with the simple piece, which is some of it is just pure math. So when you look at this Wireless model and converting from a subsidized phone model to an i",927,"Sure, Simon. So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess it's -- first off, let's start with the simple piece, which is some of it is just pure math. So when you look at this Wireless model and converting from a subsidized phone model to an installment plan model, as we've been pretty transparent with all of you, there was a GAAP accounting that falsely increased the earnings of any company who adopted this model. And we've tried to be as transparent as possible, giving you the baseline in the beginning, but that became more complicated. And what we said going forward is, look, the better measurement here is not service margin EBITDA, but regular EBITDA percent on total revenue because that kind of normalizes out the fact that we're now recording 100% of the revenue up front for the sale of equipment rather than a subsidy and then recouping that through service pricing over a period of time. So when you take that into consideration, as you plan out the curve on the installment sale and penetration of the base, and I said in my prepared comments, our base is -- 30% of our base is already on this new pricing. So as you go into '16 and you get into that 50%, it starts to normalize out the earnings impact that has -- was accelerated through the year 2015. So I guess what I would say is, if you took out the impact of that in '15 and you look at '14 to '15 earnings growth, you probably get a more normal growth trend than what we're delivering in double-digit growth now. And then if you put that normalization to the '16, we actually would have grown earnings, but because of the math exercise here, you're getting the flatness in that GAAP accounting. So that's part of it. The next piece of it is, as we've said also, with the divestiture of the Frontier properties in the South, these are classified as properties for discontinued operations. And for the year, we're anticipating that's going to be a $0.13 to $0.14 EPS lift because we discontinued the depreciation of those properties. So again, that has to get normalized out as we go into '16. So if you looked at it today, we're reporting $3.10 to date. We have about $0.11 of benefit, so it will be around $2.99 versus $2.65 of last year. The next thing is, if you look at the divestiture of those properties, as we've said, these are higher-margin properties. And since we are more of a centralized-cost-base company, we have a lot of allocations into those 3 properties. So as I've said before, when we announced the sale, we have this what we call stranded costs that we need to work out of the business since the time that we announced this. And look, I mean, I think we've proven a great track record here in Wireline that we know how to do this. I mean, if you look at year-over-year, we are down over 8,000 resources because of all the system enhancements and process improvements that we've made through processes and frontline execution on more online billing and so forth. So we know how to do this, and we've got about 5 more months to go. But we also have to consider the fact that we're in the middle of a labor negotiation, and some of those benefits won't be realized until we come to an agreement with the labor. So this is more of a timing issue on this one. We will realize those benefits. As you know, the last time we entered into a labor negotiation, we said that we would incur about $500 million worth of savings over the 3 years. And you can see that coming through the EBITDA of Wireline, so I think that's important. And then, of course, the last piece of this is, as you can see in our results this quarter, you're seeing more of a ramp incorporate for the start-up businesses. So as any start-up business goes, you'll incur losses up front because you're investing in the product development, you're investing in the marketing and the promotional event of that new business. And that's going to be a drag on earnings through '16 because the revenue will not catch up with the cost. So when you take all that into consideration, that's where Lowell was mentioning and forecasting more of a flat, if you will, or plateau for 2016. And just, Simon, on the update of the 600 megahertz, look, as you know, applications [indiscernible] as buyers, the FCC did some forward part of the auction, which are expected to be due in January. And the whole purpose of this was to give the broadcasters a sense of what the bid would be that they would receive. And now the broadcasters have the chance to look at that and decide whether they're going to participate or not. I think one important thing here, though, too, is that after we saw the abuse in the AWS-3 auction by DISH, I think the FCC should learn from this and not give preferences to large corporations, award credits or set-asides, and the government shouldn't be in the business of picking winners and losers, let the consumer do that. So we'll have to see how the rules play out here. But at this point, we do plan to participate, but we'll see how the rules play out and then we'll go from there."

And then just second on the kind of -- as we kind of unfold the Go90 strategy and think about content acquisition, now that AT&T and DTV are together, is there any thought about revisiting Verizon's historical kind of conversations with the cable industry about maybe joining forces to try to work together on content and distribution and allocation of resources?"
415798,311053914,878170,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. Okay.

So on the difference between the 22% on edge and the 30% on pricing. Obviously, as customers have fulfilled their contract over the 2-year period of time under the old subsidized model, those customers are free and always have been free to select whatever price plan they want, and we're allowing them to move to the new pricing because they fulfilled their contractual obligation under the old pricing. So in essence, they're bringing their previous device into the new pricing. So that's part of it. The other thing is that there is a little bit of a forward pricing here with current customers. And as we've talked before on calls, we have pretty diligent exercise where we go through our customer base, and we attack the high-value customers who we think will have a higher propensity to churn from us. So there is some proactiveness there, and I think you're seeing that come through on the reduction of churn through this year of 4 to 7 basis points. And I would anticipate that, going into the fourth quarter, you should consider us to be within that improvement on a year-over-year basis. Now given the fourth quarter is always generally a higher-churn quarter as it was last year, but we do believe that we will see a consistent improvement, as we have seen through the beginning of this year. Well, as far as Go90, look, Go90 is a very, very different product set. It's mobile-first, a social entertainment platform. Let me just talk a little bit about where we are here. But this really is just a totally different perspective than linear TV and content deals. And we know how to do that, and we've been doing that for 10 years with fios. But this is a very, very different platform. Keep in mind, we're 20 days into this. We actually haven't done any advertising or promotion activity around this product. So for early stages, we're seeing very good platform stability, we're seeing very encouraging feedback. And of course, we're looking at some very specific metrics here of what's the viewership, how many times do people revisit the site and what do the new shows capture. And if you haven't downloaded, I would encourage you to, because we now have over 10,000 assets in the product, we have 2 exclusive episodes, one is called Top Five Live, and the other one is called BETCH, B-E-T-C-H, and these are really starting to take form with the millennials. And we're starting to see a number of encouraging revisits to the platform on a daily basis to see what Top Five Live and BETCH are doing. And we have 48 more exclusive content deals coming that will be on this product before the end of the quarter. So Go90, right now, we're seeing very, very good up stage, but again, we really haven't started to advertise the platform. We do have entertainers tweeting the platform who are part of the platform, like Kanye West on his live show. So there's a lot happening in this platform. So we are really pleased with the initial stages, but this is very, very different than the legacy linear TV model. So I'll stop there, David. Thanks for the question."

So look, I mean, the TV environment this past quarter was extremely competitive and continues to be. Custom TV, though, actually, within the portfolio, is performing similar to what it did last quarter with the number of people choosing the product and the number of migrations that we have within the product. And of course, as we've said, this is going to put a little bit of top line pressure on fios growth. And the reason for that is the way you have to think about this is the new bundle is about $20 less than the average normal fios bundle. But the offset to that is we're also getting an incremental benefit in the content costs. So we're seeing an incremental margin gain by people selecting the Custom TV package. I think what's more important, though, is that consumers are speaking to the total linear environment that says they only want to pay for what they want to watch, and they don't want to pay for 300 channels when they watch only about 10% of those channels. So I think that's more important as to where the ecosystem is going. We will continue to support Custom TV. As we said, we know we have some disputes that we're working through. But Custom TV, right now, is doing what we thought it would do. As far as the growth perspective, I think, if you look at last quarter with the negative 625,000 negative ads, we continue to be positive, so we're gaining share. But look, the environment is millennials don't want linear TV content. They're disconnecting their cable for just Internet content and mobile content, and that goes to why we are launching Go90 with a mobile-first perspective, and that's attacking that entire segment that a fios brand does not attack today through a linear TV product."

As far as what we see from a take rate on installments going into 2016, look, at this point, we're guiding to 70% in the fourth quarter. We are now 100% at the point of sale with Edge only. Of course, we have an exemption for current customers who are on the subsidy model who can opt to take a new subsidized handset. So we'll have to see how that works going into 2016, and that may keep us around that 70% to 75% take rate, but it's too early to tell.

So on the EIP, I mean, look, we've gone to the full Edge product. As I've said before, I'm not interested in a rental program. We're not seeing any impact from those programs from the competitors and our base and I think our results speak to that this quarter, and I think they'll speak to that in the fourth quarter as well. I think what you'll see is, if you speak to the rating agencies, they're becoming very concerned with the balance sheet risk of some of the industry on putting up rental phones on the balance sheet with what the residual value will be with those rental phones. So again, as I've said before, that's not something that we're entertaining at this point. Again, I never say, ""Never say never."" But that is not something that I would have an appetite for. On the prepaid decline, I think, look, generally, if you look at how postpaid and the price points of postpaid, and I've talked about this before, postpaid pricing is more or less mirroring what prepaid pricing was in the past. And we are seeing some migration of our prepaid product customers to postpaid, but it's more probably limited than some others because of our intense credit models. And you have to pass the credit in order to become postpaid. But there is a segment of prepaid customers that are good credit customers that, now that the price point is closer to affordability for them on postpaid, they're moving into the postpaid products. So I don't really look into the prepaid product decline as a problem set for us at this point. We generally really compete with prepaid in our reseller model with companies like TracFone and Straight Talk and Straight Wireless. And that's where we really drive home the lower-end product without our brand connected to it. So -- and that -- although we don't disclose much in reseller anymore, that segment continues to perform well for us."

On the installment sale billings of 1.2%, yes, I do believe that will go lower as we make this transition into 50% of our base for installment sale. So the trend of service revenue and the installment billings plus the service is going to continue to decline until we get into that middle part, latter part of '16, where the curve will reverse, and then you'll  start to see that flatten down and start trending back up, just like the math would dictate."

And even through all this competitiveness, the industry itself continues to grow. Even though everyone thinks that the industry is slowing, we continue to have net adds overall, tablets become a bigger piece, data continues to grow. So the industry, overall, although very competitive, continues to grow despite all of that. Our focus has always been competing on a network quality, reliability and simplicity, and that's how we have been winning for the past 18 years, and that's our focus going forward. And you can see that with our new brand campaign, Better Matters, because what we believe with our brand and our campaign is we're trying to send the message that although some say video and data are not as important and people are willing to get disrupted, I think if you talk to the millennials, the thing that frustrates them the most is the spinning wheel when they want to watch a video or download something. So our focus on our brand is better does matter. We have the best network. We are the most reliable, and we've become a more simple company to deal with, with our simplicity of pricing. So that's where we look to compete. I think the fourth quarter will be a competitive quarter as it always is every year. I think you're going to see promotions in the marketplace. And this industry is going to compete, as we always have. But I think our differentiation is how we differentiated ourselves through this whole entire process of installment sale and now rental. And as I said before, the rental programs don't seem to be having any impact or appeasing to our customers. So I would say that we will continue to do the same. As far as how the industry changes, I think what you're seeing from us is we're going in a different direction with our Go90 launch. I mean, we're appealing to a millennial population with our network and our products, and I do think that, as we said before, you can only price down so much and then you need to generate cash. And I think, as you said, some have to start generating cash in order to invest in their networks to support the growth of the data, or else, things are going to start to fall apart. And I think you're starting to see some of that in some of the national group metrics drive tests on where some of the networks are starting to feel pressure and starting to fall down in the ranking. We continue to invest heavily in our networks, as I said before. You should continue to see us as a flat overall capital company, but Wireless continues to trend up, and that's important for the product set that we're launching. So I do think there will be more focus on returns and profitability, and that's good for the industry."

And as you know, we deployed LTE contiguously on 700 megahertz. That doesn't mean that we can't operate with 600 megahertz, but 600 and 700 don't play well together, there's a lot of interference. So where we have 700, there would be a lot of work to deploy a 600 megahertz spectrum. But there is areas where we could use lower-band spectrum, but it's probably not the top priority. We like the higher band, like AWS. We've said that all along that Charlie is sitting on very good spectrum. It's very good for capacity, which is why we spent $10.4 billion in the auction. But we also can do things like we've done in Chicago and New York, where we felt the license cost was way too high, and we instead decided to deploy small cells and get capacity in a more reasonable, cheaper way, if you will. Now some of this spectrum will come back to market. We don't know how the FCC will treat that yet, so we'll just wait and see. But higher-frequency spectrum, it's capacity, and that's really what we need at this point in time. As far as the Wireline commitment, look, I think, with the 3 divestitures in the South, they were more or less footprints which were not contiguous to anything else. Most of that property was copper, not fiber. So when we look at the East Coast, it's a much different footprint. I mean, we'll have covered over 70% of the footprint with our fios product. This is a -- we are very committed to it. We're investing over $4 billion into the Wireline company a year, so that shows our commitment from a capital investment perspective. We've already passed 20 million homes when we committed to originally 18 million. So we are very committed to the fios product. It goes hand-in-hand with our Wireless strategy. And I think if you've asked anybody, like an Altice if you were going to come in and compete for fiber-into-the-home, you certainly would either pick the East Coast or the West Coast, and they've started with Cablevision in the East Coast. So we have a very viable footprint, and we're committed to that. Now, again, as I've always said, you never say never. And of course, Lowell and I are always open to new options, and we always keep our eyes open for that. But at this point, we're very committed to the Wireline business."

So Jonathan, on the enterprise piece, I guess, what I would say is we're seeing more or less the same. There's really been no change. I think there's a lot of competition, there's a lot of price compression continuing in the IP space. As we said before, the strategic side around security and data centers, but even within the data center space now, there's an awful lot of competition happening with price compression. So I think what you're seeing is the trend that we think will continue as we revamp the portfolio, if you will, and come into more of where we're going to willing to compete. So I think you're just going to see more of the same here. As far as the Wireless network and deployment of AWS, we're looking at probably in the '17, '18 time frame with that, similar to where LTE-U would be for starting in '16. And then, of course -- so that will continue to deploy there. And then on the phone-only where we would only get a LTE-only handset, probably more to the end of 2016 is where we're looking to deploy an LTE-only handset."

Thanks, Mike. I'd just like to close with a few key points.
So through the first 9 months, we have solidly executed on the fundamentals, delivering quality customer growth and strong financial results, while positioning the business for the future and returning value to shareholders. This execution has generated strong cash flows, enabling us to consistently invest in our networks, platforms, future growth and innovation. In addition, we've returned value to shareholders and maintained a strong balance sheet, keeping us on track with our deleveraging plans.
As I highlighted earlier, we have returned more than $11 billion to-date through dividends and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.
In September, our Board of Directors again reiterated their confidence with a 2.7% dividend increase, making this the ninth consecutive year of a dividend increase.
We look forward to maintaining our positive momentum in the fourth quarter as we execute our strategy, launch new products and services like Go90, positioning ourselves for future growth and creating value for customers and shareholders.
Thank you again for joining Verizon today."
