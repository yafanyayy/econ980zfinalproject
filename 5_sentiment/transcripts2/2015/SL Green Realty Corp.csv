I think you will all be fairly pleased with our abbreviated format for today's call, which follows our extremely fulsome investor presentation last month. I think that December's presentation was, by far, the strongest, most comprehensive one yet. And I think that, that was affirmed by the extremely positive feedback we got from shareholders and analysts since that day and as reflected in substantially in the stock price since that time as well. So we are still very much on track with a lot of the -- those objectives we put out there about 6 or 7 weeks ago. I think the market is forming up in a way, which will still enable us to be right on track with our fairly aggressive goals that we set for ourselves, and so I'll just take this opportunity now to highlight a few items occurring since that time before opening it up for Q&A. 
Last night, and pretty notably, we achieved a significant milestone in the One Vanderbilt entire process. After lengthy negotiations in numerous with Manhattanville President and her staff, the President has recommended approval of the project, inclusive of certain improvements we agreed to make. There continues to be strong community support from groups like the coalition for better Grand Central and straphangers campaign, both of which greatly helped us achieve this important milestone, along with many other groups for which we are thankful for the support. 
At the Investor conference in December, Rob Shefer explained in some detail that the ULURP process contains 4 key steps, the first being community board followed by the Manhattan President recommendation yesterday, then onto City Planning Commission and finally, City Council. Next week, we'll be presenting the project to the City Planning Commission, the third stop, at a hearing where we hope to receive significant support from all of the key stakeholders, unions, coalitions and civic groups. The Bureau President's approval gives us great momentum as we enter into the final stages of this process, and we remain confident that we will achieve our goal with special permit for One Vanderbilt this coming May, which is consistent with the timeline we set out for everybody in December. 
So turning now towards leasing. We obviously went through a fairly exhaustive amount of information on the portfolio in the market in December and that supported, I think, our contention that rents will be taking a fairly sizable step forward this year and into next year over the next 12 to 18 months. And I will say right now the market environment is such that it's forming up in a way that either leading or exceeding our expectations. Just since December 8, we signed about 230,000 square feet of leases and 18 different transactions back in the Manhattan portfolio. And as you saw for the quarter, fourth quarter, we were up about 13% or slightly more than that, mark-to-market and nearly 15% mark-to-market for the entire year 2014. So I would say that, that still the primary engine on the operating side, the core earnings side, of what we're looking to. And as I go through the pipeline with Steve Durels, we see that we've got, on top of that, another million one in the pipeline as we sit here today, that's as of the 28th, which is about 70-some-odd thousand feet out for signature, 0.5 million square feet of leasing in negotiation and then another 0.5 square feet that are pipeline deals in term sheet negotiations. So again, anytime that pipeline is -- exceeds or approaches a million square feet, I would call that fairly robust or the kinds of targets we had for the year, which Mehta from, if memory serves me right, about 1.8 million square feet for the year, and that's something that I think we still feel very good about given the demand that we see out there and the winnowing supply as the absorption of this market continues to accelerate.
We had a pleasant surprise at the end of the year, which I don't think has been fully -- had not been really communicated in a formal way to the market it as it relates to the suburban leasing activity. Since December 8, the investor meeting, there was 185,000 square feet of leasing. Since then, 122,000 square feet of that represent new leases, total of 19 transactions. And true to form, the suburban group signed 8 of those deals on December 31, right into New Year's eve. 8 different transactions, 60,000 feet, which will encompass in 85,000 feet, which made for quite a exclamation point on the end of the year for an improving suburban market outlook as we see it. And I think you saw some of the metrics relating to mark-to-market and occupancy also trended up in the fourth quarter, so that was good news. 
I think the leasing is also punctuated by 2 of the recent announcement this morning. The Swarovski deal at 10 East 53rd I think is an affirmation of the excellent job, the construction and design team, the leasing team, have done in repositioning and in redeveloping that asset in a way to capture these type of high-quality tenants. is our first new office tenant lease post-redevelopment, and that's on top of the equinox deal we announced previously for major fitness center in that building. So we still are very, very bullish on the prospects with 10 East 53rd this year. And on top of that, you heard -- many of you heard talked about significant mark-to-market in the retail portfolio back in December, and I think one great example of how we now monetize just a small piece. But a significant piece of that mark-to-market was with their announced diesel deal at 625 Madison with many more deals in the pipeline to come from the retail leasing side. So that was very strong. 
In the debt and preferred equity front, our balances remained roughly the same through year-end. I think that people saw a slight dip in the average yield reported on fourth quarter activity, that 8.3%. It's actually fairly consistent with our guidance of around 8.5%, and it's still leaves a portfolio that's averaging 10.5% on 1.4 billion. So I wouldn't get too overly focused on the quarterly ups and downs. We've had some quarters that exceeded 10%. This quarter was 8.3%. I would look to the average on the 1.4 billion at 10.5%. I think that's the best depiction of the earnings power that portfolio for the 2015. And by way of example, just already into this year, we've originated about $111 million of new debt and preferred equity investments, which have a yield of just slightly under 10% in the high 9. So again, that pipeline is still, we think, extremely strong. We have fairly lofty origination goals of adding an incremental $250 million to our net balances by the end of 2015, and that's an increment. That's on top of whatever the expected payoffs and redemptions are this year. So that could approximate activity, certainly in excess of $600 million of gross originations. And looking at a pipeline in front of you now, which is about a dozen deals or so, that would make a significant dent in the total and it's only January. So I think that's reflective of a market that's got a very high amount of transaction activity. And as a result of that transaction activity, it drives financing opportunities in that preferred equity investments for people like us. 
Lastly, Andrew Mathias talked about unlocking opportunity in the liability side of the balance sheet and talked about all the opportunities we saw to take higher rate debt either unsecured certain assets or terming out using lower, more efficient and 2 performs secured corporate bond financing available in today's market. And I think one example of where we've now monetized or illuminated that since the investor meeting is on 3 Columbus where we've signed a commitment with lender for $350 million financing at an interest rate of about 3.6%, which is locked to 10 years, which is a very -- we think a very good piece of financing in terms of both the repatriation of our substantial equity investment for that deal for a long-term lock in that are very advantageous level. And there's more of that to come if you remember when you extrapolate that through the whole portfolio. We showed you the kind of interest savings number that could be achieved on a full mark-to-market at today's rates. And today's rates are lower than what we projected back in December 8 due to the recent rise in treasury prices. So all in all, I think good news to report. It was a very good quarter. And as important, the prospects for 2015 look to be very much in line with how we hope to execute. 
And with that, I will turn it over for questions-and-answers."

There's only 5 spaces available in Midtown that are 250,000 square feet or greater compared to 10 units from a year ago. So from a supply side, certainly it's driving up fast. The number of the large leases that were assigned last year to give you the trend line, was dramatically larger. There were 58 leases signed last year for 100,000 square feet or more compared to 43 leases from the prior year. But more telling was the fact that there were 33 the relocations rather than just renewal deals compared to only 17 large leases the prior year, and those large block deals were 7.5 million square feet compared to 3.4 million square feet. So clearly from the demand side and also by the lack of supply makes us very bullish as to why there's going to be a premium on the big blocks."

So for example, we signed up a legal aid to close to 30,000 square-feet, coming in lock, which is a law firm for 55,000 feet, Sony for 53,000 feet.

As we sit right now, the one reason that we didn't include the press release covering large deal that we signed in early January with fiduciary trust for 126,000 square feet was generally reported in the local papers. So that was a deal we've been working on for quite awhile. It was for 3.5 base force of the building at rents that were well within our underwrite numbers. Leases with 302,000 square feet of remaining office space left in the building, which is about 24% of the office space. We have leases out on another 110,000 square feet of that availability, and then we have another close to 80,000 square feet of term sheets that were very hopeful we'll get converted into leases within the next couple of weeks. So basically completed, I'd say, 95% of the capital program. And as soon as we unveil the lobby, and if you've been through the building, you've seen the second half of the lobby that recently opened -- they really opened up the floodgates as far as tenant demand. And we were very optimistic and bullish on the project early last year. Now it's sort of the high 5 because everybody's coming through sort of 1 right after the other. And we're going -- and we closed everything that we're working at when we're down to only one base square left in the building. And beyond that, a smattering of partial spaces up in the tower. So we'll be -- we should have the building stabilized this year without too much fear. And rents are on the rise. And as we saw all last year, it's all financial services.

But until everything is sort of -- until we have everything isolated and identified, the premature is going to the numbers.

Our renewals as opposed to new transactions on space that's completely wrong, and this is a full confession packet. So I don't know that you can gleam a lot from the number from one quarter to the next. I'll tell you that wildly speaking, there seems to be greater willingness on tenants to absorb rent increases as opposed to a reduction of concessions. Concessions are slowly coming down a little bit. Certainly by comparisons 2 years ago they're down materially, but I think construction cost for tenants are building up, not only because commodity prices are up and labors up, but also because how much tenants have to spend as they intensify their offices. Their buildout, their needs are greater. More infrastructure, more furniture, more telecom. Everything just goes into putting a lot of people in the same piece of space. And therefore, that explains why the tenants are willing to pay more rent, but resistant to really knocking down the concession. So I think it's going to be a slower reduction in concessions over the year where we'll see alternatively a bigger pop in rents as the year goes forward."

And I think the last piece of that is then the investor demand driving cap rates to compressed, which I would think that's probably will be happening this year just based on the first 2 problems maintenance. Ian say that we can give you evidence or specifics to that effect, but you don't always want to be looking at the rearview mirror. So if you want to go out on the skis a little bit, make a bit of forecast, I would say you will start to see those cap rates compress this year."

It enhances our strategy of selectively disposing of assets. We did a substantial amount of dispositions in 2014 that was kind of punctuated by the almost $0.5 billion sales 180 Maiden Lane, which just closed, I think, this month. So that's a fairly significant deal right on the heels of 2 Herald, which I think also closed in the fourth quarter, December.  So we will continue to sell into that market. I don't think the 50 basis points means we'll sell more for less. I mean, we had a plan we're on plan. Maybe it means some of the margins were going to get some higher pricing. I don't think the 50 basis points of treasury is necessarily basis point for basis point equal to reduction in financing rates because when you get the low 3.5% for 10-year money, I think it starts to get a bit sticky in terms of what the absolute rate will be for tenure I/O money. But clearly, the financing rates have come in, and we'll take advantage of that on the liability side as Andrew talked about. It should add incrementally to the sales. And obviously, on our acquisitions, we're underwriting lower rates right now, so either higher leverage returns or it could drive pricing a bit further. But we tend to model on our underwriting. Everything is towards stabilized market. So we're never just taking the spot market cap rate and the spot market financing rate on acquisitions.
We're always modeling the curve. We often, on live, where we model the curve plus the 50 basis point cushion, which I think many of you know, some of you may not. We hold our exit cap rates pretty stable at levels far in excess of where the spot market to cap rates are today. And I think that hurts as a bit on cap rate, but it certainly protects us in the future against any kind of cap rate increase. And we keep our absolute level of returns pretty consistent looking to stabilize at 6% or more current cash returns and 8% to 10% on leverage returns. And that probably translates into 6.5% to 8% on levered returns. So that, I think, is not varying greatly because of the interest rates decline, but on the margins, it certainly so."

I mean, it's fairly low. It's a low consumer on the capital end of them as compared to the Manhattan portfolio, so that's certainly a great attraction to the portfolio and why I think it's always played a key role for us is that it's a relatively unencumbered portfolio. It's maintained occupancy in the low '80s I think since we acquired it sort of at a very tough period of time in 2007, in 2008. The capital budget for that portfolio is very manageable, and the market is picking up so it's a contributor to the bottom line. So we like that portfolio. It was proven down from a much larger portfolio at the time we originally closed on the western transaction, and we kept what we felt were the best properties in the best markets, and I think that proved to be true during the downturn. And we have a team of about 30 people up here that run this portfolio in White planes in Stanford that are I think best-in-class. So everything we do, there's no wholesale position to hold. There's no wholesale decision to sell. I think everything is -- we look at is fairly opportunistic. And if we can bring properties to stabilizations and a very strong big comes back in the markets and we have redeployment opportunities, then you'll see us execute on that program as we have in the past. But I don't see current conditions driving that significantly in one direction or the other. I think we're just going to continue with that."

So now, it's TAMI, legal and financial services and then followed by general business services. So you've got really 4 big groups providing diversification as far as tenant demand goes. On the financial service side, I think it's mostly the same as what we've seen for the past year, 1.5 years, which the profile of that group has been asset management, hedge funds, private equity, commercial banking. You haven't yet seen the really big banks and the investment banks active in the market. Although I think there's a couple of requirements kicking around today that weren't there a year, 1.5 years ago. Part of that is driven on the big investment banking requirements either by consolidations or lease expirations that are coming up. And a lot of brokers that I speak to are now, I think, generally have a shared view, which is that the banks are hopefully past understanding the regulation. Their New World environment, their short on space and nobody sitting on a lot of excess inventory. And they're sort of primed to start to come back and in the market as they figure out how they're going to grow their businesses. So think it's going to be a big contributor in the period to come."

I think you will all be fairly pleased with our abbreviated format for today's call, which follows our extremely fulsome investor presentation last month. I think that December's presentation was, by far, the strongest, most comprehensive one yet. And I think that, that was affirmed by the extremely positive feedback we got from shareholders and analysts since that day and as reflected not in substantially in the stock price since that time as well. So we are still very much on track with a lot of the -- those objectives we put out there about 6 or 7 weeks ago. I think the market is forming up in a way, which will still enable us to be right on track with our fairly aggressive goals that we set for ourselves, and so I'll just take this opportunity now to highlight a few items occurring since that time before opening it up for Q&A. 
Last night, and pretty notably, we achieved a significant milestone in the One Vanderbilt entitlement process. After lengthy negotiations and numerous meetings with Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer and her staff, the Borough President has recommended approval of the project, inclusive of certain improvements we have agreed to make. There continues to be strong community support from groups like the coalition for a better Grand Central, and the straphangers campaign, both of which greatly helped us achieve this important milestone, along with many other groups for which we are thankful for their support. 
At the Investor Conference in December, Rob Schiffer explained in some detail that the ULURP process contains 4 key steps: the first being the community board; followed by the Manhattan Borough President recommendation yesterday; then on to City Planning Commission; and finally, City Council. Next week, we'll be presenting the project to the City Planning Commission, the third stop, at a hearing where we hope to receive significant support from all of the key stakeholders, unions, coalitions and civic groups. The Borough President's approval gives us great momentum as we enter into the final stages of this process, and we remain confident that we'll achieve our goal with a special permit for One Vanderbilt this coming May, which is consistent with the timeline we set out for everybody in December. 
So turning now towards leasing. We obviously went through a fairly exhaustive amount of information on the portfolio in the market in December and that supported, I think, our contention that rents would be taking a fairly sizable step forward this year and into next year over the next 12 to 18 months. And I would say right now, the market environment is such that it's forming up in a way that's either needing or exceeding our expectations. Just since December 8, we've signed about 230,000 square feet of leases and 18 different transactions, that's in the Manhattan portfolio. And as you saw for the quarter, fourth quarter, we were up about 13% or slightly more than that, mark-to-market and nearly 15% mark-to-market for the entire year 2014. So I would say that, that's still the primary engine on the operating side, the core earnings side of what we're looking to. And as I go through the pipeline with Steve Durels, I see that we've got, on top of that, another million one in the pipeline as we sit here today, that's as of the 28th, which is about 70-some-odd thousand square feet out for signature, 0.5 million square feet of leasing in negotiation and then another 0.5 million square feet that are pipeline deals in term sheet negotiations. So again, anytime that pipeline is -- exceeds or approaches a million square feet, I would call that fairly robust or the kinds of targets we had for the year, which we added from, if memory serves me right, we're about at 1.8 million square feet for the year, and that's something that I think we still feel very good about given the demand that we see out there and the winnowing supply as the absorption in this market continues to accelerate.
We had a pleasant surprise at the end of the year, which I don't think has been fully -- had not been really communicated in a formal way to the market yet as it relates to the suburban leasing activity. Since December 8, the investor meeting, there was 185,000 square feet of leasing. Since then, 122,000 square feet of that representing new leases, total of 19 transactions. And true to form, the suburban group signed 8 of those deals on December 31, right into New Year's eve. 8 different transactions, 60,000 feet, which will encompass in that 185,000 feet, which made for quite a -- put quite an exclamation point on the end of the year for an improving suburban market outlook as we see it. And I think you saw some of the metrics relating to mark-to-market and occupancy also trended up in the fourth quarter, so that was good news. 
I think the leasing is also punctuated by 2 of the recent announcement this morning. The Swarovski deal at 10 East 53rd, I think is an affirmation of the excellent job, the construction and design team and leasing team have done in repositioning and in redeveloping that asset in a way to capture these type of high-quality profile tenants. Swarovski is our first new office tenant lease post-redevelopment, and that's on top of the Equinox deal we announced previously for major fitness center in that building. So we still are very, very bullish on the prospects with 10 East 53rd this year. And on top of that, you heard -- many of you heard Brett Herschenfeld talked about significant mark-to-market in the retail portfolio back in December, and I think one great example of how we've now monetize just a small piece. But a significant piece of that mark-to-market was with their announced Diesel deal at 625 Madison with many more deals in the pipeline to come from the retail leasing side. So that was very strong. 
In the debt and preferred equity front, our balances remained roughly the same through year-end. I think that people saw a slight dip in the average yield reported on fourth quarter activity, that 8.3%. It's actually fairly consistent with our guidance of around 8.5%, and it still leaves a portfolio that's averaging 10.5% on $1.4 billion. So I wouldn't get too overly focused on the quarterly ups and downs. We've had some quarters that exceeded 10%. This quarter was 8.3%. I would look to the average on the $1.4 billion at 10.5%. I think that's the best depiction of the earnings power that portfolio for 2015. And by way of example, just already into this year, we've originated about $111 million of new debt and preferred equity investments, which have a yield of just slightly under 10%, in the high-9%. So again, that pipeline is still, we think, extremely strong. We have fairly loft the origination goals of adding an incremental $250 million to our net balances by the end of 2015, and that's an increment. That's on top of whatever the expected payoffs and redemptions are this year. So that could approximate activity, certainly in excess of $600 million of gross originations. And looking at a pipeline in front of me now, which is about a dozen deals or so, that would make a significant dent in that total and it's only January. So I think that's reflective of a market that's got a very high amount of transaction activity. And as a result of that transaction activity, it drives financing opportunities in debt and preferred equity investments for people like us. 
Lastly, Andrew Mathias talked about unlocking opportunity in the liability side of the balance sheet, and talked about all the opportunities we saw to take higher rate debt either unsecured certain assets or terming out using lower, more efficient and 2 performs secured and/or corporate bond financing that's available in today's market. And I think one example of where we've now monetized or illuminated that since the investor meeting is on 3 Columbus where we've signed a commitment with a lender for $350 million financing at an interest rate of about 3.6%, which is locked for 10 years, which is a very -- we think a very good piece of financing in terms of both repatriation of our substantial equity investment into that deal for a long-term lock in of rates at a very advantageous level. And there's more of that to come as you remember when you extrapolate that through the whole portfolio. We showed you the kinds of interest savings number that could be achieved on a full mark-to-market at today's rates. And today's rates are lower than what we projected back in December 8 due to the recent rise in treasury prices. So all in all, I think good news to report. It was a very good quarter. And as important, the prospects for 2015 look to be very much in line with how we hope to execute. 
And with that, I will turn it over for questions-and-answers."

There were 58 leases signed last year for 100,000 square feet or more compared to 43 leases from the prior year.

As we sit right now, we -- the one reason we didn't put a press release out covering is because of large deal that we signed in early January with Fiduciary Trust for 126,000 square feet was generally reported in the local papers. So that was a deal that we've been working on for quite awhile. It was for 3.5 base force of the building at rents that were well within our underwrite numbers. Leases with 302,000 square feet of remaining office space left in the building, which is about 24% of the office space. We have leases out on another 110,000 square feet of that availability, and then we have another close to 80,000 square feet of term sheets that were very hopeful we'll get converted into leases within the next couple of weeks. So we've basically completed, I'd say, 95% of the capital program. And as soon as we unveil the lobby, and if you've been through the building and seen the second half of the lobby that recently opened, they really opened up the floodgates as far as tenant demand. And where we were very optimistic and bullish on the project early last year. Now it's sort of a high 5 because everybody's coming through sort of one right after another. And we're going -- and we closed everything that we're working, and we're down to the only one base floor left in the building. And beyond that, a smattering of partial spaces up in the tower. So we'll be -- we should have the building stabilized this year without too much fear. And rents are on the rise. And as we saw all last year, it's all financial services. Nothing but financial services."

So I don't know that you can gleam a lot from the number from one quarter to the next. I'll tell you that broadly speaking, there seems to be greater willingness on tenants to absorb rent increases as opposed to reduction of concessions. Concessions are slowly coming down a little bit. Certainly by comparison to 2 years ago, they're down materially, but I think construction cost for tenants are going up, not only because commodity prices are up and labors up, but also because how much tenants have to spend as they densify their offices. Their build out, their needs are greater. More infrastructure, more furniture, more telecom. Everything just goes into putting a lot of people in the same piece of space. And therefore, that explains why the tenants are willing to pay more rent, but are resistant to really knocking down the concession.

It enhances our strategy of selectively disposing of assets. We did a substantial amount of dispositions in 2014 that was kind of punctuated by the almost $0.5 billion sales of 180 Maiden Lane, which just closed, I think, this month. So that's a fairly significant deal right on the heels of 2 Herald, which I think also closed in the fourth quarter, December.  So we will continue to sell into that market. I don't think the 50 basis points means we'll sell more for less. I mean, we had a plan we're on plan. Maybe it means on the margins were going to get some higher pricing. I don't think the 50 basis points of treasury is necessarily basis point for basis point equal to reduction in financing rates because when you get the low 3.5% of -- for 10-year money, I think it starts to get a bit sticky in terms of what the absolute rate will be for 10-year I/O [ph] money. But clearly, the financing rates have come in, and we'll take advantage of that on the liability side as Andrew talked about. It'll -- it should add incrementally to the sales. And obviously, on our acquisitions, we're underwriting lower rates right now, so either higher leverage returns or it could drive pricing a bit further. But we're -- we tend to model on our underwriting. Everything is towards stabilized markets. So we're never just taking the spot market cap rate and the spot market financing rate on acquisitions. We're always modeling the curve. We often, on live, where we model the curve plus the 50 basis point cushion, which I think many of you know, some of you may not. We hold our exit cap rates pretty stable at levels far in excess of where the spot market to cap rates are today. And I think that hurts us a bit on cap rate, but it certainly protects us in the future against any kind of cap rate increase. And we keep our absolute level of returns pretty consistent, looking to stabilize at 6% or more current cash returns and 8% to 10% levered returns. And that probably translates into 6.5% to 8% on levered returns. So that, I think, is not varying greatly because of the interest rate decline, but on the margins, it certainly so."

I mean, it's fairly low. It's a low consumer on the capital end of things as compared to the Manhattan portfolio, so that's certainly a great attraction to the portfolio, and why I think it's always played a key role for us is that it's a relatively unencumbered portfolio. It's maintained occupancy in the low 80s, I think since we acquired it, sort of at a very tough period of time in 2007, 2008. The capital budget for that portfolio is very manageable, and the market is picking up so it's a contributor to the bottom line. So we like that portfolio. It was proven down from a much larger portfolio at the time we originally closed on the Lexington [ph] transaction, and we kept what we felt were the best properties in the best markets, and I think that proved to be true during the downturn. And we have a team of about 30 people up there that run this portfolio in White Plains in Stanford that are, I think best-in-class and -- so everything we do, there's no wholesale decision to hold. There's no wholesale decision to sell. I think everything is -- we look at is fairly opportunistic. And if we can bring properties to stabilizations and a very strong bid comes back in the market and we have redeployment opportunities, then I think you'll see us execute on that program as we have in the past.

So now it's TAMI, legal and financial services and then followed by general business services. So you've got really 4 big groups providing diversification as far as tenant demand goes. On the financial service side, I think it's mostly the same as what we've seen for the past year, 1.5 years, which the profile of that group has been asset management, hedge funds, private equity, commercial banking. You haven't yet seen the really big banks and the investment banks active in the market. Although I think there's a couple of requirements kicking around today that weren't there 1 year, 1.5 years ago. And part of that is driven on the big investment banking requirements either by consolidations or lease expirations that are coming up. And a lot of brokers that I speak to are now, I think, generally have a shared view, which is that the banks are hopefully past understanding the regulation. Their new world environment, their short on space and nobody sitting on a lot of excess inventory. And they're sort of primed to start to come back into the market as they figure out how they're going to grow their businesses.

I think you will all be fairly pleased with our abbreviated format for today's call, which follows our extremely fulsome investor presentation last month. I think that December's presentation was, by far, the strongest, most comprehensive one yet. And I think that, that was affirmed by the extremely positive feedback we got from shareholders and analysts since that day and as reflected not insubstantially in the stock price since that time as well. So we are still very much on track with a lot of the -- those objectives we put out there about 6 or 7 weeks ago. I think the market is forming up in a way, which will still enable us to be right on track with our fairly aggressive goals that we set for ourselves, and so I'll just take this opportunity now to highlight a few items occurring since that time before opening it up for Q&A. 
Last night, and pretty notably, we achieved a significant milestone in the One Vanderbilt entitlement process. After lengthy negotiations and numerous meetings with Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer and her staff, the Borough President has recommended approval of the project, inclusive of certain improvements we have agreed to make. There continues to be strong community support from groups like the coalition for a better Grand Central, and the straphangers campaign, both of which greatly helped us achieve this important milestone, along with many other groups for which we are thankful for their support. 
At the Investor Conference in December, Rob Schiffer explained in some detail that the ULURP process contains 4 key steps: the first being the local community board; followed by the Manhattan Borough President recommendation yesterday; then on to City Planning Commission; and finally, City Council. Next week, we'll be presenting the project to the City Planning Commission, the third stop, at a hearing where we hope to receive significant support from all of the key stakeholders, unions, coalitions and civic groups. The Borough President's approval gives us great momentum as we enter into the final stages of this process, and we remain confident that we'll achieve our goal with a special permit for One Vanderbilt this coming May, which is consistent with the timeline we set out for everybody in December. 
So turning now towards leasing. We obviously went through a fairly exhaustive amount of information on the portfolio in the market in December and that supported, I think, our contention that rents would be taking a fairly sizable step forward this year and into next year over the next 12 to 18 months. And I would say right now, the market environment is such that it's forming up in a way that's either meeting or exceeding our expectations. Just since December 8, we've signed about 230,000 square feet of leases and 18 different transactions that's in the Manhattan portfolio. And as you saw for the quarter, fourth quarter, we were up about 13% or slightly more than that, mark-to-market and nearly 15% mark-to-market for the entire year 2014. So I would say that, that's still the primary engine on the operating side, the core earnings side of what we're looking to. And as I go through the pipeline with Steve Durels, I see that we've got, on top of that, another million one in the pipeline as we sit here today, that's as of the 28th, which is about 70-some-odd thousand square feet out for signature, 0.5 million square feet of leasing in negotiation and then another 0.5 million square feet that are pipeline deals in term sheet negotiations. So again, anytime that pipeline is -- exceeds or approaches a million square feet, I would call that fairly robust for the kinds of targets we had for the year, which we added [ph] from, if memory serves me right, we're about at 1.8 million square feet for the year, and that's something that I think we still feel very good about given the demand that we see out there and the winnowing supply as the absorption in this market continues to accelerate.
We had a pleasant surprise at the end of the year, which I don't think has been fully -- had not been really communicated in any formal way to the market yet as it relates to the suburban leasing activity. Since December 8, the investor meeting, there was 185,000 square feet of leasing. Since then, 122,000 square feet of that representing new leases, total of 19 transactions. And true to form, the suburban group signed 8 of those deals on December 31, right into New Year's eve. 8 different transactions, 60,000 feet, which were encompassed in that 185,000 feet, which made for quite a -- put quite an exclamation point on the end of the year for an improving suburban market outlook as we see it. And I think you saw some of the metrics relating to mark-to-market and occupancy also trended up in the fourth quarter, so that was good news. 
I think the leasing is also punctuated by 2 of the recent announcements this morning. The Swarovski deal at 10 East 53rd, I think is an affirmation of the excellent job, the construction and design team and leasing team have done in repositioning and in redeveloping that asset in a way to capture these type of high-quality profile tenants. Swarovski is our first new office tenant lease post-redevelopment, and that's on top of the Equinox deal we announced previously for a major fitness center in that building. So we still are very, very bullish on the prospects with 10 East 53rd this year. And on top of that, you heard -- many of you heard Brett Herschenfeld talked about significant mark-to-market in the retail portfolio back in December, and I think one great example of how we've now monetized just a small piece. But a significant piece of that mark-to-market was with their announced Diesel deal at 625 Madison with many more deals in the pipeline to come from the retail leasing side. So that was very strong. 
In the debt and preferred equity front, our balances remained roughly the same through year-end. I think that people saw a slight dip in the average yield reported on fourth quarter activity, that 8.3%. It's actually fairly consistent with our guidance of around 8.5%, and it still leaves a portfolio that's averaging 10.5% on $1.4 billion. So I wouldn't get too overly focused on the quarterly ups and downs. We've had some quarters that exceeded 10%. This quarter was 8.3%. I would look to the average on the $1.4 billion at 10.5%. I think that's the best depiction of the earnings power of that portfolio for 2015. And by way of example, just already into this year, we've originated about $111 million of new debt and preferred equity investments, which have a yield of just slightly under 10%, in the high-9%. So again, that pipeline is still, we think, extremely strong. We have fairly lofty origination goals of adding an incremental $250 million to our net balances by the end of 2015, and that's an increment that's on top of whatever the expected payoffs and redemptions are this year. So that could approximate activity, certainly in excess of $600 million of gross originations. And looking at a pipeline in front of me now, which is about a dozen deals or so, that would make a significant dent in that total and it's only January. So I think that's reflective of a market that's got a very high amount of transaction activity. And as a result of that transaction activity, it drives financing opportunities in debt and preferred equity investments for people like us. 
Lastly, Andrew Mathias talked about unlocking opportunity in the liability side of the balance sheet, and talked about all the opportunities we saw to take higher rate debt and either unsecure certain assets or term it out using lower, more efficient and cheaper forms of secured and/or corporate bond financing that's available in today's market. And I think one example of where we've now monetized or illuminated that since the investor meeting is on 3 Columbus where we've signed a commitment with a lender for $350 million financing at an interest rate of about 3.6%, which is locked for 10 years, which is a very -- we think a very good piece of financing in terms of both repatriation of our substantial equity investment into that deal for a long-term lock in of rates at a very advantageous level. And there's more of that to come as you remember when you extrapolate that through the whole portfolio. We showed you the kinds of interest savings number that could be achieved on a full mark-to-market at today's rates. And today's rates are lower than what we projected back in December 8 due to the recent rise in treasury prices. So all in all, I think good news to report. It was a very good quarter. And as important, the prospects for 2015 look to be very much in line with how we hope to execute. 
And with that, I will turn it over for questions-and-answers."

There's only 5 spaces available in Midtown that are 250,000 square feet or greater compared to 10 units from a year ago. So from a supply side, certainly, it's drying up fast. The number of large leases that were signed last year sort of give you the trend line, it was dramatically larger. There were 58 leases signed last year for 100,000 square feet or more compared to 43 leases from the prior year. But more telling was the fact that there were 33 relocations rather than just renewal deals compared to only 17 large leases the prior year, and those large block deals were 7.5 million square feet compared to 3.4 million square feet. So clearly from the demand side and an offset by the lack of supply makes us very bullish as to why there's going to be a premium on the big blocks."

We signed probably 3 or 4 leases north of 50,000 square feet, so there are also larger tenants coming back into the market as well, and that's driving both occupancy and mark-to-market, both of which have been really, really positive. So for example, we signed up Legal Aid for close to 30,000 square feet; Cummings & Lockwood, which is a law firm for 55,000 feet; Sony for 53,000 feet. So it's a cross -- it's really across-the-board, and this is the first time in the last 2 to 3 years that we've seen positive direction from different tenant types.

As we sit right now, we -- the only reason we didn't put a press release out covering is because of large deal that we signed in early January with Fiduciary Trust for 126,000 square feet was generally reported in the local papers. So that was a deal that we've been working on for quite awhile. It was for 3.5 base floors of the building at rents that were well within our underwrite numbers. Leases with 302,000 square feet of remaining office space left in the building, which is about 24% of the office space. We have leases out on another 110,000 square feet of that availability, and then we have another close to 80,000 square feet of term sheets that were very hopeful we'll get converted into leases within the next couple of weeks. So we've basically completed, I'd say, 95% of the capital program. And as soon as we unveil the lobby, and if you've been through the building and seen the second half of the lobby that recently opened, they really opened up the floodgates as far as tenant demand. And where we were very optimistic and bullish on the project early last year, now it's sort of high 5 because everybody's coming through sort of one right after another. And we're going to -- if we closed everything that we're working on, we'd be down to the -- only one base floor left in the building. And beyond that, a smattering of partial spaces up in the tower. So we'll be -- we should have the building stabilized this year without too much fear. And rents are on the rise. And as we saw all last year, it's all financial services. Nothing but financial services."

But until everything is sort of -- until we have everything isolated and identified, the premature is start going through numbers. But you can certainly look back and see what our acquisition costs are for the assemblage, and that's the bulk of the cost. But then, obviously, there's all the public realm improvements we've been pretty specific on, it's $210 million of costs associated with public realm improvements. And then obviously, a lot of predevelopment possession cost on top of that, which, like I said, when it's all settled, we'll be able to give a better picture of."

The windows have all been replaced, the facade's been recolored, a lot of the infrastructure work's been done and we've got very strong tour activity. From the mix of type of tenants, I'd say for 2/3 of the space on the floors, that are the 9,000 footers, it's primarily financial services and international companies. And then downstairs on the few floors that are a little bit larger, 16,000-foot floors, those are more general service businesses.

So I don't know that you can gleam a lot from the number from one quarter to the next. I'll tell you that broadly speaking, there seems to be greater willingness on tenants to absorb rent increases as opposed to reduction of concessions. Concessions are slowly coming down a little bit. Certainly by comparison to 2 years ago, they're down materially, but I think construction cost for tenants are going up, not only because commodity prices are up and labor's up, but also because how much tenants have to spend as they densify their offices. Their build out, their needs are greater. More infrastructure, more furniture, more telecom. Everything just goes into putting a lot of people in the same piece of space. And therefore, that explains why the tenants are willing to pay more rent, but are resistant to really knocking down the concession. So I think it's going to be a slower reduction in concessions over the year where we'll see alternatively a bigger pop in rents as the year goes forward."

Can't say that we can give you evidence or specifics to that effect, but if -- you don't always want to be looking at the rearview mirror. So if you want to go out on the skis a little bit, make a sort of -- make a bit of a forecast, I would say you will start to see those cap rates compress this year."

It enhances our strategy of selectively disposing of assets. We did a substantial amount of dispositions in 2014 that was kind of punctuated by the almost $0.5 billion sale of 180 Maiden Lane, which just closed, I think, this month. So that's a fairly significant deal right on the heels of 2 Herald, which I think also closed in the fourth quarter, December.  So we will continue to sell into that market. I don't think the 50 basis points means we'll sell more for less. I mean, we had a plan we're on plan. Maybe it means on the margins we're going to get some higher pricing. I don't think the 50 basis points of treasury is necessarily basis point for basis point equal to reduction in financing rates because when you get below 3.5% for 10-year money, I think it starts to get a bit sticky in terms of what the absolute rate will be for 10-year I/O [ph] money. But clearly, the financing rates have come in, and we'll take advantage of that on the liability side as Andrew talked about. It'll -- it should add incrementally to the sales. And obviously, on our acquisitions, we're underwriting lower rates right now, so either higher leverage returns or it could drive pricing a bit further. But we're -- we tend to model on our underwriting. Everything is towards stabilized markets. So we're never just taking the spot market cap rate and the spot market financing rate on acquisitions. We're always modeling the curve. We often, on live, where we model the curve plus the 50 basis point cushion, which I think many of you know, some of you may not. We hold our exit cap rates pretty stable at levels far in excess of where the spot market for cap rates are today. And I think that hurts us a bit on cap rate, but it certainly protects us in the future against any kind of cap rate increase. And we keep our absolute level of returns pretty consistent, looking to stabilize at 6% or more current cash returns and 8% to 10% levered returns. And that probably translates into 6.5% to 8% on levered returns. So that, I think, is not varying greatly because of the interest rate decline, but on the margins, it's certainly so."

I mean, it's fairly low -- it's a low consumer on the capital end of things as compared to the Manhattan portfolio, so that's certainly a great attraction to the portfolio, and why I think it's always played a key role for us is that it's a relatively unencumbered portfolio. It's maintained occupancy in the low 80s, I think since we acquired it, sort of at a very tough period of time in 2007, 2008. The capital budget for that portfolio is very manageable, and the market is picking up so it's a contributor to the bottom line. So we like that portfolio. It was proven down from a much larger portfolio at the time we originally closed on the Reckson transaction, and we kept what we felt were the best properties in the best markets, and I think that proved to be true during the downturn. And we have a team of about 30 people up there that run this portfolio in White Plains and Stanford that are, I think best-in-class and -- so everything we do, there's no wholesale decision to hold. There's no wholesale decision to sell. I think everything is -- we look at as fairly opportunistic. And if we can bring properties to stabilizations and a very strong bid comes back in the market and we have redeployment opportunities, then I think you'll see us execute on that program as we have in the past. But I don't see current conditions driving that significantly in one direction or the other. I think we're just going to continue with that [ph]."

So now it's TAMI, legal and financial services and then followed by general business services. So you've got really 4 big groups providing diversification as far as tenant demand goes. On the financial service side, I think it's mostly the same as what we've seen for the past year, 1.5 years, which is the profile of that group has been asset management, hedge funds, private equity, commercial banking. You haven't yet seen the really big banks and the investment banks active in the market. Although I think there's a couple of requirements kicking around today that weren't there 1 year, 1.5 years ago. And part of that is driven on the big investment banking requirements either by consolidations or lease expirations that are coming up. And a lot of the brokers that I speak to are now, I think, generally have a shared view, which is that the banks are hopefully past understanding the regulation. Their new world environment, they're short on space and nobody's sitting on a lot of excess inventory. And they're sort of primed to start to come back into the market as they figure out how they're going to grow their businesses. So we're -- we think that's going to be a big contributor in the period to come."

We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly 4 months into the new year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG's year-to-date p",1134,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly 4 months into the new year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG's year-to-date performance in essentially two words: Leasing velocity. As of today, we have concluded over 900,000 square feet of commercial leasing in over 60 individual lease transactions. Most notable among these by size are the leases to Bloomberg, at 919 Third Avenue; Franklin Templeton, a new advisory at 280 Park Avenue; and We Work at 315 West 36 Street, a balance of financial, media and technology uses. It seems likely that having completed this amount of transactions in less than 4 months, we are on track to exceed our full year leasing projections. The Manhattan office and retail leasing teams are taking full advantage of vacancies in the growth portfolio and rolling up markets -- rolling up Winston market in the stabilized portfolio and also by taking advantage of our deeply embedded mark-to-market in our retail portfolio. And by doing this, it should allow us to meet or exceed this year's goals by laying the foundation for a strong future growth in 2016 and beyond when these newly signed leases generally kick in. 
Clearly, this market is benefiting from overall Midtown vacancy rates of under 9.5% on leasing activity that is on pace for between 35 million and 40 million square feet of new and renewal leasing this year. 
From an employment perspective, the first quarter of 2015 was the strongest quarter since the year 2000. New York City added 16,400 office using jobs. And the distribution of jobs among the 3 primary office using sectors: Professional and business services; financial activities; and information, were about equal. Usually, professional and business services accounts for most of the increase in office using jobs of late. But you can see now that's equally distributed between the 3 main office using sectors. 
The good news for our shareholders is that the leasing pipeline also remains robust even after coming out of engaged storm in 2015. We now have over 500,000 square feet of leased documents that are either out for signature or are pending and being negotiated. That compares with about 575,000 square feet at the same time last quarter and to the fourth quarter. And you see how we were able to convert these opportunities into signed lease transactions and then some. These leasing achievements helped to drive a 3% same-store NOI increase in the first quarter that was actually ahead of our budget and is expected to be exceeded for the balance of the year, such that we feel on track to meet our goal of between 3.5% and 4% for the full year. 
On the investments front, we were active closing out year end deals, like the additional ownership interest that we acquired in 800 Third Avenue and the closing of the Stonehenge residential portfolio, along with a successful disposition of 180 Maiden Lane and the net new origination of about $145 million of structured finance investments. This net investment activity, along with the unencumbering of 711 Third Avenue, enabled us to access the ATM and DRiP for modest amounts of equity, issuances that were completed to continue to improve our balance sheet. This steady improvement resulted in an upgrade in credit rating to investment grade for Moody's and an outlook upgrade from S&P.
For the balance of the year, we are expecting to rollout several assets for sale, which will be used in large measure to fund our pipeline of investments for the year without reliance on larger equity issuances.
Turning now to other main objectives for the second quarter and balance of the year, we continue to move forward through the approvals process in support of the Vanderbilt corridor rezoning, and to obtain a special permit for the development of a new commercial tower at One Vanderbilt Avenue. The project has the support of the President, City Planning Commission and our partner organizations at the coalition for a better Grand Central. We are now before city council, which is expected to vote for the project in May, at which point the land review process will be concluded. And we hope and expect that we'll receive this special permit that we've been working on for some period of time now, as most of you know.
Other company recognitions just to make note during the year -- I'm sorry during the first quarter, actually, actually this was just in the past three [ph] months. SL Green was recently recognized by the U.S. EPA as a 2015 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year on Monday, April 20, during its award ceremony in Washington, D.C. And we got that award for sustained excellence in energy efficiency and the development of market-leading sustainability programs. So we're very proud of that, not only proud of the performance of the company, the balance sheet and then our stock price, but proud to be able to achieve all of that while doing it in a very responsible and environmentally sustainable way, which has now been recognized at a federal level.
Also as I think many or most of you know at this point, we were given admittance, if you will, into the S&P 500, which I think is basically a confirmation of the strategies and direction that we have taken with this company over the period of years to grow and diversify -- diversify within our market, and create a level of size, stability performance and return that we think is now on par with some of the best and biggest public companies on the New York Stock Exchange. And for that, we're very pleased and proud. 
So that is a quick snapshot of how we're looking at this market as its shaping up now. I would say it's basically on par or slightly better than our comments to you back in December at the investor conference, which you remember we have focused on basically 10 drivers of growth. I think those drivers of growth are evidencing themselves in a significant degree. And I think we've called the market fairly correctly for our shareholders, which we tried to do because we look as much as we're in this market, we view that we only have maybe a 6 to 9 to 12-month advantage over people not as deep in this market. So we always want to be as transparent and as early with you on how we see market trends developing. And I think, as I said, the first four months of the year, I think we've called it pretty well, so we're happy with that. And with that, we'll take your questions."

And we compared again some of the more opportunistic or value-added opportunities we're looking at. And in those instances, we try to cycle out of the more mature properties and into the less mature core property in this market, because anything that's been sold over the last 2 or 3 years or likely is being sold today, certainly has the potential for significant appreciation in the next 3 to 5 years.

We didn't put those numbers out there without some thought as to which assets we intended to try and dispose of and the timing that we thought would be the optimal timing to do so because in some cases, we're trying to get some leasing done right at the wire before we introduce it to the market.

And then residential, generally, I would say we've been looking at structured type deals, similar type of off market deals, the market to retail deals are very difficult for us to compete on. But opportunities like 605 West 42nd Street, which we closed up at the end of last year and the Stonehenge portfolio, which we closed up in the first quarter of this year are getting most of our attention. We're side of agnostic as to what sector we deploy that capital. And we look more in terms of risk return for any individual deals and mash them up with each other. We're not willing to take lower returns really in any of the sectors. We're trying to take the highest return on the capital be to play so we can find those higher returns across all the sectors, plus structured finance, is where we'll focus the capital."

We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly 4 months into the new year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG's year-to-date p",1136,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly 4 months into the new year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG's year-to-date performance in essentially 2 words: Leasing velocity.
As of today, we have concluded over 900,000 square feet of commercial leasing in over 60 individual lease transactions. Most notable among these by size are the leases to Bloomberg at 919 Third Avenue; Franklin Templeton, a new advisory at 280 Park Avenue; and WeWork at 315 West 36th Street, a balance of financial, media and technology uses. It seems likely that having completed this amount of transactions in less than 4 months, we are on track to exceed our full year leasing projections.
The Manhattan office and retail leasing teams are taking full advantage of vacancies in the growth portfolio and rolling up markets -- really what brings to [ph] market in the stabilized portfolio and also by taking advantage of our deeply embedded mark-to-market in our retail portfolio. And by doing this, it should allow us to meet or exceed this year's goals while laying the foundation for a strong future growth in 2016 and beyond when these newly signed leases generally will kick in. Clearly, this market is benefiting from overall Midtown vacancy rates of under 9.5% on leasing activity that is on pace for between 35 million and 40 million square feet of new and renewal leasing this year.
From an employment perspective, the first quarter of 2015 was the strongest quarter since the year 2000. New York City added 16,400 office-using jobs. And the distribution of jobs among the 3 primary office-using sectors, professional and business services, financial activities and information, were about equal. Usually, professional and business services accounts for most of the increase in office-using jobs of late. But you can see now that's equally distributed between the 3 main office-using sectors.
The good news for our shareholders is that the leasing pipeline also remains robust even after coming out of the gate strong [ph] in 2015. We now have over 500,000 square feet of leased documents that are either out for signature or are pending and being negotiated. That compares with about 575,000 square feet at the same time last quarter and to the fourth quarter. And you see how we were able to convert these opportunities into signed lease transactions and then some.
These leasing achievements helped to drive a 3% same-store NOI increase in the first quarter that was actually ahead of our budget and is expected to be exceeded for the balance of the year, such that we feel on track to meet our goal of between 3.5% and 4% for the full year.
On the investments front, we were active closing out year-end deals, like the additional ownership interest that we acquired in 800 Third Avenue and the closing of the Stonehenge residential portfolio, along with the successful disposition of 180 Maiden Lane and the net new origination of about $145 million of structured finance investments.
This net investment activity, along with the unencumbering of 711 Third Avenue, enabled us to access the ATM and DRIP for modest amounts of equity, issuances that were completed to continue to improve our balance sheet. This steady improvement resulted in an upgrade in credit rating to investment grade for Moody's and an outlook upgrade from S&P. For the balance of the year, we are expecting to rollout several assets for sale which will be used in large measure to fund our pipeline of investments for the year without reliance on larger equity issuances.
Turning now to other main objectives for the second quarter and balance of the year. We continue to move forward through the approvals process in support of the Vanderbilt Corridor rezoning and to obtain a special permit for the development of a new commercial tower at One Vanderbilt Avenue.
The project has the support of the Borough President, Borough City Planning Commission and our partner organizations at the coalition for a better Grand Central. We are now before the city council, which is expected to vote upon the project in May, at which point', the land review process will be concluded. And we hope and expect that we'll receive this special permit that we've been working on for some period of time now, as most of you know.
Other company recognitions, just to make note, during the year -- I'm sorry, during the first quarter actually. This is just in the past 3 months. SL Green was recently recognized by the U.S. EPA as a 2015 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year on Monday, April 20, during its award ceremony in Washington, D.C. And we got that award for sustained excellence in energy efficiency and the development of market-leading sustainability programs.
So we're very proud of that, not only proud of the performance of the company, the balance sheet and in our stock price, but proud to be able to achieve all of that while doing it in a very responsible and environmentally sustainable way, which has now been recognized at a federal level.
Also, as I think many or most of you know at this point, we were given admittance, if you will, into the S&P 500, which I think is basically a confirmation of the strategies and direction that we've taken with this company over the period of years to grow and diversify, but diversify within our market, and create a level of size, stability performance and return that we think is now on par with some of the best and biggest public companies on the New York Stock Exchange. And for that, we're very pleased and proud.
So that is a quick snapshot of how we're looking at this market as it's shaping up now. I would say it's basically on par or slightly better than our comments to you back in December at the investor conference, which, you remember, we have focused on basically 10 drivers of growth. I think those drivers of growth are evidencing themselves in a significant degree.
And I think we've called the market fairly correctly for our shareholders, which obviously we try to do because we look -- as much as we're in this market, we view that maybe we only have maybe a 6- to 9- to 12-month advantage over people not as deep in this market. So we always want to be as transparent and as early with you on how we see market trends developing. And I think, as I said, the first 4 months of the year, I think we've called it pretty well, so we're happy about that. And with that, we'll take your questions."

I would say, from the tenant profile perspective, financial services seem to be more active today than any time in the past couple of years. As we look at our leases that are out right now, 9 of our 10 largest leases that were negotiated are financial service related businesses. And there doesn't seem to be a pocket in town where there is a dearth of activity. It's just -- it's really guns blazing across all submarkets. And we've been pushing rents up sort of every 30, 45 days, as far as where our take [ph] in rents are in most of our buildings. So I don't think it's unique to our portfolio.

So clearly, it sort of depends on what rolls [ph] when, some of the leases we're signing or we're signing for vacancy, not for replacement leases. So I think at this point, we're going to stay with 10% to 12%. It certainly seems like there could be upside to that number based on the velocity and based on the first quarter's result. But other than just a hunch, I couldn't tell you that we've gone through each of the remaining 200 and some odd leases we expect to sign for the remainder of the year and figured out, a, which one of those are in the mark-to-market pool; and b, how it will affect the first quarter.

So I think we feel good with those numbers. That's -- we have several assets that are just now -- one in the market, several more that we intend to introduce at the market. All extremely good assets. But again, these are assets where we look at the sort of average growth trend in these assets over the next 5 to 7 to 10 years, 3 to 5 years. And we compared again some of the more opportunistic or value-added opportunities that we're looking at. And in those instances, we try to cycle out of the more mature properties and into the less mature chart [ph] to core any property maturing in this market because anything that's been sold over the last 2 or 3 years or likely is being sold today certainly has the potential for significant appreciation in the next 3 to 5 years. But maybe not the same rate as the opportunities we're looking at. And that's how we're calling out the portfolio. So on that basis, we'll probably look to do some complete dispositions and/or strategic JVs of assets that we think will get us up to or over the $600 million guidance for the year, I think our plan still is to meet or exceed that. And I would say the same for Suburban. So we didn't put those numbers out there without some forethought as to which assets we intended to try and dispose of and the timing that we thought would be the optimal timing to do so because in some cases, we're trying to get some leasing done right at the wire before we introduce it to the market.

So I think that's a good assumption. I can't say exactly because we have pipeline of many, many buildings and we're talking about selling a number of buildings, so there's timing issues and everything else. But the goal is certainly to try and fund the new acquisitions predominantly with the net proceeds of sale on a tax efficient basis, doing 1031 where possible, and then either tweaking up or down with debt or equity, if necessary, based on the timing and the volume. So -- but I mean, that's -- I think that's the way we've always done it, so there's no change in that front. And traditionally, we've been net growers, so it has required, on a net basis, some amount more of debt and equity.

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly 4 months into the new year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG's",1134,":  
          Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly 4 months into the new year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG's year-to-date performance in essentially 2 words: Leasing velocity.
As of today, we have concluded over 900,000 square feet of commercial leasing in over 60 individual lease transactions. Most notable among these by size are the leases to Bloomberg at 919 Third Avenue; Franklin Templeton, a new advisory at 280 Park Avenue; and WeWork at 315 West 36th Street, a balance of financial, media and technology uses. It seems likely that having completed this amount of transactions in less than 4 months, we are on track to exceed our full year leasing projections.
The Manhattan office and retail leasing teams are taking full advantage of vacancies in the growth portfolio and rolling up markets -- rolling up rents to market in the stabilized portfolio and also by taking advantage of our deeply embedded mark-to-market in our retail portfolio. And by doing this, it should allow us to meet or exceed this year's goals while laying the foundation for a strong future growth in 2016 and beyond when these newly signed leases generally will kick in. Clearly, this market is benefiting from overall Midtown vacancy rates of under 9.5% on leasing activity that is on pace for between 35 million and 40 million square feet of new and renewal leasing this year.
From an employment perspective, the first quarter of 2015 was the strongest quarter since the year 2000. New York City added 16,400 office-using jobs. And the distribution of jobs among the 3 primary office-using sectors, professional and business services, financial activities and information, were about equal. Usually, professional and business services accounts for most of the increase in office-using jobs of late. But you can see now that's equally distributed between the 3 main office-using sectors.
The good news for our shareholders is that the leasing pipeline also remains robust even after coming out of the gate strong in 2015. We now have over 500,000 square feet of leased documents that are either out for signature or are pending and being negotiated. That compares with about 575,000 square feet at the same time last quarter and to the fourth quarter. And you see how we were able to convert these opportunities into signed lease transactions and then some.
These leasing achievements helped to drive a 3% same-store NOI increase in the first quarter that was actually ahead of our budget and is expected to be exceeded for the balance of the year, such that we feel on track to meet our goal of between 3.5% and 4% for the full year.
On the investments front, we were active closing out year-end deals, like the additional ownership interest that we acquired in 800 Third Avenue and the closing of the Stonehenge residential portfolio, along with the successful disposition of 180 Maiden Lane and the net new origination of about $145 million of structured finance investments.
This net investment activity, along with the unencumbering of 711 Third Avenue, enabled us to access the ATM and DRIP for modest amounts of equity, issuances that were completed to continue to improve our balance sheet. This steady improvement resulted in an upgrade in credit rating to investment grade for Moody's and an outlook upgrade from S&P. For the balance of the year, we are expecting to rollout several assets for sale which will be used in large measure to fund our pipeline of investments for the year without reliance on larger equity issuances.
Turning now to other main objectives for the second quarter and balance of the year. We continue to move forward through the approvals process in support of the Vanderbilt Corridor rezoning and to obtain a special permit for the development of a new commercial tower at One Vanderbilt Avenue.
The project has the support of the Borough President Brewer, City Planning Commission and our partner organizations at the coalition for a better Grand Central. We are now before the city council, which is expected to vote upon the project in May, at which point, the land review process will be concluded. And we hope and expect that we'll receive this special permit that we've been working on for some period of time now, as most of you know.
Other company recognitions, just to make note, during the year -- I'm sorry, during the first quarter actually. This is just in the past 3 months. SL Green was recently recognized by the U.S. EPA as a 2015 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year on Monday, April 20, during its award ceremony in Washington, D.C. And we got that award for sustained excellence in energy efficiency and the development of market-leading sustainability programs.
So we're very proud of that, not only proud of the performance of the company, the balance sheet and in our stock price, but proud to be able to achieve all of that while doing it in a very responsible and environmentally sustainable way, which has now been recognized at a federal level.
Also, as I think many or most of you know at this point, we were given admittance, if you will, into the S&P 500, which I think is basically a confirmation of the strategies and direction that we've taken with this company over the period of years to grow and diversify, but diversify within our market, and create a level of size, stability performance and return that we think is now on par with some of the best and biggest public companies on the New York Stock Exchange. And for that, we're very pleased and proud.
So that is a quick snapshot of how we're looking at this market as it's shaping up now. I would say it's basically on par or slightly better than our comments to you back in December at the investor conference, which, you remember, we have focused on basically 10 drivers of growth. I think those drivers of growth are evidencing themselves in a significant degree.
And I think we've called the market fairly correctly for our shareholders, which obviously we try to do because we look -- as much as we're in this market, we view that maybe we only have maybe a 6- to 9- to 12-month advantage over people not as deep in this market. So we always want to be as transparent and as early with you on how we see market trends developing. And I think, as I said, the first 4 months of the year, I think we've called it pretty well, so we're happy about that. And with that, we'll take your questions."

          Well, the answer is yes, we are considering JV alternatives for that asset. And I think the question will just be when -- shovel is in the ground already, I mean, in terms of -- just starting some interior demolition. So the big money spend starts in probably 2017 and beyond. And by then, I think we'll have determined our capitalization of the project with or without a JV partner. But obviously, it's a high consideration right now. Although sitting here in early 2015, it's being financed right now out of cash flow, and it's not something that needs to be, in our opinion, dealt with right now. Nor should it necessarily be because I think there's -- real value will be created between now and call it, the next 12 to 24 months."

          Well, if you break apart the various submarkets, you've seen strength across the board, both on the small space type tenant, but also on the big tenants and on the high price point tenants. I would say, from the tenant profile perspective, financial services seem to be more active today than any time in the past couple of years. As we look at our leases that are out right now, 9 of our 10 largest leases that were negotiated are financial service related businesses. And there doesn't seem to be a pocket in town where there is a dearth of activity. It's just -- it's really guns blazing across all submarkets. And we've been pushing rents up sort of every 30, 45 days, as far as where our taking rents are in most of our buildings. So I don't think it's unique to our portfolio. I hear the same thing back from the brokerage community, which I think is one of the big things to understand that the brokers are out there telling their clients that the balance is shifting towards the landlords, that the market is rising and they don't see it slowing down in the near to intermediate future."

But also, the profile of the tenant that's going into those high rent paying buildings have extraordinarily expensive buildouts.

We've been focused on attending to '17 maturities if we can early, so we are considering alternatives."

          I wouldn't -- we just gave this guidance like 3.5 months ago. So in prep for today's call, we did not go back through all of the goals, if you will, to reassess. So I can't sit here now and say whether -- well, you're saying it's 12%, but we usually give a range, so it's at 10% to 12%. So is it 10% to 12%? Yes, as we sit here high, well, first quarter, it was, I guess, 17%, so that's clearly higher. I don't think we are projecting 17% as run rate. So clearly, it sort of depends on what rolls when, some of the leases we're signing, we're signing for vacancy, not for replacement leases. So I think at this point, we're going to stay with 10% to 12%. It certainly seems like there could be upside to that number based on the velocity and based on the first quarter's result. But other than just a hunch, I couldn't tell you that we've gone through each of the remaining 200 and some-odd leases we expect to sign for the remainder of the year and figured out, a, which one of those are a, in the mark-to-market pool; and b, how it will affect the first quarter. So it certainly seems like there could be some upside there, but it would be premature of us to say that. And we'll just -- maybe by mid-year, Steve will have like better feel for that when we start to reforecast for the balance of the year, and I think we'll have a better sense. But this early on, I would say, if -- nothing else, trending towards the higher end of that range."

And we don't have dispositions, just probably [ph] FFO, and $100 million for Suburban. So I think we feel good with those numbers. That's -- we have several assets that are just now -- one in the market, several more that we intend to introduce at the market. All extremely good assets. But again, these are assets where we look at the sort of average growth trend in these assets over the next 5 to 7 to 10 years, 3 to 5 years. And we compare it against some of the more opportunistic or value-added opportunities that we're looking at. And in those instances, we try to cycle out of the more mature properties and into the less mature. It's hard to call any property mature in this market because anything that's been sold over the last 2 or 3 years or likely is being sold today certainly has the potential for significant appreciation in the next 3 to 5 years. But maybe not at the same rate as the opportunities we're looking at. And that's how we're culling out the portfolio. So on that basis, we'll probably look to do some complete dispositions and/or strategic JVs of assets that we think will get us up to or over the $600 million guidance for the year, I think our plan still is to meet or exceed that. And I would say the same for Suburban. So we didn't put those numbers out there without some forethought as to which assets we intended to try and dispose of and the timing that we thought would be the optimal timing to do so because in some cases, we're trying to get some leasing done right at the wire before we introduce it to the market. So I think we're still on that kind of trajectory. And again, we can revisit mid-year once we have a better sense of the reception to the market at the prices we'll be asking."

          Sure. I think in terms of the size of the portfolio, I think at the end of last year, we said we'd be up about $250 million kind of year-over-year. I think that still holds -- if anything, we're kind ahead of budget right now, but we know there's a lot of repayments coming in the second half of the year. Yields have -- in the market generally, I think they continue to compress. We've been able to kind of outperform the expectations that we set at the beginning of the -- or I guess, the end of last year. But it's kind of too early to tell what the entire year is going to look like. There's a lot of competition out there. But through relationships and kind of the different approaches I laid out at the end of the year, we've been able to kind of keep our volumes up, and we're very bullish about the forecast for the rest of the year."

          Well, a couple of things. There are 2 different products as far as the building that Bloomberg signed at. But I can tell you is, broadly speaking, the availability of large blocks of space, and let's define that as being 250,000 square feet or more, you can count on one hand. And if you're looking for 0.5 million square feet, then maybe there's 2 of them in Midtown. So the big block premium that tenants are confronted with having to pay on a -- from a rent perspective is definitely back in the market. And I would expect it to sort of excel as the year goes by because there's not going to be a lot of inventory coming online for big block space. WeWork's building, different animal, side street, and it sort of fell into the fringe area of Midtown South kind of the hotspot where the TAMI-type businesses want to be. And that's the kind of look and feel that WeWork likes to associate themselves with. So I can't really comment specifically to the rents but would tell you that the rents that we got on the building were well in excess of underwriting when we bought the building and well in excess of what we would've budgeted 18 months ago."

She's seasoned, she's been involved with a lot of big company boards and brings a level of experience that's different from the traditional local finance and real estate experience that probably exists on the SL Green board. She really comes out of the technology sector, if you will, in venture capital sector. And given the amount of importance we put on those sectors in today's market from a tenancy perspective if nothing else, we think that she can add a lot of value in terms of her role as a corporate governance board member, but also in terms of her knowledge and relationships and ability to access the kind of tenants in this market where we would like to have a bigger presence with.

They are side street locations as part of the building. And we've had discussions with Four Seasons. They'd be a wonderful addition to the property if it were to come that way. But we're certainly not counting on them coming over to the building. We're out in the market talking to a number of restaurateurs. And now that the development work is essentially complete at the property and we're well down the road on the office lease up, we're turning our attentions to try and to find the right restaurateur or restaurateurs to fill those 2 spaces. So we view it more as a element of the development plan to add the right look and feel and amenity to the building at street level, as opposed to a typical retail addition to a property which is a big NOI contributor."

Those are 2 big office deals in the market. There are smaller office deals as well. Retail, most of our focus continues to be on off-market deals. We don't really chase and bid marketed deals much on the retail side, unless we think we have a very specific and unique angle on a deal. And then residential, generally, I would say we've been looking at structured-type deals, similar type of off-market deals. The marketed retail deals are very difficult for us to compete on. But opportunities like 605 West 42nd Street, which we closed up the end of last year, and the Stonehenge portfolio, which we closed up in the first quarter of this year, are getting most of our attention. We're side of agnostic as to what sector we deploy the capital in. And we look more in terms of risk return for any individual deal and match them up with each other. We're not willing to take lower returns really in any of the sectors. We're trying to get the highest return on the capital we deploy, so wherever we can find those higher returns across all the sectors plus structured finance is where we'll focus the capital."

We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly 4 months into the new year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG's year-to-date p",1134,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly 4 months into the new year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG's year-to-date performance in essentially 2 words: Leasing velocity.
As of today, we have concluded over 900,000 square feet of commercial leasing in over 60 individual lease transactions. Most notable among these by size are the leases to Bloomberg at 919 Third Avenue; Franklin Templeton, a new advisory at 280 Park Avenue; and WeWork at 315 West 36th Street, a balance of financial, media and technology uses. It seems likely that having completed this amount of transactions in less than 4 months, we are on track to exceed our full year leasing projections.
The Manhattan office and retail leasing teams are taking full advantage of vacancies in the growth portfolio and rolling up markets -- rolling up rents to market in the stabilized portfolio and also by taking advantage of our deeply embedded mark-to-market in our retail portfolio. And by doing this, it should allow us to meet or exceed this year's goals while laying the foundation for a strong future growth in 2016 and beyond when these newly signed leases generally will kick in. Clearly, this market is benefiting from overall Midtown vacancy rates of under 9.5% on leasing activity that is on pace for between 35 million and 40 million square feet of new and renewal leasing this year.
From an employment perspective, the first quarter of 2015 was the strongest quarter since the year 2000. New York City added 16,400 office-using jobs. And the distribution of jobs among the 3 primary office-using sectors, professional and business services, financial activities and information, were about equal. Usually, professional and business services accounts for most of the increase in office-using jobs of late. But you can see now that's equally distributed between the 3 main office-using sectors.
The good news for our shareholders is that the leasing pipeline also remains robust even after coming out of the gate strong in 2015. We now have over 500,000 square feet of leased documents that are either out for signature or are pending and being negotiated. That compares with about 575,000 square feet at the same time last quarter and to the fourth quarter. And you see how we were able to convert these opportunities into signed lease transactions and then some.
These leasing achievements helped to drive a 3% same-store NOI increase in the first quarter that was actually ahead of our budget and is expected to be exceeded for the balance of the year, such that we feel on track to meet our goal of between 3.5% and 4% for the full year.
On the investments front, we were active closing out year-end deals, like the additional ownership interest that we acquired in 800 Third Avenue and the closing of the Stonehenge residential portfolio, along with the successful disposition of 180 Maiden Lane and the net new origination of about $145 million of structured finance investments.
This net investment activity, along with the unencumbering of 711 Third Avenue, enabled us to access the ATM and DRIP for modest amounts of equity, issuances that were completed to continue to improve our balance sheet. This steady improvement resulted in an upgrade in credit rating to investment grade for Moody's and an outlook upgrade from S&P. For the balance of the year, we are expecting to rollout several assets for sale which will be used in large measure to fund our pipeline of investments for the year without reliance on larger equity issuances.
Turning now to other main objectives for the second quarter and balance of the year. We continue to move forward through the approvals process in support of the Vanderbilt Corridor rezoning and to obtain a special permit for the development of a new commercial tower at One Vanderbilt Avenue.
The project has the support of the Borough President Brewer, City Planning Commission and our partner organizations at the coalition for a better Grand Central. We are now before the city council, which is expected to vote upon the project in May, at which point, the land review process will be concluded. And we hope and expect that we'll receive this special permit that we've been working on for some period of time now, as most of you know.
Other company recognitions, just to make note, during the year -- I'm sorry, during the first quarter actually. This is just in the past 3 months. SL Green was recently recognized by the U.S. EPA as a 2015 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year on Monday, April 20, during its award ceremony in Washington, D.C. And we got that award for sustained excellence in energy efficiency and the development of market-leading sustainability programs.
So we're very proud of that, not only proud of the performance of the company, the balance sheet and in our stock price, but proud to be able to achieve all of that while doing it in a very responsible and environmentally sustainable way, which has now been recognized at a federal level.
Also, as I think many or most of you know at this point, we were given admittance, if you will, into the S&P 500, which I think is basically a confirmation of the strategies and direction that we've taken with this company over the period of years to grow and diversify, but diversify within our market, and create a level of size, stability performance and return that we think is now on par with some of the best and biggest public companies on the New York Stock Exchange. And for that, we're very pleased and proud.
So that is a quick snapshot of how we're looking at this market as it's shaping up now. I would say it's basically on par or slightly better than our comments to you back in December at the investor conference, which, you remember, we have focused on basically 10 drivers of growth. I think those drivers of growth are evidencing themselves in a significant degree.
And I think we've called the market fairly correctly for our shareholders, which obviously we try to do because we look -- as much as we're in this market, we view that maybe we only have maybe a 6- to 9- to 12-month advantage over people not as deep in this market. So we always want to be as transparent and as early with you on how we see market trends developing.

I would say, from the tenant profile perspective, financial services seem to be more active today than any time in the past couple of years. As we look at our leases that are out right now, 9 of our 10 largest leases that were negotiated are financial service related businesses. And there doesn't seem to be a pocket in town where there is a dearth of activity. It's just -- it's really guns blazing across all submarkets. And we've been pushing rents up sort of every 30, 45 days, as far as where our taking rents are in most of our buildings. So I don't think it's unique to our portfolio.

So our OpEx was high in the first quarter as it has traditionally been, particularly high given New York had another cold, wet winter. The reimbursement revenues bleed in on a lag basis.

So I can't sit here now and say whether -- well, you're saying it's 12%, but we usually give a range, so it's at 10% to 12%. So is it 10% to 12%? Yes, as we sit here high, well, first quarter, it was, I guess, 17%, so that's clearly higher. I don't think we are projecting 17% as run rate. So clearly, it sort of depends on what rolls when, some of the leases we're signing, we're signing for vacancy, not for replacement leases. So I think at this point, we're going to stay with 10% to 12%. It certainly seems like there could be upside to that number based on the velocity and based on the first quarter's result. But other than just a hunch, I couldn't tell you that we've gone through each of the remaining 200 and some-odd leases we expect to sign for the remainder of the year and figured out, a, which one of those are a, in the mark-to-market pool; and b, how it will affect the first quarter. So it certainly seems like there could be some upside there, but it would be premature of us to say that. And we'll just -- maybe by mid-year, Steve will have like better feel for that when we start to reforecast for the balance of the year, and I think we'll have a better sense.

So I think we feel good with those numbers. That's -- we have several assets that are just now -- one in the market, several more that we intend to introduce at the market. All extremely good assets. But again, these are assets where we look at the sort of average growth trend in these assets over the next 5 to 7 to 10 years, 3 to 5 years. And we compare it against some of the more opportunistic or value-added opportunities that we're looking at. And in those instances, we try to cycle out of the more mature properties and into the less mature. It's hard to call any property mature in this market because anything that's been sold over the last 2 or 3 years or likely is being sold today certainly has the potential for significant appreciation in the next 3 to 5 years. But maybe not at the same rate as the opportunities we're looking at. And that's how we're culling out the portfolio. So on that basis, we'll probably look to do some complete dispositions and/or strategic JVs of assets that we think will get us up to or over the $600 million guidance for the year, I think our plan still is to meet or exceed that. And I would say the same for Suburban. So we didn't put those numbers out there without some forethought as to which assets we intended to try and dispose of and the timing that we thought would be the optimal timing to do so because in some cases, we're trying to get some leasing done right at the wire before we introduce it to the market. So I think we're still on that kind of trajectory. And again, we can revisit mid-year once we have a better sense of the reception to the market at the prices we'll be asking."

We're out in the market talking to a number of restaurateurs. And now that the development work is essentially complete at the property and we're well down the road on the office lease up, we're turning our attentions to try and to find the right restaurateur or restaurateurs to fill those 2 spaces. So we view it more as an element of the development plan to add the right look and feel and amenity to the building at street level, as opposed to a typical retail addition to a property which is a big NOI contributor."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to take you through our second quarter results which are certainly representative of the investment strategy that's paying off in the form of outside gains, and",1321,"Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to take you through our second quarter results which are certainly representative of the investment strategy that's paying off in the form of outside gains, and an operational approach that is producing sector-leading, same-store performance. 
Accomplishments for the quarter are numerous and they are highlighted by the following: accelerating FFO growth; outside same-store cash NOI increase; over 1 million square feet of leasing executed in the quarter; strong occupancy gains; premium debt and preferred equity origination; and several large and strategically important acquisitions and dispositions.
I think the best way to summarize our current thoughts on the market is to look at our -- things in the context of how they will drive our future growth and build upon our portfolio quality and liquidity. Our leasing efforts continue to benefit by having well position and fully be developed properties in Manhattan's most desirable submarkets against the backdrop of a strong local economy producing record private sector job growth and robust demand for office space.
Last year, New York city generated 54,000 private sector jobs in the first six months, en route to 104,000 private sector jobs added for the full calendar year 2014. 
So far, in 2015, first half of private sector job additions are at 62,000 jobs added, eclipsing last year's first half amount and setting the stage for the fifth consecutive year in which private sector job growth would exceed 90,000 incrementally.
These kinds of job growth statistics will produce approximately 4 million square feet of new demand and annually around the city, which is the driving force behind the declining vacancy rates, which Cushing and Wakefield now pegs at 8.9% for Midtown and 6.2% for Midtown South. The city economy is growing rapidly, notwithstanding an only moderate recovery in the financial services sector, emphasizing New York's increasingly diversified business base. What's important here is not only by how much office using tenants are growing, but where they are growing. Midtown leasing has been exceptionally strong, reaching 10.5 million square feet of leasing and accounting for 94% of total Manhattan absorption in the first half. And no one in the city is better positioned to benefit from this dynamic market than us. We have leased over 1.3 million square feet through June. And for good measure we have already signed leases for an excess of 250,000 square feet in the first 22 days of July.
As importantly, the leasing is being done at rental levels that are representative of a resurging Midtown market, and we are routinely the achieving double-digit mark-to-market increases, both with expiring, same-store lease expirations. 
With over 1.5 million square feet of office leases signed in Manhattan, and another 1.1 million square feet in our current pipeline, by the way an amount that is the highest in the last 4 quarters, we are raising our leasing guidance to 2.2 million square feet for the full calendar year, which is still composed raising of the bar on the amount of leasing activity to be completed in just over the next 5 months. 
So these leasing results, the economy, the leasing backdrop, is clearly going to help drive the momentum behind the drivers of growth that we have, in great detail, stepped through back in December. And we repeat often to our tenant base and shareholder base, stabilized office, mark-to-market, we expect to be significant and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year. Our growth portfolio is leasing at a very fast clip as evidenced by the fact we had a dominant amount of renewal leases in the second quarter and the retail portfolio leasing continues to be strong, as evidenced by the Adidas lease that we just signed, but in combination with the other retail leases signed throughout the year. 
However, another means of driving growth and increasing quality of the portfolio away from the operational metrics is through our investment strategy and the strategic rationale, which is underpinned by our purchase of 11 Madison Avenue, which was also announced during the second quarter. 11 Madison achieved a number of things for the company, some of which we put up on the deck on our website. So for those who haven't seen it, we encourage you to pull up 11 Madison transaction summary. And some of the highlights therein is that this represents for us another trophy asset added to SL Green's core portfolio. We are buying this property at substantially below in place escalated rents, resulting in long-term embedded growth opportunities. And we are gaining more exposure to the desirable Midtown South submarket, something that we have made a primary objective of ours, and a stated objective of ours over the years. We will now become the dominant owner in Midtown South, with over 3.5 million square feet of properties located immediately adjacent to Madison Square Park, which we think is one of the best areas in the Midtown South, plus other properties scattered throughout.
In terms of the economics of the deal, we think the deal is excellent in terms of the going-in cap rate of 4.6%, which is much higher than almost full recent comparable trades for buildings of this quality and scope and even buildings of lesser quality and -- and lesser duration.
And to put that in perspective, our belief is that the money to be made on 11 Madison is as much about having bought it right, and capitalizing it right, because we will be capitalizing it with 10-year fixed-rate financing that will be sub-4% in cost. So we will have positive leverage going into this deal, with only somewhere around I think 60% -- 55%, 60% financing that will put our yields in excess of 5% cash-on-cost. And this is the kind of deal that I believe once all the tenants are fully installed, going through their free rent, and all the TI and capital work is completed, that is squarely a 4-cap for a less asset. If you apply that kind of cap rate on a stabilized NOI, that's a $3 billion asset, which is only $1,300 a foot, which is actually not only unprecedented by Manhattan standards, but it's actually lower than many comparable Midtown office rate that are priced between $1,500 and $1,800 a foot. And we think that, that -- given it's the market -- the best market, the building is not institutional quality, but basically rebuilt in terms of systems and redesign specifically for the heavy use of somebody like Credit Suisse and Sony, which are very infrastructure-sensitive tenants, that this is an asset that will provide long-term earnings growth near-term value accretion, and serve as a receiver for the sales and numerous sales that we will be either completing over the next 4 to 6 months or have already announced, backing all of that in a very tax-efficient manner into 11 Madison, to serve as a receiver with all those attributes and credit quality long-term lease durations. 
So very happy with the way this is turning out. We obviously have more work ahead of us in terms of achieving the full amount of sales and refinancings that we have highlighted within the deck, that I'm referring to. But when I look at it as sort of a transaction that stands on its own just for those merits, add on top of that the fact that we expect to achieve anywhere between $0.15 near-term and $0.30 over 3 [ph] years of accretion, deriving from the series of integrated transactions and I think that certainly puts it in one of the top 2 or 3 transactions we've been here in the company. So very happy with how this is turning out. More work to do. We'll have an update for you in the next conference call. With that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias."

In addition to the 11 Madison transaction, we have an incredibly productive quarter just completed, highlighted really by 2 sales that were part of the strategic plan for the company for the year and then sort of became part of the 11 Madison funding plan as well. Tower 45 is an asset we marketed a little more than 2 years ago and we are not satisfied with the offers we received at that time. We pulled it off the market. And Steve did an excellent job of leasing the building up, and the decision to put off that sales and subsequently the contract announced within the last couple of weeks, earned us about $100 million above the offers we had received at the time of the earlier marketing. So at $830 a foot and a sub 3/4% [ph] cap rate, the sale is a very powerful endorsement for Midtown Manhattan office values. 
Moving on to 131 Spring Street. If one wants to see the power of the retail platform from the off-market acquisition to a redevelopment of assets and conversion of a lot of space, from stairwells, hallways and ancillary office space into prime retail space, reletting in terms of redoing both of the anchor retail leases of the property, and then recapitalizing, 131 Spring is sort of the perfect case study for SL Green value creation. 
We created about $150 [ph] million of gross profit in the 2.5 years since we purchased the asset, with an unlevered IRR for the company of 30% and a strong potential for future performance due to the incentivized JV we entered into the asset with our partner. 
Given the returns on this asset and our other investments in the market, we continue to focus heavily on the SoHo market and its growth potential and we'll talk about that a little bit more when we go through the acquisition of 110 Greene Street. But I'd tell you, Green -- SL Green's ability to buy assets right, capitalize them right and then take them to market and sell or recapitalize, taking profits, really, both these assets show just how significant the embedded gains we have in a lot of our assets are. We have dozens more assets on our balance sheet that we're sitting on like these where we can go out and demonstrate value and put up enormous returns to shareholders. We look forward to doing more of that in the months to come as we continue through our aggressive sales program this year. 
On the acquisition side, we are also excited to announce agreements to acquire 2 classic SL Green deals, both off market, both incredibly well located and both with enormous upside potential.
110 Greene is a great blend for us of huge retail upside and prime office and residential space, an irreplaceable asset of one of the most desirable full blocks in SoHo. This building sits a few short blocks from 131 Spring where I just took you through our results there. And we have very high expectations for investment in this property. We think we're going to be able to do some very creative things given that we purchased the building next door, 102 Greene within the last 12 months and we're exploring synergies already there, it gives us quite a lot of flexibility in terms of adding value. 
And 187 Broadway is on a stretch of Broadway we're very familiar with, having completed our retail and dormitory building at 180 Broadway, which is directly across the street from 187. On 187, we have a lot of flexibility in terms of uses for this property. And our basis gives us a lot of flexibility in what we decide to do here. We're still studying all the various uses. We have an maximum flexibility in terms of zoning. And we look forward to updating our shareholders as our business plan for this asset really crystallizes, what we're taking a lot of meetings with third parties in terms of the best way to maximize the value in the site.
Moving onto the structured finance book. We saw another strong quarter, with $302 million of gross originations, and a current balance on our book of $1.7 billion. Spreads continue to hold up, as volatility in CMBS has really kept the lid on overaggressive senior leading, which has kept mezzanine spreads and mezzanine advance rates stable and very comfortable for us. 
Our pipeline in the second half of the year is very healthy, and we will continue to use the capital markets to optimize our returns on those interests we decide to retain. 
I would just in closing say it's been an incredibly busy summer around here. And I would like to acknowledge the efforts of our investment and retail teams, and leasing and management and underwriting teams, in putting together really a stunning series of transactions on the acquisition and disposition side that we believe set us up for enormous future growth and profits.
So with that, I will turn it over to Matt."

As evidenced in our reported results for the first two quarters, our operating fundamentals are very strong, as is Manhattan market backdrop. However that performance in our view of months to come, we have our increased FFO guidance range",1172,"Thanks, Andrew. As evidenced in our reported results for the first two quarters, our operating fundamentals are very strong, as is Manhattan market backdrop. However that performance in our view of months to come, we have our increased FFO guidance range for 2015 to $6.30 [ph] to $6.34 [ph] a share, a meaningful increase of $0.05 over the midpoint of our previous guidance range and putting us on track for growth in FFO of over 8% versus last year.
In our real estate portfolio, the velocity of leasing of rents at the upper end of our expectations will contributed to earnings in 2015 or even more meaningful for growth in the years to come. During the first 6 months of the year, our Manhattan office leasing volume has been brisk. Pat on the back to Steve and his team. But at SL Green, we were reward outperformance by moving the goalposts hence the increased target of 2.2 million square feet. 
On the retail side of the business, we leased almost 90,000 square feet in the first six months at over 80% mark-to-market and the pipeline remains robust. And not to be outdone, our Suburban leasing volume, has also far outpaced our expectation, with over 400,000 square feet leased in the first six months. All of this activity drove meaningful increases in same-store these occupancy in the second quarter, with the Manhattan portfolio near an all-time high of 97% and the Suburban portfolio north of 84%. 
Occupancy increases driving the revenue line, coupled with seasonably lower operating expenses in the second quarter, after a brutal first quarter, improved our operating margins and allowed us to achieve same-store cash NOI growth of almost 5% for the quarter. This puts us well on pace to achieve our full year same-store cash NOI growth target of at least 3.6%, sitting at 4% for just the first 6 months. 
In the category of other income, we recognized leased termination income of $7.7 million in the second quarter, including $5.8 million at 919 Third Avenue, bringing our total for the year to $8.8 million. We have only recognized so far in 2015 is consistent with what was included in our initial FFO guidance range, and is also very close to the average lease termination income that we have recorded over the last several years, which is obviously the basis for what we include in our guidance. 
We include lease termination income in our guidance because it is a very consistent, recurring income stream and has been for many years. Simply the accelerated recognition of leased income that we would otherwise would've received over time. More importantly, like at 919 3rd, incentive paid to termination fees is often vacating space that we are re-leasing. They actually increased the income we're recognizing on that same space. We often see people looking to carve out lease termination income as nonrecurring. We see that as misleading, inaccurate and understating FFO because that income stream is so consistent. 
One additional comment on the termination income that we recognized at 919 3rd, in response to some the questions that we received. No, this amount was not included in our calculation of same-store cash NOI growth of 4.9% for the quarter and 4% for the year-to-date, because it is structured to be paid out over a period of several years. 
In the debt preferred equity portfolio, we continue to outpace our expectations with regard to the volume of originations and the yields at which we are originating product. To accomplish this, we have not relied our underwriting standards, gone out further on the risk curve or even left the New York City marketplace. 
Specific to yield, recall that our initial FFO guidance assumed the yields on new originations of 8.5%. For the first six months, the weighted average yields that are over $400 million of net originations was north of 10%. In addition, the pace of repayments has been slower than we anticipated, all of which is contributing directly to FFO. 
Finally, we have the effect on FFO on real estate investment activity. Our real estate transaction volume for 2015 is on track toward the highest trending 1 year in the company's history. Clearly, 11 Madison is the highlight of this activity. As we have outlined in the thorough presentation on our website, as well as in our 8-K, hopefully everyone has studiEd, the acquisition of 11 Madison at a 4 [ph] 6 [ph], which will be funded primarily with $1.4 billion of long-term fixed-rate sub-4% debt, and up to 11 asset sales for recapitalization at an average cap rate below 3.5%, was highly accretive for years to come. It is also contributory to FFO in 2015, albeit to a lesser extent given the timing of closing. More broadly, the totality of our acquisitions and dispositions for the year, versus the very modest activity we included in our initial guidance, has contributory to our FFO. Based upon the price of which we are acquiring new assets, the NOI of those assets, the form of consideration paid and the timing of acquisitions as compared to our decision. We're not just upgrading the portfolio, we're doing it accretively. 
There's a lot of good news for the bottom line coming from virtually all aspects of our business, but there's one significant offset that actually kept a lid on what would have otherwise been an even larger upward guidance provision. That could be summarized in 2 words: Transaction cost. Recall that our initial 2015 FFO guidance, includes transaction cost of approximately $4 million. You can see in our financials we actually exceeded that amount in the first six months, and 11 Madison deal among others hasn't even closed. In total, we now project third-party cost to execute our investment activity that will need to run through day rates to find FFO, for this year will be $7 million to $8 million higher than our initial estimates, with limiting the upward guidance provision by that amount. 
I'll now spend a couple of minutes on the balance sheet. Our investment grade strategy is in full effect now that we're fully investment grade by all 3 rating agencies and we remain focused on the pillars of the strong credit profile, which include among other things, liquidity, leverage, debt maturity and interest rate exposure. 
Specific to leverage, we have reduced leverage dramatically over a period of several years, which impart drove the new investment-grade rating. And we continue to see a trend towards further reducing balance sheet leverage, inclusive of the 11 Madison acquisition. 
Looking out through 2016, given consideration to the benefits of our upcoming acquisitions and dispositions, as well as enormous EBITDA growth over that period of time, we see debt-to-EBITDA even lower in 2016, sub-8% [ph] than we would have been in 2015, even before 11 Madison acquisition. That's coupled with an improvement in all other credit metrics as a result of the significant EBITDA growth and a balanced funding strategy.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Marc."

And I think there is a market for well leased Suburban assets and I think we have to get kind of close to fuller occupancy to kind of hit that market. But once you have an asset that is now well-leased and put away, and long-term finance I think there is a strong market for it that's why you're seeing such a high [indiscernible] for it."

Marc, I was wondering if you could give maybe just something that's a feedback that was raised after you left Madison and the stuff you went through on the call and the booklet is helpful. But some of the concerns that were raised by investors was they're going to have a very large asset, so a big part of the balance sheet that while you're able to trade up accretively versus what you're selling today does have some flat leases and so it's a large part of the balance sheet does not going to have as much growth in call it years 3 to 10. The second being while it's being a receiver for assets you're selling, there's an element of you could have sold those assets and paid a special dividend, you can pay 80% in stocks a so you don't lever up when you do that. And then I recognized the deal wasn't a necessity for that, but the people like being able to take advantage of the sales. And the last part was competing with others that have sovereign capital and being able to beat them out using wholly-owned, effectively SL Green equity versus sovereign capital, which arguably would come at a pretty cheap cost and so maybe you could address some of those."

As much as I heard [indiscernible]. The first is mortgage asset that's a big part of the balance sheet that doesn't have a lot of near-term growth. I think there's a presumption made, not sure why it's made or where it comes from, tha",600,"So I think 3 points. As much as I heard [indiscernible]. The first is mortgage asset that's a big part of the balance sheet that doesn't have a lot of near-term growth. I think there's a presumption made, not sure why it's made or where it comes from, that we have no ability to kind of after we acquire this property, as I said earlier in my remarks, get through the period of stabilization because there is a period to finish doing work with a tenant, at which point  we will get to a valuation that's much higher than our basis just for basically getting through the period of having that income stream identified and putting the big financing in place. I wouldn't presume and I wouldn't know anyone would presume we couldn't reach an asset in 6, 12, 18 or 24 months. So when you talk about a large asset lying around the balance sheet for decades, this is SL Green, so I'm not sure -- I'm sure you dialed into the right call. We tend to not sort of buy and hold and sit on assets in perpetuity, We tend to try and buy right, capitalize right, execute. And when the moment is there, monetize the JV. This asset -- it will be closed in a series of ticks that will give us complete flexibility in a private REIT or in a JV or in a partnership or otherwise are in and name format to bring in choose to or not choose to add in comp. So I think it relates to looking out in the future, yes, we haven't made any -- we haven't given any guidance on the future, what we see on the 3 years on the books. What we have said is that the accretion, this deal will generate over the next 3 years varies between $0.15 roughly and, 2016, and I think $0.30 in 2018. So I wouldn't look beyond that because that's what are out there talking about now. If and when we ever feel this assets or any other assets, I mean 11 Madison is not unique when it comes to maximizing values and recent stabilization, if we feel we hit that with this asset, and I think it safe to assume, we probably look to monetize it in a way to create a gain, because I think any asset we sold in the company in 17 years has resulted in a gain. I don't see where this is different. Anything would be more so if we think it's a very good buy. And we wouldn't allow this or any other assets to take down the growth profile of the company over the next whatever period of time you were talking about 5, 10 or 15 years, because we do the exact opposite. I think as you have seen -- because I think we sell more than any other certainly in New York, maybe office REIT, in terms of volume of sales to kind of illuminate value and monetize and harvest. So I would -- i would kind of look at this asset as sort of on a 3 to 5-year period and then we'll always readjust from there. As you talk about the second point to lever up, again, I don't want Matt to repeat his commentary, but if you look at what's on the web for replay Matt's commentary, he talks about after the buys and sells, the debt ratios are improved. So there's no lever up, unless you're talking about in this month -- several months for it."

I mean if you measure it month-by-month, my guess is the ratios are up for August or September. But then, I don't know when the deal start to close October, November, December, that combined with our FFO projections we have for next year, lead us to a place where we believe debt-to-EBITDA will be lower than where we started and leverage ratios will be lower than where we started. So again, I don't want to -- and obviously, credit quality is way up because you compare what we sell into what we're buying at least in our eyes. And that's [indiscernible] the [indiscernible] on this management team so if we feel the credit quality is up, then that's people can differ, but I wouldn't know how the building is rock solid, the market is the best and the credit is impeccable. So we feel this credit upgrade, a leverage improvement and accretion over a 3-year period and complete flexibility up to 3 years, to figure out ways to make money on the asset in a capital markets and away.

We were all at least, as we understand it, right about the same number and it was when you narrow the field down to 4 or 5 people, it's already been through around it till you got to select the winner. And I think the Fed or the [indiscernible] cap is amongst some the very best and biggest names in the industry, SL Green was awarded the deal in no small part because we had preexisting relationships with both ends of the seller of the partnership. We actually had financed this building. If you recall, back in 2004, maybe? 2004, So we refinanced the delay back when tracking this asset for 3 years plus in an acquisition sense, the moment is here, we acted quickly. I think the relationships were solid, the trust and credibility was there. And when somebody -- you get that call on the contract in a 5-day period, I'm not sure every other Sovereign bidder is swift enough afoot where they can necessarily match up to our ability to do speed of execution, which I think is how we won the deal.

That's really been more of our focus. I mean Steve -- if we sold on a basis exactly as we bought and it wasn't accretive, we got nothing more than a credit upgrade, you can follow that basis. That's something we've been -- if you look at the portfolio and you I think appreciate we've been there since day 1, if you look back at that 17 years, looks at what it is today both in scale and quality and institutional nature, you get there in part by being valued at but in part it's rotating assets. I mean you have to work assets to increase quality. This is a serious, serious office building. 2.3 million feet, right out of Madison Park, with bulletproof credit. And as I said earlier, the proof will just be in the pudding down the road, we bought it well and we have the ability to monetize value out of this asset going forward. You don't -- value isn't only about the positioning. I think we do about as anybody as and we put a couple of sales on the board just now and we always do prove that, but sometimes we can make it [indiscernible] and I think we did here.

And they may grow in that building and grow hopefully elsewhere in our portfolio. There's a whole host of other strategic element to this deal, the connectivity to 1 Madison, the fact now that we have Credit Suisse we nut just half of their presence in the market, but all of their presence, because I think it gives us a better opportunity to have a productive relationship with CS, controlling both ends of that, there's also sorts of stuff there. 10 years, I don't know, 3 to 5 years, highly accretive. I would assume at the end of the 3 to 5-year period, if we haven't figured out a way to further the growth trajectory, then there would be an opportunity to JV and monetize significant value."

And we have -- we haven't -- we've avoided a lot of corridors, but there's vacancies. We don't have a lot of space available on those. We're seeing the effect of the competition. I haven't heard much are seeing evidence of rents backing up much because I think generally, Landers are pretty patient and are willing to wait out vacancy in order to take advantage of then demand and it's still think overall, trend is beckoning at retail and retailers come around they get their hedge around paying higher rent because ultimately location at the end of the day. So it hasn't impacted our portfolio much."

We are pleased to take you through our second quarter results which are certainly representative of an investment strategy that is paying off in the form of outside gains, and",1323,"Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to take you through our second quarter results which are certainly representative of an investment strategy that is paying off in the form of outside gains, and an operational approach that is producing sector-leading, same-store performance. 
Accomplishments for the quarter are numerous and they are highlighted by the following: Accelerating FFO growth; outsized same-store cash NOI increase; over 1 million square feet of leasing executed in the quarter; strong occupancy gains; premium debt and preferred equity originations; and several large and strategically important acquisitions and dispositions.
I think the best way to summarize our current thoughts on the market is to look at our -- things in the context of how they will drive our future growth and build upon our portfolio of quality and liquidity. Our leasing efforts continue to benefit by having well positioned and fully redeveloped properties in Manhattan's most desirable submarkets against the backdrop of a strong local economy producing record private sector job growth and robust demand for office space.
Last year, New York city generated 54,000 new private sector jobs in the first six months, en route to 104,000 private sector jobs added for the full calendar year 2014. 
So far, in 2015, first half private sector job additions are at 62,000 jobs added, eclipsing last year's first half amount and setting the stage for the fifth consecutive year in which private sector job growth would exceed 90,000 incrementally.
These kinds of job growth statistics will produce approximately 4 million square feet of new demand annually around the city, which is the driving force behind a declining vacancy rate, which Cushman & Wakefield now pegs at 8.9% for Midtown and 6.2% for Midtown South. The city economy is growing rapidly, notwithstanding an only moderate recovery in the financial services sector, emphasizing New York's increasingly diversified business base. What's important here is not only by how much office using tenants are growing, but where they are growing. Midtown leasing has been exceptionally strong, reaching 10.5 million square feet of leasing and accounting for 94% of total Manhattan absorption in the first half. And no one in the city is better positioned to benefit from this dynamic market than us. We have leased over 1.3 million square feet through June. And for good measure, we have already signed leases for an excess of 250,000 square feet in the first 22 days of July.
As importantly, the leasing is being done at rental levels that are representative of a resurging Midtown market, and we are routinely achieving double-digit mark-to-market increases, both with expiring, same-store lease expirations. 
With over 1.5 million square feet of office leases signed in Manhattan, and another 1.1 million square feet in our current pipeline, by the way, an amount that is the highest in the last 4 quarters, we are raising our leasing guidance to 2.2 million square feet for the full calendar year, which is a self-imposed raising of the bar on the amount of leasing activity to be completed in just over the next 5 months. 
So these leasing results, the economy, the leasing backdrop, is clearly going to help drive the momentum behind the drivers of growth that we have, in great detail, stepped through back in December. And we repeat often to our tenant base and our shareholder base, stabilized office, mark-to-market, we expect to be significant and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year. Our growth portfolio is leasing at a very fast clip, as evidenced by the fact we had a dominant amount of renewal leases in the second quarter and the retail portfolio leasing continues to be strong, as evidenced by the Adidas lease we just signed, but in combination with the other retail leases signed throughout the year. 
However, another means of driving growth and increasing quality of portfolio, away from the operational metrics is through our investment strategy and the strategic rationale, which is underpinned by our purchase of 11 Madison Avenue, which was also announced during the second quarter. 11 Madison achieves a number of things for the company, some of which we put up on a deck on our website. So for those that haven't seen it, I would encourage you to pull up the 11 Madison transaction summary. But some of the highlights therein is that this represents for us another trophy asset added to SL Green's core portfolio. We are buying this property at substantially below in place escalated rents, resulting in long-term embedded growth opportunities. And we are gaining more exposure to the desirable Midtown South submarket, something that we have made a primary objective of ours, and a stated objective of ours, over the years. We will now become the dominant owner in Midtown South, with over 3.5 million square feet of properties located immediately adjacent to Madison Square Park, which we think is one of the best areas in Midtown South, plus other properties scattered throughout.
In terms of the economics of the deal, we think the deal is excellent, in terms of the going-in cap rate of 4.6%, which is much higher than almost all recent comparable trades for buildings of this quality and scope, and even buildings of lesser quality and -- and lesser duration.
And to put that in perspective, our belief is that the money to be made on 11 Madison is as much about having bought it right, and capitalizing it right, because we will be capitalizing it with a 10-year fixed-rate financing that will be sub-4% in cost. So we will have positive leverage going into this deal, with only somewhere around I think 60% -- 55%, 60% financing that will put our yields in excess of 5% cash-on-cost. And this is the kind of deal that I believe, once all the tenants are fully installed, earn through their free rent, and all the TI and capital work is completed, that is squarely a 4-cap or less asset. If you apply that kind of cap rate on a stabilized NOI, that's a $3 billion asset, which is only $1,300 a foot, which is actually not only unprecedented by Manhattan standards, it's actually lower than many comparable Midtown office trades that are priced between $1,500 and $1,800 a foot. And we think that, that -- given it's the market -- the best market, the building is not only institutional quality, but basically rebuilt, in terms of systems and redesigned specifically for the heavy use of somebody like Credit Suisse and Sony, which are very infrastructure-sensitive tenants, that this is an asset that will provide long-term earnings growth, near-term value accretion, and serve as a receiver for the sales and numerous sales that we will be either completing over the next 4 to 6 months or have already announced, backing all of that in a very tax-efficient manner into 11 Madison, to serve as a receiver with all those attributes and credit quality long-term lease durations. 
So very happy with the way this is turning out. We obviously have more work ahead of us in terms of achieving the full amount of sales from refinancings that we have highlighted within the deck that I'm referring to. But when I look at it as a transaction that sort of stands on its own just for those merits, add on top of that the fact that we expect to achieve anywhere between $0.15 near-term and $0.30 over through years of accretion, deriving from this series of integrated transactions, then I think it makes it, certainly puts it in one of the top 2 or 3 transactions I think we've been here at the company. So very happy with how this is turning out. More work to do. We'll have an update for you on the next conference call. With that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias."

In addition to the 11 Madison transaction, otherwise we have an incredibly productive quarter just completed, highlighted really by 2 sales that were part of a strategic plan for the company for the year, and then sort of became part of the 11 Madison funding plan as well. Tower 45 is an asset we marketed a little more than 2 years ago, and we are not satisfied with the offers we received at the time. We pulled it off the market. And Steve Durels and his team did an excellent job of leasing the building up, and the decision to put off that sale and then subsequently the contract we announced within the last couple of weeks, earned us about $100 million above the offers we had received at the time of the earlier marketing. So at $830 a foot and a sub 3.25% cap rate, this sale is a very powerful endorsement for Midtown Manhattan office values. 
Moving on to 131 Spring Street. If one wants to see the power of the retail platform from the off-market acquisition to a redevelopment of the asset and conversion of a lot of space, from stairwells, hallways and ancillary office space into prime retail space, reletting, in terms of redoing both of the anchor retail leases of the property, and then recapitalizing, 131 Spring is sort of the perfect case study for SL Green value creation. 
We created about $150 million of gross profit in the 2.5 years since we purchased the asset, with an unlevered IRR to the company of 30% and a strong potential for future outperformance due to the incentivized JV we entered into on the asset with our partner. 
Given the returns on this asset and our other investments in the market, we continue to focus heavily in the SoHo market and its growth potential and we'll talk about that a little bit more when we go through the acquisition of 110 Greene Street. But I'd tell you, Green -- SL Green's ability to buy assets right, capitalize them right and then take them to market and sell or recapitalize, taking profits, really, both these assets show just how significant the embedded gains we have in a lot of our assets are. We have dozens more assets on our balance sheet that we're sitting on like these, where we can go out and demonstrate value and put up enormous returns to shareholders. And we look forward to doing more of that in the months to come as we continue through our aggressive sales program this year. 
On the acquisition side, we are also excited to announce agreements to acquire 2 classic SL Green deals, both off market, both incredibly well located and both with enormous upside potential.
110 Greene is a great blend for us of huge retail upside and prime office and residential space, and an irreplaceable asset on one of the most desirable blocks in SoHo. This building sits a few short blocks from 131 Spring, where I just took you through our results there. And we have very high expectations for investment in this property. We think we're going to be able to do some very creative things, given that we purchased the building next door, 102 Greene, within the last 12 months and we're exploring synergies already there, it gives us quite a lot of flexibility in terms of adding value. 
And 187 Broadway is on a stretch of Broadway we're very familiar with, having completed our retail and dormitory building at 180 Broadway, which is directly across the street from 187. On 187, we have a lot of flexibility in terms of uses for this property. And our basis gives us a lot of flexibility in what we decide to do here. We're still studying all the various uses. We have maximum flexibility in terms of zoning. And we look forward to updating our shareholders as our business plan for this asset really crystallizes, what we're taking a lot of meetings with third parties in terms of the best way to maximize the value in the site.
Moving onto the structure finance book. We saw another strong quarter, with $302 million of gross originations, and a current balance on our book of $1.7 billion. Spreads continue to hold up, as volatility in CMBS has really kept a lid on overaggressive senior lending, which has kept mezzanine spreads and mezzanine advance rates stable and very comfortable for us. 
Our pipeline for the second half of the year is very healthy, and we'll continue to use the capital markets to optimize our returns on those interests we decide to retain. 
I would just, in closing, say it's been an incredibly busy summer around here. And I'd like to acknowledge the efforts of our investment and retail teams, and leasing and management and underwriting teams, in putting together really, a stunning series of transactions on the acquisition and disposition side, that we believe set us up for enormous future growth and profits.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt."

As evidenced in our reported results for the first two quarters, our operating fundamentals are very strong, as is the Manhattan market backdrop. [indiscernible]  that performance in our view of months to come, we have increased our FFO guidance range for 2015 to $6.30 to $6.34 a share, a meaningful increase of $0.05 over the midpoint of our previous guidance range and putting us on track for growth in FFO of over 8% versus last year.
In our real estate portfolio, the velocity of leasing at rents that are at the upper end of our expectations will contribute to earnings in 2015 for even more meaningful for growth in the years to come. During the first 6 months of the year, our Manhattan office leasing volume has been brisk. Pat on the back to Steve and his team. But at SL Green, we reward outperformance by moving the goalposts, hence the increased target of 2.2 million square feet. 
On the retail side of the business, we leased almost 90,000 square feet in the first six months at an over 80% mark-to-market, and the pipeline remains robust. And not to be outdone, our Suburban leasing volume has also far outpaced our expectation, with over 400,000 square feet leased in the first six months. All of this activity drove meaningful increases in same-store lease occupancy in the second quarter, with the Manhattan portfolio near an all-time high of 97% and the Suburban portfolio north of 84%. 
Occupancy increases driving the revenue line, coupled with seasonably lower operating expenses in the second quarter, after a brutal first quarter, improved our operating margins and allowed us to achieve same-store cash NOI growth of almost 5% in the quarter. This puts us well on pace to achieve our full year same-store cash NOI growth target of at least 3.6%, sitting at 4% for just the first 6 months. 
In the category of other income, we recognized lease termination income of $7.7 million in the second quarter, including $5.8 million at 919 Third Avenue, bringing our total for the year to $8.8 million. What we have recognized so far in 2015 is consistent with what was included in our initial FFO guidance range, and is also very close to the average lease termination income that we have recorded over the last several years, which is obviously the basis for one, including guidance. 
We include lease termination income in our guidance because it is a very consistent, recurring income stream and has been for many years. Simply, the accelerated recognition of lease income that we otherwise would've received over time. More importantly, like at 919 3rd, incentive paid to termination fee is often vacating space that we are re-leasing. They're actually increasing the income we're recognizing on that same space. We often see people looking to carve out lease termination income as nonrecurring. We see that as misleading, inaccurate and understating FFO because that income stream is so consistent. 
One additional comment on the termination income that we recognized at 919 3rd, in response to some the questions that we received. No, this amount was not included in our calculation of same-store cash NOI growth of 4.9% for the quarter and 4% for the year-to-date, because it is structured to be paid out over a period of several years. 
In the debt and preferred equity portfolio, we continue to outpace our expectations with regard to the volume of originations and the yields at which we are originating product. To accomplish this, we have not relaxed our underwriting standards, gone out further on the risk curve or even left the New York City marketplace. 
Specific to yield, recall that our initial FFO guidance assume the yields on new originations of 8.5%. For the first six months, the weighted average yields that are over $400 million of net originations was north of 10%. In addition, the pace of repayments has been slower than we anticipated, all of which is contributing directly to FFO. 
Finally, we have the effect on FFO on our real estate investment activity. Our real estate transaction volume for 2015 is on track to be one of the highest for any 1 year in the company's history. Clearly, 11 Madison is the highlight of this activity. As we have outlined in the thorough presentation on our website, as well as in the 8-K, hopefully everyone has studied, the acquisition of 11 Madison at a 4, 6 cap, which will be funded primarily with $1.4 billion of long-term fixed-rate sub-4% debt, and up to 11 asset sales or recapitalizations at an average cap rate below 3.5%, is highly accretive in years to come. It is also contributory to FFO in 2015, albeit to a lesser extent given the timing of closing. More broadly, the totality of our acquisitions and dispositions for the year, versus the very modest activity we included in our initial guidance, as contributory to FFO. Based upon the price at which we are acquiring new assets, the NOI of those assets, the form of consideration paid and the timing of the acquisitions, as compared to our dispositions. We're not just upgrading the portfolio, we're doing it accretively. 
There's a lot of good news for the bottom line coming from virtually all aspects of our business, but there's one significant offset that actually kept a lid on what would have otherwise been an even larger upward guidance revision. And that could be summarized in 2 words: Transaction costs. Recall that our initial 2015 FFO guidance included transaction costs of approximately $4 million. You can see in our financials that we've actually exceeded that amount in just the first six months, and the 11 Madison deal, among others, hasn't even closed. In total, we now project third-party cost to execute our investment activity that will need to run through [indiscernible] defined FFO, for this year will be $7 million to $8 million higher than our initial estimates, with limiting the upward guidance revision by that amount. 
Now spending a couple of minutes on the balance sheet. Our investment grade strategy is in full effect. Now we're fully investment grade by all 3 rating agencies and we remain focused on the pillars of a strong credit profile, which include among other things, liquidity, leverage, debt maturities and interest rate exposure. 
Specific to leverage, we have reduced leverage dramatically over a period of several years, which in part drove the new investment-grade ratings. And we continue to see a trend towards further reducing balance sheet leverage, inclusive of the 11 Madison acquisition. 
Looking out through 2016, giving consideration to the benefits of our upcoming acquisitions and dispositions, as well as enormous EBITDA growth over that period of time, we see debt-to-EBITDA even lower in 2016, sub-8%, than we would have been in 2015, even before the 11 Madison acquisition. That's coupled with an improvement in all other credit metrics as a result of this significant EBITDA growth and a balanced funding strategy.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Marc."

It'll really depend on how the fourth quarter shapes up, because the third quarter is looking very good. If the fourth quarter remains strong, we should get to $2.2 million. if it's a little less strong, you could easily have a couple of deals trip from December to January, and then everyone's going to write, ""Oh my God, leasing's slowing.""

Marc, I was wondering if you can maybe address something, that's your feedback, that was raised after you left Madison and the stuff you went through on the call and the booklet is helpful. But yet some of the concerns that were raised by investors was, they're going to have a very large asset, so a big part of the balance sheet that while you're able to trade up accretively versus what you're selling today, does have some flat leases and so it's a large part of the balance sheet that's not going to have as much growth in call it, years 3 to 10. The second being, while it's being a receiver for assets you're selling, there's an element of, you could have sold those assets and paid a special dividend, you can pay the 80% in stock, so you don't lever up when you do that. Then I recognized the deal was a necessity for that, but I think people like being able to take advantage of the sales. And the last part was competing with others that had Sovereign Capital and being able to beat them out using wholly-owned, effectively SL Green equity versus sovereign capital, which arguably would come at a pretty cheap cost, and so maybe you could just address some of those."

At least as I heard, and so trying to hit all those. The first is large asset, that's a big part of the balance sheet that doesn't have a lot of near-term growth. I think there's a presumption made, not sure why it's made or wh",640,"Okay, so I think, 3 points. At least as I heard, and so trying to hit all those. The first is large asset, that's a big part of the balance sheet that doesn't have a lot of near-term growth. I think there's a presumption made, not sure why it's made or where it comes from, that we have no ability to kind of, after we acquire this property, as I said earlier in my remarks, get through the period of stabilization because there is a period to finish doing work, install a tenant, at which point, I think we will get to a valuation that's much higher than our basis, just for basically getting through the period of having that income stream identified and putting the big financing in place. I wouldn't presume and I wouldn't know why anyone would presume we couldn't reach AV [ph] that asset in 6, 12, 18 or 24 months. So when you talk about a large asset lying around the balance sheet for decades, this is SL Green, so I'm not sure -- I'm sure you dialed into the right call. We tend to not just sort of buy and hold and sit on assets in perpetuity, we tend to try and buy right, capitalize right, execute. And when the moment's there, monetize our JV. This asset -- is being, it will be closed in a series of ticks that will give us complete flexibility in a private REIT or in a JV or in a partnership or otherwise, or in a tick format, to bring in any part as we choose to or not choose to, sort of add in times. So I think as it relates to looking out in the future, yes, we haven't made any -- we haven't given any guidance on the future, what we've -- beyond the 3 years that are on the books, so. What we have said is that the accretion this deal will generate over the next 3 years varies between $0.15 roughly, in 2016, I think $0.30 now in 2018. So I wouldn't look beyond that, because that's what are out there, I would say, talking about now. If and when we ever feel this asset or any other asset, I wouldn't -- I mean 11 Mad is not unique when it comes to maximizing values and reaching stabilization, if we feel we hit that with this asset, then I think it's safe to assume, we probably look to monetize it in a way to create a gain, because I think any asset we've ever sold in the company in 17 years has resulted in a gain. So I don't see where this would be different. I think this, if anything, would be even more so, so I think it's a very good buy. And we wouldn't allow this or any other asset to take down the growth profile of the company over the next, whatever period of time you were talking about, 5, 10, 15 years, because we do the exact opposite and I think as you have seen -- because I think we sell more than any other, certainly in New York, or even maybe office REIT, in terms of volume of sale to kind of illuminate value and monetize and harvest. So I would -- I would kind of look at this asset as sort of, on a 3- to 5-year period and then we'll always readjust from there. As you talk about the second point, lever up, again, I don't want Matt to repeat his commentary, but the -- if you look at what's on the web and/or replay Matt's commentary, he talks about after the buys and the sells, the debt ratios are improved. So there's no lever up, unless you're talking about an interim several months to it."

This is, this will be in -- I mean if you measure it month-by-month, my guess is the ratios are up for August, September. But then, I don't know when the deal starts to close October, November, December, that, combined with the FFO projections we have for next year, lead us to a place where we believe debt-to-EBITDA will be lower than where we started, and leverage ratios will be lower than where we started. So again, I don't want to -- and obviously, credit quality is way up, because you compare what we're selling to what we're buying, at least in our eyes, and that's what -- you're -- the shareholders are betting on this management team so, if we feel the credit quality is up, then that's -- people can differ, but I wouldn't know how it's -- the building is rock solid, the market's the best and the credit is impeccable. So we feel it's a credit upgrade, a leverage improvement and accretion over a 3-year period and complete flexibility after to 3 years, to figure out ways to make money on the asset in a capital markets kind of way. So honestly, I forget the 3rd point, didn't write it down, I only wrote down those 2. So if you remember it, I ask again, if not, I forgot it. 
It's Sovereign, Sovereign. I'm sorry. Thank you, Steve. Sovereign Capital. So when you say we beat Sovereign, I'm not -- there were 4 or 5 bidders at the end of the process. It was a mixture of domestic and Sovereign, REIT and non-REIT. I don't know what kind of particular insight, you haven't said the bidding array, but we think we know the bidding array, and it was a mixture, everybody was pretty much on top of the number. If the presumption is we had to bid more to get it, that assumption is wrong. We were all at least, as we understand it, right about the same number, and it was a matter of, when you narrow a field down to 4 or 5 people, it's already been through a round or two, you got to select a winner. And I think the Fed or [indiscernible] cap is amongst some the very best and biggest names in the industry, SL Green was awarded the deal in no small part because we had preexisting relationships with both ends of the seller, because it was a partnership. We actually had financed this building, if you recall, back in 2004, maybe? 2004, So we financed the acquisition from the Shapiro family way back when, we've been on, sort of tracking this asset for 3 years plus in an acquisition sense, the moment was here, we acted quickly. I think the relationships were solid, the trust and credibility was there. And when somebody gets -- you get that call, to go to contract in a 5-day period, I'm not sure every other Sovereign or bidder is fleet enough of foot, where they can necessarily match up to our ability to do speed of execution, which I think is how we won the deal. So in terms of price, I'm not -- I don't believe price was the deciding factor at the end."

And that's really been more of our focus. I mean, look, Steve -- you can make a, and already been said, if we sold on a basis exactly as we bought, and it wasn't accretive, we got nothing more than a credit upgrade, you can justify it on that basis. And that's something we've been -- if you look at the portfolio and you I think, can appreciate this more than most because you've been there with us since Day 1, if you look back 17 years, to what the portfolio looked like then, maybe and to what it is today, both in scale and quality and institutional nature, you get there in part by being an optimist in part, by value add. But in part it's rotating assets. I mean you have to rotate assets to increase quality. This is a serious, serious office building. 2.3 million feet, right on Madison Square Park, with bulletproof credit. And as I said earlier, the proof will just be in the pudding down the road, we think we bought it well, and we'll have the ability to monetize value out of this asset going forward. You don't -- value isn't only about repositioning. I mean, I think we do that about as good as anybody else and we put a couple of sales on the board just now, and we always do prove that, but sometimes you could make a good buy. And I think we did here. I think we made a good buy, and I think we'll monetize value. I don't know if I see this as a 10, 15, 20 year hold, and we didn't compare to the portfolio in that sense. We looked at it as achieving a lot of strategic goals for us, in terms of quality and durability of cash flow and presence in that market, which is sort of, I mean it's an unmatched presence now, 3.5 million square feet on 2 blocks of Midtown south, with buildings that can cater to large tenants where most buildings in Midtown South can't, and having not just tenants like Credit Suisse and Sony, but Yelp and others that are growing tenants. And they may grow in that building and they grow hopefully elsewhere in our portfolio. And there's a whole host of other strategic elements to this deal, the connectivity to 1 Madison, the fact now that we have Credit Suisse, not just, half of their presence in the market, but all of their presence, which I think gives us a better opportunity to have a productive relationship with CS, controlling both ends of that, there's all sorts of stuff there. So 10 years, don't know, 3 to 5 years, highly accretive. I would assume at the end of the 3 to 5-year period, if we haven't figured out a way to further the growth trajectory, then there would be an opportunity to JV and monetize significant value."

We are pleased to take you through our second quarter results which are certainly representative of an investment strategy that is paying off in the form of outside gains, and",1325,"Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to take you through our second quarter results which are certainly representative of an investment strategy that is paying off in the form of outside gains, and an operational approach that is producing sector-leading, same-store performance. 
Accomplishments for the quarter are numerous and they are highlighted by the following: Accelerating FFO growth; outsized same-store cash NOI increase; over 1 million square feet of leasing executed in the quarter; strong occupancy gains; premium debt and preferred equity originations; and several large and strategically important acquisitions and dispositions.
I think the best way to summarize our current thoughts on the market is to look at our -- things in the context of how they will drive our future growth and build upon our portfolio of quality and liquidity. Our leasing efforts continue to benefit by having well positioned and fully redeveloped properties in Manhattan's most desirable submarkets against the backdrop of a strong local economy producing record private sector job growth and robust demand for office space.
Last year, New York City generated 54,000 new private sector jobs in the first six months, en route to 104,000 private sector jobs added for the full calendar year 2014. 
So far, in 2015, first half private sector job additions are at 62,000 jobs added, eclipsing last year's first half amount and setting the stage for the fifth consecutive year in which private sector job growth would exceed 90,000 incrementally.
These kinds of job growth statistics will produce approximately 4 million square feet of new demand annually around the city, which is the driving force behind a declining vacancy rate, which Cushman & Wakefield now pegs at 8.9% for Midtown and 6.2% for Midtown South. The city economy is growing rapidly, notwithstanding an only moderate recovery in the financial services sector, emphasizing New York's increasingly diversified business base. What's important here is not only by how much office using tenants are growing, but where they are growing. Midtown leasing has been exceptionally strong, reaching 10.5 million square feet of leasing and accounting for 94% of total Manhattan absorption in the first half. And no one in the city is better positioned to benefit from this dynamic market than us. We have leased over 1.3 million square feet through June. And for good measure, we have already signed leases for an excess of 250,000 square feet in the first 22 days of July.
As importantly, the leasing is being done at rental levels that are representative of a resurging Midtown market, and we are routinely achieving double-digit mark-to-market increases, both with expiring, same-store lease expirations. 
With over 1.5 million square feet of office leases signed in Manhattan, and another 1.1 million square feet in our current pipeline, by the way, an amount that is the highest in the last 4 quarters, we are raising our leasing guidance to 2.2 million square feet for the full calendar year, which is a self-imposed raising of the bar on the amount of leasing activity to be completed in just over the next 5 months. 
So these leasing results, the economy, the leasing backdrop, is clearly going to help drive the momentum behind the drivers of growth that we have, in great detail, stepped through back in December. And we repeat often to our tenant base and our shareholder base, stabilized office, mark-to-market, we expect to be significant and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year. Our growth portfolio is leasing at a very fast clip, as evidenced by the fact we had a dominant amount of new versus renewal leases in the second quarter and the retail portfolio leasing continues to be strong, as evidenced by the Adidas lease we just signed, but in combination with the other retail leases signed throughout the year. 
However, another means of driving growth and increasing quality of portfolio, away from the operational metrics, is through our investment strategy and the strategic rationale, which is underpinned by our purchase of 11 Madison Avenue, which was also announced during the second quarter. 11 Madison achieves a number of things for the company, some of which we put up on a deck on our website. So for those that haven't seen it, I would encourage you to pull up the 11 Madison transaction summary. But some of the highlights therein is that this represents for us another trophy asset added to SL Green's core portfolio. We are buying this property at substantially below in place escalated rents, resulting in long-term embedded growth opportunities. And we are gaining more exposure to the desirable Midtown South submarket, something that we have made a primary objective of ours, and a stated objective of ours, over the years. We will now become the dominant owner in Midtown South, with over 3.5 million square feet of properties located immediately adjacent to Madison Square Park, which we think is one of the best areas in Midtown South, plus other properties scattered throughout.
In terms of the economics of the deal, we think the deal is excellent, in terms of the going-in cap rate of 4.6%, which is much higher than almost all recent comparable trades for buildings of this quality and scope, and even buildings of lesser quality and -- and lesser duration.
And to put that in perspective, our belief is that the money to be made on 11 Madison is as much about having bought it right, and capitalizing it right, because we will be capitalizing it with a 10-year fixed-rate financing that will be sub-4% in cost. So we will have positive leverage going into this deal, with only somewhere around I think 60% -- 55%, 60% financing that will put our yields in excess of 5% cash-on-cost. And this is the kind of deal that I believe, once all the tenants are fully installed, burn through their free rent, and all the TI and capital work is completed, that is squarely a 4-cap or less asset. If you apply that kind of cap rate on a stabilized NOI, that's a $3 billion asset, which is only $1,300 a foot, which is actually not only unprecedented by Manhattan standards, it's actually lower than many comparable Midtown office trades that are priced between $1,500 and $1,800 a foot. And we think that, that -- given it's the market -- the best market, the building is not only institutional quality, but basically rebuilt, in terms of systems and redesigned specifically for the heavy use of somebody like Credit Suisse and Sony, which are very infrastructure-sensitive tenants, that this is an asset that will provide long-term earnings growth, near-term value accretion, and serve as a receiver for the sales and numerous sales that we will be either completing over the next 4 to 6 months or have already announced, backing all of that in a very tax-efficient manner into 11 Madison, to serve as a receiver with all those attributes and credit quality long-term lease durations. 
So very happy with the way this is turning out. We obviously have more work ahead of us in terms of achieving the full amount of sales from refinancings that we have highlighted within the deck that I'm referring to. But when I look at it as a transaction that sort of stands on its own just for those merits, add on top of that the fact that we expect to achieve anywhere between $0.15 near-term and $0.30 over through years of accretion, deriving from this series of integrated transactions, then I think it makes it, certainly puts it in one of the top 2 or 3 transactions I think we've done here at the company. So very happy with how this is turning out. More work to do. We'll have an update for you on the next conference call. With that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias."

In addition to the 11 Madison transaction, otherwise we have an incredibly productive quarter just completed, highlighted really by 2 sales that were part of a strategic plan for the company for the year, and then sort of became part of the 11 Madison funding plan as well. Tower 45 is an asset we marketed a little more than 2 years ago, and we were not satisfied with the offers we received at the time. We pulled it off the market. And Steve Durels and his team did an excellent job of leasing the building up, and the decision to put off that sale and then subsequently the contract we announced within the last couple of weeks, earned us about $100 million above the offers we had received at the time of the earlier marketing. So at $830 a foot and a sub 3.25% cap rate, this sale is a very powerful endorsement for Midtown Manhattan office values. 
Moving on to 131 Spring Street. If one wants to see the power of the retail platform from the off-market acquisition to a redevelopment of the asset and conversion of a lot of space, from stairwells, hallways and ancillary office space into prime retail space, reletting, in terms of redoing both of the anchor retail leases of the property, and then recapitalizing, 131 Spring is sort of the perfect case study for SL Green value creation. 
We created about $150 million of gross profit in the 2.5 years since we purchased the asset, with an unlevered IRR to the company of 30% and a strong potential for future outperformance due to the incentivized JV we entered into on the asset with our partner. 
Given the returns on this asset and our other investments in the market, we continue to focus heavily in the SoHo market and its growth potential and we'll talk about that a little bit more when we go through the acquisition of 110 Greene Street. But I'd tell you, Green -- SL Green's ability to buy assets right, capitalize them right and then take them to market and sell or recapitalize, taking profits, really, both these assets show just how significant the embedded gains we have in a lot of our assets are. We have dozens more assets on our balance sheet that we're sitting on like these, where we can go out and demonstrate value and put up enormous returns to shareholders. And we look forward to doing more of that in the months to come as we continue through our aggressive sales program this year. 
On the acquisition side, we are also excited to announce agreements to acquire 2 classic SL Green deals, both off market, both incredibly well located and both with enormous upside potential.
110 Greene is a great blend for us of huge retail upside and prime office and residential space, and an irreplaceable asset on one of the most desirable blocks in SoHo. This building sits a few short blocks from 131 Spring, where I just took you through our results there. And we have very high expectations for our investment in this property. We think we're going to be able to do some very creative things, given that we purchased the building next door, 102 Greene,  within the last 12 months and we're exploring synergies already there, it gives us quite a lot of flexibility in terms of adding value. 
And 187 Broadway is on a stretch of Broadway we're very familiar with, having completed our retail and dormitory building at 180 Broadway, which is directly across the street from 187. On 187, we have a lot of flexibility in terms of uses for this property. And our basis gives us a lot of flexibility in what we decide to do here. We're still studying all the various uses. We have maximum flexibility in terms of zoning. And we look forward to updating our shareholders as our business plan for this asset really crystallizes, what we're taking a lot of meetings with third parties in terms of the best way to maximize the value in the site.
Moving onto the structure finance book. We saw another strong quarter, with $302 million of gross originations, and a current balance on our book of $1.7 billion. Spreads continue to hold up, as volatility in CMBS has really kept a lid on overaggressive senior lending, which has kept mezzanine spreads and mezzanine advance rates stable and very comfortable for us. 
Our pipeline for the second half of the year is very healthy, and we'll continue to use the capital markets to optimize our returns on those interests we decide to retain. 
I would just, in closing, say it's been an incredibly busy summer around here. And I'd like to acknowledge the efforts of our investment and retail teams, and leasing and management and underwriting teams, in putting together really, a stunning series of transactions on the acquisition and disposition side, that we believe set us up for enormous future growth and profits.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt."

As evidenced in our reported results for the first two quarters, our operating fundamentals are very strong, as is the Manhattan market backdrop. Not only has our performance in our view of months to come, we have increased our FFO guidanc",1181,"Thanks, Andrew. As evidenced in our reported results for the first two quarters, our operating fundamentals are very strong, as is the Manhattan market backdrop. Not only has our performance in our view of months to come, we have increased our FFO guidance range for 2015 to $6.30 to $6.34 a share, a meaningful increase of $0.05 over the midpoint of our previous guidance range and putting us on track for growth in FFO of over 8% versus last year.
In our real estate portfolio, the velocity of leasing at rents that are at the upper end of our expectations will contribute to earnings in 2015 for even more meaningful for growth in the years to come. During the first 6 months of the year, our Manhattan office leasing volume has been brisk. Pat on the back to Steve and his team. But at SL Green, we reward outperformance by moving the goalposts, hence the increased target of 2.2 million square feet. 
On the retail side of the business, we leased almost 90,000 square feet in the first 6 months at an over 80% mark-to-market, and the pipeline remains robust. And not to be outdone, our suburban leasing volume has also far outpaced our expectation, with over 400,000 square feet leased in the first 6 months. All of this activity drove meaningful increases in same-store lease occupancy in the second quarter, with the Manhattan portfolio near an all-time high of 97% and the suburban portfolio north of 84%. 
Occupancy increases driving the revenue line, coupled with seasonably lower operating expenses in the second quarter, after a brutal first quarter, improved our operating margins and allowed us to achieve same-store cash NOI growth of almost 5% in the quarter. This puts us well on pace to achieve our full year same-store cash NOI growth target of at least 3.6%, sitting at 4% for just the first 6 months. 
In the category of other income, we recognized lease termination income of $7.7 million in the second quarter, including $5.8 million at 919 Third Avenue, bringing our total for the year to $8.8 million. What we have recognized so far in 2015 is consistent with what was included in our initial FFO guidance range, and is also very close to the average lease termination income that we have recorded over the last several years, which is obviously the basis for what we including in guidance. 
We include lease termination income in our guidance because it is a very consistent, recurring income stream and has been for many years. Simply, the accelerated recognition of lease income that we otherwise would've received over time. More importantly, like at 919 3rd, incentive paid to termination fee is often vacating space that we are re-leasing. They're actually increasing the income we're recognizing on that same space. We often see people looking to carve out lease termination income as nonrecurring. We see that as misleading, inaccurate and understating FFO because that income stream is so consistent. 
One additional comment on the termination income that we recognized at 919 3rd, in response to some the questions that we received. No, this amount was not included in our calculation of same-store cash NOI growth of 4.9% for the quarter and 4% for the year-to-date, because it is structured to be paid out over a period of several years. 
In the debt and preferred equity portfolio, we continue to outpace our expectations with regard to the volume of originations and the yields at which we are originating new product. To accomplish this, we have not relaxed our underwriting standards, gone out further on the risk curve or even left the New York City marketplace. 
Specific to yield, recall that our initial FFO guidance assume the yields on new originations of 8.5%. For the first 6 months, the weighted average yields that are over $400 million of net originations was north of 10%. In addition, the pace of repayments has been slower than we anticipated, all of which is contributing directly to FFO. 
Finally, we have the effect on FFO of our real estate investment activity. Our real estate transaction volume for 2015 is on track to be one of the highest for any 1 year in the company's history. Clearly, 11 Madison is the highlight of this activity. As we have outlined in the thorough presentation on our website, as well as in the 8-K that hopefully everyone has studied, the acquisition of 11 Madison at a 4, 6 cap, which will be funded primarily with $1.4 billion of long-term fixed-rate sub-4% debt, and up to 11 asset sales or recapitalizations at an average cap rate below 3.5%, is highly accretive in years to come. It is also contributory to FFO in 2015, albeit to a lesser extent given the timing of closing. More broadly, the totality of our acquisitions and dispositions for the year, versus the very modest activity we included in our initial guidance, is contributory to FFO. Based upon the price at which we are acquiring new assets, the NOI of those assets, the form of consideration paid and the timing of the acquisitions, as compared to our dispositions. We're not just upgrading the portfolio, we're doing it accretively. 
There's a lot of good news for the bottom line coming from virtually all aspects of our business, but there's one significant offset that actually kept a lid on what would have otherwise been an even larger upward guidance revision. And that could be summarized in 2 words: Transaction costs. Recall that our initial 2015 FFO guidance included transaction costs of approximately $4 million. You can see in our financials that we've actually exceeded that amount in just the first six months, and the 11 Madison deal, among others, hasn't even closed. In total, we now project third-party cost to execute our investment activity that will need to run through our redefined FFO for this year will be $7 million to $8 million higher than our initial estimates, with limiting the upward guidance revision by that amount. 
Now spending a couple of minutes on the balance sheet. Our investment grade strategy is in full effect. Now we're fully investment grade by all 3 rating agencies and we remain focused on the pillars of a strong credit profile, which include among other things, liquidity, leverage, debt maturities and interest rate exposure. 
Specific to leverage, we have reduced leverage dramatically over a period of several years, which in part drove the new investment-grade ratings. And we continue to see a trend towards further reducing balance sheet leverage, inclusive of the 11 Madison acquisition. 
Looking out through 2016, giving consideration to the benefits of our upcoming acquisitions and dispositions, as well as enormous EBITDA growth over that period of time, we see debt-to-EBITDA even lower in 2016, sub-8%, than we would have been in 2015, even before the 11 Madison acquisition. That's coupled with an improvement in all other credit metrics as a result of this significant EBITDA growth and a balanced funding strategy.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Marc."

And where we are, it's -- I think it's -- we're pretty much on target. We're setting a higher bar. We may not reach that $2.2 million. It'll really depend on how the fourth quarter shapes up, because the third quarter is looking very good. If the fourth quarter remains strong, we should get to $2.2 million. if it's a little less strong, you could easily have a couple of deals trip from December to January, and then everyone's going to write, ""Oh my God, leasing's slowing."" Then we have a big January first quarter. So I wouldn't don't read too much into that unless I would follow our guidance there more than anything.

Marc, I was wondering if you can maybe address something, that's your feedback, that was raised after you left Madison and the stuff you went through on the call and the booklet is helpful. But yet some of the concerns that were raised by investors was, they're going to have a very large asset, so a big part of the balance sheet that while you're able to trade up accretively versus what you're selling today, does have some flat leases and so it's a large part of the balance sheet that's not going to have as much growth in, call it, years 3 to 10. The second being, while it's being a receiver for assets you're selling, there's an element of, you could have sold those assets and paid a special dividend, you can pay the 80% in stock, so you don't lever up when you do that. Then I recognized the deal wasn't a necessity for that, but I think people like being able to take advantage of the sales. And the last part was competing with others that had sovereign capital and being able to beat them out using wholly-owned, effectively SL Green equity versus sovereign capital, which arguably would come at a pretty cheap cost, and so maybe you could just address some of those."

At least as I heard, and so trying to hit all those. The first is large asset, that's a big part of the balance sheet that doesn't have a lot of near-term growth. I think there's a presumption made, not sure why it's made or wh",640,"Okay, so I think, 3 points. At least as I heard, and so trying to hit all those. The first is large asset, that's a big part of the balance sheet that doesn't have a lot of near-term growth. I think there's a presumption made, not sure why it's made or where it comes from, that we have no ability to kind of, after we acquire this property, as I said earlier in my remarks, get through the period of stabilization because there is a period to finish doing the work and install a tenant, at which point, I think we will get to a valuation that's much higher than our basis, just for basically getting through the period of having that income stream identified and putting the big financing in place. I wouldn't presume and I wouldn't know why anyone would presume we couldn't re-JV that asset in 6, 12, 18 or 24 months. So when you talk about a large asset lying around the balance sheet for decades, this is SL Green, so I'm not sure -- I'm sure you dialed into the right call. We tend to not just sort of buy and hold and sit on assets in perpetuity, we tend to try and buy right, capitalize right, execute. And when the moment's there, monetize our JV. This asset -- is being, it will be closed in a series of ticks that will give us complete flexibility in a private REIT or in a JV or in a partnership or otherwise, or in a tick format, to bring in any party as we choose to or not choose to, sort of at any times. So I think as it relates to looking out in the future, yes, we haven't made any -- we haven't given any guidance on the future, what we've -- beyond the 3 years that are in the books, so. What we have said is that the accretion this deal will generate over the next 3 years varies between $0.15 roughly, in 2016, I think $0.30 now in 2018. So I wouldn't look beyond that, because that's what are out there, I would say, talking about now. If and when we ever feel this asset or any other asset, I wouldn't -- I mean 11 Mad is not unique when it comes to maximizing values and reaching stabilization, if we feel we hit that with this asset, then I think it's safe to assume, we probably look to monetize it in a way to create a gain, because I think any asset we've ever sold in the company in 17 years has resulted in a gain. So I don't see where this would be different. I think this, if anything, would be even more so, because I think it's a very good buy. And we wouldn't allow this or any other asset to take down the growth profile of the company over the next, whatever period of time you were talking about, 5, 10, 15 years, because we do the exact opposite that I think as you have seen -- because I think we sell more than any other, certainly in New York, or even maybe office REIT, in terms of volume of sale to kind of illuminate value and monetize and harvest. So I would -- I would kind of look at this asset as sort of, on a 3- to 5-year period and then we'll always readjust from there. As you talk about the second point, lever up, again, I don't want Matt to repeat his commentary, but the -- if you look at what's on the web and/or replay Matt's commentary, he talks about after the buys and the sells, the debt ratios are improved. So there's no lever up, unless you're talking about an interim several months to it."

That's the only -- I heard you say lever up, so that's what I was responding to. There's no lever up here.

This is, this will be in -- I mean if you measure it month-by-month, my guess is the ratios are up for August, September. But then, I don't know when the deal starts to close October, November, December, that, combined with the FFO projections we have for next year, lead us to a place where we believe debt-to-EBITDA will be lower than where we started, and leverage ratios will be lower than where we started. So again, I don't want to -- and obviously, credit quality is way up, because you compare what we're selling to what we're buying, at least in our eyes, and that's what -- you're -- the shareholders are betting on this management team so, if we feel the credit quality is up, then that's -- people can differ, but I wouldn't know how it's -- the building is rock solid, the market's the best and the credit is impeccable. So we feel it's a credit upgrade, a leverage improvement and accretion over a 3-year period and complete flexibility after to 3 years to figure out ways to make money on the asset in a capital market kind of way. So honestly, I forget the 3rd point, didn't write it down, I only wrote down those 2. So if you remember it, I ask again, if not, I forgot it. 
It's sovereign, sovereign. I'm sorry. Thank you, Steve. Sovereign capital. So when you say we beat sovereign, I'm not -- there were 4 or 5 bidders at the end of the process. It was a mixture of domestic and sovereign, REIT and non-REIT. I don't know what kind of particular insight, you haven't said the bidding array, but we think we know the bidding array, and it was a mixture, everybody was pretty much on top of the number. If the presumption is we had to bid more to get it, that assumption is wrong. We were all at least, as we understand it, right about the same number, and it was a matter of, when you narrow a field down to 4 or 5 people, it's already been through 1 round or 2, you got to select a winner. And I think the feather in our cap is amongst some the very best and biggest names in the industry, SL Green was awarded the deal in no small part because we had preexisting relationships with both ends of the seller, because it was a partnership. We actually had financed this building, if you recall, back in 2004, maybe? 2004, So we financed the acquisition from the Shapiro family way back when, we've been on, sort of tracking this asset for 3 years plus in an acquisition sense, the moment was here, we acted quickly. I think the relationships were solid, the trust and credibility was there. And when somebody gets -- you get that call, to go to contract in a 5-day period, I'm not sure every other sovereign or bidder is fleet enough of foot, where they can necessarily match up to our ability to do speed of execution, which I think is how we won the deal. So in terms of price, I'm not -- I don't believe price was the deciding factor at the end."

And that's really been more of our focus. I mean, look, Steve -- you can make a, an argument that if we sold on a basis exactly as we bought, and it wasn't accretive, we got nothing more than a credit upgrade, you can justify it on that basis. And that's something we've been -- if you look at the portfolio and you I think, can appreciate this more than most because you've been there with us since Day 1, if you look back 17 years to what the portfolio looked like then, maybe and to what it is today, both in scale and quality and institutional nature, you get there in part by being an optimist in part, by value add. But in part it's rotating assets. I mean you have to rotate assets to increase quality. This is a serious, serious office building. 2.3 million feet, right on Madison Square Park, with bulletproof credit. And as I said earlier, the proof will just be in the pudding down the road, we think we bought it well, and we'll have the ability to monetize value out of this asset going forward. You don't -- value isn't only about repositioning. I mean, I think we do that about as good as anybody else and we put a couple of sales on the board just now, and we always do prove that, but sometimes you could make a good buy. And I think we did here. I think we made a good buy, and I think we'll monetize value. I don't know if I see this as a 10, 15, 20 year hold, and we didn't compare to the portfolio in that sense. We looked at it as achieving a lot of strategic goals for us, in terms of quality and durability of cash flow and presence in that market, which is sort of, I mean it's an unmatched presence now, 3.5 million square feet on 2 blocks of Midtown South, with buildings that can cater to large tenants where most buildings in Midtown South can't, and having not just tenants like Credit Suisse and Sony, but Yelp and others that are growing tenants. And they may grow in that building and they grow hopefully elsewhere in our portfolio. And there's a whole host of other strategic elements to this deal, the connectivity to 1 Madison, the fact now that we have Credit Suisse, not just, half of their presence in the market, but all of their presence, which I think gives us a better opportunity to have a productive relationship with CS, controlling both ends of that, there's all sorts of stuff there. So 10 years, don't know, 3 to 5 years, highly accretive. I would assume at the end of the 3 to 5-year period, if we haven't figured out a way to further the growth trajectory, then there would be an opportunity to JV and monetize significant value."

364744,312638543,880033,"SL Green Realty Corp., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","SL Green Realty Corp.","Executives","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome.

Just to confirm, you're dialed into the SL Green third quarter earnings call and what a quarter it was. We had an enjoyable summer executing on 9 different disposition transactions that were part of the design and delivered strategy to take advantage of favorable market conditions that exist currently, reduced structural complexity where it exists and reduced overall leverage, and back fund the closing of the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue, a $2.6 million iconic asset located on Madison Square Park and housed in the U.S. headquarters of CS and Sony. 
In total, these transactions aggregated to $1.7 billion of activity, which upon closings will generate almost $680 million of net proceeds for the company. And most importantly, the Manhattan sales, which transacted at an average cap rate of 3.3% on current cash NOI, that's less than the 3.5% cap rate bogie we had set forth to shareholders in June.
This should dispel, in my opinion for now, any notion that macro external forces have reduced or repressed the desire of international investors to covet prime Manhattan real estate assets. And a list of very recent transactions that I'll run through right now and as recent is defined as the last 3 or 4 months since the end of Q2 was the purchase of a substantial interest in the Trinity portfolio by Norgis, a Norwegian investor; a recently announced deal in excess of $5 billion to acquire the residential complex in combination with Canadian investor, Cambridge, Alliances recapitalization of 114 Fifth Avenue, with a German investor; 520 Fifth Avenue acquisition by a Chinese investor done not too long ago; 370 Lexington was purchased by a Japanese investor; and in the list of dispositions I mentioned earlier, there were 2 specific transactions that involve foreign capital.
So clearly, that market still seems to be, in our opinion, very much -- very, very much alive. And while we were busy negotiating and documenting the terms of these dispositions, we also managed to take advantage the several value opportunities, such as our acquisition of the SoHo building, at 110 Greene Street, the development assemblage of 187 Broadway and the development assemblage on the Upper East side.
I hope our shareholders will join me in extending my compliments to the men and women SL Green team that worked with urgency throughout the summer to bring about this extraordinary results.
The net result is that we will meet our funding goals for the $3 billion 2015 acquisitions, obviously, inclusive of 11 Madison, upon the sale of just one more asset, 1745 Broadway, which we have just introduced into the market and the completion of several pending refinancings.
Notwithstanding these achievements, we will continue to sell additional assets in order to accretively fund a significant pipeline of investment opportunities that we are currently working on.
We will -- we look at asset sales of the kind that we are executing right now as being the absolute, best form of equity capital to fund this opportunistic pipeline. And in looking at how the cap rate, the resulting sale cap rates relate to our portfolio and the valuation of our portfolio, interested by the fact that at a $120 a share roughly where our stock price rates today, that's an implied cap rate on Manhattan assets of 5.3%. And to sort of get right to it, if you were to value that same portfolio, Manhattan Assets, at a 4 [ph] cap rate, that would be $153 [ph] a share. And at a 3.5 [ph] cap rate, that's $173 a share. So it's not an opinion of any of per se, one way or the other. It's simply a street math that results when you apply the kind of cap rates that we routinely see, not just in the deals that we executed on during the last 3 or 4 months. But really, if you look back over the last year or 2, the kind of results we get when we put our prime stable Manhattan assets for recycling, that these are the kind of results we get time and time again. So, however, that gets digested, we wanted to bring that to light.
I want to turn now to the leasing side. And the leasing should not at all be overshadowed by the enormous volume of activity on the transactional side. But the leasing results for the quarter were once again exceptionally strong and in line with our increased goals for the year. We continue to achieve approximately 15% [ph] mark-to-market on New Manhattan office leases. And in fact, that number is higher for the same store leases we have executed during just the first three weeks of October.
So in total, we've leased 63,000 [ph] square feet in October on the first three weeks of summer, which were same-store summer, which were not. And more importantly, we have a pipeline of leasing activity totaling 1.4 million square feet, which is substantially higher than each of the last 3 quarters, I would say each of the last 3 quarters averaged about 1 million square feet of pipeline. We announced it at 1.4 million square feet of pipeline, of which 750,000 square feet of leases are either in negotiation or out for signature, mostly that's in negotiation. But as I said before, the leases in negotiation had a very, very high probability traditionally of closing. And we would hope to close most if not all of that 750,000 square feet, although not necessarily all by year-end. But that pipeline is growing, not shrinking. So I'm sure we will be asked to expound upon that activity during the Q&A portion of the call. But the takeaway, I would hope, is a vibrant piece of the market that did not take a pause during the slow and volatile summer months. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Andrew Mathias who I think is going to give you a little more insight into some of this activity as well as the structured finance activities for the quarter."

Our big announcement this quarter were the sales of our key position at 885 Avenue and our new student housing development at 33. 885 brings to a close the last of 2007, 2008 fee positions key purchased. 
Our returns in this program were extraordinary, taking highly secure senior position and assets, applying appropriate fixed-rate long-term leverage and letting the positions appreciate. 885 will generate an IRR in excess of 10%, combined with over 17% IRR into Harold, and 15.5% IRR on 292 Madison. Extraordinary returns for our shareholders on AAA risk type positions.
Don't think this business line is discontinued, as we continue to actively look for additional opportunities to compliment 635 Madison Avenue and 562 Fifth Avenue in our current key portfolio. 
At 33 Beekman, on Tuesday our team joined Pace University's senior management team to cut the ribbon on what we believe to be the tallest student housing project in the country, at 382 feet. I'm very proud with our construction team for delivering this ground-up project on time and on-budget, successfully navigating the many complexities of the site. Base is thrilled and Wednesday we announced a contract to sell the assets to a foreign buyer at a very compelling cap rate of 3.9%. 
In addition to an extraordinary return on our investment, with a projected property level IRR in excess of 40%, we expect to receive promote on a deal in excess of $10 million when it closes early next year.
Needless to say, we're hard at work identifying new sites to continue this business line as well where we've had extraordinary profits in our student housing division. We expect more news on the sales fronts in the fourth quarter as we continue to take advantage of great market conditions in Manhattan.
On DPE, preferred equity, net originations slow down a bit this quarter as several repayments we anticipated rolled in over the course of the quarter. That said, we have very fulsome pipeline for the fourth quarter. And debt market dislocation, which shook things up a bit in August, is giving us an extraordinary opportunity to maintain or in some cases, even increase, retained deal on positions in that pipeline so we'd expect to close the year on target and with extraordinary profitability and high relative returns.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Matt."

Taking into consi",709,"Thanks, Andrew. Our third quarter results showcase the strong performance from both our real estate net preferred equity portfolios, as well as the successful execution of our disseminated real estate disposition reinvestment strategy. 
Taking into consideration these results and looking ahead to the fourth quarter after just increasing guidance back in July, we're again increasing our FFO guidance range to 634 [ph] to 637 [ph] per share, putting us on track to almost 9% as of FFO growth per year. 
Looking through the third quarter results, in the real estate portfolio, the effect of the acquisition of 11 Madison on August 18 and 110 Greene Street at the end of July contributed to an increase in several line items on the income statement as well as cash NOI, partially offset by the sale of an interest in 131, 137 Spring Street on August 4. 
Excluding the effect of these transactions, our property operating results continue to see the benefit of increasing portfolio occupancy in Manhattan, which now stands at over 97% on a lease basis with same-store portfolio and mark-to-market in excess of our expectations, coupled with the continued containment of operating expenses. 
The historically operating expenses are much higher in the third quarter than they are in the second, and that is what we saw, again, this year with a much more modest increase than expected. All these factors contribution to same-store NOI growth of 4.6% through the first 9 months and put us on a past to end the year well ahead our goal of 3.6%.
The debt and preferred equity portfolio, the balance decreased to $1.5 million as we received repayments totaling $262 million during the quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. As Andrew outlined we have significant pipeline of originations for the fourth quarter at yields that exceeds the 8.5% [ph] we expected to achieve 2015. This pipeline of activity, which is weighted towards back half of the quarter, will bring our portfolio balance to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion by the end of the year with the overall portfolio yields remaining over 10%. 
In other income, the FFO from our real estate investment preferred equity portfolio was complemented by a $5 million reduction in by the overall portfolio yield. This benefit comes as a result of enormous amount of our analysis review the cost structure between our ERS and operating partnership, including reimbursement of corporate overhead by the CRS. As you all know, we are very focused on operating efficiencies through tax structuring and strategy and everything we do. So kudos to our tax director for his efforts in this regard. 
Also included in other income during the quarter was the recognition of lease termination payments totaling about $4 million. As we have said in the past, we don't view lease termination as nonrecurring, which historically recognized some level of lease termination income every quarter. This is simply the accelerated recognition of lease income that we otherwise would have received over time. 
On the expense side, given all of our investment activity during the quarter highlighted by the acquisitions of 11 Madison and 123, we recognized a significant amount of transaction costs somewhat more than we anticipated. As always, we are conservative in our view of transaction cost given that we are so active. And that conservatism remains to be ahead into the fourth quarter with a full pipeline of activity ahead.
All things considered, we are very pleased to be raising guidance for the second consecutive quarter. I think we are set up very nicely ahead for 2016. We're excited for the quarters ahead and we look forward to unveiling our 2016 earnings guidance in early December. 
In that regard before turning it back to Marc, I want to remind everyone that our 18th Annual Investor Conference is being held on December 7 in New York City.

We have quite a bit of dislocation in the CMBS market in August. And every time there's kind of dislocation, we find extraordinary opportunity sort of shaking out capital structures that are short proceeds because people get carved back in the CMBS market.

We haven't really seen any let up in demand on whether it's the bottom or the top or price-sensitive versus the high price point product. I would say that overall midtown has got more opportunity for rent growth than Midtown South, at least in the near-term because there's more inventory available. And the demand is going to follow where the supply is. And there's a lot of -- we see a lot of velocity in deals in the pipeline for Midtown right now. So to put a number on it, between now and 12 months from now, I'd be very surprised if we didn't see at least 7% to 8% of rent growth."

We have made some investments in the Midtown South area, like 635, 646. But even in that building, which has a fair amount of tech tenants, they're all very high-quality, like In 4, Microsoft, and who else do we have there? Yelp.

And the tenants that we'll be looking for large blocks of uses between 500,000 and 1 million square feet and over on the West side really don't really answer even our target market for the most part, because we see this building likely being tenanted by tenants ranging anywhere from 50,000 feet to 250,000 feet, looking for very high end, very highly amenitized, very well designed, very well located, brand-new office space, with views that are sort of unparalleled in Midtown because of the height of the building. I don't think there's a lot of competition. That doesn't mean we don't have to think long and hard about who is that tenant base and how we can attack them.

Just to confirm, you're dialed into the SL Green third quarter earnings call and what a quarter it was. We had an enjoyable summer executing on 9 different disposition transactions that were part of a designed and deliberate strategy to take advantage of favorable market conditions that exist currently, reduce structural complexity where it exists and reduce overall leverage, and back fund the closing of the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue, a $2.6 billion iconic asset located on Madison Square Park and housing in the U.S. headquarters of CS and Sony.
In total, these transactions aggregated to $1.7 billion of activity, which upon closings will generate almost $680 million of net proceeds for the company. And most importantly, the Manhattan sales, which transacted at an average cap rate of 3.3% on current cash NOI, that's less than the 3.5% cap rate bogie we had set forth to shareholders in June.
This should dispel, in my opinion, for now, any notion that macro external forces have reduced or repressed the desire of international investors to covet prime Manhattan real estate assets. And a list of very recent transactions that I'll run through right now and this recent is defined as the last 3 or 4 months since the end of Q2, was the purchase of a substantial interest in the Trinity portfolio by Norges, a Norwegian investor; a recently announced deal in excess of $5 billion to acquire the Stuy Town residential complex in combination with Canadian investor, Ivanhoé Cambridge, Alliances recapitalization of 114 Fifth Avenue, with German investor; 520 Fifth Avenue acquisition by a Chinese investor done not too long ago; 370 Lexington was purchased by a Japanese investor; and in the list of dispositions I mentioned earlier, there were 2 specific transactions that involve foreign capital.
So clearly, that market still seems to be, in our opinion, very much -- very, very much alive. And while we were busy negotiating and documenting the terms of these dispositions, we also managed to take advantage the several value opportunities, such as our acquisition of the SoHo building, at 110 Greene Street, the development assemblage of 187 Broadway and the development assemblage on the Upper East side.
I hope our shareholders will join me in extending my compliments to the men and women on the SL Green team that worked with urgency throughout the summer to bring about this extraordinary results.
The net result is that we will meet our funding goals for the $3 billion 2015 acquisitions, obviously, inclusive of 11 Madison, upon the sale of just one more asset, 1745 Broadway, which we have just introduced into the market and the completion of several pending refinancings.
Notwithstanding these achievements, we will continue to sell additional assets in order to accretively fund a significant pipeline of investment opportunities that we are currently working on.
We will -- we look at asset sales of the kind that we are executing right now as being the absolute, best form of equity capital to fund this opportunistic pipeline. And in looking at how the cap rate, the resulting sale cap rates relate to our portfolio and the valuation of our portfolio, [indiscernible] interested by the fact that at a $120 a share roughly where our stock price trades today, that's an implied cap rate on Manhattan assets of 5.3%. And to sort of get right through it, if you were to value that same portfolio, Manhattan Assets, at a 4 cap rate, that would be $153 a share. And at a 3.5 cap rate, that's $173 a share. So it's not an opinion of NAV per se. One way or the other, it's simply a straight math that results when you apply the kind of cap rates that we routinely see, not just in the deals that we've executed on during the last 3 or 4 months. But really, if you look back over the last year or 2, the kind of results we get when we put our prime stable Manhattan assets for recycling, these are the kind of results we get time and time again. So, however, that gets digested, we wanted to bring that to light.
I want to turn now to the leasing side. And the leasing should not at all be overshadowed by the enormous volume of activity on the transactional side. Because the leasing results for the quarter were once again exceptionally strong and in line with our increased goals for the year. We continue to achieve approximately 15% mark-to-market on New Manhattan office leases. And in fact, that number is higher for the same store leases we have executed during just the first three weeks of October.
So in total, we've leased 63,000 square feet in October in the first three weeks some of which were same-store some, which were not. And more importantly, we have a pipeline of leasing activity totaling 1.4 million square feet, which is substantially higher than each of the last 3 quarters, I would say each of the last 3 quarters averaged about 1 million square feet of pipeline. We announced it at 1.4 million square feet of pipeline, of which 750,000 square feet of leases are either in negotiation or out for signature, mostly that's in negotiation. But as I've said before, the leases in negotiation have a very, very high probability traditionally of closing. And we would hope to close most, if not all of that 750,000 square feet, although not necessarily all by year-end. But that pipeline is growing, not shrinking. So I'm sure we will be asked to expand upon that activity during the Q&A portion of the call. But the takeaway, I would hope, is a vibrant piece of the market that did not take a pause during the slow and more volatile summer months. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Andrew Mathias, who I think is going to give you a little more insight into some of this activity as well as the structured finance activities for the quarter."

Our big announcement this quarter were the sales of our key position at 885 Third Avenue and our new student housing development at 33 Beekman. 885 brings to a close the last of the 2007, 2008 fee positions we purchased.
Our returns in this program were extraordinary, taking highly secure senior positions and assets, applying appropriate fixed-rate long-term leverage and letting the positions appreciate. 885 will generate an IRR in excess of 10%, combined with over 17% IRR into Harold, and 15.5% IRR on the 292 Madison. Extraordinary returns for our shareholders on AAA risk type positions.
Don't think this business line is discontinued, as we continue to actively look for additional opportunities to compliment 635 Madison Avenue and 562 Fifth Avenue in our current key portfolio.
At 33 Beekman, on Tuesday our team joined Pace University's senior management team to cut the ribbon on what we believe to be the tallest student housing projects in the country, at 382 feet. I'm very proud of our construction team for delivering this ground-up project on time and on-budget, successfully navigating the many complexities of the site. Base is thrilled and Wednesday we announced a contract to sell the assets to a foreign buyer at a very compelling cap rate of 3.9%. 
In addition to an extraordinary return on our investment, with a projected property level IRR in excess of 40%, we expect to receive promote on a deal in excess of $10 million when it closes early next year.
Needless to say, we're hard at work identifying new sites to continue this business line as well where we've had extraordinary profits in our student housing division. We expect more news on the sales front in the fourth quarter as we continue to take advantage of great market conditions in Manhattan.
On DPE, debt & preferred equity, net originations slow down a bit this quarter as several repayments we anticipated rolled in over the course of the quarter. That said, we have a very fulsome pipeline for  fourth quarter. And debt market dislocation, which shook things up a bit in August, is giving us an extraordinary opportunity to maintain or in some cases, even increase, retained yields on positions in that pipeline. So we'd expect to close the year on target and with extraordinary profitability and high relative returns.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Matt."

Our third quarter results showcase the strong performance from both our real estate, and debt and preferred equity portfolios, as well as the successful execution of our disseminated real estate disposition and reinvestment strategy.Taki",737,"Thanks, Andrew. Our third quarter results showcase the strong performance from both our real estate, and debt and preferred equity portfolios, as well as the successful execution of our disseminated real estate disposition and reinvestment strategy.
Taking into consideration these results and looking ahead to the fourth quarter after just increasing guidance back in July, we're again increasing our NAREIT defined FFO guidance range to $6.34 to $6.37 per share, putting us on track for almost 9% FFO growth year-over-year. 
Looking through the third quarter results, in the real estate portfolio, the effect of the acquisition of 11 Madison on August 18 and 110 Greene Street at the end of July contributed to an increase in several line items on the income statement as well as cash NOI, partially offset by the sale of an 80% interest in 131, 137 Spring Street on August 4.
Excluding the effects of those transactions, our property operating results continued to see the benefit of increasing portfolio occupancy in Manhattan, which now stands at over 97% on a leased basis in the same-store portfolio and mark-to-market in excess of our expectations, coupled with the continued containment of operating expenses. 
Historically, operating expenses are much higher in the third quarter than they are in the second, and that is what we saw, again, this year with a much more modest increase than expected. All these factors have contributed to same-store NOI growth of 4.6% through the first 9 months and put us on a past to end the year well ahead our goal of  3.6%.
The debt and preferred equity portfolio, the balance decreased to $1.5 million as we received repayments totaling $262 million during the quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. As Andrew outlined we have a significant pipeline of originations for the fourth quarter and yields that exceed the 8.5%, we expected to achieve in 2015. This pipeline of activity, which is weighted towards back half of the quarter, will bring our portfolio balance to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion by the end of the year with the overall portfolio yields remaining north of 10%.
In other income, the FFO from our real estate, and debt and preferred equity portfolios was complemented by a $5 million reduction in the prior year tax obligation of our taxable REIT subsidiary. This benefit comes as a result of an enormous amount of analysis by our tax professionals to review the cost sharing structure between our TRS and our operating partnership, including new reimbursement of corporate overhead by the TRS.
As you all know, we are very focused on creating efficiencies through tax structuring and strategy and everything we do. So kudos to our Tax Director, Michael Barber, for his efforts in this regard.
Also included in other income during the quarter was the recognition of lease termination payments totaling about $4 million. As we have said in the past, we don't view lease termination income as nonrecurring, which historically we've recognized some level of lease termination income virtually every quarter. This is simply the accelerated recognition of lease income that we otherwise would have received over time. 
On the expense side, given all of our investment activity during the quarter highlighted by the acquisitions of 11 Madison and 110 Greene. We recognized a significant amount of transaction costs somewhat more than we anticipated. As always, we are conservative in our view of transaction costs given that we are so active. And that conservatism remains as we head into the fourth quarter with a full pipeline of activity ahead.
All things considered, we are very pleased to be raising guidance for the second consecutive quarter. I think we are set up very nicely ahead into 2016. We're excited for the quarters ahead, and we look forward to unveiling our 2016 earnings guidance in early December.
In that regard before I turn it back to Marc, I want to remind everyone that our 18th Annual Investor Conference is being held on December 7 in New York City. It is hard to believe that we're holding this now for 18 years. It's a full day event, chock-full of information and may be a bit of entertainment. Invitations will be going out in the next couple of weeks. But if you like more information in the meantime, please email us. The email addresses in our press release, but it's slg2015@slgreen.com. 
With that, back to Marc."

We haven't really seen any let up in demand on whether it's the bottom or the top or on the more price-sensitive versus the high price point product. I would say that overall Midtown has got more opportunity for rent growth than the Midtown South, at least in the near-term because there's more inventory available. And the demand is going to follow where the supply is. And there's a lot of -- we've seen velocity in deals in the pipeline for Midtown right now.

We have made some investments in the Midtown South area, like 635, 646. But even in that building, which has a fair amount of tech tenants, they're all very high-quality, like Infor, Microsoft, and who else do we have there? And Yelp so, I don't know that, that doesn't raise any red flags for us on the credit side of things. I think we've sold properties in the past where we felt there were some credit exposures to try and head off what may be coming down the pipe.

And the tenants that we'll be looking for large blocks of uses between 500,000 and 1 million square feet and over on the West side really don't even enter or target market for the most part, because we see this building likely being tenanted by tenants ranging anywhere from 50,000 feet to 250,000 feet, looking for very high end, very highly amenitized, very high designed, very well located, brand-new office space, at -- with views that are sort of unparalleled in Midtown because of the height of the building.

So I think that is very indicative of the work day and there a retail group is doing, diligence and the assets we own and in addition to the assets we're purchasing to try to find areas where we can expand the retail footprint and convert lower revenue generating space into higher revenue generating space. So there is a lot more of that opportunity in the portfolio."

But that will have to be modified because some of the leasing has taken place this year. But the slide in December that I recall was something like $160 million of incremental NOI over the next 5 years, our share, that never represents our share, coming strictly from retail assets. Now in that regard, there's been some retail leasing but we've added retail assets. So we'll have to do that reconciliation for you in December. But suffice is to say, it's enormous. I look at that number as coming from the retail, which is not a segment of business we have a lot of capital devoted to like we do on the office sector, much more capital devoted there. So pound for pound, that kind of NOI lift over the next 5 years, coming from that segment, is enormous. But like I said, we don't -- I can't tell you at the moment the exact and kind of NOI expectation we have from retail over the next 5 years. We will have that for you in December."

364744,312638543,880669,"SL Green Realty Corp., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","SL Green Realty Corp.","Executives","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome.

Just to confirm, you're dialed into the SL Green third quarter earnings call and what a quarter it was. We had an enjoyable summer executing on 9 different disposition transactions that were part of a designed and deliberate strategy to take advantage of favorable market conditions that exist currently, reduce structural complexity where it exists and reduce overall leverage, and back fund the closing of the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue, a $2.6 billion iconic asset located on Madison Square Park and housing in the U.S. headquarters of CS and Sony.
In total, these transactions aggregated to $1.7 billion of activity, which upon closings will generate almost $680 million of net proceeds for the company. And most importantly, the Manhattan sales, which transacted at an average cap rate of 3.3% on current cash NOI, that's less than the 3.5% cap rate bogie we had set forth to shareholders in June.
This should dispel, in my opinion, for now, any notion that macro external forces have reduced or repressed the desire of international investors to covet prime Manhattan real estate assets. And a list of very recent transactions that I'll run through right now and this -- recent is defined as the last 3 or 4 months since the end of Q2, was the purchase of a substantial interest in the Trinity portfolio by Norges, a Norwegian investor; a recently announced deal in excess of $5 billion to acquire the Stuy Town residential complex in combination with Canadian investor, Ivanhoé Cambridge, Alliances recapitalization of 114 Fifth Avenue, with German investor; 520 Fifth Avenue acquisition by a Chinese investor done not too long ago; 370 Lexington was purchased by a Japanese investor; and in the list of dispositions I mentioned earlier, there were 2 specific transactions that involve foreign capital.
So clearly, that market still seems to be, in our opinion, very much -- very, very much alive. And while we were busy negotiating and documenting the terms of these dispositions, we also managed to take advantage the several value opportunities, such as our acquisition of the SoHo building, at 110 Greene Street, the development assemblage of 187 Broadway and the development assemblage on the Upper East Side.
I hope our shareholders will join me in extending my compliments to the men and women on the SL Green team that worked with urgency throughout the summer to bring about these extraordinary results.
The net result is that we will meet our funding goals for the $3 billion 2015 acquisitions, obviously, inclusive of 11 Madison, upon the sale of just one more asset, 1745 Broadway, which we have just introduced into the market and the completion of several pending refinancings.
Notwithstanding these achievements, we will continue to sell additional assets in order to accretively fund a significant pipeline of investment opportunities that we are currently working on.
We will -- we look at asset sales of the kind that we are executing right now as being the absolute, best form of equity capital to fund this opportunistic pipeline. And in looking at how the cap rate, the resulting sale cap rates relate to our portfolio and the valuation of our portfolio, I'm always interested by the fact that at a $120 a share roughly where our stock price trades today, that's an implied cap rate on Manhattan assets of 5.3%. And to sort of get right through it, if you were to value that same portfolio, Manhattan Assets, at a 4 cap rate, that would be $153 a share. And at a 3.5 cap rate, that's $173 a share. So it's not an opinion of NAV per se. One way or the other, it's simply the straight math that results when you apply the kind of cap rates that we routinely see, not just in the deals that we've executed on during the last 3 or 4 months. But really, if you look back over the last year or 2, the kind of results we get when we put our prime stable Manhattan assets for recycling, that these are the kind of results we get time and time again. So, however that gets digested, we wanted to bring that to light.
I want to turn now to the leasing side. And the leasing should not at all be overshadowed by the enormous volume of activity on the transactional side. Because the leasing results for the quarter were once again exceptionally strong and in line with our increased goals for the year. We continue to achieve approximately 15% mark-to-market on New Manhattan office leases. And in fact, that number is higher for the same store leases we have executed during just the first three weeks of October.
So in total, we've leased 63,000 square feet in October in the first three weeks, some of which were same-store, some which were not. And more importantly, we have a pipeline of leasing activity totaling 1.4 million square feet, which is substantially higher than each of the last 3 quarters, I would say each of the last 3 quarters averaged about 1 million square feet of pipeline. We announced it at 1.4 million square feet of pipeline, of which 750,000 square feet of leases are either in negotiation or out for signature, mostly that's in negotiation. But as I've said before, the leases in negotiation have a very, very high probability traditionally of closing. And we would hope to close most, if not all of that 750,000 square feet, although not necessarily all by year-end, but that pipeline is growing, not shrinking. So I'm sure we will be asked to expand upon that activity during the Q&A portion of the call. But the takeaway, I would hope, is a vibrant piece of the market that did not take a pause during the slow and more volatile summer months. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Andrew Mathias, who I think is going to give you a little more insight into some of this activity as well as the structured finance activities for the quarter."

Our big announcements this quarter were the sales of our key position at 885 Third Avenue and our new student housing development at 33 Beekman. 885 brings to a close the last of the 2007, 2008 fee positions we purchased.
Our returns in this program were extraordinary, taking highly secure senior positions and assets, applying appropriate fixed-rate long-term leverage and letting the positions appreciate. 885 will generate an IRR in excess of 10%, combined with over 17% IRR into Herald, and 15.5% IRR on 292 Madison. Extraordinary returns for our shareholders on AAA risk type positions.
Don't think this business line is discontinued, as we continue to actively look for additional opportunities to complement 635 Madison Avenue and 562 Fifth Avenue in our current key portfolio.
At 33 Beekman, on Tuesday our team joined Pace University's senior management team to cut the ribbon on what we believe to be the tallest student housing projects in the country, at 382 feet. I'm very proud of our construction team for delivering this ground-up project on time and on-budget, successfully navigating the many complexities of the site. Pace is thrilled and Wednesday we announced a contract to sell the asset to a foreign buyer at a very compelling cap rate of 3.9%. 
In addition to an extraordinary return on our investment, with a projected property level IRR in excess of 40%, we expect to receive promote on the deal in excess of $10 million when it closes early next year.
Needless to say, we're hard at work identifying new sites to continue this business line as well where we've had extraordinary profits in our student housing division. We expect more news on the sales front in the fourth quarter as we continue to take advantage of great market conditions in Manhattan.
On DPE, debt & preferred equity, net originations slow down a bit this quarter as several repayments we anticipated rolled in over the course of the quarter. That said, we have a very fulsome pipeline for  fourth quarter. And debt market dislocation, which shook things up a bit in August, is giving us an extraordinary opportunity to maintain or in some cases, even increase, retained yields on positions in that pipeline. So we'd expect to close the year on target and with extraordinary profitability and high relative returns.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Matt."

Our third quarter results showcase the strong performance from both our real estate, and debt and preferred equity portfolios, as well as the successful execution of our publicly disseminated real estate disposition and reinvestment strategy.
Taking into consideration these results and looking ahead to the fourth quarter after just increasing guidance back in July, we're again increasing our NAREIT defined FFO guidance range to $6.34 to $6.37 per share, putting us on track for almost 9% FFO growth year-over-year. 
Looking through the third quarter results, in the real estate portfolio, the effect of the acquisition of 11 Madison on August 18 and 110 Greene Street at the end of July contributed to an increase in several line items on the income statement as well as cash NOI, partially offset by the sale of an 80% interest in 131, 137 Spring Street on August 4.
Excluding the effects of those transactions, our property operating results continued to see the benefit of increasing portfolio occupancy in Manhattan, which now stands at over 97% on a leased basis in the same-store portfolio and mark-to-market in excess of our expectations, coupled with the continued containment of operating expenses. 
Historically, operating expenses are much higher in the third quarter than they are in the second, and that is what we saw, again, this year, with a much more modest increase than expected. All these factors have contributed to same-store NOI growth of 4.6% through the first 9 months and put us on a path to end the year well ahead our goal of 3.6%.
In the debt and preferred equity portfolio, the balance decreased to $1.5 million as we received repayments totaling $262 million during the quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. As Andrew outlined we have a significant pipeline of new originations for the fourth quarter and yields that exceed the 8.5%, we expected to achieve in 2015. This pipeline of activity, which is weighted towards back half of the quarter, will bring our portfolio balance to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion by the end of the year, with the overall portfolio yields remaining north of 10%.
In other income, the FFO from our real estate, and debt and preferred equity portfolios was complemented by a $5 million reduction in the prior year tax obligation of our taxable REIT subsidiary. This benefit comes as a result of an enormous amount of analysis by our tax professionals who reviewed the cost sharing structure between our TRS and our operating partnership, including the reimbursement of corporate overhead by the TRS.
As you all know, we are very focused on creating efficiencies through tax structuring and strategy and everything we do. So kudos to our Tax Director, Michael Barber, for his efforts in this regard.
Also included in other income during the quarter was the recognition of lease termination payments totaling about $4 million. As we have said in the past, we don't view lease termination income as nonrecurring, which historically we've recognized some level of lease termination income virtually every quarter. This is simply the accelerated recognition of lease income that we otherwise would have received over time. 
On the expense side, given all of our investment activity during the quarter highlighted by the acquisitions of 11 Madison and 110 Greene. We recognized a significant amount of transaction costs somewhat more than we anticipated. As always, we are conservative in our view of transaction costs given that we are so active. And that conservatism remains as we head into the fourth quarter with a full pipeline of activity ahead.
All things considered, we are very pleased to be raising guidance for the second consecutive quarter. I think we are set up very nicely ahead into 2016. We're excited for the quarters ahead, and we look forward to unveiling our 2016 earnings guidance in early December.
In that regard before I turn it back to Marc, I want to remind everyone that our 18th Annual Investor Conference is being held on December 7 in New York City. It is hard to believe that we're holding this now for 18 years. It's a full day event, chock-full of information and may be a bit of entertainment. Invitations will be going out in the next couple of weeks. But if you'd like more information in the meantime, please email us. The email address is in our press release, but it's slg2015@slgreen.com.

We haven't really seen any let up in demand on whether it's the bottom or the top or on the more price-sensitive versus the high price point product. I would say that overall Midtown has got more opportunity for rent growth than the Midtown South, at least in the near-term because there's more inventory available. And the demand is going to follow where the supply is. And there's a lot of -- we've seen velocity in deals in the pipeline for Midtown right now.

I'm going to guess we have 5% or less exposure to pure tech tenants. And certainly, the type of TAMI tenant that you're talking about, which would be credit concern tenets, I think it's a very small portion of the portfolio. And traditionally, we've had very little loss in that segment, even when there were time of distress back in 2000, 2001, et cetera. So I think that the way we think of that is, it's kind of the way we run the business, which is oriented towards companies that are largely investment-grade, established bigger companies. We have made some investments in the Midtown South area, like 635, 646. But even in that building, which has a fair amount of tech tenants, they're all very high-quality, like Infor, Microsoft, and who else do we have there? And Yelp so, I don't know that, that doesn't raise any red flags for us on the credit side of things. I think we've sold properties in the past where we felt there were some credit exposures to try and head off what may be coming down the pipe. But I would simply say that just look at the supplemental with the disclosure of our tenant profile and you'll see that regardless of how that market develops over time and there's always going to be ups and downs in what's essentially a cyclical and emerging kind of industry. I don't see that having any impact, any material impact, on the portfolio as it hasn't in years past."

It really, I think, when you say there's other buildings going up of a similar -- there's really almost none. So I don't -- this maybe 425 Park, although, that already -- the majority of that is anchored and what's left is very small floorplate, so I actually don't know anything that is going up that we'll be delivering in 2020 that I would call competitive product in a AAA location. And the tenants that we'll be looking for large blocks of uses between 500,000 and 1 million square feet and over on the West side really don't even enter our target market for the most part, because we see this building likely being tenanted by tenants ranging anywhere from 50,000 feet to 250,000 feet, looking for very high end, very highly amenitized, very high designed, very well located, brand-new office space, at -- with views that are sort of unparalleled in Midtown because of the height of the building. So I don't think there's a lot of competition. That doesn't mean we don't have to think long and hard about who is that tenant base and how we're going to attract them. And that we'll go into that in great detail in December. But suffice it to say, the reception to the building from the tenant community so far has been excellent. And if anything, given that it's only 2015, and we're talking about occupancy in 2021, 2020 possession dates for occupancy, end of 2020, 2021. For tenants in that 50,000 to 250,000 square foot range, it's a little early, which maybe is obvious, but I just wanted to state that. But the reception, generally, has been excellent and I don't think the price points we have established for the building are going to be a resistance level for these types of tenants."

And how best we're going to fund those, and from which assess we're going to be selling or capital we're going to be raising in the form of JV equity, that's the capital raised in today's environment that we look at as an alternative to selling existing assets as JV-ing of new assets. We've -- we liked very much what we bought this year, so we didn't JV, I don't think any of that product, right? I mean SoHo House came as a JV but we didn't take any partners there or 11 Madison or on 187 or the Eastside portfolio, right? So we can always use that, the ability to access private equity, the partnership as a means of moderating what we sell or don't sell fund those kind of deals. So that hasn't been decided nor does it need to be at this point. But will be over the next 3 to 5 months as we execute on those opportunities."
