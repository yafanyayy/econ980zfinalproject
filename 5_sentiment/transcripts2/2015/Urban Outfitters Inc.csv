I will begin my prepared commentary discussing our fiscal year 2015 fourth quarter sales and net income results following versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will conclude my prepared commentary by sh",1197,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my prepared commentary discussing our fiscal year 2015 fourth quarter sales and net income results following versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will conclude my prepared commentary by sharing our thoughts concerning our plans for fiscal year 2016.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 12% to a fourth quarter record of $1 billion. This was our first ever $1 billion quarter, a nice milestone to hit with all of our brands delivering positive Retail segment comp sales. The total sales increase was driven by a 6% Retail segment comp, a $46 million increase in noncomparable sales, including the opening of 7 net new stores and a 21% jump in Wholesale sales. The 6% increase in Retail segment comp sales was driven by strong direct-to-consumer growth, which more than offset a narrowly negative sales comp at stores. Direct-to-consumer growth resulted from increases in sessions, orders, average order value and conversion. Negative store sales comp resulted from a reduction in transaction and units per transaction, which were partially offset by an increase in average unit selling price.
By brand, our Retail segment sales comp rates increased by 18% Free People, 6% in Anthropologie Group and 4% at Urban Outfitters. Free People Wholesale continue to deliver yet another strong quarter as sales rose 21% to $58 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at specialty stores and department stores.
Now turning back to total company performance, URBN gross profit for the quarter increased by 5% to $350 million, while gross profit rate declined by 207 basis points to 34.6%. The deleverage in gross profit rate occurred primarily due to lower initial merchandise markups followed by higher markdowns, which were primarily driven by the underperformance at the Urban Outfitters brand. Overinvested inventory levels and certain product category misses drove higher markdowns, while product sales mix and poor execution drove initial markups at the Urban brand.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased by 11% to $226 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged by 8 basis points to 22.3%. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased expenses to support new store growth and increased spend in both web marketing and technology investments to support direct-to-consumer channel growth. Operating income for the quarter decreased by 4% to $124 million, with operating profit rate declining by 199 basis points to 12.3%.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35% versus 31.7% in the prior comparable period. The tax rate variance is due to favorable one-time benefits relating to a federal rehabilitation credit received and the release of international valuation allowances in the prior comparable period. Net income was $80 [ph] million or $0.60 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 15% to $358 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non-comp sales stores and to support Retail segment comp stores growth. Comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 7% at cost while decreasing 7% in units.
Lastly, we ended the quarter with $363 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 3.8 million common shares for approximately $126 million. We have 2.3 million shares remaining on our May 27, 2014, Board of Directors authorization to repurchase 10 million shares. On February 23, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 20 million shares.
As we look forward to fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: We are planning to open approximately 32 new stores in the year. By brand, we are planning 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America, 13 new Anthropologie Group stores globally, including 1 new European store and 15 new Free People stores in North America. We believe that we could achieve approximately 100 basis points year-over-year gross margin improvement, inclusive of the one-time fulfillment center transition costs, which I will discuss later in my prepared commentary. It is likely that this achievement could be driven by greater progress in the second half of the year.
Our gross profit margin growth opportunity, largely depends on the timing of the margin progress at the Urban Outfitters brand in North America. The majority of the improvement opportunity for the year is related to lower markdown rates from improved product execution, better inventory control and allocation and improved initial markups.
As Dick and the team will discuss later in the call, the Urban brand is in a much better position versus this time last year, but while progress has been made, we are still a work in progress with much more to come.
We believe the brand can begin to deliver markdown improvement in the first quarter, but much, if not all this improvement, could be offset by unfavorable IMU, which we believe will not start to show meaningful improvement until the second quarter. Based on the possible IMU deleverage at the Urban brand and delivery expense deleverage related to our fulfillment center relocation, it is possible that our first quarter gross profit margin could deleverage at the URBN level.
As I mentioned earlier, please note that gross profit margin for URBN will be negatively affected by approximately 50 basis points in fiscal year 2016 relating to the transition of our East Coast fulfillment center from Trenton, South Carolina to Gap, Pennsylvania. Our new state-of-the-art 1 million square foot facility will begin phasing in outbound service for the customer in June. Therefore, the majority of this deleverage is planned to occur in the second and third quarters, while both the first and fourth quarters will be modestly affected as well.
We believe that SG&A could grow at a low double-digit rate for the year. This increase would primarily be driven by increases related to direct and selling support expenses to support our new store growth, and continued investments in both marketing and technology systems to further customer acquisition and retention efforts.
Additionally, I wanted to comment on the potential effects of foreign currency translation on our fiscal 2015 plan. In today's rates held constant and all else in the business held constant, such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 3%. This would be due to our exposure to Canada and the European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 are planned at approximately $150 million to $160 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment facility. We believe our new facility will help us to better serve a larger portion of our customer base with faster fulfillment times. As mentioned earlier, this facility is planned to open during the summer of fiscal 2016.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36.5%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Ted Marlow."

I will begin the overview of the Urban Outfitters brand with a high level view of the brand performance in fourth quarter. Trish Donnelly, the President of Urban Outfitters North America, will then provide her comments on some of the positive signals which we are currently seeing in the North American business.
12 months ago on this call, we spoke about our plans to rejuvenate the Urban Outfitters brand through exciting product and expand the lifestyle offering, compelling imagery, inspiring content, overall, a richer brand experience for our 20-something customer. In September, at our Investor Day, we advised this was a work in progress from which we were seeing positive signs. As we have traveled through fiscal '15, we have put new processes in place and reworked our organization structure with these objectives as our focus in the interest of returning the Urban Outfitters North American business to positive sales performance.
In addition, through this work, we have untapped a tremendous amount of creativity in our brand which is true to our heritage. Over this past year, our team has conceived and executed many exciting projects. Some of those being Space Ninety 8 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which has a community-minded emphasis with its own local marketplace; Herald Square in Manhattan, our largest store to date, offering additional services, including a hair salon and an eatery; Honolulu, our first store in Hawaii, a particularly fun opening for us as the social advocacy we developed helped us deliver the second-largest opening day in our company's history, as well as some of our most engaged social post nationally; and finally, the launch of Without Walls, our own active lifestyle brand and a new business opportunity, whose experiential marketing and unique performance products have developed a community of athletic advocates, providing us with an exciting entry into this unique market. Although each of these projects has called upon our creative strengths and business powerless, our overarching goal has been to reestablish positive sales momentum in the business.
In speaking to our fourth quarter results, I believe we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. Traveling through fiscal '15, we have realized quarter-to-quarter improvement in Retail segment comp performance, culminating in a positive comp performance in Q4. The tractors could say this was a matter of our business going up against weaker comparable performance, and like quarters as we progressed through fiscal '15 versus fiscal '14. While true that our comparables were easier in the back half of the year versus the front half, we have seen improving rhythm in our sales performance over the past few months, which has continued through the month of February, with our trend and direct-to-consumer being quite pronounced.
As we have elevated our product offering, imagery and content, we have increased our social engagement. We are seeing strong results and sales and customer participation. We are thrilled with whom he/she is, and what they are looking to us for.
We are not simply a brand-selling products, we are attracting an audience that wants to be part of our culture through our product offering, music, photography and other creative outlets. This positive dynamic has little to do with re-comparables in like quarter last year.
Further, our direct team has delivered continual updates to our DTC user experience to complement our customer's ongoing move to mobile. In Q4, we welcomed 50 million visitors to our North American website with the majority of those customers visiting us on a mobile device, 53% this year versus 42% last year. Despite this shift in shopping behavior, our conversion rate and AOV were up nicely in the quarter.
I will leave it to Trish to highlight the areas of engagement which are resonating with our customer. However, we find ourselves proceeding into fiscal '16 with cautious optimism versus a high level of concern regarding the top line of the business this time last year. We are getting traction, we are making headway, but there is still much more work to do.
Our Q4 margin was not where it needed to be due to shortfall in IMU and markdowns. We have mapped out our receipt IMU for fiscal '16. The first half of the will continue to be a challenge with Q2 showing improvement from Q1. In the second half of the year, we are planning on delivering quarter-to-quarter IMU improvement.
Regarding markdowns, we are as well mapping out receipt flow for fiscal '16 with a conservative approach to sales performance and an emphasis on tightening weeks of supply. We believe Q4 markdowns were more driven by overoptimistic sales expectations and redundant style offerings than fashion failure.
We feel we have an opportunity to better define our category narrative in-store and thereby tighten our SKU offer, while we distort our investments in volume driving categories more dramatically.
I will now turn the call over to Trish to highlight our areas of momentum, and further outline approach to our work in progress."

It is my pleasure to speak with you today. As Ted pointed out, one of our biggest priorities was to reestablish positive sales momentum, which we started on deliver on in Q4, posting our first positive Retail segment comp in several quarters, while it was not at the margin we know we are capable of, it was a step in the right direction.
From a product category standpoint, the customer is reacting positively to the businesses we have intentionally distorted into in both the retail and direct channels. Specifically, we're seeing very positive reads at home, both in the electronics and the decorate categories, in intimates, in women's accessories and in beauty. The regular price activity we're seeing here is meaningful volume. Within these categories, we are pleased with our product execution and we still see opportunity to further capitalize on the customer is telling us she or he wants. 
Our largest category, women's apparel, was challenging from both the sales and margin standpoint throughout last year. As Ted pointed out, we started to see some momentum as we move through Q4. And today, we are seeing that momentum continue in the women's apparel rate priced top line. At this time versus last year, we have a clear reads on what is working and why. We have healthier sell-throughs in many of our top styles in several categories. We are executing IMU improvement strategies, which we believe will materialize in the back half of the year. We are focused on 4-wall contribution by category, and we are beginning distorting ideas, attributes and classifications where appropriate. By no means are we claiming that the business is fixed, and we know we still have a lot more work to do, but we feel we have established momentum in the right direction.
Throughout last year, and particularly Q3 into Q4, we have over assorted in style choices in the women's division, which resulted in a higher markdown rate and contributed to the softer margins for the quarter. Today, we are highly focused on style count, still very committed to offer the compelling assortment our customers expect from Urban, but we are editing the redundancy and over assortment. As we reduced store count, become more focused and speak to trend or items with greater conviction, this allows us to more clearly tell our product stories within stores. The output is a store experience that's less overwhelming and a new approached divisional merchandising with the primary focus on item and category shops.
As the consumer shopping behavior has continued to evolve, especially around how she shops and interacts with each of our channels, we believe these initiatives around women's productivity are very important. To build upon this effort, we have initiated a detailed review of productivity for the entire store in an effort to assign appropriate store footage within our store footprint. Our planning and allocation teams are highly focused on this. And although we're in early days of this initiative, we are seeing some great learnings within the categories we're testing. This, of course, helps educate us on go forward approach. It's a very exciting work in progress which we believe can help us optimize our 4-wall profitability.
Another area in which we're making solid improvement is that in customer engagement. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to see strong top line sales growth. Our improved marketing and creative is clearly resonating with our core customer, evident not only the top line direct sales numbers, but also in the type of engagements we're seeing within our social channels. It is becoming more and more common to see six-figure likes on our Instagram posts, with followers growing significantly year-over-year on a monthly basis.
On #UOonYOU, we're creating a fast-growing community where our customers can share their favorite looks, faces, music and more. And recently, we've been able to integrate customers' photos on our website product pages as visual recommendations.  
Our blog, dreamers and doers highlights emerging artists, creative entrepreneurs and once to wash, whether our customers are starting a new business, creating something beautiful which or just daring to do things differently, we offer a platform that celebrates their creative spirit and exposes their artistry to the millions of customers visiting our website.
As we have elevated and amped up the creativity in our imagery, we are enthusiastic about the talent that is reaching out to be part of UO brand. In addition, we are promoting talent from within the organization which allows us to tell our narrative in a fresh and innovative way. New hires and internal development are pivotal to our future, and we have made significant headway in the past few months.
In terms of our core customer and progress here, I'm happy to report we're seeing solid growth in our reactivated customer base. Additionally, it was also nice to be recognized externally as we've ranked in the Top 10 L2 Digital IQ index out of 82 specialty brands reviewed.
In closing, we're seeing positive signals in the business as we improve our product offer, focus on 4-wall productivity within our stores and continue to elevate our creative and brand marketing experience. We are happy to see positive customer growth and witness our core customers returning to the brand. We will continue to work on our retail and direct experience in all areas of the business: Apparel, accessories, home and music. These are early days and we are still very much a work in progress, with much more needed to come on improving IMU, markdowns and store productivity.
Thank you for your time today. And now I will turn the call over to Dick Hayne."

Ted, Trish, thanks to both of you, to Meg and to the entire Urban Outfitters team for the significant progress you've made in the past 12 months. I know you're all disappointed in the brand's financial results last year, and obviously, I am as well. But it's been a year of hard work and rebuilding and without that, your collective efforts are beginning to pay off.
In our Q4 conference call last year, I said that Urban team would work toward the following: Elevate all creative functions to a more central role within the brand; refocus on the core 18 to 28 age group; and elevate the product assortment, both from a fashion and quality perspective. I believe the brand team has made excellent progress on realizing these goals.
After complete reorganization and the addition of some new talent, the concept, design and merchant groups are much stronger today and are working more collaboratively. The result has been better, more elevated product than is less duplicative and more appropriate for its target customer. The styling is fresher, the fabrics and materials are better and there is more make in the products. The AUR is up double digits as of this past January 31 versus the same date last year. Most importantly, the customers are responding to the product upgrades with total comp retail sales at the Urban brand running positive for the past 3 months. 
Nowhere within the Urban brands have the creative change has been more apparent and more impactful than in the digital marketing group. With a new team leading the way, what had been mostly juvenile, pop graphics and sale messaging gave way to compelling photographic imagery and content, designed to engage the customer and drive full priced selling. This change, coupled with improved product, had delivered double-digit sales gains in web and mobile full-priced selling. So on this creative side of the business, there is quarter-over-quarter improvement in the product, how we sell it and how we communicate it to our customers. I look forward to additional improvements in fiscal 2016.
However, as Ted and Trish both pointed out earlier, the brand also had several operating issues to address before we can return to an acceptable level of profitability. The brand must be more effectively plan, control and allocate inventory in order to avoid the excessive markdowns experienced over the past several quarters. In addition, because customer demand their product category has shifted somewhat over the past year, and in some cases, has moved from higher to lower margin categories, the merchant team's bus focused on strategies to improve the overall IMU. A number of initiatives are currently underway to address these very issues, and I believe we'll see improvement in these areas this year, especially in the second half. So overall, I'm convinced that the Urban brand is back in sync with its core customers and headed in the right direction.
Let me now turn your attention to the fourth quarter results at the company's other brands, first, Free People. Meg Hayne and her team once again produced record fourth quarter results, registering double sales gains and record operating profits. This strong performance is even more impressive given the difficult comparisons the brand faced. Fiscal year 2015 marks the third consecutive year of the Free People brand has reported record-setting fourth quarter results.
During the quarter, all 3 distribution channels excelled. Wholesale continued its double-digit positive sales trends delivering revenue growth of 21%. Product expansion, international growth and stronger relationships with domestic partners drove the increase.
New and expanding categories accounted for more than 40% of the Wholesale sales increase. Internet apparel sales jumped by 51% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and the newest Wholesale category, footwear, gained significant traction. After successfully launching at Nordstrom's last year, Free People footwear is now in 80 Nordstrom doors and other department store accounts including Bloomingdales, Galeries Lafayette, Itaden [ph] in Japan, I.T in China and the Bay in Canada.
Q4 international Wholesale sales grew in all key markets. And by year's end consisted of over 350 points of distribution across 36 countries.
Opening shops with international partners has been a key ingredient in the Free People's global growth and the brand expects to more shops to open this year, including additional ones in China, Japan, the U.K., France, Germany and Spain.
The Free People direct-to-consumer business continues to set the standard for excellence with its outstanding imagery and customer engagement. It's highly successful FPE app drove significant quarter-over-quarter increases in customer engagement, with a 33% increase in pick-up loads in a 200% increase in hearts registered by community members. Mobile devices are now the preferred portal to the Free People site as mobile penetration during the quarter exceeded 50% for the first time and accounted for over 25% of sales.
The Free People store has finished the year with their highest margin and 4-wall profitability on record. The combined Retail segment channel delivered a powerful comp sales increase of 18% during the quarter on top of the 20% increase in same quarter last year. The Free People execution in Q4 was simply outstanding, and I extend my congratulations to Meg, Sheila Harrington, Dave Hayne and their teams on delivering another exceptional year.
The Anthropologie brand had an excellent quarter as well, posting both record sales and profits. Sales were driven by new stores and strong direct-to-consumer demand. During the quarter, the bread successfully opened 4 new stores, including one in the U.K. This brought the total number of new stores opened last year to 14. The stores did well in Q4 and were highly profitable, but the DTC channel was a standout. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Anthropologie direct orders grew by more than 23%, traffic by 17% and average order value by 400 basis points. Like the other brands, Anthropologie saw a significant shift to mobile devices, which accounted for over 40% of its DTC traffic. During the quarter, the Anthropologie team also made progress in developing their strategy of category expansion, with several new categories registering outstanding results.
Bhldn Anthropologie's bridal concept, had a breakout quarter and year in each of its distribution channels. Freestanding stores, the 5 shop-in-shops and 5 existing Anthropologie stores and the web all posted double-digit sales gains. And additional Bhldn shop-in-shop will be added this spring inside an Anthropologie store in Atlanta and the brand has opened a pop-up shop on Kingsroad in London.
Terrain, the outdoor living and garden concept, has also started to benefit from its recent association with the Anthropologie brand. Terrain has seen a strong uptick in brand awareness and direct-to-consumer traffic from their inclusion in the Anthropologie Group. Given their cross-marketing initiatives and improve product, it's not surprising that Terrain recorded double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. The success of Bhldn and Terrain are clear examples of the power of the Anthropologie brand and also a testament to the multi-category strategy.
As we have stated previously, the Anthropologie brand has embarked on expanding its home product category. During the third quarter, the brand dropped an expanded assortment, home-only catalog and received very positive customer reaction. A number of items were sold through in the first few weeks and home product sales continue to grow in the fourth quarter. Given the positive response the brand dropped another home jello last week and will send out 1 or 2 additional home books the remainder of this year.
Late last year, the brand also launched this registry app. And to date, 11,000 registries have been created with an average of 15 items per registrant. Over time, demand from registry should help support the home product expansion initiative and vice versa. One additional benefit of registry, 40% of the registry purchasers are first-time Anthropologie customers, so this site should be an excellent entry point to the brand.
Overall, David McCreight and the Anthropologie team delivered a great quarter and another excellent year. Thank you to all, and well done.
Now let me say a few words about our current quarter-to-date results. All brands have realized a strong start to fiscal 2016, with the total company retail comp up mid-single digits. The direct-to-consumer channel continues to significantly outperform, and within that channel, mobile continues to gain share. The Wholesale team just completed most of its trade shows for fall '16 deliveries, and to date, show orders are tracking well ahead of the previous year.
On a macro level, today, with the relatively inexpensive energy prices, little to no inflation and a strong U.S. dollar, we see a positive environment in the United States for consumer spending. In addition, we see numerous fashion trends across many of the product categories we offer. We believe the URBN brands are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities this environment creates.
In closing, I recognize and thank our 24,000 associates around the globe. Their collective hard work, dedication and creativity build the emotional bond that make and keep our brands strong and allow us to compete effectively. I also want to recognize and thank our many domestic and international business partners. And finally, I think our shareholders for the continued enthusiasm and support. As always, I am grateful for the opportunity to lead this outstanding community called URBN.
At this time, I invite your questions."

And the overall apparel market, particularly the younger segments, call it the teens and twenty-something segment, seems to be experiencing some price deflation. And obviously, not Urban Outfitters, but some of the others in this space, or -- it seems like a race to the bottom on price. You obviously have a strategy to extract yourselves from that dynamic and delivered, I think, Dick, you said double-digit increase in average unit retail price in the quarter. And so it seems like you're at least initially having some success with that. I'm wondering if you can just help us, with the way that you think about any of the deflationary forces in the market, and how do you counter downward pricing pressure in the apparel sector, generally, with -- what's the sort of secret sauce that Urban is applying in order to prevent the downward pressure from affecting that division?"

As far as pricing is concerned, we don't believe that you have to race to the bottom, as you put it, in pricing, and decrease our prices. We think that one, prices product around what the brand value proposition is, and that value proposition is created by a number of things, including, as we said on the call, some of the direct-to-consumer marketing, the store experience, our association in the music world, and a number of other things that creates the value proposition. I direct your attention to -- you can go into a Forever 21 and they have some striped tops in there right now for under $11, and you can then go someplace else in the mall and find Michael Kors that has a similar top for $50. But they cost probably relatively the same to me. Kors probably a little bit more, but still, it's relatively the same. But the Kors can get the $50 because of value proposition. So our job as merchants is to create that emotional link with the customer and get the value proposition up, and that will support a full price. Ted, you have something to add to that?"

Those challenges won't be as significant as of the brand experience in the back half of this year, but will still be challenged in Q1. As we start to come through Q2, we start to see some improvement, and then the real meaningful improvement really starts to hit in the third and the fourth quarter. So even though you're starting to see markdown improvement based on our plans for the first quarter within the Urban brand as we have more product hitting and certain inventories in a better position, that markdown improvement could be offset by the IMU challenge for the first quarter as well as some of our transition expenses related to our fulfillment center. So second quarter starts to show a little bit of improvement, but much more meaningful as we get back into the third and fourth quarters as it relates to Urban IMU."

And we're also looking to make some initiatives using more boat freight rather than airfreight. As you know, we have been primarily dependent on airfreight, and that certainly helped us during the port strike, but it's an inhibitor to margins, and we want to try to switch some over to boat. So those are the kinds of things we're going to be working on this year and we hope to have a lot of success."

I will begin my prepared commentary discussing our fiscal year 2015 fourth quarter sales and net income results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will conclude my prepared commentary by sharing our",1199,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my prepared commentary discussing our fiscal year 2015 fourth quarter sales and net income results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will conclude my prepared commentary by sharing our thoughts concerning our plans for fiscal year 2016.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 12% to a fourth quarter record of $1 billion. This was our first ever $1 billion quarter, a nice milestone to hit, with all of our brands delivering positive Retail segment comp sales. The total sales increase was driven by a 6% Retail segment comp, a $46 million increase in noncomparable sales, including the opening of 7 net new stores, and a 21% jump in Wholesale sales. The 6% increase in Retail segment comp sales was driven by strong direct-to-consumer growth, which more than offset a narrowly negative sales comp at the stores. Direct-to-consumer growth resulted from increases in sessions, orders, average order value and conversion. Negative store sales comp resulted from a reduction in transaction and units per transaction, which were partially offset by an increase in average unit selling price.
By brand, our Retail segment sales comp rates increased by 18% at Free People, 6% at Anthropologie Group and 4% at Urban Outfitters. Free People Wholesale continued to deliver yet another strong quarter as sales rose 21% to $58 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at specialty stores and department stores.
Now turning back to total company performance. URBN gross profit for the quarter increased by 5% to $350 million, while gross profit rate declined by 207 basis points to 34.6%. The deleverage in gross profit rate occurred primarily due to lower initial merchandise markups, followed by higher markdowns, which were primarily driven by the underperformance at the Urban Outfitters brand. Overinvested inventory levels and certain product category misses drove higher markdowns, while product sales mix and poor execution drove lower initial markups at the Urban brand.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased by 11% to $226 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged by 8 basis points to 22.3%. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased expenses to support new store growth and increased spend in both web marketing and technology investments to support direct-to-consumer channel growth. Operating income for the quarter decreased by 4% to $124 million, with operating profit rate declining by 199 basis points to 12.3%.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35% versus 31.7% in the prior comparable period. The tax rate variance is due to favorable onetime benefits relating to a federal rehabilitation credit received and the release of international valuation allowances in the prior comparable period. Net income was $80 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 15% to $358 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non-comp sales stores and to support Retail segment comp sales growth. Comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 7% at cost while decreasing 7% in units.
Lastly, we ended the quarter with $363 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 3.8 million common shares for approximately $126 million. We have 2.3 million shares remaining on our May 27, 2014, Board of Directors authorization to repurchase 10 million shares. On February 23, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 20 million shares.
As we look forward to fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: We are planning to open approximately 32 new stores in the year. By brand, we are planning 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America, 13 new Anthropologie Group stores globally, including 1 new European store, and 15 new Free People stores in North America. We believe that we could achieve approximately 100 basis points of year-over-year gross margin improvement, inclusive of the onetime fulfillment center transition costs, which I will discuss later in my prepared commentary. It is likely that this achievement could be driven by greater progress in the second half of the year.
Our gross profit margin growth opportunity largely depends on the timing of the margin progress at the Urban Outfitters brand in North America. The majority of the improvement opportunity for the year is related to lower markdown rates from improved product execution, better inventory control and allocation and improved initial markups.
As Dick and the team will discuss later on the call, the Urban brand is in a much better position versus this time last year, but while progress has been made, we are still a work in progress with much more to come.
We believe the brand can begin to deliver markdown improvement in the first quarter, but much, if not all this improvement, could be offset by unfavorable IMU, which we believe will not start to show meaningful improvement until the second quarter. Based on the possible IMU deleverage at the Urban brand and delivery expense deleverage related to our fulfillment center relocation, it is possible that our first quarter gross profit margin could deleverage at the URBN level.
As I mentioned earlier, please note that gross profit margin for URBN will be negatively affected by approximately 50 basis points in fiscal year 2016 relating to the transition of our East Coast fulfillment center from Trenton, South Carolina to Gap, Pennsylvania. Our new state-of-the-art 1 million square foot facility will begin phasing in outbound service for the customer in June. Therefore, the majority of this deleverage is planned to occur in the second and third quarters, while both the first and fourth quarters will be modestly affected as well.
We believe that SG&A could grow at a low double-digit rate for the year. This increase would primarily be driven by increases related to direct and selling support expenses to support our new store growth and continued investments in both marketing and technology systems to further customer acquisition and retention efforts.
Additionally, I wanted to comment on the potential effects of foreign currency translation on our fiscal 2015 plan. If today's rates held constant and all else in the business held constant, such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 3%. This would be due to our exposure to Canada and the European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 are planned at approximately $150 million to $160 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment facility. We believe our new facility will help us to better serve a larger portion of our customer base with faster fulfillment times. As mentioned earlier, this facility is planned to open during the summer of fiscal 2016.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36.5%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Ted Marlow."

I will begin the overview of the Urban Outfitters brand with a high-level view of the brand performance in fourth quarter. Trish Donnelly, the President of Urban Outfitters North America, will then provide her comments on some of the positive signals which we are currently seeing in the North American business.
12 months ago on this call, we spoke about our plans to rejuvenate the Urban Outfitters brand through exciting product and expand the lifestyle offering, compelling imagery, inspiring content, overall, a richer brand experience for our 20-something customer. In September, at our Investor Day, we advised this was a work in progress from which we were seeing positive signs. As we have traveled through fiscal '15, we have put new processes in place and reworked our organization structure with these objectives as our focus in the interest of returning the Urban Outfitters North American business to positive sales performance.
In addition, through this work, we have untapped a tremendous amount of creativity in our brand which is true to our heritage. Over this past year, our team has conceived and executed many exciting projects. Some of those being Space Ninety 8 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which has a community-minded emphasis with its own local marketplace; Herald Square in Manhattan, our largest store to date, offering additional services, including a hair salon and an eatery; Honolulu, our first store in Hawaii, a particularly fun opening for us as the social advocacy we developed helped us deliver the second-largest opening day in our company's history, as well as some of our most engaged social posts nationally; and finally, the launch of Without Walls, our own active lifestyle brand and a new business opportunity, whose experiential marketing and unique performance products have developed a community of athletic advocates, providing us with an exciting entry into this unique market. Although each of these projects has called upon our creative strengths and business prowess, our overarching goal has been to reestablish positive sales momentum in the business.
In speaking to our fourth quarter results, I believe we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. Traveling through fiscal '15, we have realized quarter-to-quarter improvement in Retail segment comp performance, culminating in a positive comp performance in Q4. Detractors could say this was a matter of our business going up against weaker comparable performance and like quarters as we progressed through fiscal '15 versus fiscal '14. While true that our comparables were easier in the back half of the year versus the front half, we have seen improving rhythm in our sales performance over the past few months, which has continued through the month of February, with our trend and direct-to-consumer being quite pronounced.
As we have elevated our product offering, imagery and content, we have increased our social engagement. We are seeing strong results in sales and customer participation. We are thrilled with who he/she is and what they are looking to us for.
We are not simply a brand-selling products, we are attracting an audience that wants to be part of our culture through our product offering, music, photography and other creative outlets. This positive dynamic has little to do with weak comparables in like quarter last year.
Further, our direct team has delivered continual updates to our DTC user experience to complement our customer's ongoing move to mobile. In Q4, we welcomed 50 million visitors to our North American website, with the majority of those customers visiting us on a mobile device, 53% this year versus 42% last year. Despite this shift in shopping behavior, our conversion rate and AOV were up nicely in the quarter.
I will leave it to Trish to highlight the areas of engagement which are resonating with our customer. However, we find ourselves proceeding into fiscal '16 with cautious optimism versus a high level of concern regarding the top line of the business this time last year. We are getting traction, we are making headway, but there is still much more work to do.
Our Q4 margin was not where it needed to be due to shortfall in IMU and markdowns. We have mapped out our receipt IMU for fiscal '16. The first half of the year will continue to be a challenge, with Q2 showing improvement from Q1. In the second half of the year, we are planning on delivering quarter-to-quarter IMU improvement.
Regarding markdowns, we are as well mapping out receipt flow for fiscal '16 with a conservative approach to sales performance and an emphasis on tightening weeks of supply. We believe Q4 markdowns were more driven by overoptimistic sales expectations and redundant style offerings than fashion failure.
We feel we have an opportunity to better define our category narrative in-store and thereby tighten our SKU offer, while we distort our investments in volume-driving categories more dramatically.
I will now turn the call over to Trish to highlight our areas of momentum and further outline the approach to our work in progress."

Thank you, Ted, and good afternoon to all on the call. It is my pleasure to speak with you today. As Ted pointed out, one of our biggest priorities was to reestablish positive sales momentum, which we started to deliver on in Q4, posting our first positive Retail segment comp in several quarters. While it was not at the margin we know we are capable of, it was a step in the right direction.
From a product category standpoint, our customer is reacting positively to the businesses we have intentionally distorted into in both the retail and direct channels. Specifically, we're seeing very positive reads in home, both in the electronics and the decorate categories, in intimates, in women's accessories and in beauty. The regular price activity we're seeing here is meaningful volume. Within these categories, we are pleased with our product execution, and we still see opportunity to further capitalize on what customer is telling us she or he wants. 
Our largest category, women's apparel, was challenging from both the sales and margin standpoint throughout last year. As Ted pointed out, we started to see some momentum as we move through Q4, and today, we are seeing that momentum continue in the women's apparel reg price top line. At this time versus last year, we have clearer reads on what is working and why. We have healthier sell-throughs in many of our top styles in several categories. We are executing IMU improvement strategies, which we believe will materialize in the back half of the year. We are focused on four-wall contribution by category, and we are beginning distorting ideas, attributes and classifications where appropriate. By no means are we claiming that the business is fixed, and we know we still have a lot of work to do, but we feel we have established momentum in the right direction.
Throughout last year, and particularly Q3 into Q4, we were over-assorted in style choices in the women's division, which resulted in a higher markdown rate and contributed to the softer margins for the quarter. Today, we are highly focused on style count, still very committed to offer the compelling assortment our customers expect from Urban, but we are editing the redundancy and the over-assortment. As we reduced style count, become more focused and speak to trend or items with greater conviction, this allows us to more clearly tell our product stories within stores. The output is a store experience that's less overwhelming and a new approach to visual merchandising with the primary focus on item and category shops.
As the consumer shopping behavior has continued to evolve, especially around how she shops and interacts with each of our channels, we believe these initiatives around women's productivity are very important. To build upon this effort, we have initiated a detailed review of productivity for the entire store in an effort to assign appropriate square footage within our store footprint. Our planning and allocation teams are highly focused on this. And although we're in early days of this initiative, we are seeing some great learnings within the categories we're testing. This, of course, helps educate us on go forward approach. It's a very exciting work in progress which we believe can help us optimize our 4-wall profitability.
Another area in which we're making solid improvement is within customer engagement. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to see strong top line sales growth. Our improved marketing and creative is clearly resonating with our core customer, evident not only in the top line direct sales numbers but also in the type of engagement we're seeing within our social channels. It is becoming more and more common to see six-figure likes on our Instagram posts, with followers growing significantly year-over-year on a monthly basis.

These are early days and we are still very much a work in progress, with much more needed to come on improving IMU, markdowns and store productivity.
Thank you for your time today. And now I will turn the call over to Dick Hayne."

Ted, Trish, thanks to both of you, to Meg and to the entire Urban Outfitters team for the significant progress you've made in the past 12 months. I know you're all disappointed in the brand's financial results last year, and obviously, I am as well. But it's been a year of hard work and rebuilding, and without that, your collective efforts are beginning to pay off.
In our Q4 conference call last year, I said the Urban team would work toward the following: elevate all creative functions to a more central role within the brand; refocus on the core 18- to 28-year-old age group; and elevate the product assortment, both from a fashion and quality perspective. I believe the brand team has made excellent progress on realizing these goals. 
After complete reorganization and the addition of some new talent, the concept, design and merchant groups are much stronger today and are working more collaboratively. The result has been better, more elevated product than is less duplicative and more appropriate for the target customer. The styling is fresher, the fabrics and materials are better and there is more make in the products. The AUR is up double digits as of this past January 31 versus the same date last year. Most importantly, the customers are responding to the product upgrades, with total comp retail sales at the Urban brand running positive for the past 3 months. 
Nowhere within the Urban brands have the creative change has been more apparent and more impactful than in the digital marketing group. With a new team leading the way, what had been mostly juvenile pop graphics and sale messaging gave way to compelling photographic imagery and content designed to engage the customer and drive full price selling. This change, coupled with improved product, had delivered double-digit sales gains in web and mobile full price selling. So on this creative side of the business, there is quarter-over-quarter improvement in the product, how we sell it and how we communicate it to our customers. I look forward to additional improvements in fiscal 2016.
However, as Ted and Trish both pointed out earlier, the brand also has several operating issues to address before it can return to an acceptable level of profitability. The brand must be more effectively planned, control and allocate inventory in order to avoid the excessive markdowns experienced over the past several quarters. In addition, because customer demand by product category has shifted somewhat over the past year and, in some cases, has moved from higher to lower margin categories, the merchant teams must focus on strategies to improve the overall IMU. A number of initiatives are currently underway to address these very issues, and I believe we will see improvements in these areas this year, especially in the second half. So overall, I'm convinced that the Urban brand is back in sync with its core customer and headed in the right direction.
Let me now turn your attention to the fourth quarter results at the company's other brands, first, Free People. Meg Hayne and her team once again produced record fourth quarter results, registering double sales gains and record operating profits. This strong performance is even more impressive given the difficult comparisons the brand faced. Fiscal year 2015 marks the third consecutive year the Free People brand has reported record-setting fourth quarter results.
During the quarter, all 3 distribution channels excelled. Wholesale continued its double-digit positive sales trend, delivering revenue growth of 21%. Product expansion, international growth and stronger relationships with domestic partners drove the increase.
New and expanding categories accounted for more than 40% of the Wholesale sales increase. Intimate apparel sales jumped by 51% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and the newest Wholesale category, footwear, gained significant traction. After successfully launching in Nordstrom's last year, Free People footwear is now in 80 Nordstrom doors and other department store accounts, including Bloomingdale's, Galeries Lafayette, Isetan in Japan, IT [ph] in China and the Bay in Canada.
Q4 international Wholesale sales grew in all key markets and by year's end, consisted of over 350 points of distribution across 36 countries.
Opening shops with international partners has been a key ingredient in the Free People's global growth, and the brand expects more shops to open this year, including additional ones in China, Japan, the U.K., France, Germany and Spain.
The Free People direct-to-consumer business continues to set the standard for excellence with its outstanding imagery and customer engagement. Its highly successful FP Me app drove significant quarter-over-quarter increases in customer engagement, with a 33% increase in pickup loads and a 200% increase in hearts registered by community members. Mobile devices are now the preferred portal to the Free People site as mobile penetration during the quarter exceeded 50% for the first time and accounted for over 25% of sales.
The Free People store has finished the year with their highest margin and four-wall profitability on record. The combined Retail segment channel delivered a powerful comp sales increase of 18% during the quarter on top of a 20% increase in the same quarter last year. The Free People execution in Q4 was simply outstanding, and I extend my congratulations to Meg, Sheila Harrington, Dave Hayne and their teams on delivering another exceptional year.
The Anthropologie brand had an excellent quarter as well, posting both record sales and profits. Sales were driven by new stores and strong direct-to-consumer demand. During the quarter, the brand successfully opened 4 new stores, including one in the U.K. This brought the total number of new stores opened last year to 14. The stores did well in Q4 and were highly profitable, but the DTC channel was the standout. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Anthropologie direct orders grew by more than 23%, traffic by 17% and average order value by 400 basis points. Like the other brands, Anthropologie saw a significant shift to mobile devices, which accounted for over 40% of its DTC traffic. During the quarter, the Anthropologie team also made progress in developing their strategy of category expansion, with several new categories registering outstanding results.
Bhldn, Anthropologie's bridal concept, had a breakout quarter and year in each of its distribution channels. Freestanding stores, the 5 shop-in-shops inside existing Anthropologie stores and the web all posted double-digit sales gains. And additional Bhldn shop-in-shop will be added this spring inside an Anthropologie store in Atlanta, and the brand has opened a pop-up shop on King's Road in London.
Terrain, the outdoor living and garden concept, has also started to benefit from its recent association with the Anthropologie brand. Terrain has seen a strong uptick in brand awareness and direct-to-consumer traffic from their inclusion in the Anthropologie Group. Given their cross-marketing initiatives and improved product, it's not surprising that Terrain recorded double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. The success of Bhldn and Terrain are clear examples of the power of the Anthropologie brand and also a testament to the multi-category strategy.
As we have stated previously, the Anthropologie brand has embarked on expanding its home product category. During the third quarter, the brand dropped an expanded assortment, home-only catalog and received very positive customer reaction. A number of items is sold through in the first few weeks, and home product sales continue to grow in the fourth quarter. Given the positive response, the brand dropped another home journal last week and will send out 1 or 2 additional home books the remainder of this year.
Late last year, the brand also launched its registry app. And to date, 11,000 registries have been created, with an average of 15 items per registrant. Over time, demand from registry should help support the home product expansion initiative and vice versa. One additional benefit of registry, 40% of the registry purchasers are first-time Anthropologie customers, so this site should become an excellent entry point to the brand.
Overall, David McCreight and the Anthropologie team delivered a great quarter and another excellent year. Thank you to all, and well done.
Now let me say a few words about our current quarter-to-date results. All brands have realized a strong start to fiscal 2016, with the total company retail comp up mid-single digits. The direct-to-consumer channel continues to significantly outperform, and within that channel, mobile continues to gain share. The Wholesale team just completed most of its trade shows for fall '16 deliveries and, to date, show orders are tracking well ahead of the previous year.
On a macro level, today, with relatively inexpensive energy prices, little to no inflation and a strong U.S. dollar, we see a positive environment in the United States for consumer spending. In addition, we see numerous fashion trends across many of the product categories we offer. We believe the URBN brands are well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities this environment creates.
In closing, I recognize and thank our 24,000 associates around the globe. Their collective hard work, dedication and creativity build the emotional bond that make and keep our brands strong and allow us to compete effectively. I also want to recognize and thank our many domestic and international business partners. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued enthusiasm and support. As always, I am grateful for the opportunity to lead this outstanding community called URBN.

As we think about the ultimate margin potential for the business, as we continue to drive comp and reduce some of the markdown activity, should we think about the range of merchandise margins for UO as somehow structurally different than it was in the past, maybe with the shift to direct-to-consumer? Or are there other factors? Or when UO realizes its full kind of margin potential, is it the same as what we might have expected to see from it historically?

And the overall apparel market, particularly the younger segments, call it the teens and twenty-something segment, seems to be experiencing some price deflation. And obviously, not Urban Outfitters, but some of the others in this space are, it seems like, in a race to the bottom on price. You obviously have a strategy to extract yourself from that dynamic and delivered, I think, Dick, you said, double-digit increase in average unit retail price in the quarter. And so it seems like you're at least initially having some success with that. I'm wondering if you can just help us with the way that you think about any of the deflationary forces in the market. And how do you counter downward pricing pressure in the apparel sector, generally, with -- what's the sort of secret sauce that Urban is applying in order to try to prevent the downward pressure from affecting that division?"

I direct your attention to -- you can go into a Forever 21 and they have some striped tops in there right now for under $11, and you can then go someplace else in the mall and find Michael Kors that has a similar top for $50, but they cost probably relatively the same to make. Kors probably a little bit more, but still, it's relatively the same. But the Kors can get the $50 because of value proposition. So our job as merchants is to create that emotional link with the customer and get the value proposition up, and that will support a full price. Ted, you have something to add to that?"

With that being said, the low double digits, and it's very low double digits SG&A growth rate plan for the year, does include the effects of foreign currency translation, as it were to stand today. The primary drivers of that growth are new store growth, whereas we're looking for approximately 6% of square footage growth for the year, web, mobile and omni initiatives around website optimization, checkout, search, personalization and many mobile and mobile app enhancements. Also, we're looking to continue investing in marketing, as we begin supporting the new category expansions in a bigger way. For example, Anthropologie home and Free People shoes, you may see elevated marketing levels related to these categories, which we'll hopefully leverage going forward as sales momentum builds under the new categories. And last and certainly not least, we continue to look to invest from a creative standpoint. We're very focused on creating a more interactive, creative and unique web experience. We've always been proud of our experience at retail and goods [ph], and the web can be -- can't be treated any differently.

I will begin my prepared commentary discussing our fiscal year 2015 fourth quarter sales and net income results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will conclude my prepared commentary by sharing our thoughts concerning our plans for fiscal year 2016.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 12% to a fourth quarter record of $1 billion. This was our first ever $1 billion quarter, a nice milestone to hit, with all of our brands delivering positive Retail segment comp sales. The total sales increase was driven by a 6% Retail segment comp, a $46 million increase in noncomparable sales, including the opening of 7 net new stores, and a 21% jump in Wholesale sales. The 6% increase in Retail segment comp sales was driven by strong direct-to-consumer growth, which more than offset a narrowly negative sales comp at the stores. Direct-to-consumer growth resulted from increases in sessions, orders, average order value and conversion. Negative store sales comp resulted from a reduction in transaction and units per transaction, which were partially offset by an increase in average unit selling price.
By brand, our Retail segment sales comp rates increased by 18% at Free People, 6% at Anthropologie Group and 4% at Urban Outfitters. Free People Wholesale continued to deliver yet another strong quarter as sales rose 21% to $58 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at specialty stores and department stores.
Now turning back to total company performance. URBN gross profit for the quarter increased by 5% to $350 million, while gross profit rate declined by 207 basis points to 34.6%. The deleverage in gross profit rate occurred primarily due to lower initial merchandise markups, followed by higher markdowns, which were primarily driven by the underperformance at the Urban Outfitters brand. Overinvested inventory levels and certain product category misses drove higher markdowns, while product sales mix and poor execution drove lower initial markups at the Urban brand.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased by 11% to $226 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged by 8 basis points to 22.3%. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased expenses to support new store growth and increased spend in both web marketing and technology investments to support direct-to-consumer channel growth. Operating income for the quarter decreased by 4% to $124 million, with operating profit rate declining by 199 basis points to 12.3%.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35% versus 31.7% in the prior comparable period. The tax rate variance is due to favorable onetime benefits relating to a federal rehabilitation credit received and the release of international valuation allowances in the prior comparable period. Net income was $80 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 15% to $358 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non-comp sales stores and to support Retail segment comp sales growth. Comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 7% at cost while decreasing 7% in units.
Lastly, we ended the quarter with $363 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 3.8 million common shares for approximately $126 million. We have 2.3 million shares remaining on our May 27, 2014, Board of Directors authorization to repurchase 10 million shares. On February 23, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 20 million shares.
As we look forward to fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: We are planning to open approximately 32 new stores in the year. By brand, we are planning 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America, 13 new Anthropologie Group stores globally, including 1 new European store, and 15 new Free People stores in North America. We believe that we could achieve approximately 100 basis points of year-over-year gross margin improvement, inclusive of the onetime fulfillment center transition costs, which I will discuss later in my prepared commentary. It is likely that this achievement could be driven by greater progress in the second half of the year.
Our gross profit margin growth opportunity largely depends on the timing of the margin progress at the Urban Outfitters brand in North America. The majority of the improvement opportunity for the year is related to lower markdown rates from improved product execution, better inventory control and allocation and improved initial markups.
As Dick and the team will discuss later on the call, the Urban brand is in a much better position versus this time last year, but while progress has been made, we are still a work in progress with much more to come.
We believe the brand can begin to deliver markdown improvement in the first quarter, but much, if not all this improvement, could be offset by unfavorable IMU, which we believe will not start to show meaningful improvement until the second quarter. Based on the possible IMU deleverage at the Urban brand and delivery expense deleverage related to our fulfillment center relocation, it is possible that our first quarter gross profit margin could deleverage at the URBN level.
As I mentioned earlier, please note that gross profit margin for URBN will be negatively affected by approximately 50 basis points in fiscal year 2016 relating to the transition of our East Coast fulfillment center from Trenton, South Carolina to Gap, Pennsylvania. Our new state-of-the-art 1 million square foot facility will begin phasing in outbound service for the customer in June. Therefore, the majority of this deleverage is planned to occur in the second and third quarters, while both the first and fourth quarters will be modestly affected as well.
We believe that SG&A could grow at a low double-digit rate for the year. This increase would primarily be driven by increases related to direct and selling support expenses to support our new store growth and continued investments in both marketing and technology systems to further customer acquisition and retention efforts.
Additionally, I wanted to comment on the potential effects of foreign currency translation on our fiscal 2016 plan. If today's rates held constant and all else in the business held constant, such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 3%. This would be due to our exposure to Canada and the European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 are planned at approximately $150 million to $160 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment facility. We believe our new facility will help us to better serve a larger portion of our customer base with faster fulfillment times. As mentioned earlier, this facility is planned to open during the summer of fiscal 2016.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36.5%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Ted Marlow."

I will begin the overview of the Urban Outfitters brand with a high-level view of the brand performance in fourth quarter. Trish Donnelly, the President of Urban Outfitters North America, will then provide her comments on some of the positive signals which we are currently seeing in the North American business.
12 months ago on this call, we spoke about our plans to rejuvenate the Urban Outfitters brand through exciting product and expand the lifestyle offering, compelling imagery, inspiring content, overall, a richer brand experience for our 20-something customer. In September, at our Investor Day, we advised this was a work in progress from which we were seeing positive signs. As we have traveled through fiscal '15, we have put new processes in place and reworked our organization structure with these objectives as our focus in the interest of returning the Urban Outfitters North American business to positive sales performance.
In addition, through this work, we have untapped a tremendous amount of creativity in our brand which is true to our heritage. Over this past year, our team has conceived and executed many exciting projects. Some of those being Space Ninety 8 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which has a community-minded emphasis with its own local marketplace; Herald Square in Manhattan, our largest store to date, offering additional services, including a hair salon and an eatery; Honolulu, our first store in Hawaii, a particularly fun opening for us as the social advocacy we developed helped us deliver the second-largest opening day in our company's history, as well as some of our most engaged social posts nationally; and finally, the launch of Without Walls, our own active lifestyle brand and a new business opportunity, whose experiential marketing and unique performance products have developed a community of athletic advocates, providing us with an exciting entry into this unique market. Although each of these projects has called upon our creative strengths and business prowess, our overarching goal has been to reestablish positive sales momentum in the business.
In speaking to our fourth quarter results, I believe we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. Traveling through fiscal '15, we have realized quarter-to-quarter improvement in Retail segment comp performance, culminating in a positive comp performance in Q4. Detractors could say this was a matter of our business going up against weaker comparable performance and like quarters as we progressed through fiscal '15 versus fiscal '14. While true that our comparables were easier in the back half of the year versus the front half, we have seen improving rhythm in our sales performance over the past few months, which has continued through the month of February, with our trend in direct-to-consumer being quite pronounced.
As we have elevated our product offering, imagery and content, we have increased our social engagement. We are seeing strong results in sales and customer participation. We are thrilled with who he/she is and what they are looking to us for.
We are not simply a brand selling products, we are attracting an audience that wants to be part of our culture through our product offering, music, photography and other creative outlets. This positive dynamic has little to do with weak comparables in like quarter last year.
Further, our direct team has delivered continual updates to our DTC user experience to complement our customer's ongoing move to mobile. In Q4, we welcomed 50 million visitors to our North American website, with the majority of those customers visiting us on a mobile device, 53% this year versus 42% last year. Despite this shift in shopping behavior, our conversion rate and AOV were up nicely in the quarter.
I will leave it to Trish to highlight the areas of engagement which are resonating with our customer. However, we find ourselves proceeding into fiscal '16 with cautious optimism versus a high level of concern regarding the top line of the business this time last year. We are getting traction, we are making headway, but there is still much more work to do.
Our Q4 margin was not where it needed to be due to shortfall in IMU and markdowns. We have mapped out our receipt IMU for fiscal '16. The first half of the year will continue to be a challenge, with Q2 showing improvement from Q1. In the second half of the year, we are planning on delivering quarter-to-quarter IMU improvement.
Regarding markdowns, we are as well mapping out receipt flow for fiscal '16 with a conservative approach to sales performance and an emphasis on tightening weeks of supply. We believe Q4 markdowns were more driven by overoptimistic sales expectations and redundant style offerings than fashion failure.
We feel we have an opportunity to better define our category narrative in-store and thereby tighten our SKU offer, while we distort our investments in volume-driving categories more dramatically.
I will now turn the call over to Trish to highlight our areas of momentum and further outline the approach to our work in progress."

Thank you, Ted, and good afternoon to all on the call. It is my pleasure to speak with you today. As Ted pointed out, one of our biggest priorities was to reestablish positive sales momentum, which we started to deliver on in Q4, posting our first positive Retail segment comp in several quarters. While it was not at the margin we know we are capable of, it was a step in the right direction.
From a product category standpoint, our customer is reacting positively to the businesses we have intentionally distorted into in both the retail and direct channels. Specifically, we're seeing very positive reads in home, both in the electronics and the decorate categories, in intimates, in women's accessories and in beauty. The regular price activity we're seeing here is meaningful volume. Within these categories, we are pleased with our product execution, and we still see opportunity to further capitalize on what customer is telling us she or he wants. 
Our largest category, women's apparel, was challenging from both the sales and margin standpoint throughout last year. As Ted pointed out, we started to see some momentum as we move through Q4, and today, we are seeing that momentum continue in the women's apparel reg price top line. At this time versus last year, we have clearer reads on what is working and why. We have healthier sell-throughs in many of our top styles in several categories. We are executing IMU improvement strategies, which we believe will materialize in the back half of the year. We are focused on four-wall contribution by category, and we are beginning distorting ideas, attributes and classifications where appropriate. By no means are we claiming that the business is fixed, and we know we still have a lot of work to do, but we feel we have established momentum in the right direction.
Throughout last year, and particularly Q3 into Q4, we were over-assorted in style choices in the women's division, which resulted in a higher markdown rate and contributed to the softer margins for the quarter. Today, we are highly focused on style count, still very committed to offer the compelling assortment our customers expect from Urban, but we are editing the redundancy and the over-assortment. As we reduced style count, become more focused and speak to trend or items with greater conviction, this allows us to more clearly tell our product stories within stores. The output is a store experience that's less overwhelming and a new approach to visual merchandising with the primary focus on item and category shops.
As the consumer shopping behavior has continued to evolve, especially around how she shops and interacts with each of our channels, we believe these initiatives around women's productivity are very important. To build upon this effort, we have initiated a detailed review of productivity for the entire store in an effort to assign appropriate square footage within our store footprint. Our planning and allocation teams are highly focused on this. And although we're in early days of this initiative, we are seeing some great learnings within the categories we're testing. This, of course, helps educate us on go forward approach. It's a very exciting work in progress which we believe can help us optimize our 4-wall profitability.
Another area in which we're making solid improvement is within customer engagement. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to see strong top line sales growth. Our improved marketing and creative is clearly resonating with our core customer, evident not only in the top line direct sales numbers but also in the type of engagement we're seeing within our social channels. It is becoming more and more common to see six-figure likes on our Instagram posts, with followers growing significantly year-over-year on a monthly basis.
On #UOonYOU, we're creating a fast-growing community where our customers can share their favorite looks, faces, music and more. And recently, we've been able to integrate customers' photos on our website product pages as visual recommendations. 
Within our blog, dreamers and doers highlights emerging artists, creative entrepreneurs and ones to watch. Whether our customers are starting a new business, creating something beautiful or just daring to do things differently, we offer a platform that celebrates their creative spirit and exposes their artistry to the millions of customers visiting our website.
As we have elevated and amped up the creativity in our imagery, we are enthusiastic about the talent that is reaching out to be part of the UO brand. In addition, we are promoting talent from within the organization which allows us to tell our narrative in a fresh and innovative way. New hires and internal development are pivotal to our future, and we have made significant headway in the past few months.
In terms of our core customer and progress here, I'm happy to report we're seeing solid growth in our reactivated customer base. Additionally, it was also nice to be recognized externally as we ranked in the Top 10 L2 Digital IQ Index out of 82 specialty brands reviewed.
In closing, we are seeing positive signals in the business as we improve our product offer, focus on four-wall productivity within our stores and continue to elevate our creative and brand marketing experience. We are happy to see positive customer growth and witness our core customers returning to the brand. We will continue to work on our retail and direct experience in all areas of the business: apparel, accessories, home and music. These are early days and we are still very much a work in progress, with much more needed to come on improving IMU, markdowns and store productivity.
Thank you for your time today. And now I will turn the call over to Dick Hayne."

Ted, Trish, thanks to both of you, to Meg and to the entire Urban Outfitters team for the significant progress you've made in the past 12 months. I know you're all disappointed in the brand's financial results last year, and obviously, I am as well. But it's been a year of hard work and rebuilding, and without doubt, your collective efforts are beginning to pay off.
In our Q4 conference call last year, I said the Urban team would work toward the following: elevate all creative functions to a more central role within the brand; refocus on the core 18- to 28-year-old age group; and elevate the product assortment, both from a fashion and quality perspective. I believe the brand team has made excellent progress on realizing these goals. 
After complete reorganization and the addition of some new talent, the concept, design and merchant groups are much stronger today and are working more collaboratively. The result has been better, more elevated product that is less duplicative and more appropriate for the target customer. The styling is fresher, the fabrics and materials are better and there is more make [ph] in the products. The AUR is up double digits as of this past January 31 versus the same date last year. Most importantly, the customers are responding to the product upgrades, with total comp retail sales at the Urban brand running positive for the past 3 months. 
Nowhere within the Urban brands have the creative change has been more apparent and more impactful than in the digital marketing group. With a new team leading the way, what had been mostly juvenile pop graphics and sale messaging gave way to compelling photographic imagery and content designed to engage the customer and drive full price selling. This change, coupled with improved product, had delivered double-digit sales gains in web and mobile full price selling. So on the creative side of the business, there is quarter-over-quarter improvement in the product, how we sell it and how we communicate it to our customers. I look forward to additional improvements in fiscal 2016.
However, as Ted and Trish both pointed out earlier, the brand also has several operating issues to address before it can return to an acceptable level of profitability. The brand must be more effectively planned, control and allocate inventory in order to avoid the excessive markdowns experienced over the past several quarters. In addition, because customer demand by product category has shifted somewhat over the past year and, in some cases, has moved from higher to lower margin categories, the merchant teams must focus on strategies to improve the overall IMU. A number of initiatives are currently underway to address these very issues, and I believe we will see improvements in these areas this year, especially in the second half. So overall, I'm convinced that the Urban brand is back in sync with its core customer and headed in the right direction.
Let me now turn your attention to the fourth quarter results at the company's other brands, first, Free People. Meg Hayne and her team once again produced record fourth quarter results, registering double sales gains and record operating profits. This strong performance is even more impressive given the difficult comparisons the brand faced. Fiscal year 2015 marks the third consecutive year the Free People brand has reported record-setting fourth quarter results.
During the quarter, all 3 distribution channels excelled. Wholesale continued its double-digit positive sales trend, delivering revenue growth of 21%. Product expansion, international growth and stronger relationships with domestic partners drove the increase.
New and expanding categories accounted for more than 40% of the Wholesale sales increase. Intimate apparel sales jumped by 51% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and the newest Wholesale category, footwear, gained significant traction. After successfully launching in Nordstrom's last year, Free People footwear is now in 80 Nordstrom doors and other department store accounts, including Bloomingdale's, Galeries Lafayette, Isetan in Japan, IT [ph] in China and the Bay in Canada.
Q4 international Wholesale sales grew in all key markets and by year's end, consisted of over 350 points of distribution across 36 countries.
Opening shops with international partners has been a key ingredient in the Free People's global growth, and the brand expects more shops to open this year, including additional ones in China, Japan, the U.K., France, Germany and Spain.
The Free People direct-to-consumer business continues to set the standard for excellence with its outstanding imagery and customer engagement. Its highly successful FP Me app drove significant quarter-over-quarter increases in customer engagement, with a 33% increase in pickup loads and a 200% increase in hearts registered by community members. Mobile devices are now the preferred portal to the Free People site as mobile penetration during the quarter exceeded 50% for the first time and accounted for over 25% of sales.
The Free People stores finished the year with their highest margin and four-wall profitability on record. The combined Retail segment channel delivered a powerful comp sales increase of 18% during the quarter on top of a 20% increase in the same quarter last year. The Free People execution in Q4 was simply outstanding, and I extend my congratulations to Meg, Sheila Harrington, Dave Hayne and their teams on delivering another exceptional year.
The Anthropologie brand had an excellent quarter as well, posting both record sales and profits. Sales were driven by new stores and strong direct-to-consumer demand. During the quarter, the brand successfully opened 4 new stores, including one in the U.K. This brought the total number of new stores opened last year to 14. The stores did well in Q4 and were highly profitable, but the DTC channel was the standout. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Anthropologie direct orders grew by more than 23%, traffic by 17% and average order value by 400 basis points. Like the other brands, Anthropologie saw a significant shift to mobile devices, which accounted for over 40% of its DTC traffic. During the quarter, the Anthropologie team also made progress in developing their strategy of category expansion, with several new categories registering outstanding results.
Bhldn, Anthropologie's bridal concept, had a breakout quarter and year in each of its distribution channels. Freestanding stores, the 5 shop-in-shops inside existing Anthropologie stores and the web all posted double-digit sales gains. An additional Bhldn shop-in-shop will be added this spring inside an Anthropologie store in Atlanta, and the brand has opened a pop-up shop on King's Road in London.
Terrain, the outdoor living and garden concept, has also started to benefit from its recent association with the Anthropologie brand. Terrain has seen a strong uptick in brand awareness and direct-to-consumer traffic from their inclusion in the Anthropologie Group. Given their cross-marketing initiatives and improved product, it's not surprising that Terrain recorded double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. The success of Bhldn and Terrain are clear examples of the power of the Anthropologie brand and also a testament to the multi-category strategy.
As we have stated previously, the Anthropologie brand has embarked on expanding its home product category. During the third quarter, the brand dropped an expanded assortment, home-only catalog and received very positive customer reaction. A number of items is sold through in the first few weeks, and home product sales continue to grow in the fourth quarter. Given the positive response, the brand dropped another home journal last week and will send out 1 or 2 additional home books the remainder of this year.
Late last year, the brand also launched its registry app. And to date, 11,000 registries have been created, with an average of 15 items per registrant. Over time, demand from registry should help support the home product expansion initiative and vice versa. One additional benefit of registry, 40% of the registry purchasers are first-time Anthropologie customers, so this site should become an excellent entry point to the brand.
Overall, David McCreight and the Anthropologie team delivered a great quarter and another excellent year. Thank you to all, and well done.
Now let me say a few words about our current quarter-to-date results. All brands have realized a strong start to fiscal 2016, with the total company retail comp up mid-single digits. The direct-to-consumer channel continues to significantly outperform, and within that channel, mobile continues to gain share. The Wholesale team just completed most of its trade shows for fall '16 deliveries and, to date, show orders are tracking well ahead of the previous year.
On a macro level, today, with relatively inexpensive energy prices, little to no inflation and a strong U.S. dollar, we see a positive environment in the United States for consumer spending. In addition, we see numerous fashion trends across many of the product categories we offer. We believe the URBN brands are well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities this environment creates.
In closing, I recognize and thank our 24,000 associates around the globe. Their collective hard work, dedication and creativity build the emotional bond that make and keep our brands strong and allow us to compete effectively. I also want to recognize and thank our many domestic and international business partners. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued enthusiasm and support. As always, I am grateful for the opportunity to lead this outstanding community called URBN.

The business did launch in March of last year, and it was certainly a year of learning, as it pertains to doing our own product and a category that was brand spanking new to us. So getting the inventory right in regard to not only the product offer but the quantification of the product offer was much of what we put up with coming through last year. We've gotten very positive response to the concept, the lifestyle attributes of the concept and its appropriateness for our customer. And as we got into the back half of the year, we decided to take it to additional stores outside of the -- simply the shop-in-shop formats, and thus, we put it in a smaller statement in a number of stores in fourth quarter. As we've gotten into this year feeling, as well, positive about the opportunity, we will be merchandising larger presentations as we go forward through the year within the men's area and within the women's area, and that we find that, that is how we get the best response to the product offer and the overall assortment within the stores. The direct side of the business has overperformed its expected penetrations from day 1, and it has performed very well on the Urban website."

And we're also looking to make some initiatives using more boat freight rather than airfreight. As you know, we have been primarily dependent on airfreight, and that certainly helped us during the port strike, but it's an inhibitor to margins. And we want to try to switch some over to boat. So those are the kinds of things we're going to be working on this year, and we hope to have a lot of success."

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our fiscal year 2016 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning the remainder  of the year.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 8% to a first quarter record of $739 million. This sales increase was driven by a 4% Retail segment comp, a $20 million increase in non-comparable sales including the opening of 6 net new stores, and 18% growth in Wholesale sales.  Please note that currency negatively impacted our sales growth rate by approximately 140 basis points for the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting positive gains driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 17%, 5% and 1% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and the Anthropologie Group respectively. This marks the second quarter in a row all brands have posted positive Retail segment comp sales growth.
Free People Wholesale delivered another strong quarter as sales grew 18% to $54 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at department stores and the international business.  Additionally, I want to note that due to some fulfillment center transition challenges in our Trenton, South Carolina distribution, we were unable to process all of our quarter-end demand, which pushed a little more than $2 million of sales into the amount of May.
Now moving back into total URBN results. Gross profit for the quarter was up 3% versus the prior comparable quarter to $246 million. Gross profit rate declined by 141 basis points to 33.3%. The decline in gross profit rate was primarily due to lower initial merchandise margins at the Urban Outfitters brand and higher delivery and fulfillment center expenses across the entire company.  The deleverage and delivering fulfillment expenses were partially due to the increases in direct-to-consumer penetration and incremental costs associated with the beginning of the South Carolina fulfillment center transition to  , Pennsylvania.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter increased by 8% to $193 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged just slightly by 13 basis points to 26.1%. This minor SG&A deleverage was primarily due to increased marketing expenses, which were used to drive higher direct-to-consumer traffic.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 11% to $53 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 154 basis points to 7.2%.
Net income was $33 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 14% to $398 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to support the Retail segment growth as well as new and non-comp stores.  Comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 8% at cost while decreasing 5% in units. 
I wanted to take a quick moment and comment on the inventory increase in a bit more detail. By brand, the Urban Outfitters segment's comparable inventory in North America is well-controlled and actually in a negative position on a cost and unit basis. The driver of the increase in URBN Retail segment comp inventory is the Anthropologie brand, and it is being driven primarily by the investment in home product.  Home inventory is double-digit comp positive as the brand begins to build their home inventory for the upcoming catalog drops and increased home marketing efforts. The past 2 home catalogs have performed well, and we sold out of many items in a few weeks. So the brand is making a larger investment in inventory to more closely align with anticipated demand.
We ended the quarter with $357 million in cash and marketable securities. During the first quarter, the company repurchased and retired 402,000 common shares for approximately $17 million. We have 21.9 million shares remaining on the 2 most recent Board of Directors authorizations to repurchase shares.
As we look forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: We are planning to open approximately 31 new stores during the year. By brand, we are planning approximately 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America, 13 new Anthropologie stores globally including 1 new European store and 14 new Free People stores in North America.
Our gross margin rate for the second quarter could deleverage versus the prior year similar to the rate of deleverage experienced in Q1. This deleverage could be driven primarily by costs associated with the transition of our East Coast DTC fulfillment center. This deleverage could occur despite the planned improved margin at the Urban Outfitters brand. The planned Urban brand improvement could be offset by increased markdowns at Anthropologie while they address some product misses in a few of their women's apparel and accessory classes.
Due to Anthropologie's sales slowdown at the end of April and the uptick experienced in May-to-date, it is not clear at this point what level of markdowns Anthropologie will incur during the second quarter.  On an annual basis, we believe there is potential for approximately 25 to 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement in gross profit margin. This potential improvement is inclusive of the onetime fulfillment center transition costs. Based on our current plan, we believe that the DC fulfillment center transition will negatively effect our annual gross profit margin by approximately 50 basis points.  Our new state-of-the-art 1 million square foot facility will begin phasing in outbound service to the customer in June. Therefore, the second quarter is expected to be the most negatively affected by our transition.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate for the year. This increase would be driven by the DC investments related to marketing and technology and selling support investments to support our new store growth.
As I noted earlier, the effect of foreign currency translation resulted in approximately 140 basis point reduction to sales and 30 basis point reduction in operating profit. If today's rates held constant, all else in the business held constant such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 2.5% for the full year fiscal 2016.  This would be based on our current business in the Canadian and European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 are planned at approximately $150 million to $160 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. This facility is all but complete, and we have begun testing it in preparation of the beginning of our transition in June of this year.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36.25%. 
As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to our Anthropologie Group Chief Executive Officer, David McCreight."

For this call, I will provide an update on the Anthropologie Group including recent results, highlights and upcoming milestones. 
The Anthropologie Group has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of positive comp revenue growth, and I remain confident that continued comp growth is available to our brand when we execute well. This first quarter's 1% comp is a disappointment and a bit of a surprise as we had a stronger comp performance going into April.
We read commentary about whether port delays affected performance, but our Q1 results are mostly the by-product of how we please with the product and creative offers. Throughout the quarter, many areas showed solid to very strong growth. However, a few merchandise categories were not as well received and impacted the result, Most notably, dresses and accessories.
Dress shortfalls came from missed opportunities in a few key silhouettes, fabrics and price points as well as insufficiently addressing our more casual customer. Certainly correctable, if not downright avoidable. 
In comparison to the styling misses in dresses, accessories has underperformed to the sizable opportunity we have to participate in our customers' purchasing of accessories. We have adjusted the team and the strategy and look for improvement in the back half of the year and continued expansion of accessories in the future.
While we are not satisfied by our 1% comp, the quarter did contain many areas making nice progress. In fact, most apparel categories did do well. The home initiative is right on schedule. Our Anthro filed with double digits over last year, and our customers demonstrate an increasing comfort with our ability to please her across a variety of channels. Bhldn continues to sparkle, delighting brides and wedding parties and has made inroads in broadening offer and leveraging the opportunities associated with the Anthropologie.  The Anthropologie Group growth strategy remains as last reviewed during September's Investment Day. Consistent with the URBN Vision 2020, we are investing in talent, infrastructure and processes that will allow us to for fill the potential for our multibillion-dollar lifestyle brands.
Apparel remains a vital part of our business and growth strategy. We are constantly evaluating our capabilities and analyzing her evolving needs. And sharing our design, production and merchandising teams are interpreting and executing on point. As a result, we are looking to add talent within the apparel team and reduce the lead to necessary to bring our product to market. 
We are in the process of restructuring the way that we design and merchandise and the teams work together. Based on the success of the Free People brand and as you already done in the Anthropologie home area, we are adopting Meg Hayne's concept of concept to customer approach to creating an apparel offer. As we improve our current apparel and accessories offering and shorten lead times, we expect to take full advantage of the opportunities presented digitally and realize approaches to how we can merchandise our stores.
Since Bhldn joined Anthropologie Group 3 years ago, we've have been able to refocus on product and creating magical moments for our brides. With strong leadership guiding the development of our and the power of the Anthropologie behind them, sales at Bhldn has skyrocketed. Our unique and inspiring gowns resonated with thousands of brides. And in the coming year, we will turn an eye to bridal parties of dresses and separates for bridesmaids and mothers. For the product is found the sweet spot, the store experience has also evolved nicely through the shop in shop model, with 6 shop-in-shops, were able to reach more customers and cultivate more brands than ever before.
Additionally, Bhldn location in Anthropologie's website has increased nationwide awareness. As a result, Bhldn has seen almost triple-digit sales growth this past quarter and is driving incremental bottom line dollars to the business.
With Terrain joining Anthropologie Group, we expect to see a similar path to success, evolving the creative brand experience across all media, strategically building out our digital offer and leveraging the resources of the Anthropologie Group. All early signs show that Terrain is a natural life stage extension for our core customer.
When I spoke to you 8 months ago, I outlined our vision for building a home company within the Anthropologie Group and the impressive scale the opportunity presents. Focusing on decorating and entertaining, leadership has made excellent progress with the home assortment. Last year, over 1,500 new styles were introduced. And the new product is resonating with the customer, enabling our category to achieve double-digit comp sales within the quarter.
  Since the launch of the expanded offer and new design concepts, demand for our new home offer has exceeded our expectations with the biggest wins in unique items that you can't find elsewhere. As we learn more about her taste preferences and the longer demand curves for home, it is nice to see the team also making progress building relationships with key domestic partners to expand our drop ship offer in the furniture, rug wall paper and curtain categories.  In order to fulfill the rising demand, we continue to invest in our home business. We continue to build the team, redesign our digital home presentation, create new home journals and analyze our logistic capabilities. In fact, some of you may find our newest home journal in your mailbox today. Please take a look and let me know what you think.
Alongside these major category expansions comes committed investment in digital and infrastructure capabilities. As the Anthropologie brand fans grow increasingly comfortable visiting our digital content points, we are committed to providing a best-in-class experience from look books and inspirational content, award-winning social to reliable shipping and customer service.
The growth of home decor calls for specific digital solutions to make online experience easier to be inspired and shopped. Starting this month, we will introduce home website developments including improved navigation, enhanced delivery services and rates and more inspirational content. 
Also the recent launch of our registry service has attracted thousands of brides. I'm very satisfied with the rapid embrace of brides creating a gift registry with and Anthropologie. In addition to fulfilling our home potential, the registry has helped provide a gateway to the brand with over 40% of gift givers being first-time Anthropologie shoppers.
And while the digital experience is more important than ever, that does not mean we are resting on our previous success in stores. The largest part of consumer commerce still occurs in stores. Our customers still want to touch and feel our product, be inspired by our spaces and interact with our delightful associates. We know how important the store experience has been to shaping our brand, and we have a best-in-class experience that is compelling and very profitable. 
But our stance relationship with the store experience is changing. The Anthropologie Group is evolving with growing product categories and new brands under our umbrella. As we observe her behavior, we are excited by the opportunities ahead of the Anthropologie Group and providing one of the richest multichannel, multimedia brand experiences in the world of retail. 
In addition to investments, we have made in PPC and social platforms, we believe that it is vital that our store experience remains remarkable and relevant. As we shared with you in September, we plan on rolling out this new experience next year with our first large format store scheduled to open in May, one where we can bring new experiences, expanded product offers and services. Our home expansion is on track. The beauty assortment and services are well underway. Bhldn and Terrain continues to flourish, and we've been hard at work on our multichannel business model. Most importantly, we think our new large format initiative is in perfect alignment with the direction our customers are headed and one which will support Anthropologie Group's growth well into the future.
At URBN, we are continually challenged to listen to our customer and develop creative ways to engage her efficiently. It is unusual to be part of a group whose brand reach exceeds that of an already sizable business. I'd like to thank Dick and the URBN shared services for their encouragement and support for investing in Anthropologie Group. We have a beautiful customer, beloved brand and a very profitable business model. We are proud of our recent successes, excited by the early results of our new initiatives and eager to see the new categories develop as we head towards our goal of doubling the size of our brand business.
All of this is made possible by the passion and talents of our people, both at the home office and the 5,000-plus associates in the field that make Anthropologie Group's story so compelling and unique.
Thank you for your time this evening, and I will now turn the call over to Dick."

While I was also disappointed with the Anthropologie results for Q1, I think it's important to remember that the brand remains one of the strongest in the world with extremely loyal customers. Plus, it produces operating margins that are the envy of most of the retailers.
It's also important to realize that the Q1 shortfall in planned sales happened almost entirely in the last 2 weeks of April. This is when the Easter shift and the change in the catalog drop date combined to negatively impact sales more than anticipated.  Newly received product and the catalog drop in early May have improved Anthropologie's sales so far this month. 
Finally, I'm very pleased to see the additional investments made last year and expanding the home category and the Bhldn brand are already bearing fruit. Sales in both categories are strong, and I look forward to watching both reach their full potential.  David, thank you, and thanks to the entire Anthropologie team for delivering a very good and a very profitable quarter.
Let me now provide an update on the first quarter results of the company's other 2 brands.
First, Urban Outfitters. I am happy to report that the Urban brand in North America continued to make solid progress during the quarter. Positive comps were driven by regular priced sales throughout the quarter. 6 of Urban's 8 major product categories delivered positive regular-price comps, including the all-important women's apparel division. Only the men's categories were down. Markdowns on a year-over-year basis decreased by more than 200 basis points and the number of markdown units owned at the end of the period versus the same date last year dropped in half.
However, on a year-over-year basis, lower initial margins in the first quarter nearly offset the positive impact of fewer markdowns. So total maintain merchandise margins showed only slight improvement.  The IMU issue, as we discussed last quarter, resulted from merchants ordering more products from the market, combined with a change in customer demand in favor of lower-margin categories.
Ted, Trish and Meg pushed forward to improving the trends, and I'm pleased to report the total April receipts showed slight year-over-year IMU improvement. We believe this will positively impact Urban's merchandise margins in Q2. In addition, the product on order to be delivered in the second quarter carry an even higher IMU, which leads us to believe that the back half of the year could continue to show IMU improvement.
Ending inventory at Urban on supply basis was the leanest it's been in 3 years. So we believe there's opportunity for further markdown improvement in the second quarter as well.
Across both channels, the Urban customer reacted positively to the product categories the merchants chose to distort. While the merchants reduced the overall style comp by more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, they increased the number of styles and depth to buy in selected classes. These 2 factors, the decrease in total style comp and an increase in distortion, have allowed the merchants to own less total inventory and still generate more sales.
Store initiatives such as reducing redundant styles, establishing category shops and elevating customer service levels have improved the overall shopping experience. The Urban stores are now less cluttered and easier to shop than last year at this time. The teams will continue to refine these initiatives on a go-forward basis as part of an effort to better please the customer and improve four-wall profitability.
In the direct-to-consumer channel, better product and many initiatives drove strong increases in DTC sessions and customer demand. These factors also produced double-digit increases across all customer groups: new, retained and reactivated. The amazing 40% year-over-year growth in the active customers is especially important as it verifies our anecdotal evidence that Urban Outfitters' core customer has returned to the brand.
In summary, the Urban brand has made significant progress over the past 12 months. Major improvements has been achieved in the following areas: the process by which inventory is planned, allocated and controlled; the process by which products are designed, selected, rand and purchased; the product quality and the reach of price choice offered; the store experience and the digital experience, especially through better inventory and content.
Above all, teamwork and communication across the various home office functional areas have improved significantly. While there are still much work to be done to return the Urban brand to the level of profitability we believe is capable of producing, I believe many of the people and processes necessary to accomplish this to work right now in place.
Congratulations to Ted, Trish, Meg and their teams for orchestrating these improvements and reinvigorating the brand.
Turning to Free People. Once again the team produced record first quarter results, delivering double-digit sales gains and record operating profits. The brand continues to emerge by registering stellar growth against multi-year difficult comparisons. This was accomplished by offering highly compelling products with engaging shopping experiences, both in stores and online.  The combined Retail segment delivered a powerful comp sales increase of 17% during the quarter. This is on top of the 25% increase in the same quarter last year and a 44% comp in the year before that.
The brand recorded strong growth across all 3 distribution channels. As with our other brands, the standout channel was direct-to-consumer. Customer demand continues to grow from a retained, new and reactivated customers as the brand continues to enhance its marketing programs. 
Within the direct channel, mobile devices now account for over 50% of total traffic and nearly 30% of sales.  The brand continues to explore new ways to further engage the customer and create a stronger digital community. 
We eagerly await the completion of the Free People Rockefeller Center store expansion. When completed in June, the store will become the largest in the brand's portfolio, exceeding 6,000 selling square feet and will allow the brand to offer a full product assortment including the more recently launched categories such as intimate apparel, shoes, special occasion dresses and, for the first time in a store, Free People Movement, which is the brand's activewear category.
The Wholesale channel continued its double-digit positive sales trend, delivering revenue growth of 18% despite some distribution delays at the end of the quarter. Those delays stem from the transition of our fulfillment center in South Carolina to our new larger facility in Gap, Pennsylvania and resulted in slightly more than $2 million in Wholesale shipments moving from Q1 to Q2.
New and expanded product categories drove domestic Wholesale growth, while more doors in Europe, Canada and Asia fueled the international expansion. During the quarter, the brand opened 6 new international shop-in-shops, 2 in France and 4 in China.
In all, the brand delivered another string of amazing quarterly performances. My thanks go to Meg, Sheila and Dave and the entire Free People team.
Now let me say a few words about our customer shopping behavior and what it means to URBN. For many years, we have repeated that the direct-to-consumer channel is growing and capturing a larger share of our customer's wallet. 3 years ago, I predicted that in 5 years, the direct-to-consumer channel would account for half of URBN retail sales. That prediction was met with some skepticism. What we now see is that the trend towards greater DTC penetration is not just continuing, but is actually accelerating.  If my prediction is wrong, it's only off by a year or 2. Since 2001, when URBN launched its digital selling channel, DTC penetration has increased every year, and the the rate of growth of penetration has grown almost every year. Q1 this year was no exception. It shows our second largest DTC penetration gain ever. While stores continue to be a very important part of our business, there is no mistaking the fact that the customer's shopping preference, measured by both traffic and sales, continues to move to virtual experience.  As a result, we believe it is critically important for URBN to accelerate its investments in new and enhanced capabilities to support this rapidly growing and changing channel. These initiatives are focused in the areas of product, technology, marketing, logistics, localization and personalization.
At the same time, we are accelerating our investments in virtual capabilities. We are slowing the number of new retail stores we open in the North American market. We have said consistently that from a store location perspective, we believe both of our larger brands will be fully penetrated in the North American market when they each have 200 to 250 stores. Today, Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters operate 199 and 195 stores in North America respectively.  To be clear, we will still open some traditional stores, and we plan to open a number of large larger formats. But many of these larger stores will be replacements or additions to existing smaller ones.
Finally, before I turn the call over for your questions, I would like to announce that Ted Marlow has informed me that he wishes to retire at the end of August. When Ted began his Urban career in 2001, the brand operated 43 stores in North America and 2 in Europe. Total brand sales that year were just north of $150 million.
15 years later, under Ted's stewardship, the brand operates 195 stores in North America, 43 in Europe, 7 international concessions and runs multiple international direct-to-consumer businesses. This year, the Urban brand is on pace to exceed last year's $1.4 billion in sales. That's incredible growth.
Ted's loyalty to the brand and the customer is unwavering, and I am forever grateful to him for his service and his friendship. When Ted returned to the business in the spring of 2012, he told me he only wanted to work for a few additional years. There is no way any of us could have anticipated how tumultuous those 3 years would be for the brand. But in true Ted Marlow style, he hunkered down, fought through the adversity and came out on top. So Ted, on behalf of the board, your entire Urban Outfitters team and all URBN employees, I thank you, and I wish you and Sara the very best in the future.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I extend my thanks to all URBN associates and shareholders around the world. And now I'll turn the call over for your questions."

And we had, particularly in the apparel and accessory area, a few classes that really sort of disappointed us, and that led to the most. Now the moves we're making in terms of the restructuring are things that Dick's talked about strategically across all of URBN, and that's really reducing speed to market and talking about some other ways that we're going to be bringing the concepts to the customer that Meg has done so well across Free People and recently at URBN women's. So we feel very confident that this is I guess one of the more dramatic dips, but the customer will certainly tell us that in the future."

It's hard to tell at this point. Our inventories, our comp inventories ended the quarter up in the mid-single digits. Apparel was only up 2%. Accessories was negative high single digits.

The lion's share of the deleverage was driven by IMU deleverage from the Urban Outfitters brand globally. And then, as David alluded to, we did have slightly higher markdown rates and lower merchandise margins within the Anthropologie brand. So that's the answer to your Q1 question. As it relates to the remainder of the year, yes, based on our current plans, we believe we can achieve 25 to 50 basis points of gross margin improvement on an annual basis for fiscal '16. This is inclusive of the onetime fulfillment center transition expenses. This would be driven by strong improvement in the Urban brand's merch margins, and it does include relatively consistent performance through the first quarter of this year by the Anthropologie and Free People brand. So keep in mind that Anthropologie and Free People delivered basically at or near record merch margins last year. And Anthro missed that number in the first quarter. That miss is baked into our annual basis plans, which does look for a 25 to 50 basis points of improvement on an annual basis."

I think the first thing I want to say is please be aware that there's a lot of moving pieces and some unknowns as we think about the second quarter. We have our largest fulfillment center transition in the history of the company going on. The Urban brand is improving. We have some growth rate uncertainty with regards to the Anthropologie brand, and some of the largest currency fluctuations in some time in many of the international countries that we operate in. With all that said and in consideration, yes, we believe gross profit margin could be down similar to Q1 in the second quarter, although I would say the composition of what is driving this deleverage could be different from Q1. As we said earlier, we believe the largest driver deleverage could be our delivering fulfillment center expense related to the transition from South Carolina to Pennsylvania. As we said a quarter ago, we believe expense related to this transition will be approximately 50 basis points for the year, with the second quarter being the quarter that's the most significantly affected. As of right now based on our plans, we believe Q2 could be negatively affected by somewhere in the range of 100 basis points for the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps a little bit."

We are slowing that because we believe that we are nearly fully penetrated in North America, but we realize that we are relatively un-penetrated in the world. So we will continue to open stores internationally. We are doing that smoothly because we believe that there's a lot of learning that we have to go through before we can do it consistently and with the right return. But as you know in North America, there is growing issue with traffic in the stores and traffic in the malls. And we see as rents continue to escalate and traffic goes down, there is a squeeze in occupancy costs. And we are right now engaged in a number of initiatives trying to offset that.

So you're correct, SG&A did come in lower than what we were planning for in the first quarter as the store business didn't deliver the comps that we have planned. We appropriately pulled back store controllable expenses. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I do believe we are planning to execute to a single-digit SG&A growth rate. So we are pulling that number down just a little bit from our low single-digit plan, which was discussed a quarter ago. And when I say high single-digit, I'm implying high, high single-digit. So it's just under double digits for SG&A plan for the year. As it relates to inventory, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. But knowing where Urban North America was an being very lean and negative on a comp basis, and with Anthropologie basically only being high positive in the home and the bold than categories, I would say we would have been in the low single digit range. I can tell you I feel very comfortable with inventory position Anthropologie, even though they drove the increase in comp, their aging is actually favorable on a year-over-year basis, so they are very current. I mean any markdown exposure they would have would be just due to how the customer's receiving the current content. It is not related to getting ahead of the sales curve here. So I think the magnitude of the potential risk for markdowns is controlled there as it relates to the inventory investment. I would also say over the last few quarters as we have begun to market and work on the home category in a more meaningful way, it has carried a very low markdown rate as David and team have done a phenomenal job in executing in that category."

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our fiscal year 2016 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning the remainder of the year.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 8% to a first quarter record of $739 million. This sales increase was driven by a 4% Retail segment comp, a $20 million increase in non-comparable sales, including the opening of 6 net new stores, and 18% growth in Wholesale sales. Please note that currency negatively impacted our sales growth rate by approximately 140 basis points for the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting positive gains driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 17%, 5% and 1% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and the Anthropologie Group, respectively. This marks the second quarter in a row all brands have posted positive Retail segment comp sales growth.
Free People Wholesale delivered another strong quarter as sales grew 18% to $54 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at department stores and the international business. Additionally, I want to note that due to some fulfillment center transition challenges at our Trenton, South Carolina distribution center, we were unable to process all of our quarter-end demand, which pushed a little more than $2 million of sales into the month of May.
Now moving back to total URBN results. Gross profit for the quarter was up 3% versus the prior comparable quarter to $246 million. Gross profit rate declined by 141 basis points to 33.3%. The decline in gross profit rate was primarily due to lower initial merchandise margins at the Urban Outfitters brand and higher delivery and fulfillment center expenses across the entire company. The deleverage in delivery and fulfillment expenses were partially due to the increases in direct-to-consumer penetration and incremental costs associated with the beginning of the South Carolina fulfillment center transition to Gap, Pennsylvania.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter increased by 8% to $193 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged just slightly by 13 basis points to 26.1%. This minor SG&A deleverage was primarily due to increased marketing expenses, which were used to drive higher direct-to-consumer traffic.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 11% to $53 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 154 basis points to 7.2%. Net income was $33 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 14% to $398 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to support the Retail segment growth as well as new and non-comp stores.  Comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 8% at cost while decreasing 5% in units.
I wanted to take a quick moment and comment on the inventory increase in a bit more detail. By brand, the Urban Outfitters segment comparable inventory in North America is well controlled and actually in a negative position on a cost and unit basis. The driver of the increase in URBN Retail segment comp inventory is the Anthropologie brand, and it is being driven primarily by the investment in home product. Home inventory is double-digit comp positive as the brand begins to build their home inventory for their upcoming catalog drops and increased home marketing efforts. The past 2 home catalogs have performed well, and we sold out of many items in a few weeks. So the brand is making a larger investment in inventory to more closely align it with the anticipated demand.
We ended the quarter with $357 million in cash and marketable securities. During the first quarter, the company repurchased and retired 402,000 common shares for approximately $17 million. We have 21.9 million shares remaining on the 2 most recent Board of Directors authorizations to repurchase shares.
As we look forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: We are planning to open approximately 31 new stores during the year. By brand, we are planning approximately 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America, 13 new Anthropologie stores globally, including 1 new European store, and 14 new Free People stores in North America.
Our gross margin rate for the second quarter could deleverage versus the prior year similar to the rate of deleverage experienced in Q1. This deleverage could be driven primarily by costs associated with the transition of our East Coast DTC fulfillment center. This deleverage could occur despite the planned improved margin at the Urban Outfitters brand. The planned Urban brand improvement could be offset by increased markdowns at Anthropologie while they address some product misses in a few of their women's apparel and accessory classes.
Due to Anthropologie's sales slowdown at the end of April and the uptick experienced in May-to-date, it is not clear at this point what level of markdowns Anthropologie will incur during the second quarter. On an annual basis, we believe there is potential for approximately 25 to 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement in gross profit margin. This potential improvement is inclusive of the onetime fulfillment center transition costs. Based on our current plan, we believe the DTC fulfillment center transition will negatively affect our annual gross profit margin by approximately 50 basis points. Our new state-of-the-art 1 million square foot facility will begin phasing in outbound service to the customer in June. Therefore, the second quarter is expected to be the most negatively affected by our transition.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate for the year. This increase would be driven by DTC investments related to marketing and technology and selling support investments to support our new store growth.
As I noted earlier, the effects of foreign currency translation resulted in approximately 140 basis point reduction to sales and 30 basis point reduction in operating profit. If today's rates held constant, all else in the business held constant such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 2.5% for the full year fiscal 2016. This would be based on our current business in the Canadian and European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 are planned at approximately $150 million to $160 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. This facility is all but complete, and we have begun testing it in preparation of the beginning of our transition in June of this year.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36.25%.
As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to our Anthropologie Group Chief Executive Officer, David McCreight."

For this call, I will provide an update on the Anthropologie Group, including recent results, highlights and upcoming milestones.
The Anthropologie Group has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of positive comp revenue growth, and I remain confident that continued comp growth is available to our brand when we execute well. This first quarter's 1% comp is a disappointment and a bit of a surprise as we had a stronger comp performance going into April.
We have read commentary about weather and port delays impacting performance, but our Q1 results are mostly the by-product of how we pleased her with our product and creative offers. Throughout the quarter, many areas showed solid to very strong growth. However, a few merchandise categories were not as well received and impacted the result, most notably dresses and accessories. Dress shortfalls came from missed opportunities in a few key silhouettes, fabrics and price points as well as insufficiently addressing our more casual customer. Certainly correctable, if not downright avoidable.
In comparison to the styling misses in dresses, accessories has underperformed to the sizable opportunity we have to participate in our customers' purchasing of accessories. We have adjusted the team and the strategy and look for improvement in the back half of the year and continued expansion of accessories in the future.
While we are not satisfied by our 1% comp, the quarter did contain many areas making nice progress. In fact, most apparel categories did well. The home initiative is right on schedule. Our Anthro file grew double digits over last year, and our customer is demonstrating increasing comfort with our ability to please her across a variety of channels. Bhldn continues to sparkle, delighting brides and wedding parties, and Terrain has made inroads in broadening their offer and leveraging the opportunities associated with the Anthropologie. The Anthropologie Group growth strategy remains as last reviewed during September's Investment Day. Consistent with the URBN Vision 20|20, we are investing in talent, infrastructure and processes that will allow us to for fulfill the potential for our multibillion-dollar lifestyle brands.
Apparel remains a vital part of our business and growth strategy. We are constantly evaluating our capabilities and analyzing her evolving needs, ensuring our design, production and merchandising teams are interpreting and executing on point. As a result, we are looking to add talent within the apparel team and reduce the lead time necessary to bring our product to market.
We are in the process of restructuring the way that we design and merchandise and the teams work together. Based on the success of the Free People brand and as we have already done in the Anthropologie Home area, we are adopting Meg Hayne's concept of concept-to-customer approach to creating our apparel offer. As we improve our current apparel and accessories offering and shorten lead times, we expect to take full advantage of the opportunities presented digitally and realize new approaches to how we can merchandise our stores.
Since Bhldn joined the Anthropologie Group 3 years ago, we have been able to refocus on product and creating magical moments for our brides. With strong leadership guiding the development of our archetypes and the power of the Anthropologie behind them, sales at Bhldn has skyrocketed. Our unique and inspiring gowns have resonated with thousands of brides. And in the coming year, we will turn an eye to bridal party styles with dresses and separates for bridesmaids and mothers. While the product has found its sweet spot, the store experience has also evolved nicely through the shop-in-shop model. With 6 shop-in-shops, we're able to reach more customers and cultivate more brand fans than ever before.
Additionally, Bhldn's location on the Anthropologie's website has increased nationwide awareness. As a result, Bhldn has seen almost triple-digit sales growth this past quarter and is driving incremental bottom line dollars to the business.
With Terrain joining the Anthropologie Group, we expect to see a similar path to success, evolving their creative brand experience across all media, strategically building out our digital offer and leveraging the resources of the Anthropologie Group. All early signs show that Terrain is a natural life-stage extension for our core customer.
When I spoke to you 8 months ago, I outlined our vision for building a home company within the Anthropologie Group and the impressive scale the opportunity presents. Focusing on decorating and entertaining, leadership has made excellent progress with the home assortment. Last year, over 1,500 new styles were introduced. And the new product is resonating with the customer, enabling the entire category to achieve double-digit comp sales within the quarter.
Since the launch of the expanded offer and new design concepts, demand for our new home offer has exceeded our expectations with the biggest wins in unique items that she can't find elsewhere. As we learn more about her taste preferences and the longer demand curves for home, it is nice to see the team also making progress building relationships with key domestic partners to expand our drop ship offer in the furniture, rug, wall paper and curtain categories. In order to fulfill the rising demand, we continue to invest in our home business. We continue to build the team, redesign our digital home presentation, create new home journals and analyze our logistic capabilities. In fact, some of you may find our newest home journal in your mailbox today. Please take a look and let me know what you think.
Alongside these major category expansion comes commensurate investment in digital and infrastructure capabilities. As the Anthropologie brand fans grow increasingly comfortable visiting our digital contact points, we are committed to providing a best-in-class experience from look books and inspirational content, award-winning social to reliable shipping and customer service.
The growth of home decor calls for specific digital solutions to make the online experience easier to be inspired and shopped. Starting this month, we will introduce home website developments, including improved navigation, enhanced delivery service and rates and more inspirational content.
Also, the recent launch of our Registry service has attracted thousands of brides. I'm very satisfied with the rapid embrace of brides creating a gift registry within Anthropologie. In addition to fulfilling our home potential, the registry has helped provide a gateway to the brand with over 40% of gift givers being first-time Anthropologie shoppers.
And while the digital experience is more important than ever, that does not mean we are resting on our previous success in stores. The largest part of consumer commerce still occurs in stores. Our customers still want to touch and feel our product, be inspired by our spaces and interact with our delightful associates. We know how important the store experience has been to shaping our brand, and we have a best-in-class experience that is compelling and very profitable.
But our brand fans relationship with the store experience is changing. The Anthropologie Group is evolving, with growing product categories and new brands under our umbrella. As we observe her behavior, we are excited by the opportunities ahead for the Anthropologie Group in providing one of the richest multichannel, multimedia brand experiences in the world of retail.
In addition to investments we have made in DTC and social platforms, we believe that it is vital that our store experience remain remarkable and relevant. As we shared with you in September, we plan on rolling out this new experience next year with our first large format store scheduled to open in May, one where we can bring new experiences, expanded product offers and services. Our home expansion is on track. The beauty assortment and services are well underway. Bhldn and Terrain continue to flourish, and we've been hard at work on our multichannel service model. Most importantly, we think our new large format initiative is in perfect alignment with the direction our customers are headed and one which will support Anthropologie Group's growth well into the future.
At URBN, we are continually challenged to listen to our customer, develop creative ways to engage her efficiently. It is unusual to be part of a group whose brand reach exceeds that of an already sizable business. I'd like to thank Dick and the URBN shared services for their encouragement and support for investing in the Anthropologie Group. We have a beautiful customer, beloved brand and a very profitable business model. We are proud of our recent successes, excited by the early results of our new initiatives and eager to see the new categories develop as we head towards our goal of doubling the size of our brand business.
All of this is made possible by the passion and talents of our people, both at the home office and the 5,000-plus associates in the field that make Anthropologie Group's story so compelling and unique.
Thank you for your time this evening, and I will now turn the call over to Dick."

While I was also disappointed with the Anthropologie results for Q1, I think it's important to remember that the brand remains one of the strongest in the world with extremely loyal customers. Plus, it produces operating margins that are the envy of most of other retailers.
It's also important to realize that the Q1 shortfall in planned sales happened almost entirely in the last 2 weeks of April. This is when the Easter shift and the change in the catalog drop date combined to negatively impact sales more than anticipated. Newly received product and the catalog drop in early May have improved Anthropologie's sales so far this month.
Finally, I'm very pleased to see the additional investments made last year in expanding the home category and the Bhldn brand are already bearing fruit. Sales in both categories are strong, and I look forward to watching both reach their full potential. David, thank you, and thanks to the entire Anthropologie team for delivering a very good and a very profitable quarter.
Let me now provide an update on the first quarter results at the company's other 2 brands.
First, Urban Outfitters. I am happy to report that the Urban brand in North America continued to make solid progress during the quarter. Positive comps were driven by regular-price sales throughout the quarter. 6 of Urban's 8 major product categories delivered positive regular-price comps, including the all-important women's apparel division. Only the men's categories were down. Markdowns on a year-over-year basis decreased by more than 200 basis points, and the number of markdown units owned at the end of the period versus the same date last year dropped in half.
However, on a year-over-year basis, lower initial margins in the first quarter nearly offset the positive impact of fewer markdowns. So total maintain merchandise margins showed only slight improvement. 
The IMU issue, as we discussed last quarter, resulted from merchants ordering more products from the market, combined with a change in customer demand in favor of lower-margin categories. Ted, Trish and Meg pushed the Urban merchants to focus on improving their IMU. And I'm pleased to report that total April receipts showed slight year-over-year IMU improvement. We believe this will positively impact Urban's merchandise margins in Q2. In addition, the products on order to be delivered in the second quarter carry an even higher IMU, which leads us to believe that the back half of the year could continue to show IMU improvement.
Ending inventory at Urban on a weeks-of-supply basis was the leanest it's been in 3 years. So we believe there's opportunity for further markdown improvement in the second quarter as well.
Across both channels, the Urban customer reacted positively to the product categories the merchants chose to distort. While the merchants reduced the overall style comp by more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, they increased the number of styles and depth of buy in selected classes. These 2 factors, the decrease in total style comp and an increase in distortion, have allowed the merchants to own less total inventory and still generate more sales.
Store initiatives such as reducing redundant styles, establishing category shops and elevating customer service levels have improved the overall shopping experience. The Urban stores are now less cluttered and easier to shop than last year at this time. The team will continue to refine these initiatives on a go-forward basis as part of an effort to better please the customer and improve four-wall profitability.
In the direct-to-consumer channel, better product and many initiatives drove strong increases in DTC sessions and customer demand. These factors also produced double-digit increases across all customer groups: new, retained and reactivated. The amazing 40% year-over-year growth in the reactivated customers is especially important as it verifies our anecdotal evidence that Urban's core customer has returned to the brand.
In summary, the Urban brand has made significant progress over the past 12 months. Major improvements have been achieved in the following areas: the process by which inventory is planned, allocated and controlled; the process by which products are designed, selected, ranked and purchased; the product quality and the range of price points offered; the store experience and the digital experience, especially through better inventory and content.
Above all, teamwork and communication across the various home office functional areas have improved significantly. While there is still much work to be done to return the Urban brand to the level of profitability we believe it's capable of producing, I believe many of the people and processes necessary to accomplish this work are now in place.
Congratulations to Ted, Trish, Meg and their teams for orchestrating these improvements and reinvigorating the brand.
Turning to Free People. Once again, the team produced record first quarter results, delivering double-digit sales gains and record operating profits. The brand continues to amaze by registering stellar growth against multi-year difficult comparisons. This was accomplished by offering highly compelling product in wildly engaging shopping experiences, both in stores and online. The combined Retail segment delivered a powerful comp sales increase of 17% during the quarter. This is on top of the 25% increase in the same quarter last year and a 44% comp in the year before that.
The brand recorded strong growth across all 3 distribution channels. As with our other brands, the standout channel was direct-to-consumer. Customer demand continues to grow from retained, new and reactivated customers as the brand continues to enhance its marketing programs.
Within the direct channel, mobile devices now account for over 50% of total traffic and nearly 30% of sales. The brand continues to explore new ways to further engage the customer and create a stronger digital community.
We eagerly await the completion of the Free People Rockefeller Center store expansion. When completed in June, the store will become the largest in the brand's portfolio, exceeding 6,000 selling square feet and will allow the brand to offer a full product assortment, including the more recently launched categories such as intimate apparel, shoes, special occasion dresses, and for the first time in a store, Free People Movement, which is the brand's activewear category.
The Wholesale channel continued its double-digit positive sales trend, delivering revenue growth of 18% despite some distribution delays at the end of the quarter. Those delays stem from the transition of our fulfillment center in South Carolina to our new larger facility in Gap, Pennsylvania and resulted in slightly more than $2 million in Wholesale shipments moving from Q1 into Q2.
New and expanded product categories drove domestic Wholesale growth, while more doors in Europe, Canada and Asia fueled the international expansion. During the quarter, the brand opened 6 new international shop-in-shops, 2 in France and 4 in China.
In all, the brand delivered another in a string of amazing quarterly performances. My thanks go to Meg, Sheila and Dave and the entire Free People team.
Now let me say a few words about our customer shopping behavior and what it means to URBN. For many years, we have repeated that the direct-to-consumer channel is growing and capturing a larger share of our customer's wallet. 3 years ago, I predicted that in 5 years, the direct-to-consumer channel would account for half of URBN retail sales. That prediction was met with some skepticism. What we now see is that the trend toward greater DTC penetration is not just continuing but is actually accelerating. If my prediction is wrong, it's only off by 1 year or 2. 
Since 2001, when URBN launched its digital selling channel, DTC penetration has increased every year, and the rate of growth of penetration has grown almost every year. Q1 this year was no exception. It showed our second largest DTC penetration gain ever. While stores continue to be a very important part of our business, there is no mistaking the fact that the customer's shopping preference, measured by both traffic and sales, continues to move to a virtual experience. As a result, we believe it is critically important for URBN to accelerate its investments in new and enhanced capabilities to support this rapidly growing and changing channel. These initiatives are focused in the areas of product, technology, marketing, logistics, localization and personalization.
At the same time, we are accelerating our investments in virtual capabilities. We are slowing the number of new retail stores we open in the North American market. We have said consistently that from a store location perspective, we believe both of our larger brands will be fully penetrated in the North American market when they each have 200 to 250 stores. Today, Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters operate 199 and 195 stores in North America, respectively. To be clear, we will still open some traditional stores, and we plan to open a number of larger format stores. But many of these larger stores will be replacements of or additions to existing smaller ones.
Finally, before I turn the call over for your questions, I would like to announce that Ted Marlow has informed me that he wishes to retire at the end of August. When Ted began his Urban career in 2001, the brand operated 43 stores in North America and 2 in Europe. Total brand sales that year were just north of $150 million. 15 years later, under Ted's stewardship, the brand operates 195 stores in North America, 43 in Europe, 7 international concessions and runs multiple international direct-to-consumer businesses. This year, the Urban brand is on pace to exceed last year's $1.4 billion in sales. That's incredible growth.
Ted's loyalty to the brand and the customer is unwavering, and I am forever grateful to him for his service and his friendship. When Ted returned to the business in the spring of 2012, he told me he only wanted to work for a few additional years. There is no way any of us could have anticipated how tumultuous those 3 years would be for the brand. But in true Ted Marlow style, he hunkered down, fought through the adversity and came out on top. So Ted, on behalf of the board, your entire Urban Outfitters team and all URBN employees, I thank you and I wish you and Sara the very best in the future.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I extend my thanks to all URBN associates and shareholders around the world. And now I'll turn the call over for your questions."

Now the moves we're making in terms of the restructuring are things that Dick's talked about strategically across all of URBN, and that's really reducing speed to market and talking about some other ways that we're going to be bringing the concepts to the customer that Meg has done so well across Free People and recently at URBN women's. So we feel very confident that this isn't, I guess, one of the more dramatic dips, but the customer will certainly tell us that in the future."

This would be driven by strong improvement in the Urban brand's merch margins, and it does include relatively consistent performance to the first quarter of this year for the Anthropologie and Free People brand.

But perhaps you could comment on how the casual dress business is performing and if you're more confident in the assortments, the casual dress assortments. And Frank, I'm a little confused or unclear on the gross margin guidance. I think on the first call, you -- first -- fourth quarter call, you had outlined a plan for gross margins to be up 100 basis points this year. Now I think you're saying 25 to 50. Is that largely reflective of the higher markdowns expected for the first and the second quarters and with the second half gross margin outlook pretty much as it was when you talked on the fourth quarter call?"

As it relates to us, and because -- I'll answer the second question because I assume some other people are going to ask it as well. As it relates to the Q2 plan, I think the first thing I want to say is please be aware that there's a lot of moving pieces and some unknowns as we think about the second quarter. We have our largest fulfillment center transition in the history of the company going on. The Urban brand is improving. We have some growth rate uncertainty with regards to the Anthropologie brand and some of the largest currency fluctuations in some time in many of the international countries that we operate in. With all of that said and in consideration, yes, we believe gross profit margin could be down similar to Q1 in the second quarter, although I would say the composition of what is driving this deleverage could be different from Q1. As we said earlier, we believe the largest driver of deleverage could be our delivering fulfillment center expense related to the transition from South Carolina to Pennsylvania. As we said a quarter ago, we believe the expense related to this transition will be approximately 50 basis points for the year, with the second quarter being the quarter that's the most significantly affected. As of right now, based on our plans, we believe Q2 could be negatively affected by somewhere in the range of 100 basis points for the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps a little bit."

Simeon, I think that the DTC, as it grows, there is some additional expense that is incurred with marketing, and there's also additional expenses incurred with delivery. But in general, DTC is a more profitable channel than a store channel. We see the stores continuing to grow, as I said in my prepared remarks. We are slowing that because we believe that we're nearly fully penetrated in North America, but we realize that we are relatively un-penetrated in the world. So we will continue to open stores internationally. We are doing that slowly because we believe that there's a lot of learnings that we have to go through before we can do it consistently and with the right return. But as you know, in North America, there is a growing issue with traffic in the stores and traffic in the malls. And we see as rents continue to escalate and the traffic goes down, there is a squeeze in occupancy costs. And we are right now engaged in a number of initiatives trying to offset that. So that's where we are with the different channels."

So you're correct, SG&A did come in lower than what we were planning for in the first quarter as the store business didn't deliver the comps that we had planned. We appropriately pulled back store controllable expenses. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I do believe we are planning to execute to a single-digit SG&A growth rate. So we are pulling that number down just a little bit from our low single-digit plan, which was discussed a quarter ago. And when I say high single digit, I'm implying high, high single digit. So just under double digit for SG&A plan for the year. As it relates to inventory, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. But knowing where Urban North America was and being very lean and negative on a comp basis and with the Anthropologie basically only being high positive in the home and the Bhldn categories, I would say we would have been in the low single-digit range. I can tell you that I feel very comfortable with the inventory position. Anthropologie, although they drove the increase in comp, their aging is actually favorable on a year-over-year basis, so they are very current. I mean, any markdown exposure they would have would be just due to how the customer is receiving the current content. It is not related to getting ahead of a sales curve here. So I think the magnitude of the potential risk for markdowns is controlled there as it relates to the inventory investment. And I would also say over the last few quarters, as we have begun to market and work on the home category in a more meaningful way, it has carried a very low markdown rate as David and team have done a phenomenal job in executing in that category."

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our fiscal year 2016 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning the remainder of the year.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 8% to a first quarter record of $739 million. This sales increase was driven by a 4% Retail segment comp; a $20 million increase in non-comparable sales, including the opening of 6 net new stores; and 18% growth in Wholesale sales. Please note that currency negatively impacted our sales growth rate by approximately 140 basis points for the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting positive gains driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 17%, 5% and 1% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and the Anthropologie Group, respectively. This marks the second quarter in a row all brands have posted positive Retail segment comp sales growth.
Free People Wholesale delivered another strong quarter, as sales grew 18% to $54 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at department stores and the international business. Additionally, I want to note that due to some fulfillment-center transition challenges at our Trenton, South Carolina, distribution center, we were unable to process all of our quarter-end demand, which pushed a little more than $2 million of sales into the month of May.
Now moving back to total URBN results. Gross profit for the quarter was up 3% versus the prior comparable quarter to $246 million. Gross profit rate declined by 141 basis points to 33.3%. The decline in gross profit rate was primarily due to lower initial merchandise margins at the Urban Outfitters brand and higher delivery and fulfillment-center expenses across the entire company. The deleverage in delivery and fulfillment expenses were partially due to the increases in direct-to-consumer penetration and incremental costs associated with the beginning of the South Carolina fulfillment center transition to Gap, Pennsylvania.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter increased by 8% to $193 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged just slightly by 13 basis points to 26.1%. This minor SG&A deleverage was primarily due to increased marketing expenses, which were used to drive higher direct-to-consumer traffic.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 11% to $53 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 154 basis points to 7.2%. Net income was $33 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 14% to $398 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to support the Retail segment growth as well as new and non-comp stores.  Comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 8% at cost while decreasing 5% in units.
I wanted to take a quick moment and comment on the inventory increase in a bit more detail. By brand, the Urban Retail segment comparable inventory in North America is well controlled and actually in a negative position on a cost and unit basis. The driver of the increase in URBN Retail segment comp inventory is the Anthropologie brand, and it is being driven primarily by the investment in home product. Home inventory is double-digit comp positive as the brand begins to build their home inventory for their upcoming catalog drops and increased home marketing efforts. The past 2 home catalogs have performed well, and we sold out of many items in a few weeks. So the brand is making a larger investment in inventory to more closely align it with the anticipated demand.
We ended the quarter with $357 million in cash and marketable securities. During the first quarter, the company repurchased and retired 402,000 common shares for approximately $17 million. We have 21.9 million shares remaining on the 2 most recent Board of Directors authorizations to repurchase shares.
As we look forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: We are planning to open approximately 31 new stores during the year. By brand, we are planning approximately 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America; 13 new Anthropologie stores globally, including 1 new European store; and 14 new Free People stores in North America.
Our gross margin rate for the second quarter could deleverage versus the prior year similar to the rate of deleverage experienced in Q1. This deleverage could be driven primarily by costs associated with the transition of our East Coast DTC fulfillment center. This deleverage could occur despite the planned improved margin at the Urban Outfitters brand. The planned Urban brand improvement could be offset by increased markdowns at Anthropologie while they address some product misses in a few of their women's apparel and accessory classes.
Due to Anthropologie's sales slowdown at the end of April and the uptick experienced in May-to-date, it is not clear at this point what level of markdowns Anthropologie will incur during the second quarter. On an annual basis, we believe there is potential for approximately 25 to 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement in gross profit margin. This potential improvement is inclusive of the onetime fulfillment center transition costs. Based on our current plan, we believe the DTC fulfillment-center transition will negatively affect our annual gross profit margin by approximately 50 basis points. Our new state-of-the-art 1 million square-foot facility will begin phasing in outbound service to the customer in June. Therefore, the second quarter is expected to be the most negatively affected by our transition.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate for the year. This increase would be driven by DTC investments related to marketing and technology, and selling support investments to support our new store growth.
As I noted earlier, the effects of foreign currency translation resulted in approximately 140-basis-point reduction to sales and 30-basis-point reduction in operating profit. If today's rates held constant, all else in the business held constant such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 2.5% for the full year fiscal 2016. This would be based on our current business in the Canadian and European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 are planned at approximately $150 million to $160 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. This facility is all but complete, and we have begun testing it in preparation of the beginning of our transition in June of this year.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36.25%.
As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to our Anthropologie Group Chief Executive Officer, David McCreight."

For this call, I will provide an update on the Anthropologie Group, including recent results, highlights and upcoming milestones.
The Anthropologie Group has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of positive comp revenue growth, and I remain confident that continued comp growth is available to our brand when we execute well. This first quarter's 1% comp is a disappointment and a bit of a surprise as we had a stronger comp performance going into April.
We have read commentary about weather and port delays impacting performance, but our Q1 results are mostly the by-product of how we pleased her with our product and creative offers. Throughout the quarter, many areas showed solid to very strong growth. However, a few merchandise categories were not as well received and impacted the result, most notably dresses and accessories. Dress shortfalls came from missed opportunities in a few key silhouettes, fabrics and price points as well as insufficiently addressing our more casual customer. Certainly correctable, if not downright avoidable.
In comparison to the styling misses in dresses, accessories has underperformed to the sizable opportunity we have to participate in our customers' purchasing of accessories. We have adjusted the team and the strategy and look for improvement in the back half of the year and continued expansion of accessories in the future.
While we are not satisfied by our 1% comp, the quarter did contain many areas making nice progress. In fact, most apparel categories did well. The home initiative is right on schedule. Our Anthro file grew double digits over last year, and our customer is demonstrating increasing comfort with our ability to please her across a variety of channels. Bhldn continues to sparkle, delighting brides and wedding parties, and Terrain has made inroads in broadening their offer and leveraging the opportunities associated with Anthropologie. The Anthropologie Group growth strategy remains as last reviewed during September's Investment Day. Consistent with the URBN Vision 20|20, we are investing in talent, infrastructure and processes that will allow us to for fulfill the potential for our multibillion-dollar lifestyle brands.
Apparel remains a vital part of our business and growth strategy. We are constantly evaluating our capabilities and analyzing her evolving needs, ensuring our design, production and merchandising teams are interpreting and executing on point. As a result, we are looking to add talent within the apparel team and reduce the lead time necessary to bring our product to market.
We are in the process of restructuring the way that we design and merchandise and the teams work together. Based on the success of the Free People brand and as we have already done in the Anthropologie Home area, we are adopting Meg Hayne's concept of concept-to-customer approach to creating our apparel offer. As we improve our current apparel and accessories offering and shorten lead times, we expect to take full advantage of the opportunities presented digitally and realize new approaches to how we can merchandise our stores.
Since Bhldn joined the Anthropologie Group 3 years ago, we have been able to refocus on product and creating magical moments for our brides. With strong leadership guiding the development of our archetypes and the power of the Anthropologie behind them, sales at Bhldn has skyrocketed. Our unique and inspiring gowns have resonated with thousands of brides. And in the coming year, we will turn an eye to bridal party styles with dresses and separates for bridesmaids and mothers. While the product has found its sweet spot, the store experience has also evolved nicely through the shop-in-shop model. With 6 shop-in-shops, we're able to reach more customers and cultivate more brand fans than ever before.
Additionally, Bhldn's location on Anthropologie's website has increased nationwide awareness. As a result, Bhldn has seen almost triple-digit sales growth this past quarter and is driving incremental bottom line dollars to the business.
With Terrain joining the Anthropologie Group, we expect to see a similar path to success, evolving their creative brand experience across all media, strategically building out our digital offer and leveraging the resources of the Anthropologie Group. All early signs show that Terrain is a natural life-stage extension for our core customer.
When I spoke to you 8 months ago, I outlined our vision for building a home company within the Anthropologie Group and the impressive scale the opportunity presents. Focusing on decorating and entertaining, leadership has made excellent progress with the home assortment. Last year, over 1,500 new styles were introduced. And the new product is resonating with the customer, enabling the entire category to achieve double-digit comp sales within the quarter.
Since the launch of the expanded offer and new design concepts, demand for our new home offer has exceeded our expectations with the biggest wins in unique items that she can't find elsewhere. As we learn more about her taste preferences and the longer demand curves for home, it is nice to see the team also making progress building relationships with key domestic partners to expand our drop-ship offer in the furniture, rug, wallpaper and curtain categories. In order to fulfill the rising demand, we continue to invest in our home business. We continue to build the team, redesign our digital home presentation, create new home journals and analyze our logistic capabilities. In fact, some of you may find our newest home journal in your mailbox today. Please take a look and let me know what you think.
Alongside these major category expansions comes commensurate investment in digital and infrastructure capabilities. As the Anthropologie brand fans grow increasingly comfortable visiting our digital contact points, we are committed to providing a best-in-class experience from look books and inspirational content, award-winning social to reliable shipping and customer service.
The growth of home decor calls for specific digital solutions to make the online experience easier to be inspired and shopped. Starting this month, we will introduce home website developments, including improved navigation, enhanced delivery service and rates and more inspirational content.
Also, the recent launch of our Registry service has attracted thousands of brides. I'm very satisfied with the rapid embrace of brides creating a gift registry within Anthropologie. In addition to fulfilling our home potential, the registry has helped provide a gateway to the brand with over 40% of gift givers being first-time Anthropologie shoppers.
And while the digital experience is more important than ever, that does not mean we are resting on our previous success in stores. The largest part of consumer commerce still occurs in stores. Our customers still want to touch and feel our product, be inspired by our spaces and interact with our delightful associates. We know how important the store experience has been to shaping our brand, and we have a best-in-class experience that is compelling and very profitable.
But our brand fans relationship with the store experience is changing. The Anthropologie Group is evolving, with growing product categories and new brands under our umbrella. As we observe her behavior, we are excited by the opportunities ahead for the Anthropologie Group in providing one of the richest multichannel, multimedia brand experiences in the world of retail.
In addition to investments we have made in DTC and social platforms, we believe that it is vital that our store experience remain remarkable and relevant. As we shared with you in September, we plan on rolling out this new experience next year with our first large format store scheduled to open in May, one where we can bring new experiences, expanded product offers and services. Our home expansion is on track. The beauty assortment and services are well underway. Bhldn and Terrain continue to flourish, and we've been hard at work on our multichannel service model. Most importantly, we think our new large-format initiative is in perfect alignment with the direction our customers are headed and one which will support Anthropologie Group's growth well into the future.
At URBN, we are continually challenged to listen to our customer, develop creative ways to engage her efficiently. It is unusual to be part of a group whose brand reach exceeds that of an already-sizable business. I'd like to thank Dick and the URBN shared services for their encouragement and support for investing in the Anthropologie Group. We have a beautiful customer, beloved brand and a very profitable business model. We are proud of our recent successes, excited by the early results of our new initiatives and eager to see the new categories develop as we head towards our goal of doubling the size of our brand business.
All of this is made possible by the passion and talents of our people, both at the home office and the 5,000-plus associates in the field that make Anthropologie Group's story so compelling and unique.
Thank you for your time this evening, and I will now turn the call over to Dick."

While I was also disappointed with the Anthropologie results for Q1, I think it's important to remember that the brand remains one of the strongest in the world with extremely loyal customers. Plus, it produces operating margins that are the envy of most of other retailers.
It's also important to realize that the Q1 shortfall in planned sales happened almost entirely in the last 2 weeks of April. This is when the Easter shift and the change in the catalog drop date combined to negatively impact sales more than anticipated. Newly received product and the catalog drop in early May have improved Anthropologie's sales so far this month.
Finally, I'm very pleased to see the additional investments made last year in expanding the home category and the Bhldn brand are already bearing fruit. Sales in both categories are strong, and I look forward to watching both reach their full potential. David, thank you, and thanks to the entire Anthropologie team for delivering a very good and a very profitable quarter.
Let me now provide an update on the first quarter results at the company's other 2 brands.
First, Urban Outfitters. I am happy to report that the Urban brand in North America continued to make solid progress during the quarter. Positive comps were driven by regular-price sales throughout the quarter. 6 of Urban's 8 major product categories delivered positive regular-price comps, including the all-important women's apparel division. Only the men's categories were down. Markdowns on a year-over-year basis decreased by more than 200 basis points, and the number of markdown units owned at the end of the period versus the same date last year dropped in half.
However, on a year-over-year basis, lower initial margins in the first quarter nearly offset the positive impact of fewer markdowns. So total maintained merchandise margins showed only slight improvement. 
The IMU issue, as we discussed last quarter, resulted from merchants ordering more products from the market, combined with a change in customer demand in favor of lower-margin categories. Ted, Trish and Meg pushed the Urban merchants to focus on improving their IMU. And I'm pleased to report that total April receipts showed slight year-over-year IMU improvement. We believe this will positively impact Urban's merchandise margins in Q2. In addition, the products on order to be delivered in the second quarter carry an even higher IMU, which leads us to believe that the back half of the year could continue to show IMU improvement.
Ending inventory at Urban on a weeks-of-supply basis was the leanest it's been in 3 years. So we believe there's opportunity for further markdown improvement in the second quarter as well.
Across both channels, the Urban customer reacted positively to the product categories the merchants chose to distort. While the merchants reduced the overall style count by more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, they increased the number of styles and depth of buy in selected classes. These 2 factors, the decrease in total style count and an increase in distortion, have allowed the merchants to own less total inventory and still generate more sales.
Store initiatives such as reducing redundant styles, establishing category shops and elevating customer service levels have improved the overall shopping experience. The Urban stores are now less cluttered and easier to shop than last year at this time. The team will continue to refine these initiatives on a go-forward basis as part of an effort to better please the customer and improve four-wall profitability.
In the direct-to-consumer channel, better product and many initiatives drove strong increases in DTC sessions and customer demand. These factors also produced double-digit increases across all customer groups: new, retained and reactivated. The amazing 40% year-over-year growth in reactivated customers is especially important as it verifies our anecdotal evidence that Urban's core customer has returned to the brand.
In summary, the Urban brand has made significant progress over the past 12 months. Major improvements have been achieved in the following areas: the process by which inventory is planned, allocated and controlled; the process by which products are designed, selected, ranked and purchased; the product quality and the range of price points offered; the store experience and the digital experience, especially through better inventory and content.
Above all, teamwork and communication across the various home-office functional areas have improved significantly. While there is still much work to be done to return the Urban brand to the level of profitability we believe it's capable of producing, I believe many of the people and processes necessary to accomplish this work are now in place.
Congratulations to Ted, Trish, Meg and their teams for orchestrating these improvements and reinvigorating the brand.
Turning to Free People. Once again, the team produced record first quarter results, delivering double-digit sales gains and record operating profits. The brand continues to amaze by registering stellar growth against multi-year difficult comparisons. This was accomplished by offering highly compelling product in wildly engaging shopping experiences, both in stores and online. The combined Retail segment delivered a powerful comp sales increase of 17% during the quarter. This was on top of the 25% increase in the same quarter last year and a 44% comp in the year before that.
The brand recorded strong growth across all 3 distribution channels. As with our other brands, the standout channel was direct-to-consumer. Customer demand continues to grow from retained, new and reactivated customers as the brand continues to enhance its marketing programs.
Within the direct channel, mobile devices now account for over 50% of total traffic and nearly 30% of sales. The brand continues to explore new ways to further engage the customer and create a stronger digital community.
We eagerly await the completion of the Free People Rockefeller Center store expansion. When completed in June, the store will become the largest in the brand's portfolio, exceeding 6,000 selling square feet, and will allow the brand to offer a full product assortment, including the more recently launched categories such as intimate apparel, shoes, special occasion dresses, and for the first time in a store, Free People Movement, which is the brand's activewear category.
The Wholesale channel continued its double-digit positive sales trend, delivering revenue growth of 18% despite some distribution delays at the end of the quarter. Those delays stem from the transition of our fulfillment center in South Carolina to our new larger facility in Gap, Pennsylvania and resulted in slightly more than $2 million in Wholesale shipments moving from Q1 into Q2.
New and expanded product categories drove domestic Wholesale growth, while more doors in Europe, Canada and Asia fueled the international expansion. During the quarter, the brand opened 6 new international shop-in-shops: 2 in France and 4 in China.
In all, the brand delivered another in a string of amazing quarterly performances. My thanks go to Meg, Sheila and Dave and the entire Free People team.
Now let me say a few words about our customer shopping behavior and what it means to URBN. For many years, we have repeated that the direct-to-consumer channel is growing and capturing a larger share of our customer's wallet. 3 years ago, I predicted that in 5 years, the direct-to-consumer channel would account for half of URBN retail sales. That prediction was met with some skepticism. What we now see is that the trend toward greater DTC penetration is not just continuing but is actually accelerating. If my prediction is wrong, it's only off by 1 year or 2. 
Since 2001, when URBN launched its digital selling channel, DTC penetration has increased every year, and the rate of growth of penetration has grown almost every year. Q1 this year was no exception. It showed our second-largest DTC penetration gain ever. While stores continue to be a very important part of our business, there is no mistaking the fact that the customer's shopping preference, measured by both traffic and sales, continues to move to a virtual experience. As a result, we believe it is critically important for URBN to accelerate its investments in new and enhanced capabilities to support this rapidly growing and changing channel. These initiatives are focused in the areas of product, technology, marketing, logistics, localization and personalization.
At the same time we are accelerating our investments in virtual capabilities, we are slowing the number of new retail stores we open in the North American market. We have said consistently that from a store-location perspective, we believe both of our larger brands will be fully penetrated in the North American market when they each have 200 to 250 stores. Today, Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters operate 199 and 195 stores in North America, respectively. To be clear, we will still open some traditional stores, and we plan to open a number of larger-format stores. But many of these larger stores will be replacements of or additions to existing smaller ones.
Finally, before I turn the call over for your questions, I would like to announce that Ted Marlow has informed me that he wishes to retire at the end of August. When Ted began his Urban career in 2001, the brand operated 43 stores in North America and 2 in Europe. Total brand sales that year were just north of $150 million. 15 years later, under Ted's stewardship, the brand operates 195 stores in North America, 43 in Europe, 7 international concessions and runs multiple international direct-to-consumer businesses. This year, the Urban brand is on pace to exceed last year's $1.4 billion in sales. That's incredible growth.
Ted's loyalty to the brand and the customer is unwavering, and I am forever grateful to him for his service and his friendship. When Ted returned to the business in the spring of 2012, he told me he only wanted to work for a few additional years. There is no way any of us could have anticipated how tumultuous those 3 years would be for the brand. But in true Ted Marlow style, he hunkered down, fought through the adversity and came out on top. So Ted, on behalf of the board, your entire Urban Outfitters team and all URBN employees, I thank you and I wish you and Sara the very best in the future.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I extend my thanks to all URBN associates and shareholders around the world. And now I'll turn the call over for your questions."

In terms of rebound, we're expecting we could see Q2 shaping up like Q1 in terms of low single-digit comps. We could also see being into the low mid-single-digit comps. It's hard to tell at this point. Our inventories, our comp inventories ended the quarter up in the mid-single digits. Apparel was only up 2%. Accessories was negative high-single digits. And most of the investment is, as I alluded to earlier, investing in home and Bhldn.

The lion's share of the deleverage was driven by IMU deleverage from the Urban Outfitters brand globally. And then as David alluded to, we did have slightly higher markdown rates and lower merchandise margins within the Anthropologie brand. So that's the answer to your Q1 question. As it relates to the remainder of the year, yes, based on our current plans, we believe we can achieve 25 to 50 basis points of gross profit margin improvement on an annual basis for fiscal '16. This is inclusive of the onetime fulfillment-center transition expenses. This would be driven by strong improvement in the Urban brand's merch margins, and it does include relatively consistent performance to the first quarter of this year for the Anthropologie and Free People brands. So keep in mind that Anthropologie and Free People delivered basically at or near record merch margins last year and Anthro missed that number in the first quarter. That miss is baked into our annual basis plans, which does look for 25 to 50 basis points of improvement on an annual basis."

As it relates to -- and because -- I'll answer the second question because I assume some other people are going to ask it as well. As it relates to the Q2 plan, I think the first thing I want to say is please be aware that there's a lot of moving pieces and some unknowns as we think about the second quarter. We have our largest fulfillment center transition in the history of the company going on. The Urban brand is improving. We have some growth-rate uncertainty with regards to the Anthropologie brand and some of the largest currency fluctuations in some time in many of the international countries that we operate in. With all of that said and in consideration, yes, we believe gross profit margin could be down similar to Q1 in the second quarter, although I would say the composition of what is driving this deleverage could be different from Q1. As we said earlier, we believe the largest driver of deleverage could be our delivery and fulfillment-center expense related to the transition from South Carolina to Pennsylvania. As we said a quarter ago, we believe the expense related to this transition will be approximately 50 basis points for the year, with the second quarter being the quarter that's the most significantly affected. As of right now, based on our plans, we believe Q2 could be negatively affected by somewhere in the range of 100 basis points for the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps a little bit."

We are slowing that because we believe that we're nearly fully penetrated in North America, but we realize that we are relatively un-penetrated in the world. So we will continue to open stores internationally. We are doing that slowly because we believe that there's a lot of learnings that we have to go through before we can do it consistently and with the right return. But as you know, in North America, there is a growing issue with traffic in the stores and traffic in the malls. And we see as rents continue to escalate and the traffic goes down, there is a squeeze in occupancy costs. And we are right now engaged in a number of initiatives trying to offset that.

So you're correct, SG&A did come in lower than what we were planning for in the first quarter as the store business didn't deliver the comps that we had planned. We appropriately pulled back store-controllable expenses. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I do believe we are planning to execute to a high single-digit SG&A growth rate. So we are pulling that number down just a little bit from our low single-digit plan, which was discussed a quarter ago. And when I say high-single digit, I'm implying high, high-single digit. So just under double digit for SG&A planned for the year. As it relates to inventory, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. But knowing where Urban North America was and being very lean and negative on a comp basis, and with Anthropologie basically only being high positive in the home and the Bhldn categories, I would say we would have been in the low single-digit range. I can tell you that I feel very comfortable with the inventory position. Anthropologie, although they drove the increase in comp, their aging is actually favorable on a year-over-year basis, so they are very current. I mean, any markdown exposure they would have would be just due to how the customer is receiving the current content. It is not related to getting ahead of a sales curve here. So I think the magnitude of the potential risk for markdowns is controlled there as it relates to the inventory investment. And I would also say over the last few quarters, as we have begun to market and work on the home category in a more meaningful way, it has carried a very low markdown rate, as David and team have done a phenomenal job in executing in that category."

I'll start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter, then I will share our thoughts concerning our current quarter.",1186,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter, then I will share our thoughts concerning our current quarter.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 7% to a second quarter record of $867 million. This sales increase was driven by a 4% Retail segment comp, a $15 million increase in noncomparable sales including the opening of 4 net new stores and 21% growth in Wholesale sales.  Please note that currency translation negatively impacted our sales growth rate by approximately 165 basis points for the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting positive gains driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 14%, 4% and 2% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and the Anthropologie Group respectively.  This marks the third quarter in a row all brands have posted positive retail comp sales growth, the 13th quarter Free People has posted double-digit comp gains and 12th quarter in a row Anthropologie has posted positive comp sale gains.
Our URBN Retail segment comp was strongest in May followed by June and July, which came in fairly consistent with each other.
Free People Wholesale delivered another strong quarter as sales grew 21% to $72 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at department stores, partially driven by the success of our category expansion, namely Intimately Free and Free People shoes.
Now moving back to total URBN results. Gross profit for the quarter was up 5% versus the prior comparable quarter to $318 million. Gross profit rate declined by 71 basis points to 36.7%. The decline in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher delivery and fulfillment center expenses. The deleverage and the delivery fulfillment expenses was partially due to the increase in direct-to-consumer channel penetration to total sales as well as the incremental costs associated with the transition of the South Carolina fulfillment center to Gap, Pennsylvania.  
We are proud to share that our transition has gone extremely well. All 3 brands' direct-to-consumer businesses have been completely moved to our new facility, which is now up and running. Expenses related to the transition had come in better than expected and we believe only negative affected the second quarter gross profit margin by approximately 40 basis points, much less than we originally planned.  We are still forecasting approximately 25 basis points of incremental expense in the third quarter related to the transition, but the overall expense and the leverage of the year is trending lower than what we have originally planned. A big congratulation and thank you is in order to our shared service teams for their hard work and extraordinary execution.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter increased by 8% to $214 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 29 basis points to 24.7%. The minor SG&A deleverage was partially due to increased marketing expenses, which were used to drive higher direct-to-consumer traffic.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 1% to $104 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 100 basis points to 12%. Net income for the quarter was $67 million or $0.52 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 6% to $384 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to new and noncomp stores as well as the Wholesale segment. Comparable Retail segment inventory decreased by 2% at cost, while decreasing 7% in units. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply.
We ended the quarter with $339 million in cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, the company repurchased and retired 6.6 million common shares for approximately $236 million. We now have 15.2 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase shares.
On July 1, we entered into a 5-year, $400 million asset-backed revolving credit facility. This facility gives us additional flexibility to use more cash strategically when appropriate. We utilized $115 million of this line during the second quarter to fund some of the shares repurchase previously discussed.
As I look forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following. 
We are planning to open approximately 32 new stores during the year. By brand, we are planning approximately 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America, 13 new Anthropologie stores globally including one new European store, and 15 new Free People stores in North America.
Our gross margin rate for the third quarter could increase versus the prior year. This growth could be driven by meaningful improvement in the Urban Outfitters brands' maintained margin if their product performance and inventory management continues to progress favorably. The overall URBN rate improvement could occur while the Anthropologie and Free People brands maintain margins normalized down from their near-record selling performances from a year ago to rates more similar to where they landed for the second quarter this year.
With that said, please take note that thus far in August for all brands, our direct-to-consumer business has posted strong gains consistent with the second quarter, while our store sales have started out slower than what we planned and where we finished the second quarter. There are many factors that could be impacting our store performance, and there is too little data at this time to draw any solid conclusions.
Based on our current plans, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rates for the year, with the third quarter growth rate looking fairly similar to what we recorded for the second quarter.  This increase will be driven by the DC investments relating to marketing and technology and selling support investments to support our new store growth.
As I noted earlier, the effects of foreign currency translation resulted in an approximately 165 basis point reduction to sales and approximately 30 basis point reduction in operating profit. If today's rates held constant and all else in the business held constant, such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 3% for the full year fiscal 2016. This would be based on our current businesses in the Canadian and European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 remained planned at approximately $140 million to $150 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36%. 
As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to our Free People brand Chief Operating Officer, David Hayne."

I'm excited to provide an update on the positive momentum at Free People in the second quarter. 
Last year on this call, we started off by discussing our record-setting quarter, and I'm very pleased to do the same today. The Free People brand achieved a consolidated second quarter revenue record with a 20% top line increase over the last year.
These results were driven by a strong Retail segment comp of 14% and continued robust growth of 21% from the Wholesale segment. This performance is even more exciting when viewed on a 2-year basis where second quarter revenue has grown by nearly 60% since fiscal 2014, certainly, an achievement of which all of our teams can be proud.
Strong product is the lifeblood of our business, and our design and merchant teams have consistently delivered compelling assortments that have repeatedly brought our customers back to the brand. And this spring was no different, with many product wins to speak of. The customer continues to vote for our dress collection with our strategy of expanding into party dresses providing a very healthy boost to the business. Our intimates collection has outperformed expectations in all channels. And our own label shoe assortment saw significant gains in the quarter.  Our active wear line, FP Movement, continues to impress us in the direct-to-consumer channel, making us even more excited to launch Movement to the wholesale market this fall for spring delivery. Our teams look forward to developing these concepts further as well as exploring the category expansions in the future.
Moving to the Wholesale channel. The team closed July with our single strongest sales month ever and entered the back half with future bookings on pace with the current trend. Our department store partners have success across their bricks and digital storefronts with particular strength coming from our expansion categories. In fact, our expansion categories drove over 1/3 of our total Wholesale growth in the quarter, with success across both our department store and specialty store partners.
Our 4-pronged domestic strategy has been working for us: one, investing shopping shops in key department store doors; two, offer replenishment programs to key accounts; three, open expansion classes to existing accounts; and four, onboard new accounts to both our core collection and expansion categories.
This has provided a successful framework for developing our legacy domestic business, and we see room to continue this momentum.
Moving overseas, our Wholesale team now supports over 300 global accounts with over 500 doors in 35 countries. Our relationship with IT in Hong Kong continues to grow with 3 new shops open this spring. And a new department store relationship in Mexico offers new potential for the brand closer to home.  We've seen particular strength in Europe where our London team has doubled their business by improving operational execution and developing domestic relationships, such as our partnership with ASOS and our 2 new pair of shop-in-shops in Galeries Lafayette. Additionally, our existing London presence in Selfridges recently expanded to a 400 square foot shop-in-shop, and this location is already the most productive we have globally.  The team has also partnered with new distributors in Spain, Italy and Germany, which helped to open 40 new specialty accounts in those countries in the quarter.
Alongside these Wholesale developments, our Retail team recently celebrated the opening of our first self-operated shop in London, a pop-up boutique in -- on Kings Road, which will remain open into next year. Although only a small space, many of the operational complexities of opening stores in a new market have now been overcome by the team. And we're excited that the stage is now set for permanent stores in the U.K. and Europe in the years ahead.  More definitively, we expect to open at least one permanent store in London in the first half of next year.
On the domestic front, our retail team drove record second quarter sales and successfully opened 3 new stores in the quarter following 4 new stores in Q1, bringing the current count to 108 total stores in North America. Additionally, later this fiscal year, we plan to open 9 new or relocated stores, which average approximately 3,700 selling square feet per store, the largest of which, a relocation in Denver's Cherry Creek mall, will total 5,300 selling square feet, over 3x larger than our current store in the center with plenty of room to support our successful category expansions such as intimates, shoes and movement in addition to our core collection and accessory assortments.
Not to be overlooked, we also completed a significant expansion of our Rockefeller Center store, more than doubling our selling space to nearly 6,500 selling square feet. This prominent store is now able to carry the widest assortment in our fleet including shoes, party dresses, movement and even a small home capsule. We couldn't be more pleased with the new store presentation, and initial reaction to the broader product assortment has been very encouraging.
Our larger format store initiative is now well underway, and we're eager to learn from and develop this critical area of the brand's future growth.
Moving online. Our direct-to-consumer business experienced very healthy growth in the quarter with our customer base increasing 37% alongside a nice bump in conversion rate. Our domestic growth outperformed the total growth as we experienced a noticeable slowdown in our international DTC growth rate, which we believe is primarily due to currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.  Despite these challenges, our localized U.K. and China online business has generally outperformed other global markets, with China in particular showing nice acceleration against last year's growth rates.  We believe this is just more proof to the importance of website localization.
As has already been mentioned, the wider URBN team successfully migrated our fulfillment operations to our new Pennsylvania facility. It's hard to overstate just how impressive this new building is in person, and it's also hard not to be impressed that just how flawlessly the transition went for all of our brands.  On behalf of all of our brands, I'd like to congratulate all the shared service teams supporting the design, build and transition on a job very well done.
Meanwhile, the mobile migration we've been witnessing in the DTC channel has continued with mobile devices now accounting for over 55% of our visitors and nearly 30% of our sales.  To better support our e-commerce future and better position ourselves for the new mobile era, the Free People team and our shared service partners have been hard at work building a future web platform for all of our brands. When our new platform launches in the back half of this year, we expect a faster shopping experience, improved functionality, broadened FP Me capabilities, more seamless mobile presentations and generally a more robust foundation from which to build the shopping and experiential platforms, which will be at the core of our brands and businesses for years to come.
I cannot talk about the core of who we are without also saying a word about the creative process. The Free People brand has been a success with customers because we endeavor to infuse creativity in everything we do, be it product design and imagery, catalog shoots, editorial content, store environments, marketing videos or local brand events. Whatever it be, the creative teams that touch these areas are actually the essence of who we are as a brand. And it's this sentiment that we aspire to leave fresh in our customer's mind with the hope that she recalls us favorably in the future.
Thank you very much for your time. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Dick Hayne."

Good afternoon, everyone. Amazing using is the word that comes to mind when I hear the Free People story. 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit comp sales growth is a remarkable story and a tribute to the extraordinary performance of the Free People. Congratulations to Meg, Dave, Sheila, Crissy and their teams.  Given the many new initiatives including the international expansion and new product category expansions, I believe the brand has the opportunity to continue that growth.  However, after many years of strong comp store increases, the Free People stores are operating at an extremely high level of productivity. So I believe that future top line growth for the Free People brand will likely come less from comp store sales increases and more from opening additional and larger stores and from expanding their other 2 channels of distribution.
Let me now discuss second quarter results at our other 2 brands. 
First, Urban Outfitters.  Speaking on last year's Q4 conference call, Trish Donnelly said one of our biggest priorities is to reestablish positive sales momentum. I'm pleased to report the brand recorded a healthy 4% Retail segment comp with the North American group outperforming its European counterpart.
However, the 4% comp in Q2 only tells part of a very positive brand story. Importantly, the productivity gain was driven by a high single-digit increase in regular price sales. Year-over-year increases in both conversion and average transaction value drove the right price increase and demonstrate the willingness of the Urban customer to buy full price when we provide her with compelling product and exciting experience.  As in the first quarter, 6 of Urban's 8 major product categories delivered regular price comps including the all-important women's apparel division.
One of the brand's most important achievements for the quarter was a 400-plus basis point improvement in the year-over-year markdown rate. Fewer markdowns more than offset the decrease in IMU and resulted in significant merchandise margin improvement for the brand. Urban's product deliveries throughout the second quarter and into the third continue to show additional IMU improvement. We believe this will positively impact merchandise margins in the second half of the year. In addition, ending inventory at the URBN brand on a weeks of supply basis was the leanest it's been in 3 years, thus providing opportunity for further markdowns improvement in Q3.
On the same conference call, Trish also outlined initiatives around store productivity. During the first half of FY '16, the brand made good progress on these initiatives. 
The first is category distortion. The brand team looked at sales by product category and compared them to the floor space allocated to each category. Next, the team planned additional space for emerging strong categories like beauty, intimates and dresses while rightsizing the space allocated to others. In July, the team tested a prototype store within a new floor set and a number of category shop-in-shops. Customer response has been very positive, so the Urban team is now in the process of reproducing this floor set across the store fleet.
In addition to better category distortion, the brand is working to increase selling space in existing stores by shrinking the back of the house, hold less back stock in stores, creating a supply chain that requires less time to flow new product into our distribution channels and integrate more digital capabilities into the store experience.  As an example of this last initiative, the brand tested the use of in-store beacon messaging for those customers using the Urban On app on their smartphones. 54% of the customers receiving this messages chose to interact with them, many times higher than the open rate of standard email messaging.  Furthermore, customers who chose to open messages were 3x more likely to make a purchase than an average Urban brand shopper. 
Most of these productivity initiatives are currently in the design and testing stage. If proven successful, they will be adopted across all stores. This new way of operating is an integral process tied to our long-term strategic vision and not a 1-season project meant to drive immediate results.
Overall, I'm pleased with the considerable progress the Urban brand teams have made over the past 12 months in terms of improving the product, the brand position and the brand experience. Urban has reconnected with its core customer and is once again a fashion leader for young adults. I thank Ted, Trish, Meg and their teams for their own hard work throughout this process.  I hope the results are as gratifying to them as they are to me, and I'm excited to see the progress the brand will make over the next 12 months.
Turning your attention now to the Anthropologie brand. Its second quarter performance was very close to what we expected it would be when we last spoke on our May conference call. The branded delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth, but due to some product misses, margins came in below the same quarter last year. Many categories delivered solid growth, but a few, notably dresses and accessories, were poorly executed, and those product misses negatively impacted the overall brand performance. David and his team's sharp focus on inventory management enabled them to mitigate the markdown pressure and maintain solid merchandise margins. Furthermore, the team made timely adjustments throughout the quarter at the styles and taking additional promotions as necessary to clear through slower-moving merchandise.  Overall, the brand finished the quarter in a healthy inventory position and generated an operating margin that, although not an Anthropologie record, would be the envy of most other apparel retailers.  I believe the brand will continue to make adjustments to their assortments throughout the back half of the year. And I believe they are positioned to post healthy, but not record, margins over the next few quarters.
At this time last year, URBN unveiled its Vision 20|20 strategy at our Investor Day conference. For those who attended, you may recall our growth strategy was: expand the number of products our brands offer, grow all of our distribution channels across all geographies and allow them to accommodate a larger product assortment, and improve operational capabilities and become more efficient.  
All URBN brands are working to execute this vision. I listed a number of examples of how the URBN brand is in the process of making improvements to its operational capabilities. In addition, Dave noted in his commentary how the Free People brand benefited greatly from launching new product categories. 
All through the past year, the Anthropologie brand has had many strategic successes as well. The brand recognized the opportunity to build much larger businesses in categories adjacent to apparel and so invested in talent and infrastructure to expand the offering in a number of these, most notably, home, beauty and shoes. Each has performed well.
In addition, the brand successfully integrated the BHLDN and Terrain concept into the Anthropologie Group, and those concepts are now growing rapidly. Strong customer response to these Anthropologie product expansions as well similar successful expansions at the Free People and Urban brands have increased our confidence in the longer-term strategy we presented last September.  
Opening large format stores and redesigning existing stores think a more selling space to how we are expanding product is part of the strategy, so I'm pleased to report that the Anthropologie brand has now signed leases for 4 large format stores. The first 2 both scheduled to open in spring of 2016 would be expansions of the current stores in Portland, Oregon and Newport Beach, California. By next summer, the brands plan to open a new large format store in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California. This is a renovation of a much smaller store in a secondary location in that same market. The new Palo Alto store will feature expanded assortment of all the brand product categories plus a large beauty offering, a BHLDN and Terrain shop-in-shop and an Anthro café. 
Larger stores each offering expanded product assortments is now part of the strategy, but as we emphasized last September, our product expansion strategy is an important component in driving growth and all of our distribution channels. Indeed, product expansion has been instrumental in helping the direct-to-consumer and Wholesale channels achieve vigorous growth. In his commentary on Q2 sales, Dave credited the expansion classes for approximately 1/3 of the gains in Free People's Wholesale sales. In addition, we estimate that expanded product accounted for more than 40% of the powerful double-digit direct-to-consumer sales growth in the quarter.
So to summarize, we are making steady progress on implementing all 3 components of our strategic plan and have already seen many successes from our efforts to date. All brands have carefully but steadily offered larger nonredundant product assortments across a number of categories and in several cases, have added entirely new categories.  Without question, this has helped to drive our top line growth in the direct and Wholesale channels.
At the same time, we are launching initiatives to make operational improvements like better category distortion in stores, faster reaction to customer demand, more efficient use of store space and better integration of technology. More product and improved operations will allow us to continues to expand our distribution and meet our Vision 20|20 goals. We are in the early stages of implementation, but have already tasted its benefits. We're excited by the opportunities it provides and the growth it envisions. I will update you on annual progress.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, since this will be Ted's final URBN conference call, I wanted to thank him publicly one more time for the extraordinary impact his leadership has had on the Urban brand over the past 15 years. Ted, I wish you and Sarah the very best, and I thank you for your friendship and the many contributions you've made to the company.
Finally, in closing, I thank our 23,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication drive and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

All of the brands have shown a trend of strong comps on the direct channel, slightly weaker when we compare it to July on the store channel, and the Wholesale channel's ahead. Now there are a number of categories that are working and working nicely and I don't think is significantly different than the categories that we're working toward the end of the second quarter. And so it just begs the question as why would the stores be down and not the direct business. And the only things we can come up with and the factors are the calendar shift where the Labor Day holiday is a week later this year. It may have something to do with weather. Because it's so hot on the East and West Coast, maybe people are thinking more time away and going on vacations, therefore shopping online rather than in stores. Yes, traffic continue to show slight declines from almost mid-single-digit declines from where it was the prior year, but that's not really a change from the July month. And then, of course, we always look at the potential that is product execution. That's a possibility, but if it were that, then we would expect that direct business to be down as well. So we're certainly not panicked about it. And we believe it is probably one of the first 2 factors that I mentioned, but we can't be sure at this time because it's only been 2 weeks. So I think we're going to have to wait until the 10-K is released in September and we'll have much more clarity by then."

We are in a very, very early stages of that development, but we do believe that we have the opportunity to do that. Now having said that, our way of thinking about expansion is in terms of expanded product categories, meaning larger footprint and stores, so the square footage of stores will grow, but the number of units may not. So we expect to either close and reopen, meaning relocate on when lease is up, replace it with another lease that would be larger and allow us to present these expanded categories. That way, we can continue our growth in the retail stores segment. The beauty of that strategy is that, of course, is that product expansion that is driving the direct-to-consumer and in the Free People case, Wholesale channels of distribution.

As Anthropologie, for example, has 4 larger format stores on that horizon, if those perform well and we continue along with a strategy which we're all confident here. That could change the changing because all of the stores will be replacing an existing stores, it will be net-net, like adding 2-plus stores.

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning our current quarter",1191,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning our current quarter.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 7% to a second quarter record of $867 million. This sales increase was driven by a 4% Retail segment comp, a $15 million increase in noncomparable sales including the opening of 4 net new stores and 21% growth in Wholesale sales. Please note that currency translation negatively impacted our sales growth rate by approximately 165 basis points for the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting positive gains driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 14%, 4% and 2% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and the Anthropologie Group, respectively. This marks the third quarter in a row all brands have posted positive Retail segment comp sales growth, the 13th quarter Free People has posted double-digit comp gains and the 12th quarter in a row Anthropologie has posted positive comp sales gains.
Our URBN Retail segment comp was strongest in May followed by June and July, which came in fairly consistent with each other.
Free People Wholesale delivered another strong quarter as sales grew 21% to $72 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at department stores, partially driven by the success of our category expansion, namely Intimately Free and Free People shoes.
Now moving back to total URBN results. Gross profit for the quarter was up 5% versus the prior comparable quarter to $318 million. Gross profit rate declined by 71 basis points to 36.7%. The decline in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher delivery and fulfillment center expenses. The deleverage in delivery and fulfillment center expenses was partially due to the increase in direct-to-consumer channel penetration to total sales as well as the incremental costs associated with the transition of the South Carolina fulfillment center to Gap, Pennsylvania.
We are proud to share that our transition has gone extremely well. All 3 brands' direct-to-consumer businesses have been completely moved to our new facility, which is now up and running. The expenses related to the transition had come in better than expected and we believe only negative affected the second quarter gross profit margin by approximately 40 basis points, much less than we originally planned. We are still forecasting approximately 25 basis points of incremental expense in the third quarter related to the transition, but the overall expense and deleverage of the year is trending lower than what we had originally planned. A big congratulations and thank you is in order to our shared service teams for their hard work and extraordinary execution.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter increased by 8% to $214 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 29 basis points to 24.7%. This minor SG&A deleverage was partially due to increased marketing expenses, which were used to drive higher direct-to-consumer traffic.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 1% to $104 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 100 basis points to 12%. Net income for the quarter was $67 million or $0.52 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 6% to $384 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to new and noncomp stores as well as the Wholesale segment. Comparable Retail segment inventory decreased by 2% at cost while decreasing 7% in units. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply.
We ended the quarter with $339 million in cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, the company repurchased and retired 6.6 million common shares for approximately $236 million. We now have 15.2 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase shares.
On July 1, we entered into a 5-year, $400 million asset-backed revolving credit facility. This facility gives us additional flexibility to use more cash strategically when appropriate. We utilized $115 million of this line during the second quarter to fund some of the shares repurchase previously discussed.
As we look forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following.
We are planning to open approximately 32 new stores during the year. By brand, we are planning approximately 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America, 13 new Anthropologie stores globally including one new European store and 15 new Free People stores in North America.
Our gross margin rate for the third quarter could increase versus the prior year. This growth could be driven by meaningful improvement in the Urban Outfitters brands' maintained margin if their product performance and inventory management continues to progress favorably. The overall URBN rate improvement could occur while the Anthropologie and Free People brands maintain margins normalized down from their near-record setting performances from a year ago to rates more similar to where they landed for the second quarter this year.
With that said, please take note that thus far in August, for all brands, our direct-to-consumer business has posted strong gains consistent with the second quarter, while our store sales have started out slower than what we planned and where we finished the second quarter. There are many factors that could be impacting our store performance, and there is too little data at this time to draw any solid conclusions.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate for the year, with the third quarter growth rate looking fairly similar to what we recorded for the second quarter. This increase would be driven by the DTC investments relating to marketing and technology and selling support investments to support our new store growth.
As I noted earlier, the effects of foreign currency translation resulted in an approximately 165 basis point reduction to sales and approximately 30 basis point reduction in operating profit. If today's rates held constant and all else in the business held constant such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 3% for the full year fiscal 2016. This would be based on our current businesses in the Canadian and European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 remained planned at approximately $140 million to $150 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36%.
As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to our Free People brand Chief Operating Officer, Dave Hayne."

These results were driven by a strong Retail segment comp of 14% and continued robust growth of 21% from the Wholesale segment. This performance is even more exciting when viewed on a 2-year basis where second quarter revenue has grown by nearly 60% since fiscal 2014, certainly an achievement of which all of our teams can be proud.
Strong product is the lifeblood of our business, and our design and merchant teams have consistently delivered compelling assortments that have repeatedly brought our customers back to the brand. And this spring was no different, with many product wins to speak of. The customer continues to vote for our dress collection with our strategy of expanding into party dresses providing a very healthy boost to the business. Our intimates collection has outperformed expectations in all channels. And our own label shoe assortment saw significant gains in the quarter.  Our active wear line, FP Movement, continues to impress us in the direct-to-consumer channel, making us even more excited to launch Movement to the wholesale market this fall for spring delivery. Our teams look forward to developing these concepts further as well as exploring new category expansions in the future.
Moving to the Wholesale channel. The team closed July with their single strongest sales month ever and entered the back half with future bookings on pace with the current trend. Our department store partners had success across both their bricks and digital storefronts with particular strength coming from our expansion categories. In fact, our expansion categories drove over 1/3 of our total Wholesale growth in the quarter, with success across both our department store and specialty store partners.
Our 4-pronged domestic strategy has been working for us: one, invest in shop-in-shops in key department store doors; two, offer replenishment programs to key accounts; three, open expansion classes to existing accounts; and four, onboard new accounts to both our core collection and expansion categories.
This has provided a successful framework for developing our legacy domestic business, and we see room to continue this momentum.
Moving overseas. Our Wholesale team now supports over 300 global accounts with over 500 doors in 35 countries. Our relationship with IT in Hong Kong continues to grow with 3 new shops opened this spring. And a new department store relationship in Mexico offers new potential for the brand closer to home. We've seen particular strength in Europe where our London team has doubled their business by improving operational execution and developing domestic relationships such as our partnership with ASOS and our 2 new Paris shop-in-shops in Galeries Lafayette. Additionally, our existing London presence in Selfridges recently expanded to a 400 square foot shop-in-shop, and this location is already the most productive we have globally. The team has also partnered with new distributors in Spain, Italy and Germany, which helped to open 40 new specialty accounts in those countries in the quarter.
Alongside these Wholesale developments, our Retail team recently celebrated the opening of our first self-operated shop in London, a pop-up boutique in -- on King's Road, which will remain open into next year. Although only a small space, many of the operational complexities of opening stores in a new market have now been overcome by the team. And we're excited that the stage is now set for permanent stores in the U.K. and Europe in the years ahead. More definitively, we expect to open at least one permanent store in London in the first half of next year.
On the domestic front, our retail team drove record second quarter sales and successfully opened 3 new stores in the quarter following 4 new stores in Q1, bringing the current count to 108 total stores in North America. Additionally, later this fiscal year, we plan to open 9 new or relocated stores, which average approximately 3,700 selling square feet per store, the largest of which, a relocation in Denver's Cherry Creek mall, will total 5,300 selling square feet, over 3x larger than our current store in the center with plenty of room to support our successful category expansions such as intimates, shoes and movement in addition to our core collection and accessory assortments.
Not to be overlooked, we also completed a significant expansion of our Rockefeller Center store, more than doubling our selling space to nearly 6,500 selling square feet. This prominent store is now able to carry the widest assortment in our fleet including shoes, party dresses, movement and even a small home capsule. We couldn't be more pleased with the new store presentation, and initial reaction to the broader product assortment has been very encouraging.
Our larger format store initiative is now well underway, and we're eager to learn from and develop this critical area of the brand's future growth.
Moving online. Our direct-to-consumer business experienced very healthy growth in the quarter with our customer base increasing 37% alongside a nice bump in conversion rate. Our domestic growth outperformed the total growth as we experienced a noticeable slowdown in our international DTC growth rate, which we believe is primarily due to currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Despite these challenges, our localized U.K. and China online businesses generally outperformed other global markets, with China in particular showing nice acceleration against last year's growth rates. We believe this is just more proof to the importance of website localization.
As has already been mentioned, the wider URBN team successfully migrated our fulfillment operations to our new Pennsylvania facility. It's hard to overstate just how impressive this new building is in person, and it's also hard not to be impressed with just how flawlessly the transition went for all of our brands. On behalf of all of our brands, I'd like to congratulate all the shared service teams supporting the design, build and transition on a job very well done.
Meanwhile, the mobile migration we've been witnessing in the DTC channel has continued with mobile devices now accounting for over 55% of our visitors and nearly 30% of our sales. To better support our e-commerce future and better position ourselves for the new mobile era, the Free People team and our shared service partners have been hard at work building a future web platform for all of our brands. When our new platform launches in the back half of this year, we expect a faster shopping experience, improved functionality, broadened FP Me capabilities, more seamless mobile presentations and generally a more robust foundation from which to build the shopping and experiential platforms, which will be at the core of our brands and businesses for years to come.
I cannot talk about the core of who we are without also saying a word about the creative process. The Free People brand has been a success with customers because we endeavor to infuse creativity in everything we do, be it product design and imagery, catalog shoots, editorial content, store environments, marketing videos or local brand events. Whatever it be, the creative teams that touch these areas are truly the essence of who we are as a brand. And it's this sentiment that we aspire to leave fresh in our customer's mind with the hope that she recalls us favorably in the future.
Thank you very much for your time. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Dick Hayne."

Good afternoon, everyone. Amazing is the word that comes to mind when I hear the Free People story. 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit comp sales growth is a remarkable story and a tribute to the extraordinary performance of the Free People team. Congratulations to Meg, Dave, Sheila, Krissy and their teams. Given the many new initiatives including the international expansion and new product category introductions, I believe the brand has the opportunity to continue that growth. However, after many years of strong comp store increases, the Free People stores are operating at an extremely high level of productivity. So I believe that future top line growth for the Free People brand will likely come less from comp store sales increases and more from opening additional and larger stores and from expanding their other 2 channels of distribution.
Let me now discuss second quarter results at our other 2 brands. 
First, Urban Outfitters. Speaking on last year's Q4 conference call, Trish Donnelly said one of our biggest priorities is to reestablish positive sales momentum. I'm pleased to report the brand recorded a healthy 4% Retail segment comp with the North American group outperforming its European counterpart.
However, the 4% comp in Q2 only tells part of a very positive brand story. Importantly, the productivity gain was driven by a high single-digit increase in regular price sales. Year-over-year increases in both conversion and average transaction value drove the right price increase and demonstrate the willingness of the Urban customer to buy full price when we provide her with compelling product and exciting experience. As in the first quarter, 6 of Urban's 8 major product categories delivered positive regular price comps including the all-important women's apparel division.
One of the brand's most important achievements for the quarter was a 400-plus basis point improvement in the year-over-year markdown rate. Fewer markdowns more than offset a decrease in IMU and resulted in significant merchandise margin improvement for the brand. Urban's product deliveries throughout the second quarter and into the third continue to show additional IMU improvement. We believe this will positively impact merchandise margins in the second half of the year. In addition, ending inventory at the URBN brand on a weeks of supply basis was the leanest it's been in 3 years, thus providing opportunity for further markdown improvement in Q3.
On the same conference call, Trish also outlined initiatives around store productivity. During the first half of FY '16, the brand made good progress on these initiatives.
The first is category distortion. The brand team looked at sales by product category and compared them to the floor space allocated to each category. Next, the team planned additional space for emerging strong categories like beauty, intimates and dresses while rightsizing the space allocated to others. In July, the team tested a prototype store with a new floor set and a number of category shop-in-shops. Customer response has been very positive, so the Urban team is now in the process of reproducing this floor set across the store fleet.
In addition to better category distortion, the brand is working to increase selling space in existing stores by shrinking the back of house, hold less back-stock in stores, create a supply chain that requires less time to flow new product into our distribution channels and integrate more digital capabilities into the store experience. As an example of this last initiative, the brand tested the use of in-store beacon messaging for those customers using the Urban On app on their smartphones. 54% of the customers receiving those messages chose to interact with them, many times higher than the open rate of standard email messaging.  Furthermore, customers who chose to open the messages were 3x more likely to make a purchase than an average Urban brand shopper.
Most of these productivity initiatives are currently in the design and testing stage. If proven successful, they will be adopted across all stores. This new way of operating is an iterative process tied to our long-term strategic vision and not a 1-season project meant to drive immediate results.
Overall, I'm pleased with the considerable progress the Urban brand teams have made over the past 12 months in terms of improving the product, the brand position and the brand experience. Urban has reconnected with its core customer and is once again a fashion leader for young adults. I thank Ted, Trish, Meg and their teams for their own hard work throughout this process. I hope the results are as gratifying to them as they are to me, and I'm excited to see the progress the brand will make over the next 12 months.
Turning your attention now to the Anthropologie brand. Its second quarter performance was very close to what we expected it would be when we last spoke on our May conference call. The brand delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth, but due to some product misses, margins came in below the same quarter last year. Many categories delivered solid growth, but a few, notably dresses and accessories, were poorly executed, and those product misses negatively impacted the overall brand performance. David and his team's sharp focus on inventory management enabled them to mitigate the markdown pressure and maintain solid merchandise margins. Furthermore, the team made timely adjustments throughout the quarter, adding new styles and taking additional promotions as necessary to clear through slower-moving merchandise.
Overall, the brand finished the quarter in a healthy inventory position and generated an operating margin that, although not an Anthropologie record, would be the envy of most other apparel retailers. I believe the brand will continue to make adjustments to their assortments throughout the back half of the year. And I believe they are positioned to post healthy, but not record, margins over the next few quarters.
At this time last year, URBN unveiled its Vision 20|20 strategy at our Investor Day conference. For those who attended, you may recall our growth strategy was: expand the number of products our brands offer; grow all of our distribution channels across all geographies and allow them to accommodate a larger product assortment; and improve operational capabilities and become more efficient.
All of the URBN brands are working to execute this vision. I listed a number of examples of how the URBN brand is in the process of making improvements to its operational capabilities. In addition, Dave noted in his commentary how the Free People brand benefited greatly from launching new product categories.
Over the past year, the Anthropologie brand has had many strategic successes as well. The brand recognized the opportunity to build much larger businesses in categories adjacent to apparel and so invested in talent and infrastructure to expand the offering in a number of these, most notably home, beauty and shoes. Each has performed well.
In addition, the brand successfully integrated the BHLDN and Terrain concepts into the Anthropologie Group, and those concepts are now growing rapidly. Strong customer response to these Anthropologie product expansions as well as similar successful expansions at the Free People and Urban brands have increased our confidence in the longer-term strategy we presented last September.
Opening large format stores and redesigning existing stores to gain more selling space to house the expanding product is part of the strategy, so I'm pleased to report that the Anthropologie brand has now signed leases for 4 large format stores. The first 2 both scheduled to open in spring of 2016 will be expansions of the current stores in Portland, Oregon and Newport Beach, California. By next summer, the brands plan to open a new large format store in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California. This is a relocation of a much smaller store in a secondary location in that same market. The new Palo Alto store will feature expanded assortments of all the brand product categories plus a large beauty offering, a BHLDN and Terrain shop-in-shop and an Anthro café [ph]. 
Larger stores, each offering expanded product assortments, is one part of the strategy. But as we emphasized last September, our product expansion strategy is an important component in driving growth in all of our distribution channels. Indeed, product expansion has been instrumental in helping the direct-to-consumer and Wholesale channels achieve vigorous growth. In his commentary on Q2 sales, Dave credited the expansion classes for approximately 1/3 of the gains in Free People's Wholesale sales. In addition, we estimate that expanded product accounted for more than 40% of the powerful double-digit direct-to-consumer sales growth in the quarter.
So to summarize, we are making steady progress on implementing all 3 components of our strategic plan and have already seen many successes from our efforts to date. All brands have carefully but steadily offered larger, nonredundant product assortments across a number of categories and in several cases, have added entirely new categories. Without question, this has helped to drive our top line growth in the direct and Wholesale channels.
At the same time, we are launching initiatives to make very important operational improvements like better category distortion in stores, faster reaction to customer demand, more efficient use of store space and better integration of technology. More product and improved operations will allow us to continue to expand our distribution and meet our Vision 20|20 goals. We are in the early stages of implementation but have already tasted its benefits. We're excited by the opportunities it provides and the growth it envisions. I will update you on annual progress.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, since this will be Ted's final URBN conference call, I wanted to thank him publicly one more time for the extraordinary impact his leadership has had on the Urban brand over the past 15 years. Ted, I wish you and Sara the very best, and I thank you for your friendship and the many contributions you've made to the company.
Finally, in closing, I thank our 23,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

I agree with your sentiments about Ted. Yes, so far in August, all of the brands have shown a trend of strong comps on the direct channel, slightly weaker when we compare it to July on the store channel, and the Wholesale channel's ahead. Now there are a number of categories that are working and working nicely and I don't think is significantly different than the categories that we're working toward the end of the second quarter. And so it sort of begs the question as why would the stores be down and not the direct business. And the only things we can come up with and the factors are the calendar shift where the Labor Day holiday is a week later this year. It may have something to do with weather. Because it's so hot on the East and West Coast, maybe people are taking more time away and going on vacations, therefore shopping online rather than in stores. Yes, traffic continues to show slight declines from almost mid-single-digit declines from where it was the prior year, but that's not really a change from the July month. And then, of course, we always look at the potential it is product execution. That's a possibility, but if it were that, then we would expect the direct business to be down as well. So we're certainly not panicked about it. And we believe it is probably one of the first 2 factors that I mentioned, but we can't be sure at this time because it's only been 2 weeks. So I think you're going to have to wait until the 10-K is released in September, and we'll have much more clarity by then."

And this will also require our fulfillment center expenses, delivery and fulfillment center expenses, to continue to come in at or below our expectations as it relates to some incremental costs there, which we still will experience some in the third quarter as Free People Wholesale has not transitioned yet.

And you would be surprised that the number of times that a decision has to be made and the person who's supposed to make the decision is either out of the -- out of our offices, out of the country and maybe traveling for a few days, and that decision is -- one day can be a week off in production.

Now having said that, our way of thinking about expansion is in terms of expanded product categories, meaning larger footprint in stores, so the square footage of stores will grow, but the number of units may not. So we expect to either close and reopen, meaning relocate, or when a lease is up, replace it with another lease that would be larger and allow us to present these expanded categories.

Over the longer term, I think that, that story is a little yet to be told. Depending on the success of the larger format stores, that spread could change. As Anthropologie, for example, has 4 larger format stores on the horizon, if those perform well and we continue along with that strategy, which we're all certainly very confident of here, that could change the spread because although some of the stores will be replacing an existing store, it will still be net-net, like adding 2-plus stores. So that could change your gap between the total and the comp ratio. But I think we want to wait to see exactly how those stores perform and trend before we, I guess, change the longer-term algorithm, if that helps you."

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning our current quarter",1191,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 second quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning our current quarter.
Total company sales for the quarter increased by 7% to a second quarter record of $867 million. This sales increase was driven by a 4% Retail segment comp, a $15 million increase in noncomparable sales including the opening of 4 net new stores and 21% growth in Wholesale sales. Please note that currency translation negatively impacted our sales growth rate by approximately 165 basis points for the quarter.
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores, posting positive gains driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices.
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 14%, 4% and 2% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and the Anthropologie Group, respectively. This marks the third quarter in a row all brands have posted positive Retail segment comp sales growth, the 13th quarter Free People has posted double-digit comp gains and the 12th quarter in a row Anthropologie has posted positive comp sales gains.
Our URBN Retail segment comp was strongest in May followed by June and July, which came in fairly consistent with each other.
Free People Wholesale delivered another strong quarter as sales grew 21% to $72 million. These results came from double-digit sales growth at department stores, partially driven by the success of our category expansion, namely Intimately Free and Free People shoes.
Now moving back to total URBN results. Gross profit for the quarter was up 5% versus the prior comparable quarter to $318 million. Gross profit rate declined by 71 basis points to 36.7%. The decline in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher delivery and fulfillment center expenses. The deleverage in delivery and fulfillment center expenses was partially due to the increase in direct-to-consumer channel penetration to total sales as well as the incremental costs associated with the transition of the South Carolina fulfillment center to Gap, Pennsylvania.
We are proud to share that our transition has gone extremely well. All 3 brands' direct-to-consumer businesses have been completely moved to our new facility, which is now up and running. The expenses related to the transition had come in better than expected and we believe only negative affected the second quarter gross profit margin by approximately 40 basis points, much less than we originally planned. We are still forecasting approximately 25 basis points of incremental expense in the third quarter related to the transition, but the overall expense and deleverage of the year is trending lower than what we had originally planned. A big congratulations and thank you is in order to our shared service teams for their hard work and extraordinary execution.
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter increased by 8% to $214 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 29 basis points to 24.7%. This minor SG&A deleverage was partially due to increased marketing expenses, which were used to drive higher direct-to-consumer traffic.
Operating income for the quarter decreased by 1% to $104 million, with operating profit margin deleveraging by 100 basis points to 12%. Net income for the quarter was $67 million or $0.52 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory increased by 6% to $384 million. The growth in inventory was primarily related to new and noncomp stores as well as the Wholesale segment. Comparable Retail segment inventory decreased by 2% at cost while decreasing 7% in units. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply.
We ended the quarter with $339 million in cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, the company repurchased and retired 6.6 million common shares for approximately $236 million. We now have 15.2 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase shares.
On July 1, we entered into a 5-year, $400 million asset-backed revolving credit facility. This facility gives us additional flexibility to use more cash strategically when appropriate. We utilized $115 million of this line during the second quarter to fund some of the shares repurchase previously discussed.
As we look forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following.
We are planning to open approximately 32 new stores during the year. By brand, we are planning approximately 4 new Urban Outfitters stores in North America, 13 new Anthropologie stores globally including one new European store and 15 new Free People stores in North America.
Our gross margin rate for the third quarter could increase versus the prior year. This growth could be driven by meaningful improvement in the Urban Outfitters brands' maintained margin if their product performance and inventory management continues to progress favorably. The overall URBN rate improvement could occur while the Anthropologie and Free People brands maintain margins normalized down from their near-record setting performances from a year ago to rates more similar to where they landed for the second quarter this year.
With that said, please take note that thus far in August, for all brands, our direct-to-consumer business has posted strong gains consistent with the second quarter, while our store sales have started out slower than what we planned and where we finished the second quarter. There are many factors that could be impacting our store performance, and there is too little data at this time to draw any solid conclusions.
Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a high single-digit rate for the year, with the third quarter growth rate looking fairly similar to what we recorded for the second quarter. This increase would be driven by the DTC investments relating to marketing and technology and selling support investments to support our new store growth.
As I noted earlier, the effects of foreign currency translation resulted in an approximately 165 basis point reduction to sales and approximately 30 basis point reduction in operating profit. If today's rates held constant and all else in the business held constant such as shares outstanding and planned profit rates, we believe foreign currency translation could negatively affect our earnings per share by approximately 3% for the full year fiscal 2016. This would be based on our current businesses in the Canadian and European markets.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 remained planned at approximately $140 million to $150 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36%.
As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to our Free People brand Chief Operating Officer, Dave Hayne."

It's a pleasure to be speaking with you today. I'm excited to provide an update on the positive momentum at Free People in the second quarter.Last year on this call, we started off by discussing a record-s",1292,"Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you today. I'm excited to provide an update on the positive momentum at Free People in the second quarter.
Last year on this call, we started off by discussing a record-setting quarter, and I'm very pleased to do the same today. The Free People brand achieved a consolidated second quarter revenue record with a 20% top line increase over last year.
These results were driven by a strong Retail segment comp of 14% and continued robust growth of 21% from the Wholesale segment. This performance is even more exciting when viewed on a 2-year basis where second quarter revenue has grown by nearly 60% since fiscal 2014, certainly an achievement of which all of our teams can be proud.
Strong product is the lifeblood of our business, and our design and merchant teams have consistently delivered compelling assortments that have repeatedly brought our customers back to the brand. And this spring was no different, with many product wins to speak of. The customer continues to vote for our dress collection with our strategy of expanding into party dresses providing a very healthy boost to the business. Our intimates collection has outperformed expectations in all channels. And our own label shoe assortment saw significant gains in the quarter.  Our active wear line, FP Movement, continues to impress us in the direct-to-consumer channel, making us even more excited to launch Movement to the wholesale market this fall for spring delivery. Our teams look forward to developing these concepts further as well as exploring new category expansions in the future.
Moving to the Wholesale channel. The team closed July with their single strongest sales month ever and entered the back half with future bookings on pace with the current trend. Our department store partners had success across both their bricks and digital storefronts with particular strength coming from our expansion categories. In fact, our expansion categories drove over 1/3 of our total Wholesale growth in the quarter, with success across both our department store and specialty store partners.
Our 4-pronged domestic strategy has been working for us: one, invest in shop-in-shops in key department store doors; two, offer replenishment programs to key accounts; three, open expansion classes to existing accounts; and four, onboard new accounts to both our core collection and expansion categories.
This has provided a successful framework for developing our legacy domestic business, and we see room to continue this momentum.
Moving overseas. Our Wholesale team now supports over 300 global accounts with over 500 doors in 35 countries. Our relationship with IT in Hong Kong continues to grow with 3 new shops opened this spring. And a new department store relationship in Mexico offers new potential for the brand closer to home. We've seen particular strength in Europe where our London team has doubled their business by improving operational execution and developing domestic relationships such as our partnership with ASOS and our 2 new Paris shop-in-shops in Galeries Lafayette. Additionally, our existing London presence in Selfridges recently expanded to a 400 square foot shop-in-shop, and this location is already the most productive we have globally. The team has also partnered with new distributors in Spain, Italy and Germany, which helped to open 40 new specialty accounts in those countries in the quarter.
Alongside these Wholesale developments, our Retail team recently celebrated the opening of our first self-operated shop in London, a pop-up boutique in -- on King's Road, which will remain open into next year. Although only a small space, many of the operational complexities of opening stores in a new market have now been overcome by the team. And we're excited that the stage is now set for permanent stores in the U.K. and Europe in the years ahead. More definitively, we expect to open at least one permanent store in London in the first half of next year.
On the domestic front, our retail team drove record second quarter sales and successfully opened 3 new stores in the quarter following 4 new stores in Q1, bringing the current count to 108 total stores in North America. Additionally, later this fiscal year, we plan to open 9 new or relocated stores, which average approximately 3,700 selling square feet per store, the largest of which, a relocation in Denver's Cherry Creek mall, will total 5,300 selling square feet, over 3x larger than our current store in the center with plenty of room to support our successful category expansions such as intimates, shoes and movement in addition to our core collection and accessory assortments.
Not to be overlooked, we also completed a significant expansion of our Rockefeller Center store, more than doubling our selling space to nearly 6,500 selling square feet. This prominent store is now able to carry the widest assortment in our fleet including shoes, party dresses, movement and even a small home capsule. We couldn't be more pleased with the new store presentation, and initial reaction to the broader product assortment has been very encouraging.
Our larger format store initiative is now well underway, and we're eager to learn from and develop this critical area of the brand's future growth.
Moving online. Our direct-to-consumer business experienced very healthy growth in the quarter with our customer base increasing 37% alongside a nice bump in conversion rate. Our domestic growth outperformed the total growth as we experienced a noticeable slowdown in our international DTC growth rate, which we believe is primarily due to currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Despite these challenges, our localized U.K. and China online businesses generally outperformed other global markets, with China in particular showing nice acceleration against last year's growth rates. We believe this is just more proof to the importance of website localization.
As has already been mentioned, the wider URBN team successfully migrated our fulfillment operations to our new Pennsylvania facility. It's hard to overstate just how impressive this new building is in person, and it's also hard not to be impressed with just how flawlessly the transition went for all of our brands. On behalf of all of our brands, I'd like to congratulate all the shared service teams supporting the design, build and transition on a job very well done.
Meanwhile, the mobile migration we've been witnessing in the DTC channel has continued with mobile devices now accounting for over 55% of our visitors and nearly 30% of our sales. To better support our e-commerce future and better position ourselves for the new mobile era, the Free People team and our shared service partners have been hard at work building a future web platform for all of our brands. When our new platform launches in the back half of this year, we expect a faster shopping experience, improved functionality, broadened FP Me capabilities, more seamless mobile presentations and generally a more robust foundation from which to build the shopping and experiential platforms, which will be at the core of our brands and businesses for years to come.
I cannot talk about the core of who we are without also saying a word about the creative process. The Free People brand has been a success with customers because we endeavor to infuse creativity in everything we do, be it product design and imagery, catalog shoots, editorial content, store environments, marketing videos or local brand events. Whatever it be, the creative teams that touch these areas are truly the essence of who we are as a brand. And it's this sentiment that we aspire to leave fresh in our customer's mind with the hope that she recalls us favorably in the future.
Thank you very much for your time. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Dick Hayne."

Good afternoon, everyone. Amazing is the word that comes to mind when I hear the Free People story. 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit comp sales growth is a remarkable story and a tribute to the extraordinary performance of the Free People team. Congratulations to Meg, Dave, Sheila, Krissy and their teams. Given the many new initiatives including the international expansion and new product category introductions, I believe the brand has the opportunity to continue that growth. However, after many years of strong comp store increases, the Free People stores are operating at an extremely high level of productivity. So I believe that future top line growth for the Free People brand will likely come less from comp store sales increases and more from opening additional and larger stores and from expanding their other 2 channels of distribution.
Let me now discuss second quarter results at our other 2 brands. 
First, Urban Outfitters. Speaking on last year's Q4 conference call, Trish Donnelly said one of our biggest priorities is to reestablish positive sales momentum. I'm pleased to report the brand recorded a healthy 4% Retail segment comp with the North American group outperforming its European counterpart.
However, the 4% comp in Q2 only tells part of a very positive brand story. Importantly, the productivity gain was driven by a high single-digit increase in regular price sales. Year-over-year increases in both conversion and average transaction value drove the right price increase and demonstrate the willingness of the Urban customer to buy at full price when we provide her with compelling product and exciting experience. As in the first quarter, 6 of Urban's 8 major product categories delivered positive regular price comps including the all-important women's apparel division.
One of the brand's most important achievements for the quarter was a 400-plus basis point improvement in the year-over-year markdown rate. Fewer markdowns more than offset a decrease in IMU and resulted in significant merchandise margin improvement for the brand. Urban's product deliveries throughout the second quarter and into the third continue to show additional IMU improvement. We believe this will positively impact merchandise margins in the second half of the year. In addition, ending inventory at the URBN brand on a weeks of supply basis was the leanest it's been in 3 years, thus providing opportunity for further markdown improvement in Q3.
On the same conference call, Trish also outlined initiatives around store productivity. During the first half of FY '16, the brand made good progress on these initiatives.
The first is category distortion. The brand team looked at sales by product category and compared them to the floor space allocated to each category. Next, the team planned additional space for emerging strong categories like beauty, intimates and dresses while rightsizing the space allocated to others. In July, the team tested a prototype store with a new floor set and a number of category shop-in-shops. Customer response has been very positive, so the Urban team is now in the process of reproducing this floor set across the store fleet.
In addition to better category distortion, the brand is working to increase selling space in existing stores by shrinking the back of house, hold less back-stock in stores, create a supply chain that requires less time to flow new product into our distribution channels and integrate more digital capabilities into the store experience. As an example of this last initiative, the brand tested the use of in-store beacon messaging for those customers using the Urban On app on their smartphones. 54% of the customers receiving those messages chose to interact with them, many times higher than the open rate of standard email messaging.  Furthermore, customers who chose to open the messages were 3x more likely to make a purchase than an average Urban brand shopper.
Most of these productivity initiatives are currently in the design and testing stage. If proven successful, they will be adopted across all stores. This new way of operating is an iterative process tied to our long-term strategic vision and not a 1-season project meant to drive immediate results.
Overall, I'm pleased with the considerable progress the Urban brand teams have made over the past 12 months in terms of improving the product, the brand position and the brand experience. Urban has reconnected with its core customer and is once again a fashion leader for young adults. I thank Ted, Trish, Meg and their teams for their own hard work throughout this process. I hope the results are as gratifying to them as they are to me, and I'm excited to see the progress the brand will make over the next 12 months.
Turning your attention now to the Anthropologie brand. Its second quarter performance was very close to what we expected it would be when we last spoke on our May conference call. The brand delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth, but due to some product misses, margins came in below the same quarter last year. Many categories delivered solid growth, but a few, notably dresses and accessories, were poorly executed, and those product misses negatively impacted the overall brand performance. David and his team's sharp focus on inventory management enabled them to mitigate the markdown pressure and maintain solid merchandise margins. Furthermore, the team made timely adjustments throughout the quarter, adding new styles and taking additional promotions as necessary to clear through slower-moving merchandise.
Overall, the brand finished the quarter in a healthy inventory position and generated an operating margin that, although not an Anthropologie record, would be the envy of most other apparel retailers. I believe the brand will continue to make adjustments to their assortments throughout the back half of the year. And I believe they are positioned to post healthy, but not record, margins over the next few quarters.
At this time last year, URBN unveiled its Vision 20|20 strategy at our Investor Day conference. For those who attended, you may recall our growth strategy was: expand the number of products our brands offer; grow all of our distribution channels across all geographies and allow them to accommodate a larger product assortment; and improve operational capabilities and become more efficient.
All of the URBN brands are working to execute this vision. I listed a number of examples of how the URBN brand is in the process of making improvements to its operational capabilities. In addition, Dave noted in his commentary how the Free People brand benefited greatly from launching new product categories.
Over the past year, the Anthropologie brand has had many strategic successes as well. The brand recognized the opportunity to build much larger businesses in categories adjacent to apparel and so invested in talent and infrastructure to expand the offering in a number of these, most notably home, beauty and shoes. Each has performed well.
In addition, the brand successfully integrated the BHLDN and Terrain concepts into the Anthropologie Group, and those concepts are now growing rapidly. Strong customer response to these Anthropologie product expansions as well as similar successful expansions at the Free People and Urban brands have increased our confidence in the longer-term strategy we presented last September.
Opening large format stores and redesigning existing stores to gain more selling space to house the expanding product is part of the strategy, so I'm pleased to report that the Anthropologie brand has now signed leases for 4 large format stores. The first 2 both scheduled to open in spring of 2016 will be expansions of the current stores in Portland, Oregon and Newport Beach, California. By next summer, the brands plan to open a new large format store in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California. This is a relocation of a much smaller store in a secondary location in that same market. The new Palo Alto store will feature expanded assortments of all the brand product categories plus a large beauty offering, a BHLDN and Terrain shop-in-shop and an Anthro café [ph]. 
Larger stores, each offering expanded product assortments, is one part of the strategy. But as we emphasized last September, our product expansion strategy is an important component in driving growth in all of our distribution channels. Indeed, product expansion has been instrumental in helping the direct-to-consumer and Wholesale channels achieve vigorous growth. In his commentary on Q2 sales, Dave credited the expansion classes for approximately 1/3 of the gains in Free People's Wholesale sales. In addition, we estimate that expanded product accounted for more than 40% of the powerful double-digit direct-to-consumer sales growth in the quarter.
So to summarize, we are making steady progress on implementing all 3 components of our strategic plan and have already seen many successes from our efforts to date. All brands have carefully but steadily offered larger, nonredundant product assortments across a number of categories and in several cases, have added entirely new categories. Without question, this has helped to drive our top line growth in the direct and Wholesale channels.
At the same time, we are launching initiatives to make very important operational improvements like better category distortion in stores, faster reaction to customer demand, more efficient use of store space and better integration of technology. More product and improved operations will allow us to continue to expand our distribution and meet our Vision 20|20 goals. We are in the early stages of implementation but have already tasted its benefits. We're excited by the opportunities it provides and the growth it envisions. I will update you on annual progress.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, since this will be Ted's final URBN conference call, I wanted to thank him publicly one more time for the extraordinary impact his leadership has had on the Urban brand over the past 15 years. Ted, I wish you and Sara the very best, and I thank you for your friendship and the many contributions you've made to the company.
Finally, in closing, I thank our 23,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

That being said, the balance of this year, we expect to be very similar to what we saw in Qs 1 and Qs 2 in terms of having some strength, some broad strength in many categories, but we'll continue to watch, particularly in apparel, the trend and the change in the seasons running through. And also, we're going to be watching our accessories business, as we talked about in Q2.

I agree with your sentiments about Ted. Yes, so far in August, all of the brands have shown a trend of strong comps on the direct channel, slightly weaker when we compare it to July on the store channel, and the Wholesale channel's ahead. Now there are a number of categories that are working and working nicely and I don't think its significantly different than the categories that were working toward the end of the second quarter. And so it sort of begs the question as why would the stores be down and not the direct business. And the only things we can come up with and the factors are the calendar shift where the Labor Day holiday is a week later this year. It may have something to do with weather. Because it's so hot on the East and West Coast, maybe people are taking more time away and going on vacations, therefore shopping online rather than in stores. Yes, traffic continues to show slight declines from almost mid-single-digit declines from where it was the prior year, but that's not really a change from the July month. And then, of course, we always look at the potential it is product execution. That's a possibility, but if it were that, then we would expect the direct business to be down as well. So we're certainly not panicked about it. And we believe it is probably one of the first 2 factors that I mentioned, but we can't be sure at this time because it's only been 2 weeks. So I think you're going to have to wait until the 10-K is released in September, and we'll have much more clarity by then."

This will require URBN to continue to make progress in their maintained margins as they have to date with the significant improvement in markdowns and show improvement in their IMU as well. This will take into account and require Anthropologie and Free People to maintain their more normalized margins similar to where they landed in the second quarter. And this will also require our fulfillment center expenses, delivery and fulfillment center expenses, to continue to come in at or below our expectations as it relates to some incremental costs there, which we still will experience some in the third quarter as Free People Wholesale has not transitioned yet. All 3 direct-to-consumer businesses have successfully transitioned, but Wholesale transitions in the third quarter. So we believe we have opportunity in both the third and the fourth quarter.

And we believe if things -- trends continue, that the third quarter will come in fairly consistent with where we landed for the second quarter. The drivers for the gross profit margin opportunity in the third and the fourth quarter are, as we discussed, the usual suspects. So the Urban brand will need to continue to deliver their maintained margin improvement. They've driven significant improvement, as Dick mentioned in his prepared remarks, over 400 basis point improvement in markdown on a year-over-year basis. And they will need to continue that as well as show IMU improvement in the back half of the year. Both the Urban -- excuse me, but the Anthropologie and the Free People brands will need to basically maintain their more normalized rates where they landed in the second quarter, and then net-net, we'll be looking at a benefit to overall URBN. And the last piece there is obviously the DTC transition that needs to come in at about the 25 basis points of deleverage that we're planning for in the third quarter. All of those summarized up, we do believe that we can. We have the opportunity to show margin improvement in the third quarter and then hopefully continuing going forward."

Yes, I think we have opportunity to bringing product to market much faster than we do today. How are we going to do that?

And you would be surprised that the number of times that a decision has to be made and the person who's supposed to make the decision is either out of the -- out of our offices, out of the country and maybe traveling for a few days, and that decision is -- one day can be a week off in production. So it's that. And then finally, we are trying to accelerate the production by near sourcing, more production capabilities in the Americas. And so when we combine all those things together, I'm convinced that we can take anywhere from 6 to 8 weeks off of our normal turnaround time."

And we believe that there are certainly that many stores available to open around the world, meaning Europe and Asia. We're in the very, very early stages of that development, but we do believe that we have the opportunity to do that. Now having said that, our way of thinking about expansion is in terms of expanded product categories, meaning larger footprint in stores, so the square footage of stores will grow, but the number of units may not. So we expect to either close and reopen, meaning relocate, or when a lease is up, replace it with another lease that would be larger and allow us to present these expanded categories. That way, we can continue our growth in the retail store segment. The beauty of that strategy is that, of course, is that product expansion that is driving the direct-to-consumer and in the Free People case, Wholesale channels of distribution. So we win in each channel."

Over the longer term, I think that, that story is a little yet to be told. Depending on the success of the larger format stores, that spread could change. As Anthropologie, for example, has 4 larger format stores on the horizon, if those perform well and we continue along with that strategy, which we're all certainly very confident of here, that could change the spread because although some of the stores will be replacing an existing store, it will still be net-net, like adding 2-plus stores. So that could change your gap between the total and the comp ratio. But I think we want to wait to see exactly how those stores perform and trend before we, I guess, change the longer-term algorithm, if that helps you."

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning the fourth quarter.",1150,"Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning the fourth quarter. Total company for URBN sales for the quarter increased by 1% to a third quarter record of $825 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a $9 million increase in non-comp sales, including the opening of 10 net new stores, which more than offset a 5% decline in wholesale sales. Additionally, please note that our sales growth was negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points of currency translation. 
Our Wholesale segment sales were negatively affected by transition delays at our new distribution facility in Gap, Pennsylvania. These delays resulted in approximately $9 million of third quarter shipments being delayed into the fourth quarter. Had we been able to fulfill these orders during the third quarter, our wholesale sales growth would have been approximately 9%. As we enter into the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong demand in both department and specialty stores. And based on several measures put into place, we do not anticipate further sales method due to delayed shipments. 
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continues to outperform stores, posting double-digit sales increases driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices. The negative transaction could have been affected by traffic, which was down in our comp store during the quarter, although we did benefit from an increase conversion rate. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 3% and 1% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, while the Anthropologie Group was flat for the quarter. Our Retail segment comp was positive in September, flat in August and negative in October. When thinking about the months in the quarter, please keep in mind that the Labor Day holiday weekend shifted from August last year to September this year, so if you were to look at the month combined to try and account for the holiday shift, the net result of the 2 months together was a positive Retail segment comp for the period. 
Total URBN gross profit for the fourth quarter was up 2% [ph] versus the prior comparable quarter to $288 million. Gross profit rate improved by 11 basis points to 34.9%. The improvement in gross profit rate was driven by almost 150 basis points of improvement in URBN mainstream margins due to significant improvement in the Urban Outfitters brand markdown rate, which was partially offset by lower maintaining margins at the Anthropologie and Free People Retail segment. 
URBN maintained margin improvement was partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of deleverage in delivery and fulfillment center expenses, primarily related to the ongoing Gap, Pennsylvania fulfillment center transition and the increase penetration of direct-to-consumer sales. Approximately half of the deleverage and delivery in fulfillment center expenses previously noted related to the transition of the South Carolina fulfillment center to Gap, Pennsylvania. After the direct-to-consumer transition to the new facility in the second quarter went well, this deleverage in the third quarter, which was primarily related to the Wholesale segment transition, was more than we originally anticipated. We believe this deleverage will continue into the fourth quarter. Additionally, we estimated a currency translation negatively affected our gross profit rate by just under 50 basis points in the quarter. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up less than 1% to $208 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged by 23 basis points to 25.2%. This SG&A leverage was primarily due to lower incentive-based and share-based compensation expense as well as currency translation benefits, which were partially offset by an increase in technology-related expenses used to support our direct-to-consumer channel investment. 
Operating income for the quarter increased by 5% to $80 million, with operating profit margin leveraging by 34 basis points to 9.7%. Net income for the quarter was $52 million or $0.42 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 5% to $442 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 9% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory and cost, partially offset by increases in wholesale inventory and non-comparable store inventory. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply. 
We ended the quarter with $273 million in cash and marketable securities. During the third quarter, the company repurchased and retired 3.6 million common shares for approximately $112 million. We have 11.6 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.7 million common shares for approximately $366 million. 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: First, I wanted to briefly comment on our current quarter-to-date sales trend. As noted above, October was the weakest sales comp in the third quarter and this negative trend has worsened into the first half of November. As of quarter-to-date, this negative trend is consistent across each of our brands and most prevalent in stores. We are planning to open approximately 8 stores during the fourth quarter, totaling 28 net new stores for the year. For the fourth quarter by brand, we are planning approximately 6 new Anthropologie stores globally, including 1 new European store and 2 new Free People stores in North America. 
URBN's gross margin rate for the fourth quarter could decrease versus the prior year. This decrease could be driven by deleverage related to our fulfillment center transition, store occupancy deleverage related to negative store comps and lower maintained margin at the Anthropologie, Free People brand. This deleverage could also be driven by the current negative sales growth rate. This deleverage could occur despite year-over-year improvement in the Urban Outfitters brand maintained margin due to continued progress in regular price sales and overall lower levels of market sales. Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit range for the fourth quarter. This increase would be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 remain planned [ph] at approximately $145 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfill misinterprets. 
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Trish Donnelly, President of the Urban Outfitters brand in North America."

We are incredibly proud of the progress the UO brand has made this past quarter. The team's focus on assortment planning and allocation on creating compelling products, on delivering unique shopping environments and improved 4-wall [ph] productivity and on communicating our brand messaging through creative imagery and social engagement has given us solid quarterly results and a successful and stable foundation from which to continue to build. 
Starting with assortment planning and allocation. The team's laser focus and discipline around inventory control and management has resulted in significantly improved markdown rates and historically fast inventory return. The collaboration between planners and merchants has been exemplary. The teams work together to edit redundant styles and offerings, while funding and merging businesses based on current trends. This balanced and focus has resulted in positive great price comps in both retail and direct, and the businesses into which we've intentionally distorted are seeing very exciting double-digit full price comp results. 
We came into this year knowing we had a lot of work to do around IMU although it is still a work in progress with great focus, discipline and collaborative efforts with Barbara Roses, our Chief Sourcing Officer and her team, we are proud to report our IMU for the quarter showed nice improvement versus last year. Our design and merchant teams have worked closely with Barb's group on increasing our internal design penetration, which has also proven beneficial to improved IMU. In addition, the design team is executing more in-house strength, which allow us to get samples right the first time, resulting in faster production turnaround and speed to stores. 
The last time we spoke, I talked about our focus on driving 4-wall productivity and the initiation of a detailed review of all store floorplans to assign appropriate square footage by product category. We are well into this complex project, and although it is still a work in progress, we've seen some excellent results in large format stores, specifically Herald Square as well as our mall protostore in King of Prussia. We are taking our learnings here and continue to roll out what's working through the rest of the stores. Most recently, a successful example of this has been in our dresses and beauty category with a margin contribution within our 4 walls that's dictated greater square footage need, we are distorting these areas accordingly on each store's footprint. As a company, we recognize the importance of this exercise in making our stores as productive as possible. 
Now turning to product. Last year, May King, Chief Creative Officer for URBN, initiated a trend-to-concept process for the UO brand. By promoting strong, creative talent already within the brands and hiring outside talent where we needed additional support and expertise for process resulted in an effective framework, which gave clear focus to the design team and to the actual product assortment. We are now able to cover a broad number of sensibilities and uses that still evoke a strong UO branding statement. We have now increased our attention to the men's division, where we know we've got tremendous opportunity to please our core customer. We will build upon successes we're seeing and extend product categories where we see growth and opportunity. 
In addition to the initiative in progress already noted, we are still incredibly committed to delivering unique and exciting store environments for our core customers. As in the past, our display artists in the field continue to build compelling art layers and fixturing to the store, in which highlight product. We saw great results with these fixture build, which has helped define our floor set and shop-in-shop, making it easier and more appealing for customers to shop each defined area. Successful examples of this include our back-to-school and fall shops in dresses, beauty, intimate and music and photography. These categories saw some of our highest comp growth rates for the quarter. Even though our 4-wall focus is on efficiency and return on invested square footage, we haven't lost sight of the importance of divisional display and creativity that is unique to each individual UO store. In celebration of our artist we posted images on #UOdisplay on Instagram and given thousands of instances in which the hashtag's been used and the thousands of likes we're seeing when we rebrand via our local and national account. Our customers have a clear appreciation of the creative talent of the UO display team. 
In addition to the unique, special merchandising within our 4-wall, we are also highly focused on the direct channel and saw year-over-year increases in conversion across all of our experiences: Desktop, tablet, mobile web and our UO app. As the majority of our direct customers experience our brand through mobile, we activated our Beacon program in all stores this past quarter. Engagement here is growing, with 65% of customers receiving Beacon messages choosing to interact. 
Also in the quarter, we launched scan and shop in the UO app, allowing customers to shop for styles in our address book simply by holding their phone up to the catalog page while in store. In addition, with music being so important to our core customer, we've launched UO Music within the app featuring our favorite playlist and our UO mixed tape. And in our Herald Square store, to enhance and add to a more experienced shopping experience, we've opened our first UO Café, which is fast becoming a popular breakfast, lunch and dinner spot. 
From a brand marketing standpoint, our web imagery continues to drive and support the impressive direct-to-consumer comp increase we saw in Q3. as this imagery has resonated with customers on our website and our app and in our digital marketing general, we began using imagery in stores to support our product initiatives, shop-in-shop and the stores in category. This omni-channel visual approach led by Sue Otto, our Chief Creative Officer, helps bring the online and off-line shopping experience and send a consistent cross-channel messaging. Sue and her team has made it clearer for the customer to see what we're standing for and what we're excited about for the season, with a more singular cross-channel brand marketing point of view. Given the excitement around our brand imagery, we are also exploring printed piece opportunities, specifically our recent holiday dress book and our man's journal, which launched at the end of Q3. We will continue to explore this direct mail journals and concept as we move into spring. 
Our social media team continues to drive engagement throughout the quarter, with particularly strong increases in Instagram and Pinterest, up 76% and 52%, respectively, over last year. Our Instagram fallowing of almost 4 million users, which highly interactive this past quarter, with our post averaging close to 100,000 likes. Particularly exciting is that we saw engagement active level across all categories: Women, men's, apartments, music, electronic, beauty and instrument. Some of our newer, more successful social campaign this past quarter included #UOoncampus, our all-store listening event previewing Lana del Ray's newest album, which became the #1 trending topic in the U.S. during the hashtag launch; our marketing campaigns around product collaborations with Calvin Klein, Fila and Adidas; and our Dreamers and Doers event in stores, which celebrate artists in the local market by providing a space within our stores and marketing per floor to show their work. Because our customers are very interested and highly engaged in these types of social interaction, we'll continue to build on this opportunity and we're excited about our future initiative. 
In Q3, we experienced double-digit growth in our active customer count with increase in new customers and retain customers as well as customers coming back. While we've made notable progress over the last year in the areas of inventory management, product offering, 4-wall productivity and brand marketing, we continue to see significant growth and efficiency opportunities within the business. We still have a lot of work to do. I'd like to sincerely thank the Urban Outfitters team for the quarterly results, you appreciate your time on the call today. Thank you."

Before I turn your attention to the other brands, let me say a few words about the macro climate in which we currently operate. The fall season has been disappointing from a traffic with sales perspective. Combined North American store traffic for the quarter versus the same period last year was down 6% while conversion was up 12 basis points. Meanwhile, combined North American direct traffic [indiscernible]  sessions grew by 4% and conversion was up 20 basis points. However, even though direct sessions were up on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the rate of increase dropped [ph] from Q2. The effect of this drop in traffic has been uneven across the categories we operate. In general, sales of apparel and accessories have been slower, while intimates, shoes and beauty have been more robust. I believe our customers' current lack of enthusiasm for the apparel and accessories categories is primarily due to a lack of fashion units. We currently have a number of new fashion bright spots in our apparel offering, but whether or not these trends become more mainstream is uncertain. Having been in this situation before, my experience tells me the best course of action is to keep inventory's lead, continue to experiment and know that new trends will emerge soon. 
Now I'll address the other brands, beginning with Anthropologie. For Anthro, Q3 was very similar to Q2. A number of important classes like sweaters and dresses offered assortment less [indiscernible] than prior year period and those classes depressed the overall sales gains. [ph] The team continues to make adjustments in assortment and operating additional promotions where necessary to move slower selling inventively. Effective inventory management has helped to mitigate the marked value pressure, and as of October 31, apparel inventory this year has stood 4% below last year on a comparable basis. 
Even though some assortments were off the mark, the Anthropologie Group also produced a number of successes. Categories in businesses such as home, beauty, shoes, BHLDN and [indiscernible] all delivered very strong quarter-over-quarter sales. For example, online sales of phone product in the quarter were exceptionally strong. They were driven by expanded and compelling product along with the mailing or home-only journals. The Anthro customer also responded positively to the new beauty offering. After strong results for this product online and then several stores, the brand recently completed a roll out of beauty shops within 70 [ph] existing stores. Early results are very encouraging and speak to a much larger percentage of the beauty in the brand. These and other product expansion categories helped to drive double-digit increases in Anthropologie's direct-to-consumer sales in the quarter. The growth of online sessions and increased traffic coming from the site via natural search suggest that Anthropologie's customer base remains very powerful. The success of the expansion categories online has also increased our excitement about launching larger format stores that can offer more expanded product. Four [ph] larger stores are scheduled to open in FY '17. 
Anthropologie was not alone with the success it achieved by offering expanding categories. Free People has benefited as well. Recently, Free People opened 2 new larger format stores, 1 each in Denver and Dallas. Each was a new location from an existing store within the same mall, and each more than doubled the selling space previously available. The additional space in [indiscernible] the brands offer wider selections from the Free People expansion categories, including large branded footwear at [indiscernible] in both locations. Denver featured an area that [indiscernible] leading large movement active wear. In Dallas, customers [indiscernible] holiday party dresses. All these newer products complemented the established ready to wear and [indiscernible] great offerings. I am pleased to report that those stores and sales is significantly greater than the opening day plan, and the Denver store easily [indiscernible] industry Free People opening day sales record despite stiff competition from its sister store in Dallas. Both stores have continued to produce strong [ph] sales, so the customer clearly likes the larger offering, and thus, the brand has continued to open more stores of this type going forward. 
Three months ago in our investor call, I suggested it will be difficult to maintain, let alone improve, the extremely high levels of productivity that Free People brand achieved in their existing retail stores. My concern proved to be correct. On-store productivity declined in Q3 versus the prior year period. The seasonal classics like sweaters, jacket and cold weather accessories failed to beat the comparable sales. We have now realigned our expectations for future comp store sales growth. We believe that future store sales increases at Free People brand will come mostly from square footage growth. As with Anthropologie, Free People's success with expansion categories, most of which aren't available in the smaller format stores, will continue to drive double-digit sales increases online. This was achieved despite softness in international sales during the quarter due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. The brand did, however, manage to report better online sales from U.K. and China because of more aggressive markets. 
Before I discuss the wholesale channel performance, I want to comment on our new Gap performance issues that Frank referred to in his earlier commentary. After a relatively painless transition to the Gap facility for our DTC channel in late [ph] summer, the wholesale inventory has moved into the Gap center in September. [ph] This turned out to be a bigger job than expected, and resulted in the delay in selling wholesale orders in late September and early October. Consequently, wholesale order performance in October, one of the peak wholesale shipping months, was more back-end loaded than normal. The compressed order flow has more than reduced our [indiscernible] Processing volume combined with system problems and insufficient staff training resulted in some October wholesale orders being shipped in the first few days of November. Today, we believe the software and hardware problems have been largely fixed. We've hired additional staff and have implemented a more rigorous training program. Virtually all of the products are now being shipped within 24 to 48 hours from our fulfillment centers on both the East and West coast, and wholesale shipments were up-to-date from both our Trenton and Gap facilities. Based on the corrective measures we've taken over the past month, I believe we're positioned to take all of our orders on a timely basis in the fourth quarter. 
As for the performance of the wholesale channel in Q3, had it not been for the transition issues, I believe that division will likely have posted double-digit sales increases. Furthermore, based on orders in house, I believe it will return to a double-digit sales increase in Q4. 
Now that we've discussed this morning's announcement. For several years, we've been talking about expanding categories in order for [indiscernible] our customers more and capture more of their spend. We have consistently repeated with new categories and new products or services as long as they fit within the lifestyle of the customer. In recent years, casual dining has been one of the fastest-growing category and our involvement in the food service business to our successful cafes in 2 [ph] premium locations, and in the Urban Outfitters location on Herald Square, has [indiscernible] us the potential synergies that can exist between retail and food operations. This morning, we've announced an agreement to acquire substantially all of the Vetri Family group of restaurants, which includes the award-winning Pizzeria Vetri. Most recently in Food & Wine magazine named Pizzeria Vetri the best pizza restaurant in America. With casual dining growing rapidly and pizza is one of the most popular foods in the country, we believe there's tremendous opportunity to expand the Pizzeria Vetri concept. We feel fortunate to have Marc Vetri, a genius award-winning chef, and his business partner Jeff Benjamin and their talented teams working in partnership with the URBN development and shared service teams to realize this growth opportunity. Currently, the Vetri group operates 2 pizzeria restaurants in Philadelphia and is scheduled to open 3 more during the next 12 months. We believe future [indiscernible] stand-alone restaurants as part of a larger retail complex. The bigger traction of this concept will be the ones that fits appeal, very young to very old. Everyone loves great pizza. 
Last week, the Urban brand launched its newest Space 2420 project across the University of Texas campus. This project include an expanded Urban Outfitters store and separate food and beverage concepts that include Pizzeria Vetri and micro [indiscernible] The store and the restaurants are [indiscernible] in an open air courtyard that offers restaurant sitting and space for special events and concerts. So in addition to a large Urban store, we've assembled award-winning pizza and burgers serving beer and other beverages and operating live music, and this is all directly across the street from 50,000 [ph] plus UT students. We believe the project has a high probability of acceptance. 
The Vetri pizza concept is not limited, however, to pairing only with Urban brand. In early 2017, we plan to open a project in Devon, Pennsylvania, which is a high-end suburb at Philadelphia. This project will include a larger format Anthropologie store, a terrain garden center and outdoors store, a glass House Café, a Pizzeria Vetri, and one of Vetri group's highly-rated restaurants. We're excited to add food service to our brand portfolio and believe the Vetri Family group of restaurants complements our brand license. Having known Mark for many years and having worked with him in our numerous projects, I know our organizations and culture fit together easily. Mark and Jeff have partnered with [indiscernible] our Chief Development Officer, who currently runs our URBN food and beverage division, in leading this exciting opportunity for our company. 
Finally, a special thanks to all the home office folks who volunteered to help work in the new fulfillment center at the end of October and, of course, I think all of our 23,000 [ph] associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I recognize [indiscernible] our many partners around the world and also our shareholders for their continued support. That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

As you say, beyond the weather, of course, weather is always a factor. And we have had significant decreases in some of our weather-related classes. But as you know, having been associated with the Urban brand for many, many years now, we never ever blame the weather for anything. So I want discount that. We have seen lower traffic, as I said in my prepared remarks if you could hear them. We've had lower traffic throughout the quarter, and that traffic got a little bit worse in October. I think that from our analysis, the primary things driving that is lack of newness and fashion. I think the current fashion looks is getting a little long in the tooth and I wouldn't be surprised that we start to see some times a bit changing a little bit more radical than it had, let's say, over the last 4 or 5 years. We do think that we do see a number of areas in our business that we're excited about with the new fashion. But those -- it's pretty early to start saying that it's a trend because there are items here, there are items there. But what we have seen outside of the apparel and accessory areas, and why I don't believe that it is the lack of traffic is, let's say, a precursor of a recessionary environment, is we're seeing real strength in a number of our categories. I mentioned the home category in Anthropologie, which has been really off the charts. So Lane had done a great job of providing more products. And with the journals that they've issued, I think the customers responded very well to that. Across most or all 3 of the concepts, we've seen intimates and we've seen beauty respond very well. So there are a number of categories that are doing very well, and so I don't think customer is without money. I think she is without fashion newness."

So yes, the third quarter benefit is from, first and foremost, strong control of the brand related to variable spending, specifically direct store controllable. The comps there were negative, the brand managed the payroll appropriately. Secondly, there was a benefit in the quarter due to lower incentive base as well as a share-based compensation. The company is no longer on pace to hit it where we'd originally hope to land for the year, that there were some appropriate reversals there. That is why you see the growth rate come back up a bit into the fourth quarter, although we had originally were planning for the fourth quarter to be in the high single-digit range. Right now, we have revised that down into the mid-single-digit range. Again, that spend will be focused primarily on technology and marketing initiatives to continue to support the growth that we're -- continuing to see in the direct-to-consumer channel.

Sorry, about that. I think that one of the things that the Urban brand has a lot of success with this quarter was putting the right penetration of the product into the store and rearranging the stores so that it is grouped around product categories as opposed to product categories being hashed throughout the store. So that has helped us a lot. When you think about and say, what is the right penetration of these various product categories, the answer is the right penetration is what the customer deems it to be. Our job is to figure out what the customer wants and what is the percentage of a certain product category that she wants and then you give it to her. So I don't think there's any necessary long-term effect on gross margin because I believe, as I said before, when the fashion changes or as the fashion changes, I was fully expect apparel and accessories to come back, and whatever margins it has, it will half. [ph] Meanwhile, the other categories may carry higher or lower margin. So I don't think there's any particular long-term effect of margin on these other categories.  And I will say the 1 exception to that is probably the home area. And home traditionally has a lower initial margin, but oddly enough, it usually has a very similar maintain margin because the markdowns are typically much less. So that should really have much effect on gross margins. Thank you."

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning the fourth quarter. 
Total company or URBN sales for the quarter increased by 1% to a third quarter record of $825 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a $9 million increase in non-comp sales, including the opening of 10 net new stores, which more than offset a 5% decline in wholesale sales. Additionally, please note that our sales growth was negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points of currency translation. 
Our Wholesale segment sales were negatively affected by transition delays at our new distribution facility in Gap, Pennsylvania. These delays resulted in approximately $9 million of third quarter shipments being delayed into the fourth quarter. Had we been able to fulfill these orders during the third quarter, our wholesale sales growth would have been approximately 9%. As we enter into the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong demand in both department and specialty stores and based on several measures put into place, we do not anticipate further sales method due to delayed shipments. 
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continues to outperform stores, posting double-digit sales increases driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices. The negative transaction could have been affected by traffic, which was down in our comp store during the quarter, although we did benefit from an increase in conversion rate. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 3% and 1% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, while the Anthropologie Group was flat for the quarter. Our Retail segment comp was positive in September, flat in August and negative in October. When thinking about the months in the quarter, please keep in mind that the Labor Day holiday weekend shifted from August last year to September this year, so if you were to look at the month combined to try and account for the holiday shift, the net result of the 2 months together was a positive Retail segment comp for the period. 
Total URBN gross profit for the fourth quarter was up 2% versus the prior comparable quarter to $288 million. Gross profit rate improved by 11 basis points to 34.9%. The improvement in gross profit rate was driven by almost 150 basis points of improvement in URBN maintained margins due to significant improvement in the Urban Outfitters brand markdown rate, which was partially offset by lower maintained margins at the Anthropologie and Free People Retail segment. 
URBN maintained margin improvement was partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of deleverage in delivery and fulfillment center expenses, primarily related to the ongoing Gap, PA fulfillment center transition and the increase penetration of direct-to-consumer sales.
Approximately half of the deleverage and delivery in fulfillment center expenses previously noted, related to the transition of the South Carolina fulfillment center to Gap, Pennsylvania. After the direct-to-consumer transition to the new facility in the second quarter went well, this deleverage in the third quarter, which was primarily related to the Wholesale segment transition, was more than we had originally anticipated. We believe this deleverage will continue into the fourth quarter. Additionally, we estimated that currency translation negatively affected our gross profit rate by just under 50 basis points in the quarter. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up less than 1% to $208 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged by 23 basis points to 25.2%. This SG&A leverage was primarily due to lower incentive-based and share-based compensation expense as well as currency translation benefits, which were partially offset by an increase in technology-related expenses used to support our direct-to-consumer channel investments. 
Operating income for the quarter increased by 5% to $80 million, with operating profit margin leveraging by 34 basis points to 9.7%. Net income for the quarter was $52 million or $0.42 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 5% to $442 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 9% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost, partially offset by increases in wholesale inventory and non-comparable store inventory. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply. 
We ended the quarter with $273 million in cash and marketable securities. During the third quarter, the company repurchased and retired 3.6 million common shares for approximately $112 million. We have 11.6 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.7 million common shares for approximately $366 million. 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: First, I wanted to briefly comment on our current quarter-to-date sales trend. As noted above, October was the weakest sales comp in the third quarter and this negative trend has worsened into the first half of November. As of quarter-to-date, this negative trend is consistent across each of our brands and most prevalent in stores. 
We are planning to open approximately 8 stores during the fourth quarter, totaling 28 net new stores for the year. For the fourth quarter by brand, we are planning approximately 6 new Anthropologie stores globally, including 1 new European store and 2 new Free People stores in North America. 
URBN's gross margin rate for the fourth quarter could decrease versus the prior year. This decrease could be driven by deleverage related to our fulfillment center transition, store occupancy deleverage related to negative store comps and lower maintained margins at the Anthropologie and Free People brands. This deleverage could also be driven by the current negative sales growth rate. This deleverage could occur despite year-over-year improvement in the Urban Outfitters brand maintained margin due to continued progress in regular price sales and overall lower levels of markdown sales. Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit range for the fourth quarter. This increase would be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 remain planned at approximately $145 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. 
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Trish Donnelly, President of the Urban Outfitters brand in North America."

We are incredibly proud of the progress the UO brand has made this past quarter.

We are incredibly proud of the progress the UO brand has made this past quarter. The team's focus on assortment planning and allocation on creating compelling trend-right product, on delivering unique shopping environments that improve 4-wall productivity and on communicating our brand messaging through creative imagery and social engagement has given us solid quarterly results and a successful and stable foundation from which to continue to build. 
Starting with assortment planning and allocation. The team's laser focus and discipline around inventory control and management has resulted in significantly improved markdown rates and historically fast inventory turn. The collaboration between planners and merchants has been exemplary. The teams work together to edit redundant styles and offerings, while funding emerging businesses based on current trends. This balance in focus has resulted in positive reg price comps in both retail and direct, and the businesses into which we've intentionally distorted are seeing very exciting double-digit, full-price comp results. 
We came into this year knowing we had a lot of work to do around IMU, although it is still a work in progress with great focus, discipline and collaborative efforts with Barbara Rozsas, our Chief Sourcing Officer and her team, we are proud to report our IMU for the quarter showed nice improvement versus last year. Our design and merchant teams have worked closely with Barb's group on increasing our internal design penetration, which has also proven beneficial to improved IMU. In addition, the design team is executing more in-house drapes, which allow us to get samples right the first time, resulting in faster production turnaround and speed to stores. 
The last time we spoke, I talked about our focus on driving 4-wall productivity and the initiation of a detailed review of all store floor plans to assign appropriate square footage by product category. We are well into this complex project, and although it is still a work in progress, we've seen some excellent results in large format stores, specifically Herald Square, as well as our mall proto store in King of Prussia. We are taking our learnings here and continue to roll out what's working to rest of stores. Most recently, a successful example of this has been in our dresses, intimate and beauty category where the margin contribution within our 4-walls has dictated greater square footage needs, so we are distorting these areas accordingly on each stores' floor plan. As a company, we recognize the importance of this exercise in making our stores as productive as possible. 
Now turning to product. Last year, Meg Hayne, Chief Creative Officer for URBN, initiated a trend-to-concept process for the UO brand. By promoting strong, creative talent already within the brands and hiring outside talent where we needed additional support and expertise for process resulted in an effective framework, which gave clearer focus to the design teams and to the actual product assortment. We are now able to cover a broad number of sensibilities and end uses that still evoke a strong UO branding statement. We have now increased our attention to the men's division, where we know we've got tremendous opportunity to please our core customer. We will build upon successes we're seeing and extend product categories where we see growth and opportunity. 
In addition to the initiative and progress already noted, we are still incredibly committed to delivering unique and exciting store environments for our core customer. As in the past, our Display Artists in the field continue to build compelling art layers and fixturing for the stores, in which to highlight product. We saw great results with these fixture builds, which have helped define our floor set and shop-in-shops, making it easier and more appealing for customers to shop each defined area. Successful examples of this include our back-to-school and fall shops in dresses, beauty, intimate and music and photography. These categories saw some of our highest comp growth rates for the quarter. Even though our 4-wall focus is on efficiency and return on invested square footage, we haven't lost sight of the importance of the visual display and creativity that is unique to each individual UO store. In celebration of our artist in the field, we posted images on #UODisplay on Instagram and given thousands of instances in which the hashtag's been used and the thousands of likes we're seeing when we rebrand via our local and national account, our customers have a clear appreciation for the creative talent of the UO display team. 
In addition to unique visual merchandising within our 4-wall, we are also highly focused on the direct channel and saw year-over-year increases in conversion across all of our experiences: desktop, tablet, mobile web and our UO app. As the majority of our direct customers experience our brand through mobile, we activated our Beacon program in all stores this past quarter. Engagement here is growing, with 65% of customers receiving Beacon messages choosing to interact. 
Also in the quarter, we launched Scan and Shop in the UO app, allowing customers to shop the styles in our Dress book simply by holding their phone up to the catalog page while in store. In addition, with music being so important to our core customer, we've launched UO Music within the app featuring our favorite playlist and our UO Mixed Tape. And in our Herald Square store, to enhance and add to the more experiential shopping experience, we've opened our first UO Café, which is fast becoming a popular breakfast, lunch and dinner spot. 
From a brand marketing standpoint, our web imagery continues to drive and support the impressive direct-to-consumer comp increase we saw in Q3. As this imagery has resonated with customers on our website, in our app and in our digital marketing general, we began using imagery in stores to support our product initiatives, shop-in-shops and distortion category. This omni-channel visual approach led by Sue Otto, our Chief Creative Officer, helps link the online and off-line shopping experience and sends a consistent cross-channel messaging. Sue and her team has made it clearer for the customer to see what we're standing for and what we're excited about for the season, with a more singular cross-channel brand marketing point of view. Given the excitement around our brand imagery, we're also exploring printed piece opportunities, specifically our recent holiday dress book and our men's journal, which launched at the end of Q3. We will continue to explore this direct mail, journals and zine concept as we move into spring. 
Our social media team continued to drive engagement throughout the quarter, with particularly strong increases in Instagram and Pinterest, up 76% and 52%, respectively, over last year. Our Instagram following of almost 4 million users was highly interactive this past quarter, with our posts averaging close to 100,000 likes. Particularly exciting is that we saw engagement at this high level across all categories: women's, men's, apartment, music, electronics, beauty and intimates. Some of our newer, more successful social campaign this past quarter included UOonCampus, our all-store listening event previewing Lana Del Rey's newest album, which became the #1 trending topic in the U.S. during the hashtag launch; our marketing campaigns around product collaborations with Calvin Klein, Fila and Adidas; and our Dreamers and Doers event in stores, which celebrate artisans in the local market by providing a space within our stores and marketing support, to show their work. Because our customer is very interested and highly engaged in these types of social interactions, we'll continue to build on these opportunities and we're excited about our future initiatives. 
In Q3, we experienced double-digit growth in our active customer count, with increase in new customers and retained customers as well as customers coming back. While we've made notable progress over the last year in the areas of inventory management, product offering, 4-wall productivity and brand marketing, we continue to see significant growth and efficiency opportunities within the business. We still have a lot of work to do. 
I'd like to sincerely thank the Urban Outfitters team for the quarterly results, and I appreciate your time on the call today. Thank you."

The Urban team has made excellent progress in reenergizing its brand over the last 2 years, and that progress continued in this year's third quarter. 
As Trish explained, the team made a decision to pull back on promotional activity while improving the fashion and quality of the offerings. The strategy worked. Although top line growth in the third quarter was just 1%, the improvement in regular price selling drove healthy, double-digit increases in gross profit dollars. 
The brand team also improved in creative messaging, with better imagery and more robust social engagement. Many on today's call should have received a copy of the Urban Holiday Book. This is but one example of the improved marketing. I hope you agree with me that it's an extremely compelling catalog. As Trish said, similar books will be distributed next year as the team believes this will help drive digital sales and store traffic. 
After 2 years of rebuilding, the brand is now positioned for growth. We believe there is considerable opportunity to enter new markets, expand the direct-to-consumer channel and build more projects, like Space 24 Twenty at Austin, Texas. I'll talk more about that exciting project in a few minutes. I congratulate and thank Trish, Meg and the entire Urban brand team for a job well done. 
Before I turn your attention to the other brands, let me say a few words about the macro climate in which we currently operate. The fall season has been disappointing from a traffic and sales perspective. Combined North American store traffic for the quarter versus the same period last year was down 6%, while conversion was up 12 basis points. Meanwhile, combined North American direct traffic or sessions, grew by 4% and conversion was up 20 basis points. However, even though direct sessions were up on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the rate of increase dropped from Q2. 
The effect of this drop in traffic has been uneven across the categories we offer. In general, sales of apparel and accessories have been slower, while home, intimates, shoes and beauty have been more robust. I believe our customers' current lack of enthusiasm for the apparel and accessory categories is primarily due to a lack of fashion newness. We currently have a number of new fashion bright spots in our apparel offering, but whether or not these trends become more mainstream is uncertain. Having been in this situation before, my experience tells me the best course of action is to keep inventories lean, continue to experiment and know that new trends will emerge soon. 
Now I'll address the other brands, beginning with Anthropologie. For Anthro, Q3 was very similar to Q2. A number of important classes, like sweaters and dresses, offered assortment less compelling than the prior year period and those classes depressed the overall sales gains. The team continues to make adjustments in the assortment and offering additional promotions where necessary to move slower selling inventory. Effective inventory management helped to mitigate the marked down pressure, and as of October 31, apparel inventory this year has stood 4% below last year on a comparable basis. 
Even though some assortments were off the mark, the Anthropologie group also produced a number of successes. Categories and businesses such as home, beauty, shoes, BHLDN and Terrain all delivered very strong quarter-over-quarter sales gains. For example, online sales of home product in the quarter were exceptionally strong. They were driven by expanded and compelling product along with the mailing of home-only journals. 
The Anthro customer also responded positively to the new beauty offering. After strong results from testing this product online and in several stores, the brand recently completed a rollout of beauty shops within 70 existing stores. Early results are very encouraging and speak to a much larger potential for the beauty in the brand. These and other product expansion categories helped to drive double-digit increases in Anthropologie's direct-to-consumer sales in the quarter. The growth of online sessions and increased traffic coming from the site via natural search suggest that Anthropologie's customer engagement remains very powerful. The success of the expansion categories online has also increased our excitement about launching larger format stores that can offer more expanded product. Four larger stores are scheduled to open in FY '17. 
Anthropologie was not alone with the success it achieved by offering expanded categories, free People benefited as well. Recently, Free People opened 2 new larger format stores, 1 each in Denver and Dallas. Each was a relocation from an existing store within the same mall, and each more than doubled the selling space previously available. 
The additional space enabled the brand to offer wider selections from the Free People expansion category, including large branded footwear and intimate shops in both locations. Denver featured an area devoted to the newly launched FP Movement active wear and Dallas greeted customers at the door with a holiday party dress assortment. All of this newer product complimented the established ready to wear and accessory offerings. 
I'm pleased to report that both stores registered sales significantly greater than their opening day plan, and the Denver store easily set a new Free People opening day sales record despite stiff competition from its sister store in Dallas. Both stores have continued to produce strong sales, so the customer clearly likes the larger offering, and thus, the brand will continue to open more stores of this size going forward. 
3 months ago on our investor call, I suggested it would be difficult to maintain, let alone improve, the extremely high levels of sales productivity the Free People brand achieved in their existing retail stores. My concern proved to be correct. Comp store productivity declined in Q3 versus the prior year period. Important seasonal classes like sweaters, jackets and cold weather accessories failed to beat the comparable sales. We have now realigned our expectations for future comp store sales growth and believe that future store sales increases at Free People brand will come mostly from square footage growth. 
As with Anthropologie, Free People's success with expansion categories, most of which aren't available in the smaller format stores, did continue to drive double-digit sales increases online. This was achieved despite softness in international web sales during the quarter due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. The brand did, however, manage to report better online sales from U.K. and China because of more aggressive marketing. 
Before I discuss the wholesale channel performance, I want to comment on our new Gap fulfillment center issues that Frank referred to in his earlier commentary. After a relatively painless transition to the Gap facility for our DTC channel in late summer, the wholesale inventory was moved into the Gap center in September. This turned out to be a bigger job than expected, and resulted in the delay in filling the wholesale orders in late September and early October. Consequently, wholesale order fulfillment in October, one of the peak wholesale shipping months, was more back-end loaded than normal. 
The compressed order flow was more than the new center can handle. Processing volume combined with system problems and insufficient staff training, resulted in some October wholesale orders being shipped in the first few days of November. Today, we believe the software and hardware bugs have been largely fixed. We have hired additional staff and have implemented a more rigorous training program. Virtually all direct products are now being shipped within 24 to 48 hours from our fulfillment centers on both the East and West coast, and wholesale shipments are up-to-date and flowing from both our Trenton and Gap facilities. Based on the corrective measures we've taken over the past month, I believe we're positioned to fulfill all of our orders on a timely basis in the fourth quarter. 
As for the performance of the wholesale channel in Q3, had it not been for the transition issues, I believe that division would likely have posted double-digit sales increases. Furthermore, based on orders in-house, I believe it will return to a double-digit sales increase in Q4. 
Now let me discuss this morning's announcement. For several years, we've been talking about expanding categories in order to please our customers more and capture more of her spend. We have consistently repeated that new categories can be products or services as long as they fit within the lifestyle of the customer. In recent years, casual dining has been one of the fastest-growth categories and our involvement in the food service business to our successful cafes in 2 Terrain locations and in the Urban Outfitters location on Herald Square, has thought us the potential synergies that can exist between retail and food operations. 
This morning, we announced an agreement to acquire substantially all of The Vetri Family group of restaurants, which includes the award-winning Pizzeria Vetri. Most recently, Food and Wine Magazine named Pizzeria Vetri the best pizza restaurant in America. With casual dining growing rapidly and pizza one of the most popular foods in the country, we believe there's tremendous opportunity to expand the Pizzeria Vetri concept. 
We feel fortunate to have Marc Vetri, a James Beard award-winning chef, his business partner Jeff Benjamin and their talented teams, working in partnership with the URBN development and shared service teams to realize this growth opportunity. Currently, the Vetri group operates 2 pizza restaurants in Philadelphia and is scheduled to open 3 more in the next 12 months. We believe future units can be stand-alone restaurants or part of a larger retail complex. A big attraction of this concept is the enormous breadth of its appeal. Very young to very old. Everyone loves great pizza. 
Last week, the Urban brand launched its new Space 24 Twenty project in Austin, across from the University of Texas campus. This project include an expanded Urban Outfitters store and several food and beverage concepts, including Pizzeria Vetri and Michael Symon's Burger Joint. The store and the restaurants are clustered around an open air courtyard that offers restaurant seating and a stage for special events and concerts. So in addition to a large Urban store, we've assembled award-winning pizza and burgers, serving beer and other beverages and offering live music, and this is all directly across the street from 50,000 plus UT students. We believe the project has a high probability of success.
The Vetri pizza concept is not limited, however, to pairing only with Urban brand. In early 2017, we plan to open a project from Devon, Pennsylvania, which is a high-end suburb of Philadelphia. This project will include a larger format Anthropologie store, a Terrain garden center and outdoors store, a Glasshouse Café, a Pizzeria Vetri, and one of Vetri group's higher-end restaurants. We're excited to add food service to our brand portfolio and believe the Vetri Family group of restaurants complements our brand nicely. Having known Marc for many years and having worked with him on numerous charitable projects, I know our organizations and cultures fit together easily. Marc and Jeff will partner with David Ziel, our Chief Development Officer, who currently runs our URBN Food & Beverage division in leading this exciting opportunity for our company. 
Finally, a special thanks to all the home office folks who volunteered to help work in the new fulfillment center at the end of October and, of course, I thank all of our 23,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I recognize and thank our many partners around the world and also our shareholders for their continued support. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

As you say, beyond the weather, of course, weather is always a factor. And we have had significant decreases in some of our weather-related classes. But as you know, having been associated with the Urban brand for many, many years now, we never ever blame the weather for anything. So I want to discount that. We have seen lower traffic, as I said in my prepared remarks, if you could hear them. We've had lower traffic throughout the quarter, and that traffic got a little bit worse in October. I think that from our analysis, the primary things driving that is lack of newness in fashion. I think the current fashion looks is getting a little long in the tooth and I wouldn't be surprised if we started to see some signs of it changing a little bit more radically than it had, let's say, over the last 4 or 5 years. We do think that we do see a number of areas in our business that we're excited about with the new fashion. But those -- it's pretty early to start saying that it's a trend because there are items here, there are items there. But what we have seen outside of the apparel and accessory areas, and why I don't believe that it is the lack of traffic is, let's say, a precursor of a recessionary environment, is we're seeing real strength in a number of our categories. I mentioned the home category in Anthropologie, which has been really off the charts. So they've had done a great job of providing more products. And with the journals that they've issued, I think the customers responded very well to that. Across most or all 3 of the concepts, we've seen intimates and we've seen beauty respond very well. So there are a number of categories that are doing very well, and so I don't think customer is without money. I think she is without fashion newness."

That is why you see the growth rate come back up a bit into the fourth quarter, although we had originally were planning for the fourth quarter to be in the high single-digit range. Right now, we have revised that down into the mid-single-digit range.

Or is there another timing issue there?"

However, as I say that, we have been experiencing lower traffic in stores now for a number of quarters. It just happened to be a little bit more intense in this quarter and it also manifested itself in the direct business, which we really haven't seen before. So I would say, the traffic was a bit of a surprise. As far as inventories are concerned, I think we really have a very good group of people now in each brand controlling inventories, and they've reacted extremely quickly to the business. And that's the way we did it many years ago and it's the way I like to do it, so that we react to the current business and going forward, so we don't get caught with excess inventory. So I think you're right, as the sales materialized to where we had planned them to materialize, we may have been a little bit lighter in inventory. But I think the teams did a great job in cutting back when they saw the trend."

I think that Urban Outfitters women's did recently well during the quarter. I would congratulate Trish and the women's teams and Meg for really giving the customer what I think is an extremely good product. When I go into the stores and I take a look at the products and compare it to 2 or 3 years ago, I think it's just spectacularly better. Now having said that, overall sales were up 1%, so I think that while the women's apparel have much better full price, it shows that it wasn't enough to offset the markdown group of product. So I think that, again, traffic is an important element of this and we're sort of fighting against the wind, as it were, as when it comes to the offering. I think that there is still opportunity for the Urban brand to do better in some classifications. But overall, I give the Urban brand and women's a solid A for their efforts and their offerings. So I do think traffic affected Urban as well as the other 2 brands. I just think that Urban had a better fashion presentation. Trish, do you want to add anything to that?"

Sorry, about that. I think that one of the things that the Urban brand has a lot of success with this quarter was putting the right penetration of the product into the store and rearranging the stores so that it is grouped around product categories as opposed to product categories being hashed throughout the store. So that has helped us a lot. When you think about and say, what is the right penetration of these various product categories, the answer is the right penetration is what the customer deems it to be. Our job is to figure out what the customer wants and what is the percentage of a certain product category that she wants and then you give it to her. So I don't think there's any necessary long-term effect on gross margin because I believe, as I said before, when the fashion changes or as the fashion changes, I would fully expect apparel and accessories to come back, and whatever margins it has, it will have. Meanwhile, the other categories may carry a higher or a lower margin. So I don't think there's any particular long-term effect of margin on these other categories.  And I will say the one exception to that is probably the home area. And home traditionally has a lower initial margin, but oddly enough, it usually has a very similar maintained margin because the markdowns are typically much less. So that should really have much effect on gross margins. Thank you."

I will start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2016 third quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share our thoughts concerning the fourth quarter. 
Total company or URBN sales for the quarter increased by 1% to a third quarter record of $825 million. This sales increase included a 1% Retail segment comp, a $9 million increase in non-comp sales, including the opening of 10 net new stores, which more than offset a 5% decline in wholesale sales. Additionally, please note that our sales growth was negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points of currency translation. 
Our Wholesale segment sales were negatively affected by transition delays at our new distribution facility in Gap, Pennsylvania. These delays resulted in approximately $9 million of third quarter shipments being delayed into the fourth quarter. Had we been able to fulfill these orders during the third quarter, our wholesale sales growth would have been approximately 9%. As we enter into the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong demand in both department and specialty stores and based on several measures put into place, we do not anticipate further sales methods due to delayed shipments. 
Within our Retail segment comp, the direct-to-consumer channel continues to outperform stores, posting double-digit sales increases driven by increases in sessions, average order value and session conversion. Negative comp store sales resulted from decreased transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by higher average unit selling prices. The negative transaction could have been affected by traffic, which was down in our comp stores during the quarter, although we did benefit from an increase in conversion rate. 
By brand, our Retail segment comp rate increased by 3% and 1% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, while the Anthropologie Group was flat for the quarter. Our Retail segment comp was positive in September, flat in August and negative in October. When thinking about the months in the quarter, please keep in mind that the Labor Day holiday weekend shifted from August last year to September this year, so if you were to look at the month combined to try and account for the holiday shift, the net result of the 2 months together was a positive Retail segment comp for the period. 
Total URBN gross profit for the fourth quarter was up 2% versus the prior comparable quarter to $288 million. Gross profit rate improved by 11 basis points to 34.9%. The improvement in gross profit rate was driven by almost 150 basis points of improvement in URBN maintained margins due to significant improvement in the Urban Outfitters brand markdown rate, which was partially offset by lower maintained margins at the Anthropologie and Free People Retail segment. 
URBN maintained margin improvement was partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of deleverage in delivery and fulfillment center expenses, primarily related to the ongoing Gap, PA fulfillment center transition and the increased penetration of direct-to-consumer sales.
Approximately half of the deleverage and delivery in fulfillment center expenses previously noted, related to the transition of the South Carolina fulfillment center to Gap, Pennsylvania. After the direct-to-consumer transition to the new facility in the second quarter went well, this deleverage in the third quarter, which was primarily related to the Wholesale segment transition, was more than we had originally anticipated. We believe this deleverage will continue into the fourth quarter. Additionally, we estimated that currency translation negatively affected our gross profit rate by just under 50 basis points in the quarter. 
Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up less than 1% to $208 million. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged by 23 basis points to 25.2%. This SG&A leverage was primarily due to lower incentive-based and share-based compensation expense as well as currency translation benefits, which were partially offset by an increase in technology-related expenses used to support our direct-to-consumer channel investments. 
Operating income for the quarter increased by 5% to $80 million, with operating profit margin leveraging by 34 basis points to 9.7%. Net income for the quarter was $52 million or $0.42 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory decreased by 5% to $442 million. The reduction in inventory is due to a 9% reduction in Retail segment comp inventory at cost, partially offset by increases in wholesale inventory and non-comparable store inventory. The decrease in Retail segment comp inventory is due to improved inventory planning and control as the business continues to work towards managing to a lower weeks of supply. 
We ended the quarter with $273 million in cash and marketable securities. During the third quarter, the company repurchased and retired 3.6 million common shares for approximately $112 million. We have 11.6 million shares remaining on the most recent Board of Directors share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.7 million common shares for approximately $366 million. 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, it may be helpful for you to consider the following: First, I wanted to briefly comment on our current quarter-to-date sales trend. As noted above, October was the weakest sales comp in the third quarter and this negative trend has worsened into the first half of November. As of quarter-to-date, this negative trend is consistent across each of our brands and most prevalent in stores. 
We are planning to open approximately 8 stores during the fourth quarter, totaling 28 net new stores for the year. For the fourth quarter by brand, we are planning approximately 6 new Anthropologie stores globally, including 1 new European store and 2 new Free People stores in North America. 
URBN's gross margin rate for the fourth quarter could decrease versus the prior year. This decrease could be driven by deleverage related to our fulfillment center transition, store occupancy deleverage related to negative store comps and lower maintained margins at the Anthropologie and Free People brands. This deleverage could also be driven by the current negative sales growth rate. This deleverage could occur despite year-over-year improvement in the Urban Outfitters brand maintained margin due to continued progress in regular price sales and overall lower levels of markdown sales. Based on our current plan, we believe SG&A could grow at a mid-single-digit range for the fourth quarter. This increase would be driven by direct-to-consumer channel investments related to marketing and technology. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 remain planned at approximately $145 million, driven primarily by new stores and the completion of our new East Coast fulfillment center. 
Finally, our fiscal year 2016 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36%. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to Trish Donnelly, President of the Urban Outfitters brand in North America."

We are incredibly proud of the progress the UO brand has made this past quarter. The team's focus on assortment planning and allocation on creating compelling trend-right product, on delivering unique shopping environments that improve 4-wall productivity and on communicating our brand messaging through creative imagery and social engagement has given us solid quarterly results and a successful and stable foundation from which to continue to build. 
Starting with assortment planning and allocation. The team's laser focus and discipline around inventory control and management has resulted in significantly improved markdown rates and historically fast inventory turn. The collaboration between planners and merchants has been exemplary. The teams work together to edit redundant styles and offerings, while funding emerging businesses based on current trends. This balance in focus has resulted in positive reg price comps in both retail and direct, and the businesses into which we've intentionally distorted are seeing very exciting double-digit, full-price comp results. 
We came into this year knowing we had a lot of work to do around IMU, although it is still a work in progress with great focus, discipline and collaborative efforts with Barbara Rozsas, our Chief Sourcing Officer and her team, we are proud to report our IMU for the quarter showed nice improvement versus last year. Our design and merchant teams have worked closely with Barb's group on increasing our internal design penetration, which has also proven beneficial to improved IMU. In addition, the design team is executing more in-house drapes, which allow us to get samples right the first time, resulting in faster production turnaround and speed to stores. 
The last time we spoke, I talked about our focus on driving 4-wall productivity and the initiation of a detailed review of all store floor plans to assign appropriate square footage by product category. We are well into this complex project, and although it is still a work in progress, we've seen some excellent results in large format stores, specifically Herald Square, as well as our mall proto store in King of Prussia. We are taking our learnings here and continue to roll out what's working to rest of stores. Most recently, successful examples of this has been in our dresses, intimates and beauty categories where the margin contribution within our 4-walls has dictated greater square footage needs, so we are distorting these areas accordingly on each stores' floor plan. As a company, we recognize the importance of this exercise in making our stores as productive as possible. 
Now turning to product. Last year, Meg Hayne, Chief Creative Officer for URBN, initiated a trend-to-concept process for the UO brand. By promoting strong, creative talent already within the brands and hiring outside talent where we needed additional support and expertise, her process resulted in an effective framework, which gave clearer focus to the design teams and to the actual product assortment. We are now able to cover a broad number of sensibilities and end uses that still evoke a strong UO branding statement. We have now increased our attention to the men's division, where we know we've got tremendous opportunity to please our core customer. We will build upon successes we're seeing and extend product categories where we see growth and opportunity. 
In addition to the initiative and progress already noted, we are still incredibly committed to delivering unique and exciting store environments for our core customer. As in the past, our Display Artists in the field continue to build compelling art layers and fixturing for the stores, in which to highlight product. We saw great results with these fixture builds, which have helped define our floor sets and shop-in-shops, making it easier and more appealing for customers to shop each defined area. Successful examples of this include our back-to-school and fall shops in dresses, beauty, intimate and music and photography. These categories saw some of our highest comp growth rates for the quarter. Even though our 4-wall focus is on efficiency and return on invested square footage, we haven't lost sight of the importance of the visual display and creativity that is unique to each individual UO store. In celebration of our artist in the field, we posted images on #UODisplay on Instagram and given thousands of instances in which the hashtag's been used and the thousands of likes we're seeing when we rebrand via our local and national accounts, our customers have a clear appreciation for the creative talent of the UO display team. 
In addition to unique visual merchandising within our 4-wall, we are also highly focused on the direct channel and saw year-over-year increases in conversion across all of our experiences: desktop, tablet, mobile web and our UO app. As the majority of our direct customers experience our brand through mobile, we activated our Beacon program in all stores this past quarter. Engagement here is growing, with 65% of customers receiving Beacon messages choosing to interact. 
Also in the quarter, we launched Scan and Shop in the UO app, allowing customers to shop the styles in our Dress book simply by holding their phone up to the catalog page while in store. In addition, with music being so important to our core customer, we've launched UO Music within the app featuring our favorite playlist and our UO Mixed Tape. And in our Herald Square store, to enhance and add to the more experiential shopping experience, we've opened our first UO Café, which is fast becoming a popular breakfast, lunch and dinner spot. 
From a brand marketing standpoint, our web imagery continues to drive and support the impressive direct-to-consumer comp increase we saw in Q3. As this imagery has resonated with customers on our website, in our app and in our digital marketing channels, we began using the imagery in stores to support our product initiatives, shop-in-shops and distortion category. This omni-channel visual approach led by Sue Otto, our Chief Creative Officer, helps link the online and off-line shopping experience and sends consistent cross-channel messaging. Sue and her team has made it clearer for the customer to see what we're standing for and what we're excited about for the season, with a more singular cross-channel brand marketing point of view. Given the excitement around our brand imagery, we're also exploring printed piece opportunities, specifically our recent holiday dress book and our men's journal, which launched at the end of Q3. We will continue to explore this direct mail journal and zine concept as we move into spring. 
Our social media team continued to drive engagement throughout the quarter, with particularly strong increases in Instagram and Pinterest, up 76% and 52%, respectively, over last year. Our Instagram following of almost 4 million users was highly interactive this past quarter, with our posts averaging close to 100,000 likes. Particularly exciting is that we saw engagement at this high level across all categories: women's, men's, apartment, music, electronics, beauty and intimates. Some of our newer, more successful social campaigns this past quarter included #UOonCampus, our all-store listening event previewing Lana Del Rey's newest album, which became the #1 trending topic in the U.S. during the hashtag launch; our marketing campaigns around product collaborations with Calvin Klein, Fila and Adidas; and our Dreamers and Doers events in stores, which celebrate artisans in local markets by providing a space within our stores and marketing support, to show their work. Because our customer is very interested and highly engaged in these types of social interactions, we'll continue to build on these opportunities and we're excited about our future initiatives. 
In Q3, we experienced double-digit growth in our active customer count, with increases in new customers and retained customers as well as customers coming back. While we've made notable progress over the last year in the areas of inventory management, product offering, 4-wall productivity and brand marketing, we continue to see significant growth and efficiency opportunities within the business. We still have a lot of work to do. 
I'd like to sincerely thank the Urban Outfitters team for the quarterly results, and I appreciate your time on the call today. Thank you."

The Urban team has made excellent progress in reenergizing its brand over the last 2 years, and that progress continued in this year's third quarter. 
As Trish explained, the team made a decision to pull back on promotional activity while improving the fashion and quality of the offerings. The strategy worked. Although top line growth in the third quarter was just 1%, the improvement in regular price selling drove healthy, double-digit increases in gross profit dollars. 
The brand team also improved in creative messaging, with better imagery and more robust social engagement. Many on today's call should have received a copy of the Urban Holiday Book. This is but one example of the improved marketing. I hope you'll agree with me that it's an extremely compelling catalog. As Trish said, similar books will be distributed next year as the team believes this will help drive digital sales and store traffic. 
After 2 years of rebuilding, the brand is now positioned for growth. We believe there is considerable opportunity to enter new markets, expand the direct-to-consumer channel and build more projects like Space 24 Twenty at Austin, Texas. I'll talk more about that exciting project in a few minutes. I congratulate and thank Trish, Meg and the entire Urban brand team for a job well done. 
Before I turn your attention to the other brands, let me say a few words about the macro climate in which we currently operate. The fall season has been disappointing from a traffic and sales perspective. Combined North American store traffic for the quarter versus the same period last year was down 6%, while conversion was up 12 basis points. Meanwhile, combined North American direct traffic or sessions, grew by 4% and conversion was up 20 basis points. However, even though direct sessions were up on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the rate of increase dropped from Q2. 
The effect of this drop in traffic has been uneven across the categories we offer. In general, sales of apparel and accessories have been slower, while home, intimates, shoes and beauty have been more robust. I believe our customers' current lack of enthusiasm for the apparel and accessory categories is primarily due to a lack of fashion newness. We currently have a number of new fashion bright spots in our apparel offering, but whether or not these trends become more mainstream is uncertain. Having been in this situation before, my experience tells me the best course of action is to keep inventories lean, continue to experiment and know that new trends will emerge soon. 
Now I'll address the other brands, beginning with Anthropologie. For Anthro, Q3 was very similar to Q2. A number of important classes, like sweaters and dresses, offered assortments less compelling than the prior year period and those classes depressed the overall sales gains. The team continues to make adjustments in the assortment and offering additional promotions where necessary to move slower selling inventory. Effective inventory management helped to mitigate the marked down pressure, and as of October 31, apparel inventory this year has stood 4% below last year on a comparable basis. 
Even though some assortments were off the mark, the Anthropologie group also produced a number of successes. Categories and businesses such as home, beauty, shoes, BHLDN and Terrain all delivered very strong quarter-over-quarter sales gains. For example, online sales of home product in the quarter were exceptionally strong. They were driven by expanded and compelling product along with the mailing of home-only journals. 
The Anthro customer also responded positively to the new beauty offering. After strong results from testing this product online and in several stores, the brand recently completed a rollout of beauty shops within 70 existing stores. Early results are very encouraging and speak to a much larger potential for the beauty in the brand. These and other product expansion categories helped to drive double-digit increases in Anthropologie's direct-to-consumer sales in the quarter. The growth of online sessions and increased traffic coming from the site via natural search suggest that Anthropologie's customer engagement remains very powerful. The success of the expansion categories online has also increased our excitement about launching larger format stores that can offer more expanded product. Four larger stores are scheduled to open in FY '17. 
Anthropologie was not alone with the success it achieved by offering expanded categories, Free People benefited as well. Recently, Free People opened 2 new larger format stores, 1 each in Denver and Dallas. Each was a relocation from an existing store within the same mall, and each more than doubled the selling space previously available. 
The additional space enabled the brand to offer wider selections from the Free People expansion category, including large branded footwear and intimate shops in both locations. Denver featured an area devoted to the newly launched FP Movement active wear and Dallas greeted customers at the door with a holiday party dress assortment. All of this newer product complemented the established ready to wear and accessory offerings. 
I'm pleased to report that both stores registered sales significantly greater than their opening day plan, and the Denver store easily set a new Free People opening day sales record despite stiff competition from its sister store in Dallas. Both stores have continued to produce strong sales, so the customer clearly likes the larger offering, and thus, the brand will continue to open more stores of this size going forward. 
Three months ago on our investor call, I suggested it would be difficult to maintain, let alone improve, the extremely high level of sales productivity the Free People brand achieved in their existing retail stores. My concern proved to be correct. Comp store productivity declined in Q3 versus the prior year period. Important seasonal classes like sweaters, jackets and cold weather accessories failed to beat the comparable sales. We have now realigned our expectations for future comp store sales growth and believe that future store sales increases at the Free People brand will come mostly from square footage growth. 
As with Anthropologie, Free People's success with expansion categories, most of which aren't available in the smaller format stores, did continue to drive double-digit sales increases online. This was achieved despite softness in international web sales during the quarter due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. The brand did, however, manage to report better online sales from U.K. and China because of more aggressive marketing. 
Before I discuss the wholesale channel performance, I want to comment on our new Gap fulfillment center issues that Frank referred to in his earlier commentary. After a relatively painless transition to the Gap facility for our DTC channel in late summer, the wholesale inventory was moved into the Gap center in September. This turned out to be a bigger job than expected, and resulted in the delay in filling the wholesale orders in late September and early October. Consequently, wholesale order fulfillment in October, one of the peak wholesale shipping months, was more back-end loaded than normal. 
The compressed order flow was more than the new center could handle. Processing volume combined with system problems and insufficient staff training, resulted in some October wholesale orders being shipped in the first few days of November. Today, we believe the software and hardware bugs have been largely fixed. We have hired additional staff and have implemented a more rigorous training program. Virtually all direct orders are now being shipped within 24 to 48 hours from our fulfillment centers on both the East and West coast, and wholesale shipments are up-to-date and flowing from both our Trenton and Gap facilities. Based on the corrective measures we've taken over the past month, I believe we're positioned to fulfill all of our orders on a timely basis in the fourth quarter. 
As for the performance of the wholesale channel in Q3, had it not been for the transition issues, I believe that division would likely have posted double-digit sales increases. Furthermore, based on orders in-house, I believe it will return to a double-digit sales increase in Q4. 
Now let me discuss this morning's announcement. For several years, we've been talking about expanding categories in order to please our customers more and capture more of her spend. We have consistently repeated that new categories can be products or services as long as they fit within the lifestyle of the customer. In recent years, casual dining has been one of the fastest-growth categories and our involvement in the food service business to our successful cafes in 2 Terrain locations and in the Urban Outfitters location on Herald Square, has taught us the potential synergies that can exist between retail and food operations. 
This morning we've announced an agreement to acquire substantially all of The Vetri Family group of restaurants, which includes the award-winning Pizzeria Vetri. Most recently, Food and Wine Magazine named Pizzeria Vetri the best pizza restaurant in America. With casual dining growing rapidly and pizza one of the most popular foods in the country, we believe there's tremendous opportunity to expand the Pizzeria Vetri concept. 
We feel fortunate to have Marc Vetri, a James Beard award-winning chef, his business partner Jeff Benjamin and their talented teams, working in partnership with the URBN development and shared service teams to realize this growth opportunity. Currently, the Vetri group operates 2 pizza restaurants in Philadelphia and is scheduled to open 3 more in the next 12 months. We believe future units can be stand-alone restaurants or part of a larger retail complex. A big attraction of this concept is the enormous breadth of its appeal. Very young to very old, everyone loves great pizza. 
Last week, the Urban brand launched its new Space 24 Twenty project in Austin, across from the University of Texas campus. This project includes an expanded Urban Outfitters store and several food and beverage concepts, including Pizzeria Vetri and Michael Symon's Burger Joint. The store and the restaurants are clustered around an open air courtyard that offers restaurant seating and a stage for special events and concerts. So in addition to a large Urban store, we've assembled award-winning pizza and burgers, serving beer and other beverages and offering live music, and this is all directly across the street from 50,000 plus UT students. We believe the project has a high probability of success.
The Vetri pizza concept is not limited, however, to pairing only with Urban brand. In early 2017, we plan to open a project from Devon, Pennsylvania, which is a high-end suburb of Philadelphia. This project will include a larger format Anthropologie store, a Terrain garden center and outdoors store, a Glasshouse Café, a Pizzeria Vetri, and one of Vetri group's higher-end restaurants. We're excited to add food service to our brand portfolio and believe the Vetri Family group of restaurants complements our brand nicely. Having known Marc for many years and having worked with him on numerous charitable projects, I know our organizations and cultures fit together easily. Marc and Jeff will partner with David Ziel, our Chief Development Officer, who currently runs our URBN Food & Beverage division in leading this exciting opportunity for our company. 
Finally, a special thanks to all the home office folks who volunteered to help work in the new fulfillment center at the end of October and, of course, I thank all of our 23,000 associates worldwide for their inspiring dedication, drive and creativity. I recognize and thank our many partners around the world and also our shareholders for their continued support. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn the call over for your questions."

As you say, beyond the weather, of course, weather is always a factor. And we have had significant decreases in some of our weather-related classes. But as you know, having been associated with the Urban brand for many, many years now, we never ever blame the weather for anything. So I want to discount that. We have seen lower traffic, as I said in my prepared remarks, if you could hear them. We've had lower traffic throughout the quarter, and that traffic got a little bit worse in October. I think that from our analysis, the primary things driving that is lack of newness in fashion. I think the current fashion look is getting a little long in the tooth and I wouldn't be surprised if we started to see some signs of it changing a little bit more radically than it had, let's say, over the last 4 or 5 years. We do think that we do see a number of areas in our business that we're excited about with the new fashion. But those -- it's pretty early to start saying that it's a trend because there are items here, there are items there. But what we have seen outside of the apparel and accessory areas, and why I don't believe that it is the lack of traffic is, let's say, a precursor of a recessionary environment, is we're seeing real strength in a number of our categories. I mentioned the home category in Anthropologie, which has been really off the charts. So they've done a great job of providing more products. And with the journals that they've issued, I think the customer's responding very well to that. Across most or all 3 of the concepts, we've seen intimates and we've seen beauty respond very well. So there are a number of categories that are doing very well, and so I don't think customer is without money. I think she is without fashion newness."

One is, can you talk about the differences in sort of the uptake if there are emerging trends at UO and the success is sort of fall today or season to date versus this 35-year-old customer, perhaps, at Anthro? Are these trends less in her kind of wheelhouse, in the Anthro wheelhouse? Maybe that's for David, actually. And then on the wholesale channel, do you think it's all for this notion of the company's specific Gap, Pennsylvania move? Or do you think it has something to do with what Macy's and Nordstrom and the department stores are saying about over inventory and just a slowing in their channel?"

As far as wholesale is concerned, it has absolutely nothing to do with our customers. I've had conversations with the wholesale folks as recently as Thursday of last week and they assured me that all of our partners are so enthusiastic about the Free People brand and are enthusiastic about receiving the product. It had everything to do with exactly what I said, which was a combination of some errors on our part in not accurately projecting the quantity of merchandise we were going to have to ship. Having a few -- more than a few, actually, system bugs, both hardware and software. And then as I said, inadequate training. So those 3 things combined to cause some real problems. I believe that the majority of those problems are now behind us, and I believe that we will be shipping wholesale product and our direct-to-consumer product on time through our various fulfillment and distribution centers. Now I think I'll ask Trish to take the first part of your question, and David, you'll take the other part of that one question."

So I would say, the traffic was a bit of a surprise. As far as inventories are concerned, I think we really have a very good group of people now in each brand controlling inventories, and they've reacted extremely quickly to the business. And that's the way we did it many years ago and it's the way I like to do it, so that we react to the current business and going forward, so we don't get caught with excess inventory. So I think you're right, had the sales materialized to where we had planned them to materialize, we may have been a little bit lighter in inventory.

So I think that, again, traffic is an important element of this and we're sort of fighting against the wind, as it were, as when it comes to the offering. I think that there is still opportunity for the Urban brand to do better in some classifications. But overall, I give the Urban brand and women's a solid A for their efforts and their offering.

Sorry about that. I think that one of the things that the Urban brand had a lot of success with this quarter was putting the right penetration of the product into the store and rearranging the store so that it is grouped around product categories as opposed to product categories being hashed throughout the store. So that has helped us a lot. When you think about and say, what is the right penetration of these various product categories, the answer is the right penetration is what the customer deems it to be. Our job is to figure out what the customer wants and what is the percentage of a certain product category that she wants and then you give it to her. So I don't think there's any necessary long-term effect on gross margin because I believe, as I said before, when the fashion changes or as the fashion changes, I would fully expect apparel and accessories to come back, and whatever margins it has, it will have. Meanwhile, the other categories may carry a higher or a lower margin. So I don't think there's any particular long-term effect of margin on these other categories. And I would say the one exception to that is probably the home area. And home traditionally has a lower initial margin, but oddly enough, it usually has a very similar maintained margin because the markdowns are typically much less. So that shouldn't really have much effect on gross margins. Thank you."
