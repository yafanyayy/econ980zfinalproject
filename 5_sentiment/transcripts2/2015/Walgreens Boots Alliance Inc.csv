Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first ever earnings conference call of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Let me begin by underscoring how pleased we were to finally bring the 2 companies together on 31 December, 2014. This was a historic and pivotal milestone for 2 iconic companies, Walgreens and Alliance Boots, as we completed our merger to establish Walgreens Boots Alliance, forging the new company, the world's first global pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise. We established a senior management team to bring together our businesses and lead them forward to the next phase of their evolution while making steady progress with the integration and the establishment of a single unified corporate entity and culture. 
Our team worked very hard to accelerate the closing of the deal 2 months ahead of the beginning of the completion window. We raised the funds to complete the transaction and to finance especially all the EBITDA in an efficient manner while going through a complicated process of preparing our first full consolidated earnings and the U.S. GAAP, including eliminating the 3 months reporting lag. The complexity and effort the staff has taken cannot be underestimated. I would ask you to remember that until completion, our business is operated at arm's length as separate entities. We are today only 14 weeks, in fact, 99 days into the creation of this new global entity. It is still very early but we have moved mountains in work that we've done and are still in the first step of our journey. We have achieved the merger in a short time and are moving quickly. We have expanded our restructuring program to create a more competitive cost structure. We're going to access synergies created through the combination and sharpen our focus on our strategic priorities including the sales of the majority interest of our infusion business subsequent to the quarter close. And today, I am pleased to announce a historic quarter, achieved along with all the other tasks that we have undertaken. We are looking forward to the future in 2 years' time.
Our transaction has created the growth which, I believe, is another potential to grow in ways that give us great excitement and optimism for the future. Let's start by looking at our business as we stand today. Based on an in-depth review of our retail pharmacy USA segment, I can say that the world [indiscernible] on its sound structural footing. As you might expect, some parts are better than expected while others saw room for improvement. Our first priority is to understand the business fully, its interdependency and its differentiators. This exercise is underway and will ensure we stay focused on what is truly important, delivering against the needs of our customers in a dependable yet innovative a manner that provides us that we sustainable recurring income a causal part of our business. This will be achieved through a combination of efficient practice [indiscernible] investments in our core business and innovation in our business model. So more [indiscernible] we believe we believe there will be significant scope to announce the performance of our pharmacies through refreshing and differentiating our store, improving customer experience, delivering services to customers and patients and introducing new offerings through innovative partnerships. We believe that through good business practice and application of these and other initiatives, we can over time expand the retail margin, grow market share and prepare ourselves to better address the competitive market-driven headwinds we face in certain areas of our business. 
Let me be perfect to you. Our aim is to help world [indiscernible] further develop strategies so we continue to deliver growth for many years to come. It is vital that we make best use of the assets that we have [indiscernible] to which our arrival portfolio of location across the U.S. We must work tirelessly to drive the best possible return from this asset, and to that end, we have today announced an enlarged [indiscernible] restructuring program to focus the worldwide business but on its core assets. We believe we will come out of this stronger and better positioned to deliver [indiscernible] the full month our premium location command. 
In Retail Pharmacy international, in both, we are working hard to refine the new cycle of our business that will deliver growth in the coming year. We are continuing to develop our online offering and building on our recent success. We are working to further integrate these with our physical stores and logistical network to announce the customer choice while making better use of our resources. The constant work to keep our offering fresh through innovation within store and within our own brand and excluding the product portfolio is continuing to differentiate us in an extremely competitive U.K. retail market. I'm confident that the work which Simon and his team are doing will set us on a path for further growth in the years ahead. 
As you're aware, our retail businesses are also continuing to perform well and it had been a particularly pleasure to welcome our new colleagues in Mexico and Chile to our company, making the expansion of our international retail presence in Latin America through their vision of 2 outstanding business that with excellent [indiscernible] for growth. 
Our pharmaceuticals sales division is continuing to develop at the integrated business model that we introduced many years ago, operating an ever-growing suite of services to the manufacturers that tie up most growth than ever to them as [indiscernible]. On the other side of the supply chain, we are expanding our [indiscernible] pharmacies customers to both align them more globally with our wholesalers and let them improve the quality and economics of their own businesses. While such initiative announced the vertical integration of our sales business and create strength and value, the ever-changing market that we are operating in and the continuous economic pressure the health care system around us present us with several opportunities to expand our network. 
These present themselves in many ways in one extreme through consolidation within market and the other extreme through innovative partnerships and Alliance system and as you have seen us to do with AmerisourceBergen. As our sales is a business announced by volume and market presence, we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our network as they arise. Underpinning all of these, Walgreens Boots Alliance has embarked on the beginning of a new year, a new year that will bring a new attitude, a new culture aligned toward driving performance, serving our customers and creating long-term sustainable shareholder value. Now I will ask George to take us through the quarterly results. George?"

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Today, I would like to cover the following 3 topics: first, to provide detail on our fiscal 2015 second quarter performance; second, to provide you with an overvi",2559,"Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Today, I would like to cover the following 3 topics: first, to provide detail on our fiscal 2015 second quarter performance; second, to provide you with an overview of our restructuring program; and finally, to articulate our views on FY '15 and FY '16 results. 
To summarize, the second quarter was a solid start for our new company. Key highlights include net sales of $26.6 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 where adjusted EPS was $1.18, cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion. The quarter's financial results are complicated as we began reporting as a consolidated entity partly through the quarter, and the comparability to last year is a challenge and of limited use. 
Before we get into the details of our second quarter financial performance, I'd like to explain some elements of our new reporting structure. Historically, Walgreens has reported as one segment which consisted of the results of Walgreens in the USA, its corporate costs, synergies from the Walgreens Boots Alliance development joint venture, also known as WBAD, and equity earnings from Alliance Boots on a 3-month lag. Our focus was to merge the businesses as soon as possible and eliminate the 3-month reporting lag. This aligns the reporting -- the reported the results of the global enterprise and will make our performance easier to understand going forward. 
As Walgreens Boots Alliance, we now report results in 3 segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy international and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits including WBAD and combined corporate costs. Within our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, since the deal closed on December 31, we have reported 1 month of Alliance Boots equity income this quarter versus 3 months in the comparable quarter a year ago, recognizing the 45% stake that Walgreens had in Alliance Boots until end of December. The months of January and February are fully consolidated. Year-over-year comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable. 
So now let me take you through our financials in greater detail beginning with the consolidated results. For the quarter, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were just over $2 billion or $1.93 per diluted share, while adjusted and earnings were $1.2 billion or $1.18 per diluted share. This compares to $0.74 of GAAP net earnings per share and $0.97 of adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year quarter. Net sales in the second quarter were $26.6 million, an increase of 35.5% versus the prior year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion and on an adjusted basis was $1.8 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment as well as the consolidation of Alliance Boots results for January and February. We reported $144 million of net interest expense this quarter, which included interest expense associated with prefunding the transaction for the month of December. Consistent with last quarter, our adjusted EPS excludes this interest expense, which will not need to do going forward. 
The adjusted tax rate for this quarter was 27.7%. Now this has been impacted by a number of factors, including a change in the geographic mix forecast profits net of Alliance Boots has been fully consolidated, includes net discrete tax benefits specific to the quarter and the presentation of Alliance Boots taxes in the income statement. Prior to the full merger, Walgreens 45% share of Alliance Boots adjusted results, net of Alliance Boots tax were presented in a single line within operating income. Now following the transaction, Alliance Boots taxes reported within the income tax provision line in our income statement impacting the calculation of the adjusted tax rate. 
Diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion and average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 1.05 billion, resulting from the issuance of 144 million shares on 31 December as part of the consideration for Alliance Boots. 
So now let me walk you through the component pieces to explain the change from GAAP to adjusted EPS. The GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $1.93 reconciles to an adjusted earnings per share of $1.18. The net adjustment of $0.75 per share, this reflects the removal of net gains on transaction-related item of $0.67 and gains on the warrants we hold over AmerisourceBergen shares of $0.35. This is partially offset by LIFO provision costs of $0.04; acquisition-related amortization expenses of $0.15 which includes $0.08 relating to that industry step-up, which will not reoccur in future quarters; and special items of $0.08 related to optimization costs and asset impairments. 
The components of the net gain on transaction-related items were a gain on Walgreens previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots of $0.77, a foreign currency hedge loss of $0.07 related to the [indiscernible] of the British pound element of the step 2 consideration and a net $0.03 cost transaction fees, tax adjustments and interest cost from prefunding the cash consideration. 
So next, I'd like to provide insights into financial results at the segmental level starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Reported net sales were $21 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable store basis. In the pharmacy, comparable script store scripts, which includes immunizations, this increased 5% on a 30-day adjusted basis. The increase was driven by the positive impact of a strong cough, cold and flu season by continued growth in Medicare Part D scripts and positive underlying share trends. For the quarter ending 28 February, the division's 30-day adjusted prescription market share in the U.S. reached 19.3% as reported by IMS Health. This represents an increase of 20 basis points versus the same time last year. 
In retail products, comparable store sales increased by 2.5%. This was partially driven by strong December holiday sales, including seasonal sales of cough, cold and flu products. GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion while adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 13.4% over the year-ago quarter. Strong expense control and efficiencies offset the expected pharmacy gross margin pressure from declines in reimbursement, generic drug inflation as well as the Med Part D rate step-down that begun on the 1st of January this year. Retail product margins increased this quarter held by seasonal and cough cold and flu mix as well as our focus on reducing less profitable promotions. We remain very pleased with the progress on controlling and reducing SG&A expenses this quarter. Our GAAP SG&A expense declined 0.3% [ph] compared to the prior-year quarter. 
So next let's review the Retail Pharmacy international division, which is pharmacy life health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries. The biggest contributor is Boots in the U.K. Total sales for the 2 months ended February were just over $2 billion. As the businesses included our Retail Pharmacy international division were acquired as part of the merger of Alliance Boots, no comparable information is included in the WBA consolidated results. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable sales for January and February grew by 2.9%. Comparable sales of Boots U.K. were up 2.3% while sales in our businesses in Chile and Mexico, which we acquired by Alliance -- acquired by Alliance Boots back in August 2014, these were up 2.9%. The acquisition brings us over 1,000 [ph] stores in Mexico and over 400 in Chile and provide strong growth opportunities in the Latin American market. Inclusive of this businesses new division combined with contract manufacturing are reflected in the margins. 
Now turning to Pharmaceutical Wholesale, which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand in 12 countries. Results in any given quarter influenced by performance in larger geographies, including the U.K., Germany, France and Turkey and the division's contribution from WBAD. Total sales for the 2 months ending February was $3.9 billion. Similar to Retail Pharmacy international, our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division was acquired through the merger with Alliance Boots and so no amounts are reported in the comparable period. However, in the pro forma constant currency basis, sales were relatively flat compared with the same period the prior year. 
Now let me spend a minute on our expectations for synergies and how they will be reported going forward. Prior to the merger, the majority of our synergies were flowing through WBAD, the former joint venture between Walgreens and Boots Alliance, which Walgreens fully consolidated and then removed Alliance Boots portion via the noncontrolling interest line item. Following the combination, we're allocating all synergies including those generated by WBAD to the segments, and we're doing this according to the relative proportion of purchases driving the synergy benefits. With regard to performance in the quarter, combined net synergies were $170 million, bringing the fiscal year-to-date total to $310 million, driven primarily by our drug procurement efforts. We remain comfortable with our ability to achieve at least $650 million in combined synergies this fiscal year. For FY '16, we continue to expect at least $1 billion in combined quantifiable net synergies. Consistent with prior reporting, these synergies did not include any benefit from our AmerisourceBergen relationship. 
Now that we're a combined company, as expected, we are focusing on driving incremental synergies from sharing our best practices and working more closely together. However, not all of these can be easily quantified as some of them tend to blend into our normal business.
So moving on to the cash flows. We generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash from operations during the quarter, and our free cash flow was $1.0 billion. We're pleased with the cash generation during the second quarter due in part to an improvement in our primary working capital within our Retail Pharmacy USA division, driven by a reduction in inventory levels. We will continue to focus on working capital and remain confident in future opportunities to increase efficiencies. Net debt as of the quarter end was $14.1 billion. 
With regard to uses of free cash flow beyond reinvestment back into the company, we completed $94 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization. We've purchased additional shares post the end of the quarter and the preestablished trading plans, bringing the total purchases to $330 million.
I'd now like to make a few comments on our capital allocation policy. As we've consistently communicated, we remain committed to a solid investment grade rating while looking for ways to enhance our cash generation. This includes driving working capital efficiencies, tightening capital expenditures, controlling costs and of course improving operations. Beyond maintaining a long-term 30% to 35% dividend payout target, our top priorities for free cash include M&A consistent with our strategy and share buybacks. All of these are with a view to optimizing long-term shareholder value. Following on this theme, and as Stefano mentioned, we are focused on becoming a more agile and more productive company. 
As you know, in August, 2014, we announced a 3-year $1 billion cost reduction initiative. After a rigorous analysis, we've identified additional opportunities for cost savings primarily in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. These additional cost opportunities will increase the total expected cost savings program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. So [indiscernible] focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the USA, to reorganize corporate and field operations, drive operating efficiencies and streamline information technology and other functions. These actions are designed to restructure and invest in our company's future in a way that is better for customers, simpler for our employees resulting in a faster and more agile organization. 
We estimate the total pretax charges associated with this program through our GAAP financial results will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, of which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. The restructuring charges will be recognized over time as the program is implemented in accordance with GAAP. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on other areas of cost reduction. 
Now let's talk about the rest of fiscal 2015. We understand and appreciate that there are a lot of factors that will impact our results. So in order to help you, we are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Now this range assumes quarterly interest expense of $140 million to $150 million. It assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29% and a fiscal year diluted share count generally consistent with the current quarter. It assumes management's estimates for foreign exchange rates that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year. Now this guidance also includes recast fiscal Q1 results due to the elimination of the 3-month lag. 
Finally, you will see an increase in the share count in Q3 and Q4 due to the full inclusion of the 144 million shares issued with step 2 of the AB transaction. This will result in approximately 1.1 billion diluted shares per quarter. Any additional share repurchases will impact, of course, the fiscal year diluted share count. 
So moving on to FY '16, our previously published goals were based on a variety of assumptions to arrive at estimate ranges for both sales and adjusted EPS. These included operating assumptions for our businesses and certain below-the-line items, including interest, tax and share count. When we set the goals in August, we made foreign currency assumptions based on exchange rates that were close to market rates at that time. Since then, we've seen significant global currency movements especially the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Because we report in U.S. dollars, we do have currency translational exposures primarily based on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Simply put, a stronger dollar [indiscernible] our sales in earnings and dollars while a weaker dollar helps them. We estimate that a 1% move in the pound sterling versus the dollar from current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. Despite the FX headwind, I'm confident that we have initiatives and resources in place to address the controllable elements that drive our adjusted EPS goal for FY '16. 
Our revenues have greater potential variability due to the varied mix of businesses, particularly in our wholesale division, which accounts for a significant proportion of our overall revenue. In addition, the geographical spread of the wholesale business increases its exposure to currency variations. This being the case, we view overall revenue as a less relevant measure of our business. So taking these 2 factors into account, we decided to no longer provide our published revenue goal. And please note that our forward-looking statements assume no significant changes to the current exchange rates. 
So I'd like to wrap up today by saying that our reporting structure has changed and comparability is limited, which I know makes it really difficult for you. Therefore, in an effort to be as informative as possible, we provided adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal year 2015, and next week, we'll have a financial session to provide further insights. In addition, we plan to provide operational insights in each of our 3 segments, as well as views on our key financial drivers and future strategy. We really look forward to seeing you then. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Stefano."

We are working to deliver the benefits of our transaction within our core businesses. It will involve executing our synergies and efficiency programs across the group including the progressive development of our procurement initiatives. We must also properly manage the assets of the business to ensure we are [indiscernible] structured and prepared to address the pressure we face in the pharmacy market world. These pressures may variously be from reimbursement cuts, competitive action or simply changes in consumer behavior. Whatever form and they take, if we are properly structured and prepared to operating an efficient high quality patient-oriented pharmacy service that we will earn the right not just to participate but to be an architect of the changes in our market. We are already seeing the benefits that can be achieved in retail with the initiatives underway at Walgreens and ongoing Boots. We must ensure that we get the best return for our investment and create the best environment for our employees and customers alike. This will require us to operate announced systems and control so that we can monitor and manage our business progress. 
Now many of you will ask where we are on the CEO search. As you know, we formed a search committee of the board and they have been working with one of the top executives [indiscernible] to help us find a new CEO. Currently, we are in the process of reviewing the candidates there, finding candidates with a combination of our attributes that we deem important for the whole is not really challenging as we expected it to be, but we remain confident that in due course we will find the right person for the job. 
Lastly, as the new culture takes hold and find roots in the company, you can see efforts in all parts of the business.

I have always viewed investors as my business partner. I hope that they will view me in the same way. 
As an organization, we strongly believe it is our duty to care for our shareholder and to ensure that we are ever flexible, responsible and transparent as we can be. We also believe in being proactive in reaching out to our investors to properly understand their requirement and ensure that in our investor relations effort we have -- we are as mindful of our shareholders as we are in our patients in our pharmacies or our customers and wholesalers.

As I said earlier, I am optimistic about the long-term future of our company and have made the significant financial commitment to our future not only as Executive Vice Chairman and Acting CEO but also as a significant shareholder. I am convinced that the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance is a unique first, which will almost inevitably lead to many other new firsts in our industry. It may not yet be clear, which steps are these will be, but we are determined to continue to show the way and be at the forefront of innovating health care. Our ambition is to build a generally global company and a universal health care champion.

The whole idea that for customers simpler for our teams and more faster and agile organizations was driving all of this and we'll keep on going as -- we'll keep on working the model and trading these processes the IT structures for new models.

And so the complex structure of delivering the medicines to the patients will have to be rationalized. And as a consequence, it's easy to believe that we will have additional synergies coming from M&A activities. This could be, of course, at the level of horizontal consolidation, but in many layers of the chain, the consolidation is still up and it's still quite advanced. So it's very likely that we will also see vertical consolidation, and the opportunities are there for everybody and we will see what happens about that. As I have said before, we want that to be as we have been in the past at the forefront of changes.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first ever earnings conference call for Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first ever earnings conference call for Walgreens Boots Alliance. 
Let me begin by underscoring how pleased we were to finally bring the 2 companies together on 31 December 2014. This was a historic and pivotal milestone for 2 iconic companies, Walgreens and Alliance Boots, as we completed our merger to establish Walgreens Boots Alliance, forging the new company, the world's first global pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise. 
We established a senior management team to bring together our businesses and lead them forward to the next phase of their evolution while making steady progress with the integration and the establishment of a single unified corporate identity and culture. 
Our team worked very hard to accelerate the closing of the deal 2 months ahead of the beginning of the completion window. We raised the funds to complete the transaction and to finance essentially all the AB debt in an efficient manner while going through a complicated process of preparing our first full consolidated earnings under U.S. GAAP, including eliminating the 3-month reporting lag. The complexity [ph] and effort these tasks have taken cannot be underestimated. I would ask you to remember that until completion, our businesses have to operate at arm's length as separate entities. We are today only 14 weeks, in fact 99 days, into the creation of this new global entity. It is still very early, but we have moved mountains in what we have done and are still in the first steps of our journey. 
We have achieved the merger in a short time and are moving quickly. We have expanded our restructuring program to create a more competitive cost structure, begun to access synergies created through the combination and sharpened our focus on our strategic priorities, including the sales of a majority interest of our infusion business subsequent to the quarter close. And today, I am pleased to announce a strong quarter, achieved along with all the other tasks that we have undertaken. We are looking forward to the future with enthusiasm.
Our transaction has created a group which, I believe, has enormous potential to grow in ways that give us great excitement and optimism for the future. Let's start by looking at our business as we stand today. 
Based on an in-depth review of our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, I can say that Walgreens is on a sound structural footing. As you might expect, some parts are better than expected while others offer room for improvement. Our first priority is to understand the business fully, its interdependency and its differentiators. This exercise is under way, and we'll ensure we stay focused on what is truly important: delivering against the needs of our customers in a dependable yet innovative manner that provides us with sustainable and growing income a crucial part of our business. This will be achieved through a combination of efficient practice, [indiscernible] and insight, investments in our core business and innovation in our business model. From what we have seen already, we believe there to  be significant scope to enhance the performance of our pharmacies through refreshing and differentiating our store, improving customer experience, delivering products and services to customers and patients and introducing new offerings through innovative partnership. We believe that through good business practice and the application of these and other initiatives, we can over time expand the retail margin, grow market share and prepare ourselves to better address the competitive and market-driven headwinds we face in certain areas of our business. 
Let me be perfectly clear. Our aim is to help Walgreens further develop strategies that will continue to deliver growth for many years to come. It is vital that we make best use of the assets that we have, core to which is our unrivaled portfolio of locations across the U.S. We must work tirelessly to drive the best possible return from these assets. And to that end, we have today announced an enlarged but necessary restructuring program to focus the Walgreens business back on its core assets. We believe we will come out of this stronger and better positioned to deliver enhanced performance that our premium locations should command. 
In Retail Pharmacy International in Boots, we are working hard to refine the new cycle of our business that will deliver growth in the coming year. We are continuing to develop our online offering and building on our recent successes. We are working to further integrate these with our physical stores and logistical network to enhance the customer choice while making better use of our resources. The constant work to keep our offering fresh through innovation within store and within our own brand and exclusive product portfolio is continuing to differentiate us in the extremely competitive U.K. retail market. I'm confident that the work which Simon and his team are doing will set us on a path for further growth in the years ahead. 
As you're aware, our retail businesses are also continuing to perform well, and it has been a particular pleasure to welcome our new colleagues in Mexico and Chile to our company, making the expansion of our international retail presence in Latin America through their vision of 2 outstanding businesses with excellent prospects for growth. 
Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division is continuing to develop the integrated business model that we introduced many years ago, operating an ever-growing suite of services to the manufacturers that tie up most growth than ever to them as partners. On the other side of the supply chain, we are expanding our offering to our pharmacies customers to both align them more globally with our -- the wholesalers and let them improve the quality and economics of their own businesses. While such initiative enhance the vertical integration of our wholesale businesses and create strength and value, the ever-changing market that we are operating in and the continuous economic pressure that health care systems are under present us with several opportunities to expand our network. 
These present themselves in many ways. In one extreme, through consolidation within markets; and at the other extreme, through innovative partnerships and alliance systems, as you have seen us to do with AmerisourceBergen. As wholesale is a business that is enhanced by volume and market presence, we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our network as they arise. Underpinning all of these, Walgreens Boots Alliance has embarked on the beginning of a new year, a new year that will bring a new attitude, a new culture aligned toward driving performance, serving our customers and creating long-term, sustainable shareholder value. 
Now I will ask George to take us through the quarterly results. George?"

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Today, I would like to cover the following 3 topics: first, to provide detail on our fiscal 2015 second quarter performance; second, to provide you with an overview of our restructuring program; and finally, to articulate our views on FY '15 and FY '16 results. 
To summarize, the second quarter was a solid start for our new company. Key highlights include net sales of $26.6 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 while adjusted EPS was $1.18, cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion. The quarter's financial results are complicated as we began reporting as a consolidated entity partly through the quarter and the comparability to last year is a challenge and of limited use. 
Before we get into the details of our second quarter financial performance, I'd like to explain some elements of our new reporting structure. Historically, Walgreens has reported as one segment, which consisted of the results of Walgreens in the USA; its corporate costs; synergies from the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development joint venture, also known as WBAD; and equity earnings from Alliance Boots on a 3-month lag. Our focus was to merge the businesses as soon as possible and eliminate the 3-month reporting lag. This aligns the reporting -- the reported results of the global enterprise and will make our performance easier to understand going forward. 
As Walgreens Boots Alliance, we now report results in 3 segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD and combined corporate costs. Within our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, since the deal closed on December 31, we have reported 1 month of Alliance Boots equity income this quarter versus 3 months in the comparable quarter a year ago, recognizing the 45% stake that Walgreens had in Alliance Boots until end December. The months of January and February are fully consolidated. Year-over-year comparisons of results required consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable. 
So now let me take you through our financials in greater detail, beginning with the consolidated results. 
For the quarter, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were just over $2 billion or $1.93 per diluted share, while adjusted and earnings were $1.2 billion or $1.18 per diluted share. This compares to $0.74 of GAAP net earnings per share and $0.97 of adjusted earnings per share in the prior year quarter. 
Net sales in the second quarter were $26.6 billion, an increase of 35.5% versus the prior year. 
Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion and on an adjusted basis was $1.8 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment as well as the consolidation of Alliance Boots' results for January and February. 
We reported $144 million of net interest expense this quarter, which included interest expense associated with prefunding the transaction for the month of December. Consistent with last quarter, our adjusted EPS excludes this interest expense, which we'll not need to do going forward. 
The adjusted tax rate for this quarter was 27.7%. Now this has been impacted by a number of factors, including a change in the geographic mix of forecast profits now that Alliance Boots has been fully consolidated, includes net discrete tax benefits specific to the quarter and the presentation of Alliance Boots' taxes in the income statement. Prior to the full merger, Walgreens 45% share of Alliance Boots' adjusted results, net of Alliance Boots' tax, were presented in a single line within operating income. Now following the transaction, Alliance Boots' tax is reported within the income tax provision line in our income statement, impacting the calculation of the adjusted tax rate. 
Diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion and average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 1.05 billion resulting from the issuance of 144 million shares on 31st December as part of the consideration for Alliance Boots. 
So now let me walk you through the component pieces to explain the change from GAAP to adjusted EPS. The GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $1.93 reconciles to an adjusted earnings per share of $1.18. The net adjustment of $0.75 per share, this reflects the removal of net gains on transaction-related item of $0.67 and gains on the warrants we hold over AmerisourceBergen shares of $0.35. This is partially offset by LIFO provision costs of $0.04; acquisition-related amortization expenses of $0.15, which includes $0.08 relating to an -- to the inventory step-up which will not reoccur in future quarters; and special items of $0.08 related to optimization costs and asset impairments. 
The components of the net gain on transaction-related items were a gain on Walgreens' previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots of $0.77; a foreign currency hedge loss of $0.07 related to the delivery of the British pound element of the Step 2 consideration; and a net $0.03 cost of transaction fees, tax adjustments and interest costs from prefunding the cash consideration. 
So next, I'd like to provide insights into financial results at the segmental level, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Reported net sales were $21 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable store basis. In the pharmacy, comparable store scripts, which includes immunizations, this increased 5% on a 30-day adjusted basis. The increase was driven by the positive impact of a strong cough, cold and flu season; by continued growth in Medicare Part D scripts; and positive underlying share trends. For the quarter ending 28 February, the division's 30-day adjusted retail prescription market share in the U.S. reached 19.3%, as reported by IMS Health. This represents an increase of 20 basis points versus the same time last year. In retail products, comparable store sales increased by 2.5%. This was partially driven by strong December holiday sales, including seasonal sales of cough, cold and flu products. 
GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion while adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 13.4% over the year-ago quarter. Strong expense control and efficiencies offset the expected pharmacy gross margin pressure from declines in reimbursement, generic drug inflation as well as the Med Part D rate step-down that began on the 1st of January this year. 
Retail product margins increased this quarter, helped by seasonal and cough, cold, flu mix as well as our focus on reducing less profitable promotions. We remain very pleased with the progress on controlling and reducing SG&A expenses this quarter. Our GAAP SG&A expense declined 0.3% compared to the prior year quarter. 
So next, let's review the Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries. The biggest contributor is Boots in the U.K. 
Total sales for the 2 months ended February were just over $2 billion. As the businesses included in our Retail Pharmacy International division were acquired as part of the merger with Alliance Boots, no comparable information is included in the WBA consolidated results. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable sales for January and February grew by 2.9%. Comparable sales of Boots U.K. were up 2.3% while sales in our businesses in Chile and Mexico, which we acquired by Alliance -- acquired by Alliance Boots back in August 2014, these were up 2.9%. The acquisition brings us over 1,000 stores in Mexico and over 400 in Chile and provides strong growth opportunities in the Latin American market. The inclusion of these businesses in the division, combined with contract manufacturing, are reflected in the margins. 
Now turning to Pharmaceutical Wholesale, which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand in 12 countries. Results in any given quarter are influenced by performance in larger geographies, including the U.K., Germany, France and Turkey and the division's contribution from WBAD. 
Total sales for the 2 months ending February were $3.9 billion. Similar to Retail Pharmacy International, our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division was acquired through the merger with Alliance Boots, and so no amounts are reported in the comparable period. However, on a pro forma constant currency basis, sales were relatively flat compared with the same period the prior year. 
Now let me spend a minute on our expectations for synergies and how they will be reported going forward. Prior to the merger, the majority of our synergies were flowing through WBAD, the former joint venture between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, which Walgreens fully consolidated and then removed Alliance Boots' portion via the noncontrolling interest line item. Following the combination, we're allocating all synergies, including those generated by WBAD, to the segments, and we're doing this according to the relative proportion of purchases driving the synergy benefits. 
With regard to performance in the quarter, combined net synergies were $170 million, bringing the fiscal year-to-date total to $310 million, driven primarily by our drug procurement efforts. We remain comfortable with our ability to achieve at least $650 million in combined synergies this fiscal year. For FY '16, we continue to expect at least $1 billion in combined quantifiable net synergies. Consistent with prior reporting, these synergies do not include any benefit from our AmerisourceBergen relationship. 
Now that we're a combined company, as expected we are focusing on driving incremental synergies from sharing our best practices and working more closely together. However, not all of these can be easily quantified as some of them tend to blend into our normal business.
So moving on to the cash flows. We generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash from operations during the quarter, and our free cash flow was $1.0 billion. We're pleased with the cash generation during the second quarter due in part to an improvement in our primary working capital within our Retail Pharmacy USA division, driven by a reduction in inventory levels. We will continue to focus on working capital and remain confident in future opportunities to increase efficiencies. 
Net debt as of the quarter end was $14.1 billion. 
With regard to uses of free cash flow beyond reinvestment back into the company, we completed $94 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization. We purchased additional shares post the end of the quarter under preestablished trading plans, bringing the total purchases to $330 million.
I'd now like to make a few comments on our capital allocation policy. As we've consistently communicated, we remain committed to a solid investment-grade rating while looking for ways to enhance our cash generation. This includes driving working capital efficiencies, tightening capital expenditures, controlling costs and, of course, improving operations. Beyond maintaining a long-term 30% to 35% dividend payout target, our top priorities for free cash include M&A consistent with our strategy and share buybacks. All of these are with a view to optimizing long-term shareholder value. 
Following on this theme, and as Stefano mentioned, we are focused on becoming a more agile and more productive company. As you know, in August 2014, we announced a 3-year $1 billion cost reduction initiative. After a rigorous analysis, we've identified additional opportunities for cost savings primarily in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. These additional cost opportunities will increase the total expected cost savings program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. So moving to areas of focus, they include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.A., to reorganize corporate and field operations, drive operating efficiencies and streamline information technology and other functions. These actions are designed to restructure and invest in our company's future in a way that is better for customers, simpler for our employees, resulting in a faster and more agile organization. 
We estimate that total pretax charges associated with this program to our GAAP financial results will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, of which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. The restructuring charges will be recognized over time as the program is implemented in accordance with GAAP. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on other areas of cost reduction. 
So now let's talk about the rest of fiscal 2015. We understand and appreciate that there are lots of factors that will impact our results. So in order to help you, we are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Now this range assumes quarterly interest expense of $140 million to $150 million. It assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29% and a fiscal year diluted share count generally consistent with the current quarter. It assumes management's estimates for foreign exchange rates that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year. Now this guidance also includes recast fiscal Q1 results due to the elimination of the 3-month lag. Finally, you will see an increase in the share count in Q3 and Q4 due to the full inclusion of the 144 million shares issued with Step 2 of the AB transaction. This will result in approximately 1.1 billion diluted shares per quarter. Any additional share repurchases will impact, of course, the fiscal year diluted share count. 
So moving on to FY '16. Our previously published goals were based on a variety of assumptions to arrive at estimate ranges for both sales and adjusted EPS. These included operating assumptions for our businesses and certain below-the-line items, including interest, tax and share count. When we set the goals in August, we made foreign currency assumptions based on exchange rates that were close to market rates at that time. Since then, we've seen significant global currency movements, especially the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Because we report in U.S. dollars, we do have currency translational exposures primarily based on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Simply put, a stronger dollar hurts our sales and earnings in dollars while a weaker dollar helps them. We estimate that a 1% move in the pound sterling versus the dollar from current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. Despite the FX headwind, I'm confident that we have initiatives and resources in place to address the controllable elements that drive our adjusted EPS goal for FY '16. 
Our revenues have greater potential variability due to the varied mix of businesses, particularly in our Wholesale division, which accounts for a significant proportion of our overall revenue. In addition, the geographical spread of the Wholesale business increases its exposure to currency variations. This being the case, we view overall revenue as a less relevant measure of our business. So taking these 2 factors into account, we decided to no longer provide our published revenue goal. And please note that our forward-looking statements assume no significant changes to the current exchange rates. 
So I'd like to wrap up today by saying that our reporting structure has changed and comparability is limited, which I know makes it really difficult for you. Therefore, in an effort to be as informative as possible, we've provided adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal year 2015. And next week, we'll have a financial session to provide further insights. In addition, we plan to provide operational insights in each of our 3 segments as well as views on our key financial drivers and future strategy. We really look forward to seeing you then. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Stefano."

We are working to deliver the benefits of our transaction within our core businesses. These will involve executing our synergies and efficiency programs across the group, including the progressive development of our procurement initiatives. We must also properly manage the assets of the business to ensure we are [indiscernible] structured and prepared to address the pressures we face as the pharmacy markets evolve. These pressures may variously be from reimbursement cuts, competitive action or simply changes in consumer behavior. Whatever form they take, if we are properly structured and prepared, operating an efficient, high-quality, patient-oriented pharmacy service, that we will earn the right not just to participate but to be an architect of the changes in our market. We are already seeing the benefits that can be achieved in retail with the initiatives under way at Walgreens and ongoing at Boots. We must ensure that we get the best return for our investment and create the best environment for our employees and customers alike. This will require us to operate enhanced systems and control so that we can monitor and manage our business properly. 
Now many of you have asked where we are on the CEO search. As you know, we formed a search committee of the board and they have been working with one of the top executive recruiting firms to help us find a new CEO. Currently, we are in the process of reviewing the candidates they have proposed. Finding candidates with the combination of attributes that we deem important for the role is not really challenging as we expected that -- it to be. But we remain confident that in due course, we will find the right person for the job. 
Lastly, as the new culture takes hold and find roots in a company, you can see echoes [ph] of it in all parts of the business. I hope that in one particular area, you are seeing the new culture emerge very clearly and that -- and the easy [ph] now approach to our owners and the financial community in general. I have always viewed investors as my business partner, and I hope that they will view me in the same way. 
As an organization, we strongly believe it is our duty to care for our shareholders and to ensure that we are as accessible, responsive and transparent as we can be. We also believe in being proactive in reaching out to our investors to properly understand their requirements and to ensure that in our investor relations effort, we have as mindful -- we are as mindful of our shareholders as we are of the patients in our pharmacies or our customers in wholesale. I think that Gerald and his team have done well to demonstrate this new [indiscernible], and it is a great pleasure to see, although there is still more to do. We are in the first steps of a long and exciting path, and I look forward to carving [ph] it with you as fellow owners and partners. 
As I said earlier, I am optimistic about the long-term future of our company and have made a significant personal commitment to our future not only as the Executive Vice Chairman and acting CEO but also as a significant shareholder. I am convinced that the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance is a unique first, which will almost inevitably lead to many other new firsts in our industry. It may not yet be clear which steps these will be, but we are determined to continue to show the way and be at the forefront of innovating health care. Our ambition is to build a generally global company and a universal health care champion. We look forward to providing a more comprehensive outlook on our future strategy and value creation next week at our first Analyst Day. 
With that, we are now ready to take your questions."

We've been really successful. The team has done a great job in Walgreens in terms of being able to find cost savings that do not affect the customer. The most pleasing thing about this beyond these cost savings is the fact that we're still growing volume ahead of the market, both in pharmacy and in retail products. And also, we're seeing internally our measure in cost of the delay improving. The whole idea of better for customers, simpler for our teams and more faster, agile organization is what's driving all of this, and we'll keep on going as we'll keep on working the old model and trading these processes, the IT structures for new model. So yes, we're delighted with the SG&A savings in this quarter and they are materially better than the SG&A last year.

The reality is that, as I have said many times and I have realized immediately after being for 2 weeks in the job, is that this market, the American market, is ready for another round of consolidation because the margins are squeezed everywhere. The government is more and more in charge for the cost of the health care business. And so for sure, they will exercise their power to squeeze the costs as much as possible, as we have seen in Europe for decades. And so the complex structure of the -- of delivering the medicines to the patients will have to be rationalized. And as a consequence, it's easy to believe that we will have additional synergies coming from M&A activities. These could be, of course, at the level of horizontal consolidation. But in many layers of the chain, the consolidation is still up and is still quite advanced. So it's very likely that we'll see also vertical consolidation. And the opportunities are there for everybody, and we will see what happens. But as I have said before, we want to be, as we have been in the past, at the forefront of changes.

And I also think it's about the right cash and the right returns per store basis. This is a very individual store-based decision. And of course, the stores which are potentially going to be closed, we have looked carefully at the markets today and the numbers of customers in them and how they shop in that market and also how the population explodes [ph] over the course of these stores being open. And  we've seen stores which really the population is moving away from and there's less future opportunity than today."

And importantly, you improve service levels. So again, we'll continue to work at this. There are more opportunities and we'll do in a really balanced way to make sure that we care for customers first, get it right going forward and reduce working capital out. And I'm confident that the working relationship with ABC will continue to improve. And of course, working in Europe, as I did before with Ronald [ph] and the team in Alliance Healthcare, we really worked as well for a number of years and saw more and more opportunities which comes through very clearly in the U.K. business performance for both the Wholesale and the Boots division."

So there are many ways to deliver synergies. And of course, we are open to any kind of organization which can improve the value of our company, and we are analyzing many, many different alternatives. And of course, it depends also on the maturity of the potential partner, from the willingness they have to do something with us.

And if -- when you have such a vast territory, such a high number of stores, that  inevitably you will have some stores which have been maybe profitable in the past and are not particularly exciting today, and you will need to open stores in areas which didn't even exist in the past. So the reality, you see a certain concentration which is still small because a few hundred out of 8,300 stores is not a big number, but you'll see it's a certain concentration because this program has not been done in the past in an orderly fashion.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first ever earnings conference call for Walgreens Boots Alliance. 
Let me begin by underscoring how pleased we were to finally bring the 2 companies together on 31 December 2014. This was a historic and pivotal milestone for 2 iconic companies, Walgreens and Alliance Boots, as we completed our merger to establish Walgreens Boots Alliance, forging the new company, the world's first global pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise. 
We established a senior management team to bring together our businesses and lead them forward to the next phase of their evolution while making steady progress with the integration and the establishment of a single unified corporate identity and culture. 
Our team worked very hard to accelerate the closing of the deal 2 months ahead of the beginning of the completion window. We raised the funds to complete the transaction and refinance essentially all the AB debt in an efficient manner while going through a complicated process of preparing our first full consolidated earnings under U.S. GAAP, including eliminating the 3-month reporting lag. The complexity and effort these tasks have taken cannot be underestimated. I would ask you to remember that until completion, our businesses have to operate at arm's length as separate entities. We are today only 14 weeks, in fact 99 days, into the creation of this new global entity. It is still very early, but we have moved mountains in what we have done and are still in the first steps of our journey. 
We have achieved much in a short time and are moving quickly. We have expanded our restructuring program to create a more competitive cost structure, begun to access synergies created through the combination and sharpened our focus on our strategic priorities, including the sales of a majority interest of our infusion business subsequent to the quarter close. And today, I am pleased to announce a strong quarter, achieved along with all the other tasks that we have undertaken. We are looking forward to the future with enthusiasm.
Our transaction has created a group which, I believe, has enormous potential to grow in ways that give us great excitement and optimism for the future. Let's start by looking at our business as we stand today. 
Based on an in-depth review of our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, I can say that Walgreens is on a sound structural footing. As you might expect, some parts are better than expected while others offer room for improvement. Our first priority is to understand the business fully, its interdependency and its differentiators. This exercise is under way, and we'll ensure we stay focused on what is truly important: delivering against the needs of our customers in a dependable yet innovative manner that provides us with sustainable and growing income across all parts of our business. This will be achieved through a combination of efficient practice, research and insight, investments in our core business and innovation in our business model. From what we have seen already, we believe there to be significant scope to enhance the performance of our pharmacies through refreshing and differentiating our store, improving customer experience, delivering products and services to customers and patients and introducing new offerings through innovative partnership. We believe that through good business practice and the application of these and other initiatives, we can over time expand the retail margin, grow market share and prepare ourselves to better address the competitive and market-driven headwinds we face in certain areas of our business. 
Let me be perfectly clear. Our aim is to help Walgreens further develop strategies that will continue to deliver growth for many years to come. It is vital that we make best use of the assets that we have, core to which is our unrivaled portfolio of locations across the U.S. We must work tirelessly to drive the best possible return from these assets. And to that end, we have today announced an enlarged but necessary restructuring program to focus the Walgreens business back on its core assets. We believe we will come out of this stronger and better positioned to deliver enhanced performance that our premium locations should command. 
In Retail Pharmacy International in Boots, we are working hard to refine the new cycle of our business that will deliver growth in the coming year. We are continuing to develop our online offering and building on our recent successes. We are working to further integrate these with our physical stores and logistical network to enhance the customer choice while making better use of our resources. The constant work to keep our offering fresh through innovation within store and within our own brand and exclusive product portfolio is continuing to differentiate us in the extremely competitive U.K. retail market. I'm confident that the work which Simon and his team are doing will set us on a path for further growth in the years ahead. 
As you're aware, our retail businesses are also continuing to perform well, and it has been a particular pleasure to welcome our new colleagues in Mexico and Chile to our company, making the expansion of our international retail presence in Latin America through their vision of 2 outstanding businesses with excellent prospects for growth. 
Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division is continuing to develop the integrated business model that we introduced many years ago, operating an ever-growing suite of services to the manufacturers that tie up most growth than ever to them as partners. On the other side of the supply chain, we are expanding our offering to our pharmacies customers to both align them more globally with our -- the wholesalers and let them improve the quality and economics of their own businesses. While such initiative enhance the vertical integration of our wholesale businesses and create strength and value, the ever-changing market that we are operating in and the continuous economic pressure that health care systems are under present us with several opportunities to expand our network. 
These present themselves in many ways. In one extreme, through consolidation within markets; and at the other extreme, through innovative partnerships and alliance systems, as you have seen us to do with AmerisourceBergen. As wholesale is a business that is enhanced by volume and market presence, we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our network as they arise. Underpinning all of these, Walgreens Boots Alliance has embarked on the beginning of a new year, a new year that will bring a new attitude, a new culture aligned toward driving performance, serving our customers and creating long-term, sustainable shareholder value. 
Now I will ask George to take us through the quarterly results. George?"

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Today, I would like to cover the following 3 topics: first, to provide detail on our fiscal 2015 second quarter performance; second, to provide you with an overview of our restructuring program; and finally, to articulate our views on FY '15 and FY '16 results. 
To summarize, the second quarter was a solid start for our new company. Key highlights include net sales of $26.6 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 while adjusted EPS was $1.18, cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion. The quarter's financial results are complicated as we began reporting as a consolidated entity partly through the quarter and the comparability to last year is a challenge and of limited use. 
Before we get into the details of our second quarter financial performance, I'd like to explain some elements of our new reporting structure. Historically, Walgreens has reported as one segment, which consisted of the results of Walgreens in the USA; its corporate costs; synergies from the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development joint venture, also known as WBAD; and equity earnings from Alliance Boots on a 3-month lag. Our focus was to merge the businesses as soon as possible and eliminate the 3-month reporting lag. This aligns the reporting -- the reported results of the global enterprise and will make our performance easier to understand going forward. 
As Walgreens Boots Alliance, we now report results in 3 segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD and combined corporate costs. Within our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, since the deal closed on December 31, we have reported 1 month of Alliance Boots equity income this quarter versus 3 months in the comparable quarter a year ago, recognizing the 45% stake that Walgreens had in Alliance Boots until end December. The months of January and February are fully consolidated. Year-over-year comparisons of results required consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable. 
So now let me take you through our financials in greater detail, beginning with the consolidated results. 
For the quarter, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were just over $2 billion or $1.93 per diluted share, while adjusted and earnings were $1.2 billion or $1.18 per diluted share. This compares to $0.74 of GAAP net earnings per share and $0.97 of adjusted earnings per share in the prior year quarter. 
Net sales in the second quarter were $26.6 billion, an increase of 35.5% versus the prior year. 
Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion and on an adjusted basis was $1.8 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment as well as the consolidation of Alliance Boots' results for January and February. 
We reported $144 million of net interest expense this quarter, which included interest expense associated with prefunding the transaction for the month of December. Consistent with last quarter, our adjusted EPS excludes this interest expense, which we'll not need to do going forward. 
The adjusted tax rate for this quarter was 27.7%. Now this has been impacted by a number of factors, including a change in the geographic mix of forecast profits now that Alliance Boots has been fully consolidated, includes net discrete tax benefits specific to the quarter and the presentation of Alliance Boots' taxes in the income statement. Prior to the full merger, Walgreens 45% share of Alliance Boots' adjusted results, net of Alliance Boots' tax, were presented in a single line within operating income. Now following the transaction, Alliance Boots' tax is reported within the income tax provision line in our income statement, impacting the calculation of the adjusted tax rate. 
Diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion and average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 1.05 billion resulting from the issuance of 144 million shares on 31st December as part of the consideration for Alliance Boots. 
So now let me walk you through the component pieces to explain the change from GAAP to adjusted EPS. The GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $1.93 reconciles to an adjusted earnings per share of $1.18. The net adjustment of $0.75 per share, this reflects the removal of net gains on transaction-related item of $0.67 and gains on the warrants we hold over AmerisourceBergen shares of $0.35. This is partially offset by LIFO provision costs of $0.04; acquisition-related amortization expenses of $0.15, which includes $0.08 relating to an -- to the inventory step-up which will not reoccur in future quarters; and special items of $0.08 related to optimization costs and asset impairments. 
The components of the net gain on transaction-related items were a gain on Walgreens' previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots of $0.77; a foreign currency hedge loss of $0.07 related to the delivery of the British pound element of the Step 2 consideration; and a net $0.03 cost of transaction fees, tax adjustments and interest costs from prefunding the cash consideration. 
So next, I'd like to provide insights into financial results at the segmental level, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Reported net sales were $21 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable store basis. In the pharmacy, comparable store scripts, which includes immunizations, this increased 5% on a 30-day adjusted basis. The increase was driven by the positive impact of a strong cough, cold and flu season; by continued growth in Medicare Part D scripts; and positive underlying share trends. For the quarter ending 28 February, the division's 30-day adjusted retail prescription market share in the U.S. reached 19.3%, as reported by IMS Health. This represents an increase of 20 basis points versus the same time last year. In retail products, comparable store sales increased by 2.5%. This was partially driven by strong December holiday sales, including seasonal sales of cough, cold and flu products. 
GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion while adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 13.4% over the year-ago quarter. Strong expense control and efficiencies offset the expected pharmacy gross margin pressure from declines in reimbursement, generic drug inflation as well as the Med Part D rate step-down that began on the 1st of January this year. 
Retail product margins increased this quarter, helped by seasonal and cough, cold, flu mix as well as our focus on reducing less profitable promotions. We remain very pleased with the progress on controlling and reducing SG&A expenses this quarter. Our GAAP SG&A expense declined 0.3% compared to the prior year quarter. 
So next, let's review the Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries. The biggest contributor is Boots in the U.K. 
Total sales for the 2 months ended February were just over $2 billion. As the businesses included in our Retail Pharmacy International division were acquired as part of the merger with Alliance Boots, no comparable information is included in the WBA consolidated results. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable sales for January and February grew by 2.9%. Comparable sales of Boots U.K. were up 2.3% while sales in our businesses in Chile and Mexico, which we acquired by Alliance -- acquired by Alliance Boots back in August 2014, these were up 2.9%. The acquisition brings us over 1,000 stores in Mexico and over 400 in Chile and provides strong growth opportunities in the Latin American market. The inclusion of these businesses in the division, combined with contract manufacturing, are reflected in the margins. 
Now turning to Pharmaceutical Wholesale, which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand in 12 countries. Results in any given quarter are influenced by performance in larger geographies, including the U.K., Germany, France and Turkey and the division's contribution from WBAD. 
Total sales for the 2 months ending February were $3.9 billion. Similar to Retail Pharmacy International, our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division was acquired through the merger with Alliance Boots, and so no amounts are reported in the comparable period. However, on a pro forma constant currency basis, sales were relatively flat compared with the same period the prior year. 
Now let me spend a minute on our expectations for synergies and how they will be reported going forward. Prior to the merger, the majority of our synergies were flowing through WBAD, the former joint venture between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, which Walgreens fully consolidated and then removed Alliance Boots' portion via the noncontrolling interest line item. Following the combination, we're allocating all synergies, including those generated by WBAD, to the segments, and we're doing this according to the relative proportion of purchases driving the synergy benefits. 
With regard to performance in the quarter, combined net synergies were $170 million, bringing the fiscal year-to-date total to $310 million, driven primarily by our drug procurement efforts. We remain comfortable with our ability to achieve at least $650 million in combined synergies this fiscal year. For FY '16, we continue to expect at least $1 billion in combined quantifiable net synergies. Consistent with prior reporting, these synergies do not include any benefit from our AmerisourceBergen relationship. 
Now that we're a combined company, as expected we are focusing on driving incremental synergies from sharing our best practices and working more closely together. However, not all of these can be easily quantified as some of them tend to blend into our normal business.
So moving on to the cash flows. We generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash from operations during the quarter, and our free cash flow was $1.0 billion. We're pleased with the cash generation during the second quarter due in part to an improvement in our primary working capital within our Retail Pharmacy USA division, driven by a reduction in inventory levels. We will continue to focus on working capital and remain confident in future opportunities to increase efficiencies. 
Net debt as of the quarter end was $14.1 billion. 
With regard to uses of free cash flow beyond reinvestment back into the company, we completed $94 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization. We purchased additional shares post the end of the quarter under preestablished trading plans, bringing the total purchases to $330 million.
I'd now like to make a few comments on our capital allocation policy. As we've consistently communicated, we remain committed to a solid investment-grade rating while looking for ways to enhance our cash generation. This includes driving working capital efficiencies, tightening capital expenditures, controlling costs and, of course, improving operations. Beyond maintaining a long-term 30% to 35% dividend payout target, our top priorities for free cash include M&A consistent with our strategy and share buybacks. All of these are with a view to optimizing long-term shareholder value. 
Following on this theme, and as Stefano mentioned, we are focused on becoming a more agile and more productive company. As you know, in August 2014, we announced a 3-year $1 billion cost reduction initiative. After a rigorous analysis, we've identified additional opportunities for cost savings primarily in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. These additional cost opportunities will increase the total expected cost savings program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. So moving to areas of focus, they include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.A., to reorganize corporate and field operations, drive operating efficiencies and streamline information technology and other functions. These actions are designed to restructure and invest in our company's future in a way that is better for customers, simpler for our employees, resulting in a faster and more agile organization. 
We estimate that total pretax charges associated with this program to our GAAP financial results will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, of which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. The restructuring charges will be recognized over time as the program is implemented in accordance with GAAP. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on other areas of cost reduction. 
So now let's talk about the rest of fiscal 2015. We understand and appreciate that there are lots of factors that will impact our results. So in order to help you, we are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Now this range assumes quarterly interest expense of $140 million to $150 million. It assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29% and a fiscal year diluted share count generally consistent with the current quarter. It assumes management's estimates for foreign exchange rates that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year. Now this guidance also includes recast fiscal Q1 results due to the elimination of the 3-month lag. Finally, you will see an increase in the share count in Q3 and Q4 due to the full inclusion of the 144 million shares issued with Step 2 of the AB transaction. This will result in approximately 1.1 billion diluted shares per quarter. Any additional share repurchases will impact, of course, the fiscal year diluted share count. 
So moving on to FY '16. Our previously published goals were based on a variety of assumptions to arrive at estimate ranges for both sales and adjusted EPS. These included operating assumptions for our businesses and certain below-the-line items, including interest, tax and share count. When we set the goals in August, we made foreign currency assumptions based on exchange rates that were close to market rates at that time. Since then, we've seen significant global currency movements, especially the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Because we report in U.S. dollars, we do have currency translational exposures primarily based on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Simply put, a stronger dollar hurts our sales and earnings in dollars while a weaker dollar helps them. We estimate that a 1% move in the pound sterling versus the dollar from current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. Despite the FX headwind, I'm confident that we have initiatives and resources in place to address the controllable elements that drive our adjusted EPS goal for FY '16. 
Our revenues have greater potential variability due to the varied mix of businesses, particularly in our Wholesale division, which accounts for a significant proportion of our overall revenue. In addition, the geographical spread of the Wholesale business increases its exposure to currency variations. This being the case, we view overall revenue as a less relevant measure of our business. So taking these 2 factors into account, we decided to no longer provide our published revenue goal. And please note that our forward-looking statements assume no significant changes to the current exchange rates. 
So I'd like to wrap up today by saying that our reporting structure has changed and comparability is limited, which I know makes it really difficult for you. Therefore, in an effort to be as informative as possible, we've provided adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal year 2015. And next week, we'll have a financial session to provide further insights. In addition, we plan to provide operational insights in each of our 3 segments as well as views on our key financial drivers and future strategy. We really look forward to seeing you then. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Stefano."

We are working to deliver the benefits of our transaction within our core businesses. These will involve executing our synergies and efficiency programs across the group, including the progressive development of our procurement initiatives. We must also properly manage the assets of the business to ensure we are suitably structured and prepared to address the pressures we face as the pharmacy markets evolve. These pressures may variously be from reimbursement cuts, competitive action or simply changes in consumer behavior. Whatever form they take, if we are properly structured and prepared, operating an efficient, high-quality, patient-oriented pharmacy service, that we will earn the right not just to participate but to be an architect of the changes in our market. We are already seeing the benefits that can be achieved in retail with the initiatives under way at Walgreens and ongoing at Boots. We must ensure that we get the best return for our investment and create the best environment for our employees and customers alike. This will require us to operate enhanced systems and control so that we can monitor and manage our business properly. 
Now many of you have asked where we are on the CEO search. As you know, we formed a search committee of the board and they have been working with one of the top executive recruiting firms to help us find a new CEO. Currently, we are in the process of reviewing the candidates they have proposed. Finding candidates with the combination of attributes that we deem important for the role is naturally challenging as we expected that -- it to be. But we remain confident that in due course, we will find the right person for the job. 
Lastly, as the new culture takes hold and finds roots in a company, you can see echoes of it in all parts of the business. I hope that in one particular area, you are seeing the new culture emerge very clearly and that -- and the different [ph] now approach to our owners and the financial community in general. I have always viewed investors as my business partner, and I hope that they will view me in the same way. 
As an organization, we strongly believe it is our duty to care for our shareholders and to ensure that we are as accessible, responsive and transparent as we can be. We also believe in being proactive in reaching out to our investors to properly understand their requirements and to ensure that in our investor relations effort, we have as mindful -- we are as mindful of our shareholders as we are of the patients in our pharmacies or our customers in wholesale. I think that Gerald and his team have done well to demonstrate this new [indiscernible], and it is a great pleasure to see, although there is still more to do. We are in the first steps of a long and exciting path, and I look forward to traveling it with you as fellow owners and partners. 
As I said earlier, I am optimistic about the long-term future of our company and have made a significant personal commitment to our future not only as the Executive Vice Chairman and acting CEO but also as a significant shareholder. I am convinced that the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance is a unique first, which will almost inevitably lead to many other new firsts in our industry. It may not yet be clear which steps these will be, but we are determined to continue to show the way and be at the forefront of innovating health care. Our ambition is to build a generally global company and a universal health care champion. We look forward to providing a more comprehensive outlook on our future strategy and value creation next week at our first Analyst Day. 
With that, we are now ready to take your questions."

And also, we're seeing internally our measure in cost of the delay improving.

And so for sure, they will exercise their power to squeeze the costs as much as possible, as we have seen in Europe for decades. And so the complex structure of the -- of delivering the medicines to the patients will have to be rationalized. And as a consequence, it's easy to believe that we will have additional synergies coming from M&A activities. These could be, of course, at the level of horizontal consolidation. But in many layers of the chain, the consolidation is still up and is still quite advanced. So it's very likely that we'll see also vertical consolidation.

And so that's -- so this has been driven really from implementation of Balance Rewards, the insights we're getting. And they're driving that through better tools to the merchants. So the merchant teams have done a really great job in terms of understanding more precisely where customers truly value promotions and where actually they don't. And you can see the growth in the front-end margin. You can also see the growth in product sales at the same time. So we've really been able to pull these 2 things off together. And we feel confident with the new tools we've got and the key tools we're developing going forward. Also a great hire. Linda, Linda Filler, has come into us. And again, Linda, we believe, will accelerate our journey given her tremendous experience in Walmart and Sam's Club in particular. So that feels pretty good. In terms of own brand penetration, we've created a new division within our organization, within Walgreens Boots Alliance, led by Ken Murphy. And again, we're able to think about how do we understand local insights in America and also global insights, and Ken will speak more about this next week, and how therefore do we get the right products and the right brands into the American consumers' hands in the drug store channel. Having said that, we've done a couple of things recently. We've issued 2 new masstige cosmetic brands, CIRCA and Colour Prevails. That's happened in the last 2 or 3 weeks. So we're not waiting for that to happen. We continue to work on the basis of growing own brand penetration. So I think in both fronts, we made good, solid progress and there's more to come."

So we're not valuing the industry -- the inventory at cost. So that gets -- what it does is it essentially artificially takes down the U.S. GAAP profit in those 2 divisions as a result.

So the reality, you see a certain concentration which is still small because a few hundred out of 8,300 stores is not a big number, but you'll see it's a certain concentration because this program has not been done in the past in an orderly fashion. In the future, once we have, let's say, recreated this new base, I believe we should every year look after -- review all the stores. And if we have -- every year, if we have to close 10 stores or 5 stores or 15 stores, we have to -- we will have to do it in order not to have this concentration of stores just in 1 year.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first ever earnings conference call for Walgreens Boots Alliance. Let me begin by underscoring how pleased we were to finally bring the 2 companies together on 31 December 2014. This was a hi",1109,"Thank you, Gerald. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first ever earnings conference call for Walgreens Boots Alliance. 
Let me begin by underscoring how pleased we were to finally bring the 2 companies together on 31 December 2014. This was a historic and pivotal milestone for 2 iconic companies, Walgreens and Alliance Boots, as we completed our merger to establish Walgreens Boots Alliance, forging the new company, the world's first global pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise. 
We established a senior management team to bring together our businesses and lead them forward to the next phase of their evolution while making steady progress with the integration and the establishment of a single unified corporate identity and culture. 
Our team worked very hard to accelerate the closing of the deal 2 months ahead of the beginning of the completion window. We raised the funds to complete the transaction and refinance essentially all the AB debt in an efficient manner while going through a complicated process of preparing our first full consolidated earnings under U.S. GAAP, including eliminating the 3-month reporting lag. The complexity and effort these tasks have taken cannot be underestimated. I would ask you to remember that until completion, our businesses have to operate at arm's length as separate entities. We are today only 14 weeks, in fact 99 days, into the creation of this new global entity. It is still very early, but we have moved mountains in what we have done and are still in the first steps of our journey. 
We have achieved much in a short time and are moving quickly. We have expanded our restructuring program to create a more competitive cost structure, begun to access synergies created through the combination and sharpened our focus on our strategic priorities, including the sales of a majority interest of our infusion business subsequent to the quarter close. And today, I am pleased to announce a strong quarter, achieved along with all the other tasks that we have undertaken. We are looking forward to the future with enthusiasm.
Our transaction has created a group which, I believe, has enormous potential to grow in ways that give us great excitement and optimism for the future. Let's start by looking at our business as we stand today. 
Based on an in-depth review of our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, I can say that Walgreens is on a sound structural footing. As you might expect, some parts are better than expected while others offer room for improvement. Our first priority is to understand the business fully, its interdependency and its differentiators. This exercise is under way, and we'll ensure we stay focused on what is truly important: delivering against the needs of our customers in a dependable yet innovative manner that provides us with sustainable and growing income across all parts of our business. This will be achieved through a combination of efficient practice, research and insight, investments in our core business and innovation in our business model. From what we have seen already, we believe there to be significant scope to enhance the performance of our pharmacies through refreshing and differentiating our store, improving customer experience, delivering products and services to customers and patients and introducing new offerings through innovative partnership. We believe that through good business practice and the application of these and other initiatives, we can over time expand the retail margin, grow market share and prepare ourselves to better address the competitive and market-driven headwinds we face in certain areas of our business. 
Let me be perfectly clear. Our aim is to help Walgreens further develop strategies that will continue to deliver growth for many years to come. It is vital that we make best use of the assets that we have, core to which is our unrivaled portfolio of locations across the U.S. We must work tirelessly to drive the best possible return from these assets. And to that end, we have today announced an enlarged but necessary restructuring program to focus the Walgreens business back on its core assets. We believe we will come out of this stronger and better positioned to deliver enhanced performance that our premium locations should command. 
In Retail Pharmacy International in Boots, we are working hard to refine the new cycle of our business that will deliver growth in the coming year. We are continuing to develop our online offering and building on our recent successes. We are working to further integrate these with our physical stores and logistical network to enhance the customer choice while making better use of our resources. The constant work to keep our offering fresh through innovation within store and within our own brand and exclusive product portfolio is continuing to differentiate us in the extremely competitive U.K. retail market. I'm confident that the work which Simon and his team are doing will set us on a path for further growth in the years ahead. 
As you're aware, our retail businesses are also continuing to perform well, and it has been a particular pleasure to welcome our new colleagues in Mexico and Chile to our company, making the expansion of our international retail presence in Latin America through their vision of 2 outstanding businesses with excellent prospects for growth. 
Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division is continuing to develop the integrated business model that we introduced many years ago, operating an ever-growing suite of services to the manufacturers that tie up most growth than ever to them as partners. On the other side of the supply chain, we are expanding our offering to our pharmacies customers to both align them more globally with our -- the wholesalers and let them improve the quality and economics of their own businesses. While such initiative enhance the vertical integration of our wholesale businesses and create strength and value, the ever-changing market that we are operating in and the continuous economic pressure that health care systems are under present us with several opportunities to expand our network. 
These present themselves in many ways. In one extreme, through consolidation within markets; and at the other extreme, through innovative partnerships and alliance systems, as you have seen us to do with AmerisourceBergen. As wholesale is a business that is enhanced by volume and market presence, we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our network as they arise. Underpinning all of these, Walgreens Boots Alliance has embarked on the beginning of a new year, a new year that will bring a new attitude, a new culture aligned toward driving performance, serving our customers and creating long-term, sustainable shareholder value. 
Now I will ask George to take us through the quarterly results. George?"
93624,283101937,788618,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2015",2015-04-09,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano.

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Today, I would like to cover the following 3 topics: first, to provide detail on our fiscal 2015 second quarter performance; second, to provide you with an overview of our restructuring program; and finally, to articulate our views on FY '15 and FY '16 results. 
To summarize, the second quarter was a solid start for our new company. Key highlights include net sales of $26.6 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 while adjusted EPS was $1.18, cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion. The quarter's financial results are complicated as we began reporting as a consolidated entity partly through the quarter and the comparability to last year is a challenge and of limited use. 
Before we get into the details of our second quarter financial performance, I'd like to explain some elements of our new reporting structure. Historically, Walgreens has reported as one segment, which consisted of the results of Walgreens in the USA; its corporate costs; synergies from the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development joint venture, also known as WBAD; and equity earnings from Alliance Boots on a 3-month lag. Our focus was to merge the businesses as soon as possible and eliminate the 3-month reporting lag. This aligns the reporting -- the reported results of the global enterprise and will make our performance easier to understand going forward. 
As Walgreens Boots Alliance, we now report results in 3 segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD and combined corporate costs. Within our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, since the deal closed on December 31, we have reported 1 month of Alliance Boots equity income this quarter versus 3 months in the comparable quarter a year ago, recognizing the 45% stake that Walgreens had in Alliance Boots until end December. The months of January and February are fully consolidated. Year-over-year comparisons of results required consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable. 
So now let me take you through our financials in greater detail, beginning with the consolidated results. 
For the quarter, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were just over $2 billion or $1.93 per diluted share, while adjusted and earnings were $1.2 billion or $1.18 per diluted share. This compares to $0.74 of GAAP net earnings per share and $0.97 of adjusted earnings per share in the prior year quarter. 
Net sales in the second quarter were $26.6 billion, an increase of 35.5% versus the prior year. 
Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion and on an adjusted basis was $1.8 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment as well as the consolidation of Alliance Boots' results for January and February. 
We reported $144 million of net interest expense this quarter, which included interest expense associated with prefunding the transaction for the month of December. Consistent with last quarter, our adjusted EPS excludes this interest expense, which we'll not need to do going forward. 
The adjusted tax rate for this quarter was 27.7%. Now this has been impacted by a number of factors, including a change in the geographic mix of forecast profits now that Alliance Boots has been fully consolidated, includes net discrete tax benefits specific to the quarter and the presentation of Alliance Boots' taxes in the income statement. Prior to the full merger, Walgreens 45% share of Alliance Boots' adjusted results, net of Alliance Boots' tax, were presented in a single line within operating income. Now following the transaction, Alliance Boots' tax is reported within the income tax provision line in our income statement, impacting the calculation of the adjusted tax rate. 
Diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion and average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 1.05 billion resulting from the issuance of 144 million shares on 31st December as part of the consideration for Alliance Boots. 
So now let me walk you through the component pieces to explain the change from GAAP to adjusted EPS. The GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $1.93 reconciles to an adjusted earnings per share of $1.18. The net adjustment of $0.75 per share, this reflects the removal of net gains on transaction-related item of $0.67 and gains on the warrants we hold over AmerisourceBergen shares of $0.35. This is partially offset by LIFO provision costs of $0.04; acquisition-related amortization expenses of $0.15, which includes $0.08 relating to an -- to the inventory step-up which will not reoccur in future quarters; and special items of $0.08 related to optimization costs and asset impairments. 
The components of the net gain on transaction-related items were a gain on Walgreens' previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots of $0.77; a foreign currency hedge loss of $0.07 related to the delivery of the British pound element of the Step 2 consideration; and a net $0.03 cost of transaction fees, tax adjustments and interest costs from prefunding the cash consideration. 
So next, I'd like to provide insights into financial results at the segmental level, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Reported net sales were $21 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable store basis. In the pharmacy, comparable store scripts, which includes immunizations, this increased 5% on a 30-day adjusted basis. The increase was driven by the positive impact of a strong cough, cold and flu season; by continued growth in Medicare Part D scripts; and positive underlying share trends. For the quarter ending 28 February, the division's 30-day adjusted retail prescription market share in the U.S. reached 19.3%, as reported by IMS Health. This represents an increase of 20 basis points versus the same time last year. In retail products, comparable store sales increased by 2.5%. This was partially driven by strong December holiday sales, including seasonal sales of cough, cold and flu products. 
GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion while adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 13.4% over the year-ago quarter. Strong expense control and efficiencies offset the expected pharmacy gross margin pressure from declines in reimbursement, generic drug inflation as well as the Med Part D rate step-down that began on the 1st of January this year. 
Retail product margins increased this quarter, helped by seasonal and cough, cold, flu mix as well as our focus on reducing less profitable promotions. We remain very pleased with the progress on controlling and reducing SG&A expenses this quarter. Our GAAP SG&A expense declined 0.3% compared to the prior year quarter. 
So next, let's review the Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries. The biggest contributor is Boots in the U.K. 
Total sales for the 2 months ended February were just over $2 billion. As the businesses included in our Retail Pharmacy International division were acquired as part of the merger with Alliance Boots, no comparable information is included in the WBA consolidated results. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable sales for January and February grew by 2.9%. Comparable sales of Boots U.K. were up 2.3% while sales in our businesses in Chile and Mexico, which we acquired by Alliance -- acquired by Alliance Boots back in August 2014, these were up 2.9%. The acquisition brings us over 1,000 stores in Mexico and over 400 in Chile and provides strong growth opportunities in the Latin American market. The inclusion of these businesses in the division, combined with contract manufacturing, are reflected in the margins. 
Now turning to Pharmaceutical Wholesale, which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand in 12 countries. Results in any given quarter are influenced by performance in larger geographies, including the U.K., Germany, France and Turkey and the division's contribution from WBAD. 
Total sales for the 2 months ending February were $3.9 billion. Similar to Retail Pharmacy International, our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division was acquired through the merger with Alliance Boots, and so no amounts are reported in the comparable period. However, on a pro forma constant currency basis, sales were relatively flat compared with the same period the prior year. 
Now let me spend a minute on our expectations for synergies and how they will be reported going forward. Prior to the merger, the majority of our synergies were flowing through WBAD, the former joint venture between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, which Walgreens fully consolidated and then removed Alliance Boots' portion via the noncontrolling interest line item. Following the combination, we're allocating all synergies, including those generated by WBAD, to the segments, and we're doing this according to the relative proportion of purchases driving the synergy benefits. 
With regard to performance in the quarter, combined net synergies were $170 million, bringing the fiscal year-to-date total to $310 million, driven primarily by our drug procurement efforts. We remain comfortable with our ability to achieve at least $650 million in combined synergies this fiscal year. For FY '16, we continue to expect at least $1 billion in combined quantifiable net synergies. Consistent with prior reporting, these synergies do not include any benefit from our AmerisourceBergen relationship. 
Now that we're a combined company, as expected we are focusing on driving incremental synergies from sharing our best practices and working more closely together. However, not all of these can be easily quantified as some of them tend to blend into our normal business.
So moving on to the cash flows. We generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash from operations during the quarter, and our free cash flow was $1.0 billion. We're pleased with the cash generation during the second quarter due in part to an improvement in our primary working capital within our Retail Pharmacy USA division, driven by a reduction in inventory levels. We will continue to focus on working capital and remain confident in future opportunities to increase efficiencies. 
Net debt as of the quarter end was $14.1 billion. 
With regard to uses of free cash flow beyond reinvestment back into the company, we completed $94 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization. We purchased additional shares post the end of the quarter under preestablished trading plans, bringing the total purchases to $330 million.
I'd now like to make a few comments on our capital allocation policy. As we've consistently communicated, we remain committed to a solid investment-grade rating while looking for ways to enhance our cash generation. This includes driving working capital efficiencies, tightening capital expenditures, controlling costs and, of course, improving operations. Beyond maintaining a long-term 30% to 35% dividend payout target, our top priorities for free cash include M&A consistent with our strategy and share buybacks. All of these are with a view to optimizing long-term shareholder value. 
Following on this theme, and as Stefano mentioned, we are focused on becoming a more agile and more productive company. As you know, in August 2014, we announced a 3-year $1 billion cost reduction initiative. After a rigorous analysis, we've identified additional opportunities for cost savings primarily in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. These additional cost opportunities will increase the total expected cost savings program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. So moving to areas of focus, they include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.A., to reorganize corporate and field operations, drive operating efficiencies and streamline information technology and other functions. These actions are designed to restructure and invest in our company's future in a way that is better for customers, simpler for our employees, resulting in a faster and more agile organization. 
We estimate that total pretax charges associated with this program to our GAAP financial results will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, of which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. The restructuring charges will be recognized over time as the program is implemented in accordance with GAAP. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on other areas of cost reduction. 
So now let's talk about the rest of fiscal 2015. We understand and appreciate that there are lots of factors that will impact our results. So in order to help you, we are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Now this range assumes quarterly interest expense of $140 million to $150 million. It assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29% and a fiscal year diluted share count generally consistent with the current quarter. It assumes management's estimates for foreign exchange rates that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year. Now this guidance also includes recast fiscal Q1 results due to the elimination of the 3-month lag. Finally, you will see an increase in the share count in Q3 and Q4 due to the full inclusion of the 144 million shares issued with Step 2 of the AB transaction. This will result in approximately 1.1 billion diluted shares per quarter. Any additional share repurchases will impact, of course, the fiscal year diluted share count. 
So moving on to FY '16. Our previously published goals were based on a variety of assumptions to arrive at estimate ranges for both sales and adjusted EPS. These included operating assumptions for our businesses and certain below-the-line items, including interest, tax and share count. When we set the goals in August, we made foreign currency assumptions based on exchange rates that were close to market rates at that time. Since then, we've seen significant global currency movements, especially the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Because we report in U.S. dollars, we do have currency translational exposures primarily based on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Simply put, a stronger dollar hurts our sales and earnings in dollars while a weaker dollar helps them. We estimate that a 1% move in the pound sterling versus the dollar from current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. Despite the FX headwind, I'm confident that we have initiatives and resources in place to address the controllable elements that drive our adjusted EPS goal for FY '16. 
Our revenues have greater potential variability due to the varied mix of businesses, particularly in our Wholesale division, which accounts for a significant proportion of our overall revenue. In addition, the geographical spread of the Wholesale business increases its exposure to currency variations. This being the case, we view overall revenue as a less relevant measure of our business. So taking these 2 factors into account, we decided to no longer provide our published revenue goal. And please note that our forward-looking statements assume no significant changes to the current exchange rates. 
So I'd like to wrap up today by saying that our reporting structure has changed and comparability is limited, which I know makes it really difficult for you. Therefore, in an effort to be as informative as possible, we've provided adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal year 2015. And next week, we'll have a financial session to provide further insights. In addition, we plan to provide operational insights in each of our 3 segments as well as views on our key financial drivers and future strategy. We really look forward to seeing you then. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Stefano."

We are working to deliver the benefits of our transaction within our core businesses. These will involve executing our synergies and efficiency programs across the group, including the progressive development of our procurement initiatives. We must also properly manage the assets of the business to ensure we are suitably structured and prepared to address the pressures we face as the pharmacy markets evolve. These pressures may variously be from reimbursement cuts, competitive action or simply changes in consumer behavior. Whatever form they take, if we are properly structured and prepared, operating an efficient, high-quality, patient-oriented pharmacy service, that we will earn the right not just to participate but to be an architect of the changes in our market. We are already seeing the benefits that can be achieved in retail with the initiatives under way at Walgreens and ongoing at Boots. We must ensure that we get the best return for our investment and create the best environment for our employees and customers alike. This will require us to operate enhanced systems and control so that we can monitor and manage our business properly. 
Now many of you have asked where we are on the CEO search. As you know, we formed a search committee of the board and they have been working with one of the top executive recruiting firms to help us find a new CEO. Currently, we are in the process of reviewing the candidates they have proposed. Finding candidates with the combination of attributes that we deem important for the role is naturally challenging as we expected that -- it to be. But we remain confident that in due course, we will find the right person for the job. 
Lastly, as the new culture takes hold and finds roots in a company, you can see echoes of it in all parts of the business. I hope that in one particular area, you are seeing the new culture emerge very clearly and that -- and the different [ph] now approach to our owners and the financial community in general. I have always viewed investors as my business partner, and I hope that they will view me in the same way. 
As an organization, we strongly believe it is our duty to care for our shareholders and to ensure that we are as accessible, responsive and transparent as we can be. We also believe in being proactive in reaching out to our investors to properly understand their requirements and to ensure that in our investor relations effort, we have as mindful -- we are as mindful of our shareholders as we are of the patients in our pharmacies or our customers in wholesale. I think that Gerald and his team have done well to demonstrate this new [indiscernible], and it is a great pleasure to see, although there is still more to do. We are in the first steps of a long and exciting path, and I look forward to traveling it with you as fellow owners and partners. 
As I said earlier, I am optimistic about the long-term future of our company and have made a significant personal commitment to our future not only as the Executive Vice Chairman and acting CEO but also as a significant shareholder. I am convinced that the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance is a unique first, which will almost inevitably lead to many other new firsts in our industry. It may not yet be clear which steps these will be, but we are determined to continue to show the way and be at the forefront of innovating health care. Our ambition is to build a generally global company and a universal health care champion. We look forward to providing a more comprehensive outlook on our future strategy and value creation next week at our first Analyst Day. 
With that, we are now ready to take your questions."

We've been really successful. The team has done a great job in Walgreens in terms of being able to find cost savings that do not affect the customer. The most pleasing thing about this beyond these cost savings is the fact that we're still growing volume ahead of the market, both in pharmacy and in retail products. And also, we're seeing internally our measure in cost of the delay improving. The whole idea of better for customers, simpler for our teams and more faster, agile organization is what's driving all of this, and we'll keep on going as we'll keep on working the old model and trading these processes, the IT structures for new model. So yes, we're delighted with the SG&A savings in this quarter and they are materially better than the same period last year. And as part of the restructuring we started already is in there, but a lot of this also is just due to ongoing cost control and cost management."

The reality is that, as I have said many times and I have realized immediately after being for 2 weeks in the job, is that this market, the American market, is ready for another round of consolidation because the margins are squeezed everywhere. The government is more and more in charge for the cost of the health care business. And so for sure, they will exercise their power to squeeze the costs as much as possible, as we have seen in Europe for decades. And so the complex structure of the -- of delivering the medicines to the patients will have to be rationalized. And as a consequence, it's easy to believe that we will have additional synergies coming from M&A activities. These could be, of course, at the level of horizontal consolidation. But in many layers of the chain, the consolidation is still up and is still quite advanced. So it's very likely that we'll see also vertical consolidation. And the opportunities are there for everybody, and we will see what happens. But as I have said before, we want to be, as we have been in the past, at the forefront of changes. And so if there is a need for a consolidation will be confirmed. We will try to be part of it."

In terms of own brand penetration, we've created a new division within our organization, within Walgreens Boots Alliance, led by Ken Murphy. And again, we're able to think about how do we understand local insights in America and also global insights, and Ken will speak more about this next week, and how therefore do we get the right products and the right brands into the American consumers' hands in the drug store channel. Having said that, we've done a couple of things recently. We've issued 2 new masstige cosmetic brands, CIRCA and Colour Prevails. That's happened in the last 2 or 3 weeks. So we're not waiting for that to happen. We continue to work on the basis of growing own brand penetration. So I think in both fronts, we made good, solid progress and there's more to come."

And of course, working in Europe, as I did before with Ronald [ph] and the team in Alliance Healthcare, we really worked as well for a number of years and saw more and more opportunities which comes through very clearly in the U.K. business performance for both the Wholesale and the Boots division."

So I apologize if I missed this, but I guess did you provide the fully adjusted gross margin for the quarter just to make it a little bit easier for us? And also, part 2 is then that just curious, all the talk about the U.S. Medicare Part D rate reductions that went into effect on 1/1/15, is there any way just to get a rough sense for how much that impacted the gross margin in the quarter? Was it perhaps 100 basis points year-over-year or maybe something greater than that? I'm just trying to get a sense for that."

And that's simply because under -- when you're doing the purchase accounting, and we've done the provisional purchase accounting allocation and we've got a year to finalize that, what you have to do is revalue the inventory at a selling price less a small margin. So we're not valuing the industry -- the inventory at cost. So that gets -- what it does is it essentially artificially takes down the U.S. GAAP profit in those 2 divisions as a result. So that's why we've stripped it out to show the operating results with that out. It has no impact at all on the comparables because it doesn't impact the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. I'm sorry it's got so many of these adjustments. We'll try -- next week, I'll try to take you back through them in a little more detail.

When we approached Walgreens, so when we started our discussion, the first thing that we decided was to create these joint ventures to buy together, and this joint venture would have been there even without the merger. So there are many ways to deliver synergies. And of course, we are open to any kind of organization which can improve the value of our company, and we are analyzing many, many different alternatives.

And if -- when you have such a vast territory, such a high number of stores, that inevitably you will have some stores which have been maybe profitable in the past and are not particularly exciting today, and you will need to open stores in areas which didn't even exist in the past. So the reality, you see a certain concentration which is still small because a few hundred out of 8,300 stores is not a big number, but you'll see it's a certain concentration because this program has not been done in the past in an orderly fashion. In the future, once we have, let's say, recreated this new base, I believe we should every year look after -- review all the stores. And if we have -- every year, if we have to close 10 stores or 5 stores or 15 stores, we have to -- we will have to do it in order not to have this concentration of stores just in 1 year.

The past 6 months had been significant progress in delivering on the benefit of the merger. Restructuring the business for the future, but there is a lot more to do. 
As you have seen today, I have been appointed by the board as Chief Executive Officer, replacing the interim appointment that I was previously fulfilling. The board has decided that building in mind the pace of change and the amount that we have to do, there is a benefit to stability at the senior level of the organization. And to focus on the operational and strategic part rather than appointing, orientating and educating someone new to the business. 
The role presents me with certain personnel and logistical challenges, but with the support of the board and particularly, James Skinner, as our Executive Chairman, I happily accept the appointment in the best interest of the company, my colleagues and, of course, my fellow shareholder. 
Today, I am pleased to be announcing another strong financial performance in this the first quarter to reflect a full 3 months of the combined company. Although it may not always from outside the business but it has been a very busy period for us since I last talked to you. As I have mentioned, our focus has naturally been on putting in place the changes and the restructuring we need in order to deliver the full benefits of that enlarge company and position the company for growth in the immediate and long term. 
Given that the deal was consummated only 6 months ago, we are still in the early stages of the process but we have been working hard and faster to deliver on our plan in fact, better than our plan and I am pleased to say that the benefits of this work are already beginning to be seen in our results, which is growth in revenues and margins and continued strong innovation. The first [indiscernible] which you can see the impact are strict cost control and disciplined financial management, but I want to assure you that we give our operation the investment they need to grow and prosper. 
We have accelerated our cost-reduction process and they reap the certain benefits earlier than expected in this quarter. Of course, we cannot extract this benefits more than one, however, the purchase of identifying benefit is ongoing so when we have completed this first wave of restructuring we will reveal review our progress of our business to identify further potential cost savings. 
I must comment my colleague that throughout the company for their willingness and openness to  accept change even when it is the most uncomfortable in the interest of improving and growing your company, and I would assure them that change is a sign of life and is in place in this manner becomes more of an allied than an enemy. 
It's a reminder that why we must prioritize our work if we are to achieve everything we want to and I promise to we cannot ignore and the element of the business when it comes to efficiency and best practices. 
I will hand over to George now for him to take you through the results for the quarter and give you some color for what I have just said. George?"

Today, I will begin my remarks by taking you through key highlights of our fiscal 2015 third quarter results. I will then give you some insight into the performance of each of our 3 divisions before updating you on progress we have made in implementing our cost savings and continuing to execute our synergy programs. I will conclude by taking you through our updated guidance for fiscal year '15 and comment on our fiscal year '16 goals. 
As Stefano said, the benefits of the work carried out since Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed in December are already beginning to be seen in our financial results, enabling us to deliver another strong quarter. 
Looking at the highlights. Net sales for the quarter were $28.8 billion, an increase of 48.4% versus the comparable quarter in the prior year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion and on an adjusted basis was $1.7 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by the consolidation of Alliance Boots, as well as growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment. 
GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion or $1.18 per diluted share, while adjusted net earnings were $1.1 billion or $1.02 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 59.5% in GAAP net earnings per diluted share and an increase of 22.9% in adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter in the prior year. 
Net interest expense in the quarter was $151 million and our adjusted tax rate was 30%. Finally, the average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was 1.1 billion. This includes, of course, the 144 million shares issued on the 31st December as part of the second step consideration for Alliance Boots. It should also be noted that the third quarter results last year included 3 months equity earnings as a result of Walgreens' 45% interest in Alliance Boots compared to fully consolidated results in this year's third quarter. 
Now I will take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. GAAP earnings of $1.18 per diluted share this quarter reconciles to adjusted earnings of $1.02 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.16 per share reflects additions of $0.05 of LIFO provision cost in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.06 of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and an additional $0.11 of restructuring-related cost from our cost optimization and store closure program. These additions were more than offset by removal of the $0.29 gain on our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares and a net 9% gain from special items, which includes the release of a capital loss valuation allowance, totaling $0.12 combined with a $0.01 loss on the sale of Walgreens infusion services and $0.02 for an adjusted tax rate true-up. 
So now, I would take it to the performance of each of our divisions in the quarter. To remind you, our results were reported in 3 segments: Retail Pharmacy USA; Retail Pharmacy International; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The segments we're reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD as well as an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. 
Responding to feedback received at our Analyst Day in April, you will see that we are providing additional detail on segment performance, both in the press release and in this presentation. This quarter, we have provided gross profit SG&A and operating profit on a GAAP and adjusted basis for each of our segments. We plan to continue this practice going forward. 
So now let's start with the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Retail Pharmacy USA total sales for the quarter were $20.4 billion, an increase of 5.3% over the third quarter in the prior year. Please remember, of course, that we sold a majority stake in Walgreens infusion services on the 7th of April. With our minority position, our share of earnings in the company now flow through the post-tax earnings from equity method investments in the income statement. Sales in the division on a comparable store basis increased by 6.3%. SG&A on a GAAP basis was $4.5 billion and on an adjusted basis was $4.3 billion. We continue to see strong progress in controlling SG&A expenses this quarter, including benefits associated with our cost savings program. This was a significant driver of the quarterly year-on-year performance. As a result, GAAP operating income for Retail Pharmacy USA was $1 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion. 
So looking now at the pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail. Comparable-store sales for pharmacy were up 9.1% for the quarter. We filled 226 million prescriptions, including immunizations on a 30-day adjusted basis, that was an increase of 3.8% over last year's quarter of prescriptions filled in comparable stores, up 4.1%. We continue to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D scripts along with positive underlying share trends. 
Our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased to 19.3% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. The benefit of positive sales growth was however substantially offset by pharmacy gross margin pressure, consistent with our expectations. 
Retail product sales increased by 2% in total. Comparable store sales increasing by 1.6%. The growth in retail sales was driven by performance in key destination category, including health and wellness. We are pleased with our progress in driving profitable sales growth and margin expansion while at the same time, focusing on operating efficiencies and focusing on working capital efficiencies. 
Additionally, we continue to enhance our successful Balance Rewards program by recently releasing Balance Rewards with everyday points. We now provide our active customers with a more consistent platform to receive loyalty points on most pharmacy and retail product transactions. We also encourage healthy lifestyle choices by rewarding points for positive health and well-being positions. 
So turning now to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division. The Retail Pharmacy International division is pharmacy-led health and BT retail businesses in 8 countries. At the end of the quarter, we operated 4,565 retail stores and adding net increase 6 stores during the quarter. As a reminder, our biggest operation of Boots in the U.K. followed by Mexico. We also have retail pharmacies in Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and Lithuania. 
Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.3 billion. GAAP operating income was $205 million, while adjusted operating income was $249 million. Adjusted operating margin of 7.6% in the quarter was 1.5 percentage points higher than in the second quarter, which remember included only January and February performance. The margin is typically lower in these early months of the year reflecting the seasonality of sales. 
So now let's move -- let's look more closely at the performance for the division. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable-store sales growth for the quarter was 3.1%. This reflects Boots U.K. growth of 2.4%, complemented by higher growth in emerging markets, most notably in Mexico and Chile, where we are making good progress in integrating these businesses acquired by Alliance Boots in August 2014. 
In the U.K., Boots retail sales were driven by good performances in both the beauty and retail healthcare categories. Orders on our U.K. website at Boots.com and orders during the quarter, were up approximately 50% over the same period last year, with approximately 2/3 of our website orders collected in-store. 
stay back in April, we talked about the importance of our product brands. We're very pleased with the growth in sales during the quarter of number 7, our award-winning beauty brand. This was in part due to the May launch of a new marketing program in the U.K., the number 7 protect and protected advanced serum. We're able to state for the first time in the U.K. that this innovative product was the first serum clinically proven to deliver ground-breaking anti-wrinkle results that get even better over time. 
As well as developing our existing product brands, we continue to advanced our portfolio, which resonates with our customers. Following on from the acquisition of last year, we are delighted to announce today that we've acquired Liz Earle. Liz Earle is an award-winning premium skincare range that uses naturally-active ingredients and is recognized as none of the leading botanical brands in the U.K. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Pharmaceutical Wholesale division total sales for the quarter were $5.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, which is constant currency and excludes acquisitions and disposals, sales increased 0.2% compared with the same quarter in the prior year. 
As we discussed in the last earnings call, wholesale performance in any quarter is impacted performance in larger geographies, including the U.K., Germany, France and Turkey as well as unique business model. GAAP operating income for the division was $162 million, while adjusted operating income was $171 million. Adjusted operating income margin was 3%, broadly flat versus the second quarter, and consistent with our expectations. 
The key driver for profit growth continues to be our synergy program. division in the third quarter totaled $194 million, making a total of $504 million for the fiscal year-to-date. 
As we've said before, synergies this year continue to come primarily from our drug procurement activities. As you can see from the numbers, we are on track to reach our target of at least $650 million net synergies in fiscal year 2015. 
For fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect at least $1 billion of combined quantifiable net synergies. As we work increasingly close together as a combined management team, there are, of course, an increasing number of other synergies being identified in action. Many of which was simply not practicable to quantify. 
Consistent with our prior reporting, these synergies are allocated across each segment and do not include any benefit from our relationship with AmerisourceBergen. At the same time, as driving our synergy program, as you know, we are very focused on costs. As previously announced, we have a target of $1.5 billion of cost savings to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. The expected pretax charges associated with this program, as previously stated, of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. 
Good progress was made during the quarter and reorganizing our Retail Pharmacy USA field operations with work continuing on the optimization of the divisions corporate office. Approximately 200 planned store closures in the program, 9 stores were closed in the quarter and approximately 70 to 80 additional stores planned to be closed by the end of fiscal year. We also reduced the IT cost structure in the USA to help enable significant store system investments over the coming years. 
In addition, during June, we announced the reduction of approximately 700 non-store base drawers in Retail Pharmacy International. During the quarter, we incurred pretax charges of $160 million on the program. This comprise $102 million of asset impairments, $34 million of severance costs and real estate costs of $24 million. 
So moving on now to cash flow and the deployment of capital. GAAP operating cash flow was $1.8 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $11.8 billion. 
Investing to drive future growth is our first priority for capital deployment, both in terms of capital expenditure and selective M&A. During the quarter, we invested $247 million in capital expenditure, making a total of $890 million for the first 9 months of the year. Here is a couple of investments continue to be store investment as well as IT and digital capabilities, which are vital to building and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage and are increasingly omni-channel world. To some degree, this quarter disproportionately benefited from the imposition of stricter capital investment controls. And while we expect to maintain a rigid control on capital expenditure, to assure appropriate returns on every dollar we spend, we will clearly not deprive the business of the investment it needs to drive. You should therefore, expect to see future quarters return to higher level of capital expenditure than we are reporting today. 
We remained focus on generating cash through working capital efficiency particularly in Retail Pharmacy USA. The primary area of focus is inventory management both in pharmacies and retail products. For the quarter, we improved our inventory days of supply in the U.S. by approximately 6 days versus the prior year quarter. We continue to see further opportunity for working capital improvements over time. 
At the same time, we're working hard to optimize our real estate assets, including carrying out sale-leaseback transaction. In the third quarter, we executed approximately $300 million of such transactions. 
As we have said previously, our philosophy is to run an efficient balance sheet. As such, we completed approximately $237 million share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization, bringing the total purchases under this program to $331 million. The program is ongoing and we remain committed to completing the plan by the end of fiscal 2016. 
In addition, we announced today that in order for us to manage our balance sheet, we're intending to redeem legacy Walgreens bonds with relatively short periods until they expire with a total principal amount of approximately $1.75 billion. This redemption will be funded from existing cash resources. You will see that cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.4 billion at quarter end, so we have the capacity to do this and continue to exercise on our share repurchase program. 
So turning to the dividend. We announced today a 6.7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. This raises the annual rate from $1.35 per share to $1.44 per share. We remain committed to a long-term dividend payout ratio target of 30% to 35%. 
So now let me talk about the full year outlook for fiscal 2015. In our second quarter earnings release, we had issued an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Given our solid third quarter results and increased visibility as we look to the year-end, we are pleased to both increase and narrow our adjusted EPS fiscal year guidance to a range of $3.70 to $3.80. This range assumes adjusted interest expense of approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29%, a fiscal year diluted share count of approximately 1.05 billion shares and estimates for foreign exchange rates that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year. 
I remind you that when we issued our fiscal year '15 guidance in April, we view the second half of the fiscal year differently than the first half. Specifically, we indicated that adjusted earnings per diluted share would be lower than in the second half, with the third quarter being higher than the fourth quarter. As we update our guidance, this still holds true. We expect quarter 4 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be sequentially lower for the following reasons. The primary component is seasonality, which impacts sales and product mix. And in summer months tend to be our we get, particularly in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Within the U.S., we tend to see sequential declines in the growth of both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. Also, as we continue to work through our cost plan in the U.S., the phasing and timing of certain expenses will impact the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. 
So moving onto fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our previously stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.60. This range assumes an annual adjusted tax rate in high 20s, a full year average weight diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion and no significant changes in currency exchange rate. 
Please remember, of course, that since we establish the goal a year ago, we've seen material appreciation of the dollar. As you know, we have currency translation exposure base primarily on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. And as a reminder, we estimate that a 1% move in pounds sterling versus the dollar in current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. 
Given the current situation in Greece, where we fortunately have no business interest, we anticipate a certain level of volatility in the currency markets in the forthcoming months. 
So with that, I will turn the call back to Stephan no."

The other factor is the phasing and timing of certain expenses in terms of the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. And clearly, when you go through the sort of programs that we are already trying and as fast as you can. But equally, you need to keep everyone very focused on the business and driving through all the programs that Alex is working on.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter earnings call. The past 6 months have been significant progress in delivering on the benefit out of the merger, structuring the business for the future. But there is a lot more to do. 
As you have seen today, I have been appointed by the board as Chief Executive Officer, replacing the interim appointment that I was previously fulfilling. The board has decided that bearing in mind the pace of change and the amount that we have still to do, there is a benefit to stability at the senior level in the organization and to focus this on the operational and strategic part before us rather than appointing, orientating and educating someone new to the business during this period
The role presents me with certain personnel and logistical challenges, but with the support of the board and particularly of Jim Skinner as our Executive Chairman, I happily accept the appointment in the best interest of the company, my colleagues, and of course, my fellow shareholder. 
Today, I am pleased to be announcing another strong financial performance in this -- the first quarter to reflect a full 3 months of the combined company. Although it may not always appear so from outside the business, it has been a very busy period for us since I last talked to you. As I have mentioned, our focus has naturally been on putting in place the changes and the restructuring we need in order to deliver the full benefits of the enlarged company and position the company for growth in the immediate and long term. 
Given that the deal was consummated only 6 months ago, we are still in the early stages of this process, but we have been working hard and fast to deliver on our plan, in fact, better than our plan and I am pleased to say that the benefits of this work are already beginning to be seen in our results with reasonable growth in revenues and margins and continued strong innovation. Clearly, the first areas in which you can see the impact are strict cost control and disciplined financial management, but I want to assure you that we give our operation the investment they need to grow and prosper. 
We have accelerated our cost-reduction process and there reap the certain benefits earlier than expected in this quarter. Of course, we cannot extract these benefits more than once. However, the process of identifying benefits is ongoing, not final. So when we have completed this first wave of restructuring, we will reveal -- review all areas of our business to identify further potential cost savings. 
I must commend my colleagues throughout the company for their willingness and openness to accept change even when it is the most uncomfortable in the interest of improving and growing our company, and I would assure them that change is a sign of life, and if embraced in this manner, becomes more of an ally than an enemy. It's a reminder that while we must prioritize our work if we are to achieve everything we want to and promise to, we cannot ignore any element of the business when it comes to our drive for efficiency and best practice. 
I will hand over to George now for him to take you through the results for the quarter and give you some color on what I have just said. George?"
93624,304033436,832576,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 09, 2015",2015-07-09,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano.

Today, I will begin my remarks by taking you through key highlights of our fiscal 2015 third quarter results. I will then give you some insights into the performance of each of our 3 divisions before updating you on progress we have made in implementing our cost savings and continuing to execute our synergy programs. I will conclude by taking you through our updated guidance for fiscal year '15 and comment on our fiscal year '16 goals. 
As Stefano said, the benefits of the work carried out since Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed at the end of December are already beginning to be seen in our financial results, enabling us to deliver another strong quarter. 
Looking at the highlights. Net sales for the quarter were $28.8 billion, an increase of 48.4% versus the comparable quarter in the prior year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion, and on an adjusted basis, was $1.7 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by the consolidation of Alliance Boots as well as growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion or $1.18 per diluted share while adjusted net earnings were $1.1 billion or $1.02 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 59.5% in GAAP net earnings per diluted share and an increase of 22.9% in adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter in the prior year. 
Net interest expense in the quarter was $151 million and our adjusted tax rate was 30%. Finally, the average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was 1.1 billion. This includes, of course, the 144 million shares issued on the 31st December as part of the second step consideration for Alliance Boots. It should also be noted that the third quarter results last year included 3 months equity earnings as a result of Walgreens' 45% interest in Alliance Boots compared to fully consolidated results in this year's third quarter. 
Now I will take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. GAAP earnings of $1.18 per diluted share this quarter reconciles to adjusted earnings of $1.02 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.16 per share reflects additions of $0.05 of LIFO provision costs in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.06 of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and an additional $0.11 of restructuring-related costs from our cost optimization and store closure program. These additions were more than offset by removal of a $0.29 gain on our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares and a net 9% gain from special items, which includes the release of a capital loss valuation allowance totaling $0.12 combined with a $0.01 loss on the sale of Walgreens Infusion Services and $0.02 for an adjusted tax rate true-up. 
So now I will take you through the performance of each of our divisions in the quarter. To remind you, our results are reported in 3 segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The segments we're reporting include the allocation of synergy benefits including WBAD as well as an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. 
Responding to feedback received at our Analyst Day in April, you will see that we are providing additional detail on segmental performance, both in the press release and in this presentation. This quarter, we have provided gross profit, SG&A and operating profit on a GAAP and adjusted basis for each of our segments. We plan to continue this practice going forward. 
So now let's start with the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Retail Pharmacy USA total sales for the quarter were $20.4 billion, an increase of 5.3% over the third quarter in the prior year. Please remember, of course, that we sold a majority stake in Walgreens Infusion Services on the 7th of April. With our minority position, our share of earnings in the company now flow through the post-tax earnings from equity method investments in the income statement. Sales in the division on a comparable store basis increased by 6.3%. SG&A on a GAAP basis was $4.5 billion and on an adjusted basis was $4.3 billion. We continue to see strong progress in controlling SG&A expenses this quarter including benefits associated with our cost-savings program. This was a significant driver of the quarterly year-on-year performance. As a result, GAAP operating income for Retail Pharmacy USA was $1 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion. 
So looking now at the pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail. Comparable-store sales for pharmacy were up 9.1% for the quarter. We filled 226 million prescriptions including immunizations on a 30-day adjusted basis, that was an increase of 3.8% over last year's quarter with prescriptions filled in comparable stores up 4.1%. We continue to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D scripts along with positive underlying share trends. Our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased to 19.3% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. The benefit of positive sales growth was, however, substantially offset by pharmacy gross margin pressure consistent with our expectations. 
Retail product sales increased by 2% in total, comparable store sales increasing by 1.6%. The growth in retail sales was driven by performance in key destination categories including health and wellness. We are pleased with our progress in driving profitable sales growth and margin expansion while at the same time focusing on operating efficiencies and focusing on working capital efficiencies. 
Additionally, we continue to enhance our successful Balance Rewards program by recently releasing Balance Rewards with every day points. We now provide our active customers with a more consistent platform to receive loyalty points on most pharmacy and retail product transactions. We also encourage healthy lifestyle choices by rewarding points for positive health and well-being decisions. 
So turning now to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division. The Retail Pharmacy International division has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries. At the end of the quarter, we operated 4,565 retail stores and adding net increase of 6 stores during the quarter. As a reminder, our biggest operations are Boots from the U.K. followed by Mexico. We also have retail pharmacies in Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and Lithuania. 
Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.3 billion. GAAP operating income was $205 million while adjusted operating income was $249 million. Adjusted operating margin at 7.6% for the quarter was 1.5 percentage points higher than in the second quarter, which, remember, included only January and February performance. The margin is typically lower in these early months of the year reflecting the seasonality of sales. 
So now let's look more closely at the performance for the division. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable store sales growth for the quarter was 3.1%. This reflects Boots UK growth of 2.4%, complemented by higher growth in emerging markets, most notably in Mexico and Chile where we are making good progress in integrating these businesses acquired by Alliance Boots in August 2014. 
In the U.K., Boots retail sales were driven by good performances in both the beauty and retail health care categories. Orders on our U.K. website at boots.com and orders during the quarter were up approximately 50% over the same period last year with approximately 2/3 of our website orders collected in-store. 
At our Analyst Day back in April, we talked about the importance of our product brands. We're very pleased with the growth in sales during the quarter of No7, our award-winning beauty brand. This was in part due to the May launch of a new marketing program in the U.K., the No7 Protect & Perfect Advanced Serum. We were able to state for the first time in the U.K. that this innovative product was the first serum clinically proven to deliver ground-breaking anti-wrinkle results that get even better over time. 
As well as developing our existing product brands, we continue to add brands to our portfolio, which resonate with our customers. Following on from the acquisition of Soap & Glory last year, we are delighted to announce today that we've acquired Liz Earle from Avon. Liz Earle is an award-winning premium skincare range that uses naturally active ingredients and is recognized as one of the leading botanical brands in the U.K. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Pharmaceutical Wholesale division total sales for the quarter were $5.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, which is in constant currency and excludes acquisitions and disposals, sales increased 0.2% compared with the same quarter in the prior year. 
As we discussed in the last earnings call, Wholesale performance in any quarter is impacted by performance in larger geographies including the U.K., Germany, France and Turkey as well as by the unique business model. 
GAAP operating income for the division was $162 million while adjusted operating income was $171 million. Adjusted operating income margin was 3%, broadly flat versus the second quarter and consistent with our expectations. 
The key driver of profit growth continues to be our synergy program. Net synergies in the third quarter totaled $194 million, making a total of $504 million for the fiscal year-to-date. As we've said before, synergies this year continue to come primarily from our drug procurement activities. 
As you can see from the numbers, we are on track to reach our target of at least $650 million net synergies in fiscal year 2015. For fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect at least $1 billion of combined quantifiable net synergies. As we work increasingly close together as a combined management team, there are, of course, an increasing number of other synergies being identified and actioned, many of which are simply not practicable to quantify. 
Consistent with our prior reporting, these synergies are allocated across each segment and do not include any benefit from our relationship with AmerisourceBergen. 
At the same time as driving our synergy program, as you know, we are very focused on costs. As previously announced, we have a target of $1.5 billion of cost savings to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. The expected pretax charges associated with this program, as previously stated, are between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. 
Good progress was made during the quarter in reorganizing our Retail Pharmacy USA field operations with work continuing on the optimization of the division's corporate office. Of the approximately 200 planned U.S. store closures in the program, 9 stores were closed in the quarter with approximately 70 to 80 additional stores planned to be closed by the end of fiscal year. We also reduced the IT cost structure in the USA to help enable significant store system investments over the coming years. 
In addition, during June, we announced the reduction of approximately 700 nonstore-based roles in Retail Pharmacy International. 
During the quarter, we incurred pretax charges of $160 million on the program. These comprised $102 million of asset impairments, $34 million of severance costs and real estate costs of $24 million. 
So moving on now to cash flow and the deployment of capital. GAAP operating cash flow was $1.8 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $11.8 billion. 
Investing to drive future growth is our first priority for capital deployment, both in terms of capital expenditure and selective M&A. During the quarter, we invested $247 million in capital expenditure, making a total of $890 million for the first 9 months of the year. Here, a couple of investments continue to be store investments as well as IT and digital capabilities, which are vital to building and maintaining a sustainable, competitive advantage in our increasingly omni-channel world. 
To some degree, this quarter disproportionately benefited from the imposition of stricter capital investment controls. And while we expect to maintain a rigid control on capital expenditure to assure appropriate returns on every dollar we spend, we will clearly not deprive the business of the investment it needs to thrive. You should therefore expect to see future quarters return to slightly higher level of capital expenditure than we are reporting today. 
We remain focus on generating cash through working capital efficiencies particularly in Retail Pharmacy USA. The primary area of focus is inventory management, both in pharmacy and retail products. For the quarter, we improved our inventory days of supply in the U.S. by approximately 6 days versus the prior year quarter. We continue to see further opportunity for working capital improvement over time. 
At the same time, we're working hard to optimize our real estate assets, including carrying out sale and leaseback transactions. In the third quarter, we executed approximately $300 million of such transactions. 
As we have said previously, our philosophy is to run an efficient balance sheet. As such, we completed approximately $237 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization bringing the total purchases under this program to $331 million. The program is ongoing and we remain committed to completing the plan by the end of fiscal 2016. 
In addition, we announced today that in order for us to manage our balance sheet, we're intending to redeem legacy Walgreens bonds with relatively short periods until they expire with a total principal amount of approximately $1.75 billion. This redemption will be funded from existing cash resources. You will see that cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.4 billion at quarter end, so we have the capacity to do this and continue to exercise on our share repurchase program. 
So turning to dividend. We announced today a 6.7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. This raises the annual rate from $1.35 per share to $1.44 per share. We remain committed to a long-term dividend payout ratio target of 30% to 35%. 
So now let me talk about the full year outlook for fiscal 2015. In our second quarter earnings release, we had issued an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Given our solid third quarter results and increased visibility as we look to the year-end, we are pleased to both increase and narrow our adjusted EPS fiscal year guidance to a range of $3.70 to $3.80. This range assumes adjusted interest expense of approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29%, a fiscal year diluted share count of approximately 1.05 billion shares and estimates for foreign exchange rates that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year. 
I'll remind you that when we issued our fiscal year '15 guidance in April, we viewed the second half of the fiscal year differently than the first half. Specifically, we indicated that adjusted earnings per diluted share would be lower than in the second half with the third quarter being higher than the fourth quarter. As we update our guidance, this still holds true. 
We expect quarter 4 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be sequentially lower for the following reasons. The primary component is seasonality, which impacts sales and product mix. The summer months tend to be our weakest, particularly in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Within the U.S., we tend to see sequential declines in the growth of both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. Also, as we continue to work through our cost plan in the U.S., the phasing and timing of certain expenses will impact the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. 
So moving on to fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our previously stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.60. This range assumes an annual adjusted tax rate in the high 20s, a full year average weight diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion and no significant changes to currency exchange rates. 
Please remember, of course, that since we established the goal a year ago, we've seen material appreciation of the dollar. 
As you know, we have currency translation exposure based primarily on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. And as a reminder, we estimate that a 1% move in pound sterling versus the dollar from current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share.

So I hope that you will agree that these are a very solid set of results. We still have a lot to do and we are far from being complacent about the challenges we face and the hard work it will take to deliver everything we want and that promise, but we are making good progress and traveling in the right direction. And I believe all of my colleagues recognize the challenges and the work will be needed to overcome them, but as convinced as ever about the immense potential of our company as a global pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise. 
We are in markets that are changing here in the U.S. that you are seeing this quite dramatically, but as I have said many times we are at the beginning of a new chapter for our company and are actively reviewing every opportunity that the changing environment offers us as we work to deliver the true potential of our company. 
I strongly believe that we have a significant role to play in shaping the future of our WBA [ph]. I thank you for your continued support, but also acknowledge that the best way to thank you is to deliver on our promises and I can assure you we fully intend to continue to do so.

I'm thinking about the summer months very much tend to be our weakest months particularly in Alex's business, the Retail Pharmacy USA segment, where we would see typically the sequential declines in the growth of both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. The other factor is around the phasing and timing of certain expenses in terms of the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. And clearly, when you go through the sort of programs that we are already trying and push as fast as you can, but equally, you need to keep everyone very focused on the business and driving through all the programs that Alex is working on. So there's always an element of timing on those where they eventually as to how quickly we can deliver some of those. We're clearly going as fast as we feel we can in a straight line. The other areas I've talked about, I mean, clearly currency is a factor as I touched on.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter earnings call. The past 6 months have been significant progress in delivering on the benefit of the merger, structuring the business for the future. But there is a lot more to do. 
As you have seen today, I have been appointed by the board as Chief Executive Officer, replacing the interim appointment that I was previously fulfilling. The board has decided that bearing in mind the pace of change and the amount that we have still to do, there is a benefit to stability at the senior level in the organization and to focus on the operational and strategic path before us rather than appointing, orientating and educating someone new to the business during this period
The role presents me with certain personnel and logistical challenges, but with the support of the board and particularly of Jim Skinner as our Executive Chairman, I happily [ph] accept the appointment in the best interest of the company, my colleagues, and of course, my fellow shareholder. 
Today, I am pleased to be announcing another strong financial performance in this -- the first quarter to reflect a full 3 months of the combined company. Although it may not always appear so from outside the business, it has been a very busy period for us since I last talked to you. As I have mentioned, our focus has naturally been on putting in place the changes and the restructuring we need in order to deliver the full benefits of the enlarged company and position the company for growth in the immediate and long term. 
Given that the deal was consummated only 6 months ago, we are still in the early stages of this process, but we have been working hard and fast to deliver on our plan, in fact, better than our plan and I am pleased to say that the benefits of this work are already beginning to be seen in our results with reasonable growth in revenues and margins and continued strong [indiscernible] innovation. Clearly, the first areas in which you can see the impact are strict cost control and disciplined financial management, but I want to assure you that we give our operations the investment they need to grow and prosper. 
We have accelerated our cost-reduction process and there reap the certain benefits earlier than expected in this quarter. Of course, we cannot extract these benefits more than once. However, the process of identifying benefits is ongoing, not final. So when we have completed this first wave of restructuring, we will reveal -- review other areas of our business to identify further potential cost savings. 
I must commend my colleagues throughout the company for their willingness and openness to accept change even when it is the most uncomfortable in the interest of improving and growing our company, and I would assure them that change is a sign of life, and if embraced in this manner, becomes more of an ally than an enemy. It's a reminder that while we must prioritize our work if we are to achieve everything we want to and promise to, we cannot ignore any element of the business when it comes to our drive for efficiency and best practice. 
I will hand over to George now for him to take you through the results for the quarter and give you some color on what I have just said. George?"

Today, I will begin my remarks by taking you through key highlights of our fiscal 2015 third quarter results. I will then give you some insights into the performance of each of our 3 divisions before updating you on progress we have made in implementing our cost savings and continuing to execute our [ph] synergy programs. I will conclude by taking you through our updated guidance for fiscal year '15 and comment on our fiscal year '16 goals. 
As Stefano said, the benefits of the work carried out since Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed at the end of December are already beginning to be seen in our financial results, enabling us to deliver another strong quarter. 
Looking at the highlights. Net sales for the quarter were $28.8 billion, an increase of 48.4% versus the comparable quarter in the prior year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion, and on an adjusted basis, was $1.7 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by the consolidation of Alliance Boots as well as growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion or $1.18 per diluted share while adjusted net earnings were $1.1 billion or $1.02 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 59.5% in GAAP net earnings per diluted share and an increase of 22.9% in adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter in the prior year. 
Net interest expense in the quarter was $151 million and our adjusted tax rate was 30%. Finally, the average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was 1.1 billion. This includes, of course, the 144 million shares issued on the 31st December as part of the second step consideration for Alliance Boots. It should also be noted that the third quarter results last year included 3 months' equity earnings as a result of Walgreens' 45% interest in Alliance Boots compared to fully consolidated results in this year's third quarter. 
Now I will take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. GAAP earnings of $1.18 per diluted share this quarter reconciles to adjusted earnings of $1.02 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.16 per share reflects additions of $0.05 of LIFO provision costs in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.06 of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and an additional $0.11 of restructuring-related costs from our cost optimization and store closure program. These additions were more than offset by removal of a $0.29 gain on our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares and a net 9% gain from special items, which includes the release of a capital loss valuation allowance totaling $0.12 combined with a $0.01 loss on the sale of Walgreens Infusion Services and $0.02 for an adjusted tax rate true-up. 
So now I will take you through the performance of each of our divisions in the quarter. To remind you, our results are reported in 3 segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The segments we're reporting include the allocation of synergy benefits including WBAD as well as an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. 
Responding to feedback received at our Analyst Day in April, you will see that we are providing additional detail on segmental performance, both in the press release and in this presentation. This quarter, we have provided gross profit, SG&A and operating profit on a GAAP and adjusted basis for each of our segments. We plan to continue this practice going forward. 
So now let's start with the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Retail Pharmacy USA total sales for the quarter were $20.4 billion, an increase of 5.3% over the third quarter in the prior year. Please remember, of course, that we sold a majority stake in Walgreens Infusion Services on the 7th of April. With our minority position, our share of earnings in the company now flow through the post-tax earnings from equity method investments in the income statement. Sales in the division on a comparable store basis increased by 6.3%. SG&A on a GAAP basis was $4.5 billion and on an adjusted basis was $4.3 billion. We continue to see strong progress in controlling SG&A expenses this quarter including benefits associated with our cost-savings program. This was a significant driver of the quarterly year-on-year performance. As a result, GAAP operating income for Retail Pharmacy USA was $1 billion while adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion. 
So looking now at the pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail. Comparable-store sales for pharmacy were up 9.1% for the quarter. We filled 226 million prescriptions including immunizations on a 30-day adjusted basis, that was an increase of 3.8% over last year's quarter with prescriptions filled in comparable stores up 4.1%. We continue to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D scripts along with positive underlying share trends. Our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased to 19.3% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. The benefit of positive sales growth was, however, substantially offset by pharmacy gross margin pressure consistent with our expectations. 
Retail product sales increased by 2% in total, comparable store sales increasing by 1.6%. The growth in retail sales was driven by performance in key destination categories including health and wellness. We are pleased with our progress in driving profitable sales growth and margin expansion while at the same time focusing on operating efficiencies and focusing on working capital efficiencies. 
Additionally, we continue to enhance our successful Balance Rewards program by recently releasing Balance Rewards with every day points. We now provide our active customers with a more consistent platform to receive loyalty points on most pharmacy and retail product transactions. We also encourage healthy lifestyle choices by rewarding points for positive health and well-being decisions. 
So turning now to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division. The Retail Pharmacy International division has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries. At the end of the quarter, we operated 4,565 retail stores and adding net increase of 6 stores during the quarter. As a reminder, our biggest operations are Boots from the U.K. followed by Mexico. We also have retail pharmacies in Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and Lithuania. 
Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.3 billion. GAAP operating income was $205 million while adjusted operating income was $249 million. Adjusted operating margin at 7.6% for the quarter was 1.5 percentage points higher than in the second quarter, which, remember, included only January and February performance. The margin is typically lower in these early months of the year reflecting the seasonality of sales. 
So now let's look more closely at the performance for the division. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable store sales growth for the quarter was 3.1%. This reflects Boots UK growth of 2.4%, complemented by higher growth in emerging markets, most notably in Mexico and Chile where we are making good progress in integrating these businesses acquired by Alliance Boots in August 2014. 
In the U.K., Boots retail sales were driven by good performances in both the beauty and retail health care categories. Orders on our U.K. website at boots.com and orders during the quarter were up approximately 50% over the same period last year with approximately 2/3 of our website orders collected in-store. 
At our Analyst Day back in April, we talked about the importance of our product brands. We're very pleased with the growth in sales during the quarter of No7, our award-winning beauty brand. This was in part due to the May launch of a new marketing program in the U.K., the No7 Protect & Perfect Advanced Serum. We were able to state for the first time in the U.K. that this innovative product was the first serum clinically proven to deliver ground-breaking anti-wrinkle results that get even better over time. 
As well as developing our existing product brands, we continue to add brands to our portfolio, which resonate with our customers. Following on from the acquisition of Soap & Glory last year, we are delighted to announce today that we've acquired Liz Earle from Avon. Liz Earle is an award-winning premium skincare range that uses naturally active ingredients and is recognized as one of the leading botanical brands in the U.K. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Pharmaceutical Wholesale division total sales for the quarter were $5.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, which is in constant currency and excludes acquisitions and disposals, sales increased 0.2% compared with the same quarter in the prior year. 
As we discussed in the last earnings call, Wholesale performance in any quarter is impacted by performance in larger geographies including the U.K., Germany, France and Turkey as well as by the unique business model. 
GAAP operating income for the division was $162 million while adjusted operating income was $171 million. Adjusted operating income margin was 3%, broadly flat versus the second quarter and consistent with our expectations. 
The key driver of profit growth continues to be our synergy program. Net synergies in the third quarter totaled $194 million, making a total of $504 million for the fiscal year-to-date. As we've said before, synergies this year continue to come primarily from our drug procurement activities. 
As you can see from the numbers, we are on track to reach our target of at least $650 million net synergies in fiscal year 2015. For fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect at least $1 billion of combined quantifiable net synergies. As we work increasingly close together as a combined management team, there are, of course, an increasing number of other synergies being identified and actioned, many of which are simply not practicable to quantify. 
Consistent with our prior reporting, these synergies are allocated across each segment and do not include any benefit from our relationship with AmerisourceBergen. 
At the same time as driving our synergy program, as you know, we are very focused on costs. As previously announced, we have a target of $1.5 billion of cost savings to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. The expected pretax charges associated with this program, as previously stated, are between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. 
Good progress was made during the quarter in reorganizing our Retail Pharmacy USA field operations with work continuing on the optimization of the division's corporate office. Of the approximately 200 planned U.S. store closures in the program, 9 stores were closed in the quarter with approximately 70 to 80 additional stores planned to be closed by the end of fiscal year. We also reduced the IT cost structure in the U.S.A. to help enable significant store system investments over the coming years. 
In addition, during June, we announced the reduction of approximately 700 nonstore-based roles in Retail Pharmacy International. 
During the quarter, we incurred pretax charges of $160 million on the program. These comprised $102 million of asset impairments, $34 million of severance costs and real estate costs of $24 million. 
So moving on now to cash flow and the deployment of capital. GAAP operating cash flow was $1.8 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $11.8 billion. 
Investing to drive future growth is our first priority for capital deployment, both in terms of capital expenditure and selective M&A. During the quarter, we invested $247 million in capital expenditure, making a total of $890 million for the first 9 months of the year. Here, capital investment continue to be store investments as well as IT and digital capabilities, which are vital to building and maintaining a sustainable, competitive advantage in our increasingly omni-channel world. 
To some degree, this quarter disproportionately benefited from the imposition of stricter capital investment controls. And while we expect to maintain a rigid control on capital expenditure to assure appropriate returns on every dollar we spend, we will clearly not deprive the business of the investment it needs to thrive. You should therefore expect to see future quarters return to slightly higher level of capital expenditure than we are reporting today. 
We remain focus on generating cash through working capital efficiencies particularly in Retail Pharmacy USA. The primary area of focus is inventory management, both in pharmacy and retail products. For the quarter, we improved our inventory days of supply in the U.S. by approximately 6 days versus the prior year quarter. We continue to see further opportunity for working capital improvement over time. 
At the same time, we're working hard to optimize our real estate assets, including carrying out sale and leaseback transactions. In the third quarter, we executed approximately $300 million of such transactions. 
As we have said previously, our philosophy is to run an efficient balance sheet. As such, we completed approximately $237 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization bringing the total purchases under this program to $331 million. The program is ongoing and we remain committed to completing the plan by the end of fiscal 2016. 
In addition, we announced today that in order for us to manage our balance sheet, we're intending to redeem legacy Walgreens bonds with relatively short periods until they expire with a total principal amount of approximately $1.75 billion. This redemption will be funded from existing cash resources. You will see that cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.4 billion at quarter end, so we have the capacity to do this and continue to exercise on our share repurchase program. 
So turning to dividend. We announced today a 6.7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. This raises the annual rate from $1.35 per share to $1.44 per share. We remain committed to a long-term dividend payout ratio target of 30% to 35%. 
So now let me talk about the full year outlook for fiscal 2015. In our second quarter earnings release, we had issued an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Given our solid third quarter results and increased visibility as we look to the year-end, we are pleased to both increase and narrow our adjusted EPS fiscal year guidance to a range of $3.70 to $3.80. This range assumes adjusted interest expense of approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29%, a fiscal year diluted share count of approximately 1.05 billion shares and estimates for foreign exchange rates that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year. 
I'll remind you that when we issued our fiscal year '15 guidance in April, we viewed the second half of the fiscal year differently than the first half. Specifically, we indicated that adjusted earnings per diluted share would be lower in the second half with the third quarter being higher than the fourth quarter. As we update our guidance, this still holds true. 
We expect quarter 4 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be sequentially lower for the following reasons. The primary component is seasonality, which impacts sales and product mix. The summer months tend to be our weakest, particularly in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Within the U.S., we tend to see sequential declines in the growth of both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. Also, as we continue to work through our cost plan in the U.S., the phasing and timing of certain expenses will impact the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. 
So moving on to fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our previously stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.60. This range assumes an annual adjusted tax rate in the high 20s, a full year average weight diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion and no significant changes to current currency exchange rates. 
Please remember, of course, that since we established the goal a year ago, we've seen material appreciation of the dollar. 
As you know, we have currency translation exposure based primarily on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. And as a reminder, we estimate that a 1% move in pound sterling versus the dollar from current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. 
Given the current situation in Greece where we fortunately have no business interest, we anticipate a certain level of volatility in the currency markets in the forthcoming months. 
So with that, I will turn the call back to Stefano."

I'm thinking about the summer months very much tend to be our weakest months particularly in Alex's business, the Retail Pharmacy USA segment, where we would see typically the sequential declines in the growth of both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. The other factor is around the phasing and timing of certain expenses in terms of the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. And clearly, when you go through the sort of programs that we are already trying and push as fast as you can, but equally, you need to keep everyone very focused on the business and driving through all the programs that Alex is working on. So there's always an element of timing on those where they eventually as to how quickly we can deliver some of those. We're clearly going as fast as we feel we can in a straight line.

We've got a very strong loyalty card program. Alex talked obviously about the great work that's being done here and taking Balance Rewards forward, the Advantage Card program equally important in the U.K. And then the piece that I touched on in my presentation is really omni-channel where ordering online through boots.com and picking up in-store to purchase is important. And of course, with the geography that we've got in the U.K. in the 2,500 points we can do that and we can actually leverage our Wholesale organization for delivery, we're able to do that in a profitable way that really meets the expectations of our customers.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2015 full year earnings call. So this is an exciting time for us, not only are we today announcing the first full year results as a wholly combined company but also, [indiscernible] we are announcing the acquisition of Rite Aid, a transaction that would significantly accelerate our plan to expand our pharmacy in. With this acquisition, we are accelerating long-term objective that we knew we needed to address, to strengthen our presence and coverage internationally outside the U.S. I have to say that we have reached an agreement with Rite Aid that reflect what we believe to be very fair terms, which will help us to unlock real value for the transaction. 
The addition of Rite Aid will accelerate our strategy by completing our network, providing a larger and more comprehensive portfolio, which within we can deploy our knowledge and skill and creating a more comprehensive and stronger platform for the development of our brand presence and the future growth of our business. 
Clearly, there is still a lot to be done to complete the transaction with Rite Aid. Our teams have done a lot of work on these and we will work closely with the regulators to bring the transaction to a conclusion as soon as possible. George will give you more details about our agreement to acquire Rite Aid in a few moments. 
But first, let me review the progress we have made in the past year and our work to transform our business [indiscernible] across the company. When I spoke to you in July, I refer to the extraordinary amount of work that has been going on inside the company to establish the processes and systems in which to build the more responsive and efficient and relevant business. This is critical for what is today a rapidly changing business environment, with new and different dynamics that the company [indiscernible]. 
In all of our markets, we faced tough challenges, be it from competitors or from governments, relentless drive to manage health care costs. That said, I don't believe any one of these would not say that same thing on their business. Our job is to [indiscernible] we'll continue to be to identify, address and if we can lead the market to efficient scale inside and innovation. Of course, with the completion of our transaction to form Walgreens Boots Alliance and the subsequent executive and management changes, it has taken us a little time to come with the business. And as part of these, we have been actively working to strengthen and simplify our management reporting system to ensure that we can build a reliable and accurate picture of book and understand our strengths and weaknesses. 
We have to spent some time restructuring, refocusing a number of part of the business and a number of areas of management. In some areas, we have found to bring in people and skills from outside the group, recognizing that for our U.S. business, to dovetail the management reporting of recent extensive international network that requires something different in terms of systems and expertise than running a U.S.-based domestic business. Internationally, our management have to take some time to understand how they are impacted by the shift in the nature of our business is inevitable given the scale of our U.S. business. 
The practical and cultural issues that these changes have raised our complex parts and have been helping part by the relationships and connection we begin to forge in the years before initial announcement of our deal and the final completion. And has been achieved within the company, but we remain very much at the beginning of our journey. Alex and his team have been working hard to ensure that we are operating in an efficient and effective manner, optimize as far as possible to the needs of the communities that it serves. 
They have made a lot of progress but there is a lot more to do. Our work to understand the demand and potential of a more unique of our brand product during the Boots part of the M&A is now beyond stage and is beginning to rollout in a managed way across the network. 
We are restructuring the front end of our stores to set us on the right path of future growth [Indiscernible] as anticipated. This is the short term loss of something, however, this short-term impact is compensated for by the improved margins that this restructuring has delivered. We are also continuing to innovate in new channels to stay relevant and continue to pour the strengths of our brand into future growth. Every bit as much as in the physical one. I will be doing a great disservice to many people outside the U.S. if I did not mention that there are outstanding efforts as well. That this result -- resulted in solid performance from our international pharmacy and international sales businesses. 
So the fourth quarter results have been strong and the year as a whole has been good for us. We are confident that our synergy program is on track to deliver at least $1 billion in 2016 and as we have said, we are well into the process of reviewing the restructuring and refocusing our people to deliver on our plan for many years to come, reinvigorating and different today our business every market we operate in. 
Let's say, after the completion of our formal synergy programs resulting from the more recent Alliance Boots, we will expect to result to work to the more normalized economic profile for the business in 2017 and beyond. Overall, therefore, this is an exciting and busy time and although I am never satisfied with what we have achieved as I believe in general that we can ensure to reach for more. I am also realistic and acknowledge the work that they've done and recognize that this has been a good year for the company. 
I will now hand you over to George will talk through the results and give you a bit more detail on our [indiscernible]. I will come back to you after George."

Today, I'll start by taking you through the highlights of our fiscal year ended 2015 full year and fourth quarter results. I will then give you some insights into the performance of our 3 divisions before updating you on the progress that we've made in our synergy cost savings programs. I will conclude by providing some details on the Rite Aid agreement before taking you through our guidance for fiscal year 2016.
I will begin by reminding you that our fiscal year 2015 results are not likely comparable to fiscal 2014. It is primarily due to 3 key elements associated with completing the second step of our transaction on the first [ph] of December 2014. Firstly, we eliminated the 3 months performing lag for Alliance Boots and the recast prior year results with no lag. Secondly, segments were reporting from first January '15 includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD and combined corporate costs. And lastly, fiscal 2015 results include equity earnings of Alliance Boots in the 4 month of September to December 2014 and full consolidation of Alliance Boots earnings for the 8 months from January to August 2015. 
I'm proud of our achievements and accomplishments in fiscal 2015, out transaction and delivering strong financial performance and reporting a combined results for WBA require great teamwork across the organization. 
Approaching now in our overall performance for the year. Net sales for fiscal year 2015 were $103.4 billion. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $4.7 billion, management expense $605 million, the tax rate was 19.9% and net earnings to Walgreens Boots Alliance was $4.2 billion or $4.00 per diluted share. 
On an adjusted basis, our operating income was $6.2 billion as compared to fiscal 2014, the key factors which drove our fiscal 2015 results for the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations combined with growth in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Adjusted net interest expense for the year was $464 million, reflecting increased level of debt associated with the second step of the Alliance Boots transaction. 
Adjusted tax rate was 27.8%, which was lower than we were expecting due to business mix and certain discrete items that benefited us from our early in the fourth quarter. This result in adjusted net earnings typical to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2015 of $4.1 billion accretive to $3.88 per diluted share. 
So now I will quickly take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the fiscal year. For GAAP earnings typical to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal year 2015 of $4.00 per diluted share reconciles the adjusted earnings of $3.88 per diluted share. Net adjustment of $0.12 per share reflects additions of $0.17 of LIFO provision cost in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.35 of restructuring related costs, that's from our cost optimization and store closure program, and net favorable $0.02 transaction and acquisition-related items from executing step 2 of the merger with Alliance Boots. 
These additions were more than offset by removal of a $0.54 gain on our once acquire AmerisourceBergen shares and an additional net $0.12 gain from [indiscernible] Reconciliation of all component items is included as an Appendix to the slides. 
So moving on to our fourth quarter results. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $28.5 billion, an increase of 50% versus the comparable quarter in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the quarter was $836 million, and net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance of $26 million, creating $0.02 per diluted share. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income increased to $1.5 billion, lead primarily by the consolidation of Alliance Boots. Adjusted net earnings typical to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $969 million or $0.88 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 14.3% on adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter in the prior year. It should also be noted that the fourth quarter results last year included 3 months equity earnings as a result of Walgreens 45% interest in Alliance Boots compared to [indiscernible] consolidated results in this year's fourth quarter. 
Let me now that you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings of $0.02 per diluted share for the quarter reconciles the adjusted earnings of $0.88 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.86 per share incorporates the following additions: $0.05 of LIFO cost in Retail Pharmacy USA; $0.20 of restructuring-related costs; $0.21 of 10 transaction and acquisition-related items and [indiscernible] to step 2 of the merger with Alliance Boots; a $0.37 loss on our once acquire AmerisourceBergen's shares; and net $0.03 from special items. 
So now I will take you through the performance of each of our 3 divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Firstly, please remember we sold a majority stake in our infusion business in[indiscernible] with the minority position of share earnings and options care [indiscernible] now flows through the income statement as post-tax earnings from equity method investments. So looking first in the division's fiscal year performance. Total sales were $81 billion, a year-over-year increase of 6.0% [ph]. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 6.4% for the full year. On a GAAP basis for fiscal 2015, gross profit was $21.8 billion while SG&A was $18.2 billion resulting in operating income of $3.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, gross profit for the full year was $22.1 billion, SG&A was $17.2 billion and operating income was $5.1 billion. 
Adjusted operating income increased 4.8%, driven by strong sales performance and tight cost control. Please remember when assessing this increase that the benefit of these 2 factors were partially offset by the inclusion of Walgreens share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots and operating income in the prior year-over-year. 
So, excluding this impact, adjusted operating income in the division grew by 12.5%. Substantial progress was made in controlling SG&A during the year, as a result of benefits associated with our cost-savings program. This was a significant driver of the division's year-on-year performance. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses decreased by 85 basis points year-over-year. At the end of fiscal year, the division operate it's 8,173 retail stores. 
So now let's turn to the divisions fourth quarter performance. Retail Pharmacy USA's total sales in the quarter were $19.9 billion, an increase of 4.7% over the fourth quarter in the prior year. The total sales in comparable stores increased [ph] by 6.5%. 
On a GAAP basis for the quarter, gross profit of $5.3 billion while SG&A was $4.7 billion, resulting in operating income of $511 million. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $5.4 billion while SG&A was $4.3 billion. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of $1.1 billion was down 10.1% over the comparable quarter in the prior year. This was primarily due [indiscernible] new equity earnings in Alliance Boots [indiscernible] versus 3 months in the comparable period. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating income grew by 1.2%.
We were able to increase adjusted gross profit dollars compared to the final quarter of fiscal 2014 despite lower gross margins, while at the same time delivering SG&A efficiencies through our cost-savings program. 
So let's now look at pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 9.3% for the fiscal year. We filled 894 million prescriptions, including immunizations, that's on a 30-day adjusted basis, an increase of 4.4% over last year. Prescriptions filled in comparable stores, up 4.6% year-on-year. In the fourth quarter, comparable pharmacy sales were up 10.0% as we filled 222 million prescriptions, an increase of 4.6% over the equivalent quarter in the prior year. 
Prescriptions filled in comparable stores, up 5.1%. Year-over-year we continue to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D and ACA funded scripts, resulting in our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increasing to 19.1% for the year ended for the year ended 31st of August, an increase of approximately 20 basis points. 
The benefits of positive sales growth was substantially offset by pharmacy gross margin pressure, consistent with our expectations. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, including the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail and the mix of specialty products, which carry a lower margin percentage. 
The decrease in pharmacy margins is partially offset by additional branded generic conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. While we continue to anticipate margin pressure, we remain confident in our strategies to drive access, clinical programs such us Medicare Part D and deepen our payer relationships to grow our pharmacy business over time. 
Moving now into the retail products performance within Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail sales increased by 1.9% for fiscal year 2015, while comparable sales increased 1.5%. As anticipated, the rate of sales growth was slightly slower in the fourth quarter as we continue to remove our more inefficient promotions, reduced store numbers and optimize opening hours. Sales increased 0.8% in total and by 0.4% on a comparable stores basis. Overall, our strategy continues to be to drive sales growth and improve profitability, and I am pleased to report that gross profit margins have increased for the sixth quarter in succession. 
Over the past 18 months, we've improved our product mix in our key health and wellness categories, [indiscernible] to higher proportion of total sales. We've also enhanced our merchandising tools, continue to optimize our promotional performance and upgraded on shelf availability during products store at the right price. And finally, we have improved sourcing with a higher level of our own branded products. 
In fiscal year 2016, we plan to continue to invest to drive our strategy and improve our customer offer. We will take what we've learned from our successful No7 test in Phoenix and New York City, where we saw positive lift in both beauty and overall sales and rollout the new beauty offering to an additional 1,600 stores for a total of 2,000. 
With this new offer, we will elevate the customer experience, better fixtures, improve customer care, space optimization and selected store upgrades. We're also advancing the first optimization of our Balance Rewards program, more offers targeted to our everyday points program to our health and beauty customers. 
To these efforts, we're striking to improve our customers experience, expand our profit margin in the front of store and continue to grow sales in key customer category. With that, let me turn to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty businesses in 8 countries. 
As a quick reminder, our biggest operations are Boots in the U.K. followed by a Mexico. We also have retail pharmacies in Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands and Lithuania. We ended the fiscal year with division operated 4,582 retail stores. Our focus my commentary for this division primarily on the most recent quarterly results as the fiscal year only has 8 months of data and therefore, isn't all that meaningful particularly as it does not cover the important holiday season. 
Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.5 billion, sales growth when compared with our third quarter was mainly due to the expected strongest sales in seasonal categories combined with currency benefits, mainly the British pound strengthening versus the dollar. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion and SG&A was $1.3 billion, resulting in operating income of $196 million. 
On an adjusted basis, gross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion and SG&A expense was $1.2 billion, which resulted in operating income of $242 million [indiscernible]. Adjusted operating margin was 7.0% for the quarter, which was in line with postacquisition figure over the last 8 months of the fiscal year. 
To note, let's look more closely at the operating performance of the division. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable store sales growth for the quarter was 4.3%. Comparable store retail sales growth of 4.5%, being somewhat stronger than pharmacy at 4.1%. Comparable store sales growth in U.K. was 3.5% in the quarter. Growth across all retail sales categories resulted in comparable store retail sales [indiscernible] of 4.9%, performance in beauty and offering being the largest factors. 
In beauty, No7, our award winning beauty brand celebrated its 80th anniversary with another good quarter, with both skin care and cosmetics delivering double-digit sales growth in the U.K. Sales of No7 Protect & Perfect Advanced Serum continue to be strong, [indiscernible] 1 year on from their launch, supported by their continuing market program, which highlights the clinically proven product benefits, which I talked about on our last earnings call. 
During the quarter, we also launched No7 advanced day and night cream with a new color cosmetics campaign. Both of these initiatives were well-received by our customers. Our U.K. website, boots.com, continues to see strong growth with orders during the order up more than 65% over the same period last year. 
The beginning of August, we further enhance the convenience of our order and collect offer by enabling customers to order by 8:00 p.m. still collect in-store from 12 noon the following day. In the fourth quarter, nearly 70% of all our online orders in the U.K. were collected in-store. 
Outside the U.K., our businesses in Mexico, Thailand and the Republic of Ireland all delivered pro forma constant currency comparable store sales for the quarter, while above the average of the division as the [indiscernible] competition U.K. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division in the fourth quarter work $5.8 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming constant currency and excluding acquisitions and disposals, sales increased by 5.0% over the same quarter in the prior year. 
Sales growth was particularly strong in Norway where our wholesale business won a major new contract pharmacy, which we began right on the start of calendar 2015 and 5 other countries where our businesses each achieved double-digit comparable sales growth in the quarter. This included 2 of our largest wholesale businesses in Turkey and Germany. 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was up $133 million, though adjusted operating income was $158 million. Adjusted operating income margin for the quarter was 2.7% compared to 2.9% for the 8 months postacquisition. This, in part, lies the seasonal nature of pharmaceutical wholesaling. 
So having covered our divisional performance, I would now like to turn to our synergy program, some of the key drivers of profit growth. So combining that synergies for fiscal 2015 was $799 million, significantly above our target of at least $650 million. This includes $81 million plus [indiscernible] synergies in the fourth quarter, which relates to activities commencing in prior fiscal years. 
Consistent with our prior reporting, this synergies are allocated across each segment. They do not include any benefit from our long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen or the benefits of refinancing the legacy Alliance Boots indebtedness at a lower cost. 
For fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect at least to reach at least $1 billion in combined net synergies. As time goes on and the combined management team works closely together, there are, of course, a number of other synergies being identified and actioned, but many of them are simply not practical to quantify as they blend into our core operations. 
So moving now to our cost-savings program, which is as you know, is another key area of focus. As previously announced, we have a target of $1.5 billion of cost savings to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. We expect the reach pretax charges associated with this program, as previously stated, of reaching $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, with cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. We continue to make good progress towards this goals and have achieved more than half of the program's expected savings as of the end of the fiscal year. 
In the Retail Pharmacy USA division, which is the primary driver of this program, this included closing 75 stores in the quarter, making a total of 84 store closures in fiscal 2015 as part of our plan to close approximately 200 stores total. 
Actions taken during fiscal 2015 have resulted in pretax charges totaling $542 million, including $223 million for asset impairments, $202 million for real estate closures and $$117 million for severance and other business transactions and fixed costs. 
So now I've now like to look at cash flow and capital deployment. GAAP operating profit cash flow was $5.7 billion for the full fiscal year and $1.5 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the full year and $1.1 billion in the quarter. 
Although it's hard for you to gauge our cash generating abilities from today's results, I'd like to give you some insight into our operating cash flow and working capital priorities. We remain intensely focused in driving cash flow across our 3 business segments. 
So in our Retail Pharmacy USA division, during the year, we've improved inventory management, both pharmacy and retail products. We have more opportunities in inventory covering focus on accounts receivable and accounts payable, all with the aim of driving further working capital savings. We will continue to apply the same discipline in Retail Pharmacy International, Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Total capital expenditure was $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year and $361 million in the quarter. After the merger, we put in place operational governance procedures to approve capital and then show that we are prudently maintaining our infrastructure, while investing in the right growth initiatives to generate return to shareholders. This processes working well. 
You will see a step-up in capital spend from the third to fourth quarter, which has lead to our renewed drive to invest in in key areas and develop our customer proposition, including information technology. 
So moving on to our key financing activities. In line with our philosophy of having an efficient balance sheet, we completed $395 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization, bringing the total purchase under this program to $726 million by the fiscal year-end. Since then, an existing 10b5-1 program is being completed, in which we acquired an additional $110 million of shares. We now have $2.2 billion of value remaining under our authorized bond. 
In addition, as we previously announced, we redeemed the $1.75 billion of legacy Walgreens debt in August As we've said before, we remain committed to a long-term dividend payout target between 30% and 35% of adjusted net earnings. 
But before I finish and hand back to Stefano, let me just spend a few minutes on the impact of our agreement to acquire Rite Aid on fiscal 2016 guidance. As you know, the agreed price per share for Rite Aid is $9, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt. The consideration for the shares will be paid in cash from existing new resource. The transaction is, as you will expect, subject to approval by Rite Aid shareholders, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. We have done significant analysis on how we can bring the 2 companies together, including antitrust [indiscernible] closely with regulators to bring the transaction to completion as soon as possible. That said, we anticipate the transaction closing in the second half of calendar 2016. The exact timing of this will clearly determine the impact on our financial results. 
Clearly, we are very confident in taking everything into account, the transaction will be suitably accretive for us. We have been prudent in our assumptions for the business and have been realistic about the expectations for the markets in which we operate. That said, we expect the transaction to be accretive during the first full year after completion on our usual adjusted basis. 
In addition to timing, there are a number of other factors that will impact us. We've identified an excess $1 billion [ph] per gross synergy that we must -- that we will start working to capture as soon as completion takes place. But we must recognize that while some of these are relatively easy to identify, others will require investment and will take time to deliver. 
As we are paying cash for the acquisition, we have taken the decision to suspend our share repurchase program and intend to redeploy that cash to partly fund the transaction. This means that in 2016, we will not enjoy the earnings accretion of the buybacks we originally planned. In fact, we will be running a road to the inefficient balance sheet for a short period of time. 
The transaction will also cause a temporary increase in leverage, but this does not represent an underlying tension financial policy. We'll put in place a guide path to deliver metrics consistent with our commitment to solid investment-grade. 
So with all that said, let me conclude by talking about our outlook for fiscal year 2016. As you know, we've previously had stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.60. We committed on our Analyst Meeting meeting in April, that on completion of our budgeting process, we will come back to you to give an updated view of 2016. 
Based on our budget and further evaluation of both risks and opportunity, which factors in our currency headwind of around $0.13 since the previous Walgreens management initially provided our FY '16 adjusted EPS goal back in August 2014. We're issuing new guidance for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.55. This change is primarily to reflect the impact suspending our share buyback program, to apply these funds towards the consideration for the transaction. This guidance assumes no material accretion from the planned acquisition of Rite Aid, which is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016. Please also remember that we have translational exposure primarily based on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause particularly volatility in the sales, gross margin and SG&A items as it did this quarter. 
As Stefano indicated, we anticipate the published numerical synergy targets from the merger between Walgreens and Alliance Boots to be met in 2016, and we'd advice you after we will have achieved that target. The synergies and benefits from the transaction with Rite Aid will be almost entirely within our U.S. retail pharmacy division and so it will be reflected in these figures rather than a separate itemized programs. 
Clearly, we will continue to drive hard efficiencies across [indiscernible] but we see this as normal working practice rather than unique and discrete projects. And so going further beyond 2016, we would expect our earnings growth to return a more normal fiscal challenge low double-digit growth. 
In terms of the shape of the quarters, please remember that both our first and second quarters of fiscal year '16 are noncomparable given that we close the merger on the 31st of December 2014. Seasonality is most prominent in our retail pharmacy segments with the first quarter typically the weakest. Our second quarter picks up most of the holiday season, which will be more prominent going forward as we will consolidate December results of for Retail Pharmacy International. This would include Boots performance in December, which is typically it's most important trading month. We also expect the shape of the second half of the fiscal year to be generally consistent with what we saw in fiscal 2015, with adjusted earnings per share in Q3 and Q4, stepping down sequentially from Q2. 
So with that, I will turn the call back to Stefano."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2015 full year earnings call. So this is an exciting time for us, not only are we today announcing the first full year results as a wholly combined company, but also, as you've seen, we are announcing the acquisition of Rite Aid, a transaction that would significantly accelerate our plan to expand our presence in the West. With this acquisition, we are accelerating long-term objective that we knew we needed to address, to strengthen our presence and coverage nationally throughout the U.S. I have to say that we have reached an agreement with Rite Aid that reflects what we believe to be very fair terms, which will help us to unlock real value from the transaction. 
The addition of Rite Aid will accelerate our strategy by completing our network, providing a larger and more comprehensive portfolio, of which we can deploy our knowledge and skill, and creating a more comprehensive and stronger platform for the development of our brand presence and the future growth of our business. 
Clearly, there is still a lot to be done to complete the transaction with Rite Aid. Our teams have done a lot of work on these, and we will work closely with the regulators to bring the transaction to a conclusion as soon as possible. George will give you more details about our agreement to acquire Rite Aid in a few moments. 
But first, let me review the progress we have made in the past year in our work to transform our businesses into right growth across the company. When I spoke to you in July, I refer to the extraordinary amount of work that has been going on inside the company to establish the processes and systems from which to being the more responsive, efficient and relevant business. This is critical for what is today a rapidly changing business environment, with new and different dynamics that the company [indiscernible]
In all of our markets, we faced tough challenges, be it from competitors or from governments, relentless drive to manage health care costs. That said, I don't believe any one on this forum not say the same thing on their business. Our job is [indiscernible] that we'll continue to be to identify, address and, if we can, lead the market to efficient scale insight and innovation. Of course, with the completion of our transaction to form Walgreens Boots Alliance in January and the subsequent executive and management changes, it has taken us a little time to come to [indiscernible] with the business. And as part of this, we have been actively working to strengthen and simplify our management reporting factor and system to ensure that we can build a reliable and accurate picture of our book and understand our strengths and weaknesses. 
We are ready to spend some time restructuring and refocusing a number of parts of the business and the number of areas of management. In some areas, we have found it necessary to bring in people and skills from outside the group, recognizing that for our U.S. business, to dovetail the management reporting of recent extensive international network that requires something different in terms of systems and expertise than running a U.S.-based domestic business. Internationally, our management there are ready take some time to understand how they are impacted by the shift in the nature of our business that is inevitable given the scale of our U.S. business. 
The practical and cultural issues that these changes have raised are complex but have been a helping part by the relationships and connections we begin to forge in the year before initial announcement of our deal and hits the final completion. And the margin around -- has been achieved within the company, but we remain very much at the beginning of our journey. Alex and his team have been working hard to ensure that we are operating in an efficient and effective manner, optimize as far as possible to the needs of the communities that it serves. 
They have made a lot of progress but there is a lot more to do. I want to understand the demand and potential for a more unique advantage of how our brand product using the Boots products as a base is now beyond the trial stage and is beginning to rollout in a managed way across the network. 
We are restructuring the front end of our stores to set us on the right path of future growth even if as anticipated. This is the short-term cost of something, however, this short-term impact is compensated for by the improved margins that this restructuring has delivered. We are also continuing to innovate in new channels to stay relevant and continue to pull the strengths of our brand individual growth. Every bit as much as in the physical one. I will be doing a great disservice to many people outside the U.S. if I did not mention that there are outstanding efforts as well. That this result -- resulted in solid performance from our international retail pharmacy and international sales businesses. 
So the fourth quarter results have been strong and the year as a whole has been good for us. We are confident that our synergy program is on track to deliver at least $1 billion in 2016. And as we have said, we are well into the process of reviewing and restructuring and refocusing our people to deliver on our plan for many years to come, reinvigorating and differentiating our business across every market we operate in. 
Let's say, after the completion of our formal synergy programs, resulting from the more recent Alliance Boots transaction, we will expect the result to work, so you can see there are more normalized economic growth profile for the business in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, therefore, this is an exciting and busy time. And although I am never satisfied with what we have achieved as I believe in general that we can ensure our way to reach for more. I am also realistic and acknowledge the work that they've been done and recognize that this has been a good year for the company. 
I will now hand you over to George to talk through the results and give you a bit more detail on our recent [indiscernible] I will come back to you after that. George, please?"
93624,312356229,883890,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano.

Today, I'll start by taking you through the highlights of our fiscal year ended 2015 full year and fourth quarter results. I will then give you some insights into the performance of our 3 divisions before updating you on the progress that we've made in our synergy and cost savings programs. I will conclude by providing some details on the Rite Aid agreement before taking you through our guidance for fiscal year 2016.
I will begin by reminding you that our fiscal year 2015 results are not likely comparable to fiscal 2014. This is primarily due to 3 key elements associated with completing the second step of our transaction on the 31st of December 2014. Firstly, we eliminated the 3-month reporting lag for Alliance Boots and recast prior year results with no lag. Secondly, segmental reporting from 1st January '15 includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD and combined corporate costs. And lastly, fiscal 2015 results include equity earnings in Alliance Boots for the 4 month of September to December 2014 and full consolidation of Alliance Boots earnings for the 8 months from January to August 2015. 
I'm proud of our achievements and accomplishments in fiscal 2015, closing out transaction, delivering strong financial performance and reporting a combined results for WBA require great teamwork across the organization. 
Looking now at our overall performance for the year. Net sales for fiscal year 2015 were $103.4 billion. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $4.7 billion; managed expense, $605 million. The tax rate was 19.9%, and net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance was $4.2 billion or $4.00 per diluted share. 
On an adjusted basis, our operating income was $6.2 billion as compared to fiscal 2014, the key factors which drove our fiscal 2015 results for the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations combined with growth in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Adjusted net interest expense for the year was $464 million, reflecting increased level of debt associated with the second step of the Alliance Boots transaction. 
Adjusted tax rate was 27.8%, which was lower than we were expecting due to business mix and certain discrete items that benefited us primarily in the fourth quarter. This result in adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2015 of $4.1 billion equating to $3.88 per diluted share. 
So now I will quickly take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the fiscal year. For GAAP earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal year 2015 of $4.00 per diluted share reconciles the adjusted earnings of $3.88 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.12 per share reflects additions of $0.17 of LIFO provision costs in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.35 of restructuring-related costs, that's from our cost optimization and store closure program, and a net favorable $0.02 transaction and acquisition-related items from executing step 2 of the merger with Alliance Boots. 
These additions were more than offset by removal of a $0.54 gain on our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares and an additional net $0.12 gain from special items. This reconciliation of all component items is included as an Appendix to the slides. 
So moving on to our fourth quarter results. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $28.5 billion, an increase of 50% versus the comparable quarter in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the quarter was $836 million, and net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $26 million, creating $0.02 per diluted share. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income increased to $1.5 billion, due primarily by the consolidation of Alliance Boots. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $969 million or $0.88 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 14.3% on adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter in the prior year. It should also be noted that the fourth quarter results last year included 3 months equity earnings as a result of Walgreens 45% interest in Alliance Boots compared to fully consolidated results in this year's fourth quarter. 
Let me now take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings of $0.02 per diluted share for the quarter reconciles the adjusted earnings of $0.88 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.86 per share incorporates the following additions: $0.05 of LIFO provision costs in Retail Pharmacy USA; $0.20 of restructuring-related costs; $0.21 of transaction and acquisition-related items in regard to step 2 of the merger with Alliance Boots; a $0.37 loss on our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares; and net $0.03 from special items. 
So now I will take you through the performance of each of our 3 divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Firstly, please remember that we sold a majority stake in our infusion business on 7th of April, with a minority position of shared earnings in Option Care now flows through the income statement as post-tax earnings from equity method investments. So looking first in the division's fiscal year performance. Total sales were $81 billion, a year-over-year increase of 6.0%. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 6.4% for the full year. On a GAAP basis for fiscal 2015, gross profit was $21.8 billion while SG&A was $18.2 billion, resulting in operating income of $3.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, gross profit for the full year was $22.1 billion, SG&A was $17.2 billion and operating income was $5.1 billion. 
Adjusted operating income increased 4.8%, driven by strong sales performance and tight cost control. Please remember when assessing this increase that the benefit of these 2 factors were partially offset by the inclusion of Walgreens share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots and operating income in the prior year. So excluding this impact, adjusted operating income in the division grew by 12.5%. 
Substantial progress was made in controlling SG&A during the year as a result of benefits associated with our cost-savings program. This was a significant driver of the division's year-on-year performance. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses decreased by 85 basis points year-over-year. At the end of fiscal year, the division operated 8,173 retail stores. 
So now let's turn to the division's fourth quarter performance. Retail Pharmacy USA's total sales in the quarter were $19.9 billion, an increase of 4.7% over the fourth quarter in the prior year. The total sales in comparable stores increased by 6.5%. 
On a GAAP basis for the quarter, gross profit of $5.3 billion while SG&A was $4.7 billion, resulting in operating income of $511 million. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $5.4 billion while SG&A was $4.3 billion. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of $1.1 billion was down 10.1% over the comparable quarter in the prior year. This was primarily due from the new equity earnings in Alliance Boots in current quarter versus 3 months in the comparable period. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating income grew by 1.2%.
We were able to increase adjusted gross profit dollars compared to the final quarter of fiscal 2014 despite lower gross margins, while at the same time, delivering SG&A efficiencies through our cost-savings program. 
So let's now look at pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 9.3% for the fiscal year. We filled 894 million prescriptions, including immunizations, that's on a 30-day adjusted basis, an increase of 4.4% over last year, with prescriptions filled in comparable stores, up 4.6% year-on-year. In the fourth quarter, comparable pharmacy sales were up 10.0% as we filled 222 million prescriptions, an increase of 4.6% over the equivalent quarter in the prior year, with prescriptions filled in comparable stores, up 5.1%. Year-over-year we continue to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D, an ACA-funded scripts, resulting in our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increasing to 19.1% for the year ended for the year ended 31st of August, an increase of approximately 20 basis points. 
The benefits of positive sales growth was, however, substantially offset by pharmacy gross margin pressure consistent with our expectations. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, including the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail and the mix of specialty products, which carry a lower margin percentage. 
The decrease in pharmacy margins is partially offset by additional branded to generic drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. While we continue to anticipate margin pressure, we remain confident in our strategies to drive access of clinical programs such us Medicare Part D and deepen our payer relationships to grow our pharmacy business over time. 
Moving now onto the retail products' performance within Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail sales increased by 1.9% for fiscal year 2015, while comparable sales increased 1.5%. As anticipated, the rate of sales growth was slightly slower in the fourth quarter as we continue to remove our more inefficient promotions, reduce store numbers and optimize store opening hours. Sales increased 0.8% in total and by 0.4% on a comparable sales basis. Overall, our strategy continues to be to drive sales growth and improve profitability, and I am pleased to report that gross profit margins have increased for the sixth quarter in succession. 
Over the past 18 months, we have improved our product mix, with our key health and wellness categories now contributing to higher proportion of total sales. We've also enhanced our merchandising tools, continued to optimize our promotional performance and upgraded on-shelf availability of the new products at in-store at the right price. And finally, we have improved sourcing with a higher level of our own branded products. 
In fiscal year 2016, we plan to continue to invest to drive our strategy and improve our customer offer. We will take what we've learned from our successful No7 test in Phoenix and New York City, where we saw a positive lift in both beauty and overall sales and rollout the new beauty offering to an additional 1,600 stores for a total of 2,000. With this new offer, we will elevate the customer experience, better fixtures, improve customer care, space optimization and selected store upgrades. We're also advancing the customization of our Balance Rewards program, with more offers targeted to our every day points program to our health and beauty customers. 
Through these efforts, we're striving to improve our customers' experience, expand our profit margin in the pharmacy store and continue to grow sales in key customer category. 
With that, let me turn to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty businesses in 8 countries. As a quick reminder, our biggest operations are Boots in the U.K. followed by Mexico. We also have retail pharmacies in Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and Lithuania. At the end of the fiscal year, the division operated 4,582 retail stores. I will focus my commentary for this division primarily on the most recent quarterly results as the fiscal year only has 8 months of data and, therefore, isn't all that meaningful, particularly, as it does not cover the important holiday season. 
Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.5 billion, sales growth when compared with our third quarter was mainly due to the expected stronger sales in seasonal categories combined with currency benefits, mainly the British pound strengthening versus the dollar. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion and SG&A was $1.3 billion, resulting in operating income of $196 million. 
On an adjusted basis, gross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion and SG&A expense was $1.2 billion, which resulted in operating income of $242 million. Adjusted operating margin was 7.0% for the quarter, which was in line with post-acquisition figure of the last 8 months of the fiscal year. 
To note, let's look more closely at the operating performance of the division. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable store sales growth for the quarter was 4.3%. Comparable store retail sales growth of 4.5%, being somewhat stronger than pharmacy at 4.1%. Comparable store sales growth in Boots U.K. was 3.5% in the quarter. Growth across all Boots U.K. retail sales categories resulted in comparable store retail sales growth of 4.9%, good performances in beauty and from online offering being the largest factors. 
In beauty, No7, our award winning beauty brand celebrated its 80th anniversary with another good quarter, with both skin care and cosmetics delivering double-digit sales growth in the U.K. Sales of No7 Protect & Perfect Advanced Serum continue to be strong, going 1 year on from their launch, supported by their continuing marketing program, which highlights the clinically proven product benefits, which I talked about on our last earnings call. 
During the quarter, we also launched No7 advanced day and night creams, with a new colored cosmetics campaign. Both of these initiatives were well received by our customers. Our U.K. website, boots.com, continued to see strong growth, with orders during the order up more than 65% over the same period last year. 
In the beginning of August, we further enhanced the convenience of our order and collect offer, now enabling customers to order by 8:00 p.m. and still collect in-store from 12 noon the following day. In the fourth quarter, nearly 70% of all our online orders in the U.K. were collected in-store. 
Outside the U.K., our businesses in Mexico, Thailand and the Republic of Ireland all delivered pro forma constant currency comparable store sales for the quarter, while above the average of the division as the Boots saw competition in the U.K. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division in the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming constant currency and excluding acquisitions and disposals in the space, sales increased by 5.0% over the same quarter in the prior year. 
Sales growth was particularly strong in Norway, where our wholesale business won a major new contract while hospital pharmacy, which began right on the start of calendar 2015, and 5 other countries, where our businesses each achieved double-digit comparable sales growth in the quarter. This included 2 of our largest wholesale businesses in Turkey and Germany. 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was up $133 million while adjusted operating income was $158 million. Adjusted operating income margin for the quarter was 2.7% compared to 2.9% for the 8 months post-acquisition. This, in part, reflects the seasonal nature of pharmaceutical wholesaling. 
So having covered our divisional performance, I would now like to turn to our synergy program, one of the key drivers of profit growth. So combined net synergies for fiscal 2015 were $799 million, significantly above our target of at least $650 million. This includes $81 million plus prior net synergies in the fourth quarter, which relates to activities commencing in prior fiscal years. 
Consistent with our prior reporting, these synergies are allocated across each segment. They do not include any benefit from our long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen or the benefits of refinancing the legacy Alliance Boots indebtedness at a lower cost. 
For fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect at least -- to reach at least $1 billion in combined net synergies. As time goes on and the combined management team works closely together, there are, of course, a number of other synergies being identified and actioned, but many of them are simply not practical to quantify as they blend into our core operations. 
So moving now to our cost-savings program, which is as you know, is another key area of focus. As previously announced, we have a target of $1.5 billion of cost savings to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. We expect the pretax charges associated with this program, as previously stated, between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, with cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. We continue to make good progress towards this goal and have achieved more than half of the program's expected savings as of the end of the fiscal year. 
In the Retail Pharmacy USA division, which is the primary driver of this program, this included closing 75 stores in the quarter, making a total of 84 store closures in fiscal 2015 as part of our plan to close approximately 200 stores in total. 
Actions taken during fiscal 2015 have resulted in pretax charges totaling $542 million, including $223 million for asset impairments, $202 million for real estate closures and $117 million for severance and other business transition and exit costs. 
So now I've now like to look at cash flow and capital deployment. GAAP operating profit cash flow was $5.7 billion for the full fiscal year and $1.5 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the full year and $1.1 billion in the quarter. 
Although it's hard for you to gauge our cash-generating abilities from today's results, I'd like to give you some insight into our operating cash flow and working capital priorities. We remain intensely focused in driving cash flow across our 3 business segments. 
Within our Retail Pharmacy USA division, during the year, we've improved inventory management in both pharmacy and retail products. We have more opportunities in inventory, covering huge focus on accounts receivable and accounts payable, all with the aim of driving further working capital savings. We will continue to apply the same discipline in Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Total capital expenditure was $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year and $361 million in the quarter. After the merger, we put in place operational governance procedures to improve capital and ensure that we are prudently maintaining our infrastructure while investing in the right growth initiatives to generate return to shareholders. This process is working well. You will see a step-up in capital spend from the third to fourth quarter, which has lead to our renewed drive to invest in key areas and develop our customer proposition, including information technology. 
So moving onto our key financing activities. In line with our philosophy of having an efficient balance sheet, we completed $395 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization, bringing the total purchases under this program to $726 million by the fiscal year end. Since then, an existing 10b5-1 program has been being completed, in which we acquired an additional $110 million of shares. We now have $2.2 billion of value remaining under our authorized bond. 
In addition, as we previously announced, we redeemed the $1.75 billion of legacy Walgreens debt in August As we've said before, we remain committed to a long-term dividend payout rate -- payout target between 30% and 35% of adjusted net earnings. 
But before I finish and hand back to Stefano, let me just spend a few minutes on the impact of our agreement to acquire Rite Aid and on fiscal 2016 guidance. As you know, the agreed price per share for Rite Aid is $9, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt. The consideration for the shares will be paid in cash from existing new resource. The transaction is, as you would expect, subject to approval by Rite Aid shareholders, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. We have done significant analysis on how we can bring the 2 companies together, including the antitrust analysis and we'll work closely with the regulators to bring the transaction to completion as soon as possible. That said, we anticipate the transaction closing in the second half of calendar 2016. The exact timing of this will clearly determine the impact on our financial results. 
Clearly, we are very confident in taking everything into account, the transaction will be suitably accretive for us. We have been prudent in our assumptions for the business and have been realistic about our expectations for the markets in which we operate. That said, we expect the transaction to be accretive during the first full year after completion on our usual adjusted basis. 
In addition to timing, there are a number of other factors that will impact us. We've identified an excess $1 billion of gross synergy that we must -- that we will start working to capture as soon as completion takes place. But we must recognize that while some of these are relatively easy to identify, others will require investment and will take time to deliver. 
As we are paying cash for the acquisition, we have taken the decision to suspend our share repurchase program and intend to redeploy that cash to partly fund the transaction. This means that in 2016, we will not enjoy the earnings accretion of the buybacks we originally planned. In fact, we'll be running a road to the inefficient balance sheet for a short period of time. 
The transaction will also cause a temporary increase in leverage, but this does not represent an underlying change in financial policy. We'll put in place a guide path to deliver metrics consistent with our commitment to solid investment grade. 
So with all that said, let me conclude by talking about our outlook for fiscal year 2016. As you know, we've previously had stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.60. We committed on our Analyst meeting in April, that on completion of our budgeting process, we would come back to you to give an updated view of 2016. 
Based on our budget and further evaluation of both risks and opportunity, we factored in our currency headwind of around $0.13 since the previous Walgreens management initially provided our FY '16 adjusted EPS goal back in August 2014. We're issuing new guidance for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.55. This change is primarily to reflect the impact of suspending our share buyback program, to apply these funds towards the consideration for the transaction. This guidance assumes no material accretion from the planned acquisition of Rite Aid, which is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016. 
Please also remember that we have clumsy the translational exposure primarily based on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause particularly volatility in the sales, gross margin and SG&A items as it did this quarter. 
As Stefano indicated, we anticipate to publish numerical synergy target from the merger between Walgreens and Alliance Boots to be met during 2016, and we'd advice you after we will have achieved that target. The synergies and benefits from the transaction with Rite Aid will be almost entirely within our U.S. Retail Pharmacy division, and so it will be reflected in these figures rather than separately itemized programs. 
Clearly, we will continue to drive hard efficiencies post the procurement, but we see this as normal working practice rather than unique and discrete projects. And so going further beyond 2016, we would expect our earnings growth to return to a more normal fiscal challenge in low double-digit growth. 
In terms of the shape of the quarters, please remember that both our first and second quarters of fiscal year '16 are noncomparable given that we close the merger on the 31st of December 2014. Seasonality is most prominent in our retail pharmacy segments, with the first quarter is typically the weakest. Our second quarter picks up most of the holiday season, which will be more prominent going forward as we will consolidate December results for Retail Pharmacy International. This would include Boots performance in December, which is typically it's most important trading month. We also expect the shape of the second half of the fiscal year to be generally consistent with what we saw in fiscal 2015, with adjusted earnings per share in Q3 and Q4 stepping down sequentially from Q2. 
So with that, I will turn the call back to Stefano."

So another good year, but a year of transition that brought many challenges but also with many successes, including our announcement with Rite Aid. It has been particularly gratifying to have been able to keep our team on track and maintain our momentum in our businesses, both in the U.S. and around the world, while at the same time be able to study and understand our new markets and deliver corporate expansion as we are doing with Rite Aid. 
As CEO, I very much recognize my role is both to support my team in achieving also partly their goals but also in creating the opportunities and direction for them to outperform and identify sources of growth and value enhancement while helping mark the route for sustained growth to secure the future for the company well beyond my tenure. As we said today, we have potential opportunities in many businesses, in many geographies. We continue to review all the opportunities open to us to assess where best to deploy our capital to provide the best return of our investors. 
The health care market is extraordinarily dynamic with many moving parts, and these dynamics create new opportunities and new ideas all the time. A key part of my role is to make sure that we pursue these opportunities where they are desirable to do so and not waste time and resources to where it is now and also to ensure that we do that without distracting our teams on delivering on our long- and short-term plans of our existing businesses. Over time, you can expect to see us complement the development of our existing businesses with further additions that will help us better define and differentiate our business. 
As we look at our opportunities around the globe, even the unique dynamic of the U.S. market, it is not surprising that the best opportunity we have found this year has been here, while elsewhere our expansion has been through the selective purchase event and a small bolt-on acquisition to our original business. 
The global health care market and perhaps the U.S. markets, more than any, are ready for change and openness to new ideas and new approaches while it provides care. As a leading global health care company, we have the potential to play a tiny role in this evolution. We have always married prudence with a willingness to find innovative solutions and think about things in new ways and these are qualities I am glad to be spreading across the group and I believe will form the foundation for the success of the business going forward.

We're really pleased with what's happening. The customers have signed into this program. We have, I think, about 27 million of customers signed into it and they have quite a few points. And more importantly, as we analyze how they're redeeming the points, we're seeing encouraging behavior where people are actually selecting more and more own-brand products and bigger baskets and products they may not otherwise have bought. So it's really early days. I mean, the program has been out there for only a matter of months, but the behavior we're seeing in these customers are encouraging and it is exactly the type of behavior we've seen in other loyalty programs that we know of well in the group.

And also, as we really learn some of the excellent work from the outside that the Rite Aid team have done in their new wellness format, we have the opportunity to put all that together once we're through the FTC review and see how we can improve performance in all of our networks across America and to provide better front-end performance through a more appropriate offer for communities across America, supporting a better quality pharmacy experience and, of course, lower costs. So that's our intention. But obviously, once we're through the process of FTC, we'll be able to work more closely with the teams and understand that better. But we think there's opportunity both in Walgreens, and clearly, the team at Rite Aid has seen a good improvement in their wellness format and will be read in terms of the reporting."

I mean, as I touched in the presentation, one of the reasons that we saw a step-up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter was IT program.

So there's a lot of work on IT underway. In terms of the gross synergies, it's really -- I mean, these will come in U.S., as we have said, which is why it becomes harder to separate out than in the -- as we start to integrate the operations plus being able to complete the transaction. But the synergies that will come will be procurement synergies, where there clearly isn't an investment requirement but then it will be investment over time and there is like, in IT, upgrading the stores and we will do that in a thoughtful, structured way. We'll be looking at stores on a store-by-store basis as we always do, looking for the returns that we continue to seek. So the investment will always take a little bit longer to come.

Well, we are not thinking of really improving our position with the payers because at the end of the day, we are in an environment where the margins are decreasing. So it was decreasing. We are in an environment where there is a lot of competition and the fact that we put together 2 companies would not reduce the competition.

So I do appreciate that's made the segment analysis a little tougher for you to follow.

Another result, obviously, with the Retail Pharmacy USA being, by far, our biggest segment, then you should think of the synergies being heavily, heavily weighted towards the U.S. segment. It's the basis that I would always think about. I think as we annualized through as we get to the third quarter, which I guess will be our first sort of clean year-on-year quarter, it will be a little bit easier for you to see. And of course, it's the hard synergies, which are the ones that we're quantifying. But really a lot of the -- of what are, in effect, synergies, but they're not the ones that we can quantify.

Really taking into account the timing of the tenure of leases and when the lease breaks off, so that we have a balance in our portfolio going forward and don't have the bunching of lease breaks over at the same time. So we'll be doing this -- looking at this in a thoughtful way over time is the way I would position it."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2015 full year earnings call. So this is an exciting time for us, not only are we today announcing the first full year results as a fully combined company, but also, as you've seen, we are announcing the acquisition of Rite Aid, a transaction that would significantly accelerate our plan to expand our presence in the West. With this acquisition, we are accelerating a long-term objective that we knew we needed to address, to strengthen our presence and coverage nationally throughout the U.S. I have to say that we have reached an agreement with Rite Aid that reflects what we believe to be very fair terms, which will help us to unlock real value from the transaction. 
The addition of Rite Aid will accelerate our strategy by completing our network, providing a larger and more comprehensive portfolio, off which we can deploy our knowledge and skill, and creating a more comprehensive and stronger platform for the development of our brand presence and the future growth of our business.  Clearly, there is still a lot to be done to complete the transaction with Rite Aid. Our teams have done a lot of work on this, and we will work closely with the regulators to bring the transaction to a conclusion as soon as possible. George will give you more details about our agreement to acquire Rite Aid in a few moments. 
But first, let me review the progress we have made in the past year in our work to transform our businesses and drive growth across the company. When I spoke to you in July, I referred to the extraordinary amount of work that has been going on inside the company to establish the processes and systems from which to being the more responsive, efficient and relevant business. This is critical for what is today a rapidly changing business environment, with new and different dynamics than those that the company has historically been used to.
In all of our markets, we face tough challenges, be they from competitors or from governments, relentless drive to manage health care costs. That said, I do not believe any one on this forum not say the same thing on their business. Our job is [indiscernible] that we'll continue to be to identify, address and, if we can, lead the market to efficient scale, insight and innovation. Of course, with the completion of our transaction to form Walgreens Boots Alliance in January and the subsequent executive and management changes, it has taken us a little time to come [indiscernible] with the business. And as part of this, we have been actively working to strengthen and simplify our management reporting structure and system to ensure that we can build a reliable and accurate picture of our book and understand our strengths and weaknesses. 
We are ready to spend some time restructuring and refocusing a number of parts of the business and the number of areas of management. In some areas, we have found it necessary to bring in people and skills from outside the group, recognizing that for our U.S. business, to dovetail the management reporting of what is an extensive international network that requires something different in terms of systems and expertise than running a U.S.-based domestic business. Internationally, our management there are ready take some time to understand how they are impacted by the shift in the nature of our business that is inevitable given the scale of our U.S. business. 
The practical and cultural issues that these changes have raised are complex but have been helped in part by the relationships and connections we began to forge in the year before initial announcement of our deal and since the final completion. An amazing amount has been achieved within the company, but we remain very much at the beginning of our journey. Alex and his team have been working hard to ensure that we are operating in an efficient and effective manner, optimized as far as possible to the needs of the communities that it serves. 
They have made a lot of progress but there is a lot more still to do. Our work to understand the demand and potential for a more unique advantage [ph] of our brand product using the Boots products as a base is now beyond the trial stage and is beginning to roll out in a managed way across the network. We are restructuring the front end of our stores to set us on the right path of future growth. Similarly, as anticipated, this is at the short-term cost of something, however, this short-term impact is compensated for by the improved margins that this restructuring has delivered. We are also continuing to innovate in new channels to stay relevant and continue to prove the strength of our brand individual growth, every bit as much as in the physical one. I will be doing a great disservice to many people outside the U.S. if I did not mention their outstanding efforts as well. That has resulted in solid performance from our international retail pharmacy and international sales businesses. 
So the fourth quarter results have been strong and the year as a whole has been good for us. We are confident that our synergy program is on track to deliver at least $1 billion in 2016. And as we have said, we are well into the process of reviewing and restructuring and refocusing our people to deliver on our plan for many years to come, reinvigorating and differentiating our business across every market we operate in. That said, after the completion of our formal synergy programs, resulting from the more recent Alliance Boots transaction, we will expect to revert to what we would consider a more normalized economic growth profile for the business in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, therefore, this is an exciting and busy time. And although I am never satisfied with what we have achieved as I believe in general that we can ensure our way to reach for more. I am also realistic and acknowledge the work that has been done and recognize that this has been a good year for the company. 
I will now hand you over to George to talk through the results and give you a bit more detail on our recent [indiscernible]. I will come back to you after that. George, please?"

Today, I'll start by taking you through the highlights of our fiscal year ended 2015 full year and fourth quarter results. I will then give you some insights into the performance of our 3 divisions before updating you on the progress that we've made in our synergy and cost saving programs. I will conclude by providing some details on the Rite Aid agreement before taking you through our guidance for fiscal year 2016.
I will begin by reminding you that our fiscal year 2015 results are not likely comparable to fiscal 2014. This is primarily due to 3 key elements associated with completing the second step of our transaction on the 31st December 2014. Firstly, we eliminated the 3-month reporting lag for Alliance Boots and recast prior year results with no lag. Secondly, segmental reporting from 1st January '15 includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD and combined corporate costs. And lastly, fiscal 2015 results include equity earnings in Alliance Boots for the 4 month of September to December 2014 and full consolidation of Alliance Boots earnings for the 8 months from January to August 2015.  I'm proud of our achievements and accomplishments in fiscal 2015, closing our transaction, delivering strong financial performance and reporting a combined results for WBA require great teamwork across the organization. 
Looking now at our overall performance for the year. Net sales for fiscal year 2015 were $103.4 billion. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $4.7 billion; managed expense, $605 million. The tax rate was 19.9% and net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance was $4.2 billion or $4.00 per diluted share.  On an adjusted basis, our operating income was $6.2 billion as compared to fiscal 2014, the key factors which drove our fiscal 2015 results for the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations combined with growth in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Adjusted net interest expense for the year was $464 million, reflecting increased level of debt associated with the second step of the Alliance Boots transaction.  Adjusted tax rate was 27.8%, which was lower than we were expecting due to business mix and certain discrete items that benefited us primarily in the fourth quarter. This resulted in adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2015 of $4.1 billion equating to $3.88 per diluted share. 
So now I will quickly take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the fiscal year. So GAAP earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal year 2015 of $4.00 per diluted share reconciles the adjusted earnings of $3.88 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.12 per share reflects additions of $0.17 of LIFO provision costs in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.35 of restructuring-related costs, that's from our cost optimization and store closure program, and a net favorable $0.02 transaction and acquisition-related items from executing step 2 of the merger with Alliance Boots. These additions were more than offset by removal of a $0.54 gain on our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares and an additional net $0.12 gain from special items. And a detailed reconciliation of all component items is included as an Appendix to the slides. 
So moving on to our fourth quarter results. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $28.5 billion, an increase of 50% versus the comparable quarter in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the quarter was $836 million, and net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $26 million, creating $0.02 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, operating income increased to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the consolidation of Alliance Boots. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $969 million or $0.88 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 14.3% on adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter in the prior year. It should also be noted that the fourth quarter results last year included 3 months equity earnings as a result of Walgreens 45% interest in Alliance Boots compared to fully consolidated results in this year's fourth quarter. 
Let me now take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings of $0.02 per diluted share for the quarter reconciles the adjusted earnings of $0.88 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.86 per share incorporates the following additions: $0.05 of LIFO provision costs in Retail Pharmacy USA; $0.20 of restructuring-related costs; $0.21 of transaction and acquisition-related items in regard to step 2 of the merger with Alliance Boots; a $0.37 loss on our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares; and net $0.03 from special items. 
So now I will take you through the performance of each of our 3 divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Firstly, please remember that we sold a majority stake in our infusion business on 7th of April, with a minority position of shared earnings in Option Care now flows through the income statement as post-tax earnings from equity method investments. So looking first at the division's fiscal year performance. Total sales were $81 billion, a year-over-year increase of 6.0%. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 6.4% for the full year. On a GAAP basis for fiscal 2015, gross profit was $21.8 billion while SG&A was $18.2 billion, resulting in operating income of $3.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, gross profit for the full year was $22.1 billion, SG&A was $17.2 billion and operating income was $5.1 billion. 
Adjusted operating income increased 4.8%, driven by strong sales performance and tight cost control. Please remember when assessing this increase that the benefit of these 2 factors were partially offset by the inclusion of Walgreens share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots and operating income in the prior year. So excluding this impact, adjusted operating income in the division grew by 12.5%.  Substantial progress was made in controlling SG&A during the year as a result of benefits associated with our cost-savings program. This was a significant driver of the division's year-on-year performance. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses decreased by 85 basis points year-over-year. At the end of fiscal year, the division operated 8,173 retail stores. 
So now let's turn to the division's fourth quarter performance. Retail Pharmacy USA's total sales in the quarter were $19.9 billion, an increase of 4.7% over the fourth quarter in the prior year. The total sales in comparable stores increased by 6.5%. On a GAAP basis for the quarter, gross profit was $5.3 billion while SG&A was $4.7 billion, resulting in operating income of $511 million. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $5.4 billion while SG&A was $4.3 billion. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of $1.1 billion was down 10.1% over the comparable quarter in the prior year. This was primarily due from having new equity earnings at Alliance Boots in current quarter versus 3 months in the comparable period. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating income grew by 1.2%. We were able to increase adjusted gross profit dollars compared to the final quarter of fiscal 2014 despite lower gross margins, while at the same time, delivering SG&A efficiencies through our cost-savings program. 
So let's now look at the pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 9.3% for the fiscal year. We filled 894 million prescriptions, including immunizations, that's on a 30-day adjusted basis, an increase of 4.4% over last year, with prescriptions filled in comparable stores up 4.6% year-on-year. In the fourth quarter, comparable pharmacy sales were up 10.0% as we filled 222 million prescriptions, an increase of 4.6% over the equivalent quarter in the prior year, with prescriptions filled in comparable stores, up 5.1%. Year-over-year we continue to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D and ACA-funded scripts, resulting in our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increasing to 19.1% for the year ended for the year ended 31st of August, an increase of approximately 20 basis points. 
The benefits of positive sales growth were, however, substantially offset by pharmacy gross margin pressure consistent with our expectations. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, including the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail and the mix of specialty products, which carry a lower margin percentage.  The decrease in pharmacy margins is partially offset by additional branded to generic drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. While we continue to anticipate margin pressure, we remain confident in our strategy to drive access of critical programs such as Medicare Part D and deepen our payer relationships to grow our pharmacy business over time. 
Moving now onto the retail products' performance within Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail sales increased by 1.9% for fiscal year 2015, while comparable sales increased 1.5%. As anticipated, the rate of sales growth was slightly slower in the fourth quarter as we continue to remove our more inefficient promotions, reduce store numbers and optimize store opening hours. Sales increased 0.8% in total and by 0.4% on a comparable sales basis. Overall, our strategy continues to be to drive sales growth and improve profitability, and I am pleased to report that gross profit margins have increased for the sixth quarter in succession. 
Over the past 18 months, we have improved our product mix, with our key health and wellness categories now contributing to higher proportion of total sales. We've also enhanced our merchandising tools, continued to optimize our promotional performance and upgraded on-shelf availability, ensuring products are in-store at the right price. And finally, we have improved sourcing with a higher level of our own branded products. 
In fiscal year 2016, we plan to continue to invest to drive our strategy and improve our customer offer. We will take what we've learned from our successful No7 test in Phoenix and New York City, where we saw a positive lift in both beauty and overall sales and rollout the new beauty offering to an additional 1,600 stores for a total of 2,000. With this new offer, we will elevate the customer experience through better fixtures, improved customer care, space optimization and selected store upgrades. We're also advancing the personalization of our Balance Rewards program, with more offers targeted to our everyday points program to our health and beauty customers. Through these efforts, we're striving to improve our customers' experience, expand our profit margin in the front of store and continue to grow sales in key customer categories. 
With that, let me turn to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty businesses in 8 countries. As a quick reminder, our biggest operations are Boots in the U.K. followed by Mexico. We also have retail pharmacies in Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and Lithuania. At the end of the fiscal year, the division operated 4,582 retail stores. I will focus my commentary for this division primarily on the most recent quarterly results as the fiscal year only has 8 months of data and, therefore, isn't all that meaningful, particularly, as it does not cover the important holiday season. 
Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.5 billion. Sales growth when compared with our third quarter was mainly due to the expected stronger sales in seasonal categories combined with currency benefits, mainly the British pound strengthening versus the dollar. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion and SG&A was $1.3 billion, resulting in operating income of $196 million. On an adjusted basis, gross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion and SG&A expense was $1.2 billion, which resulted in operating income of $242 million. Adjusted operating margin was 7.0% for the quarter, which was in line with post-acquisition figure of the last 8 months of the fiscal year. 
So now let's look more closely at the operating performance of the division. On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable store sales growth for the quarter was 4.3%. Comparable store retail sales growth of 4.5%, being somewhat stronger than pharmacy at 4.1%. Comparable store sales growth in Boots U.K. was 3.5% in the quarter. Growth across all Boots U.K. retail sales categories resulted in comparable store retail sales growth of 4.0%, good performances in beauty and from online offering being the largest factors. 
In beauty, No7, our award winning beauty brand celebrated its 80th anniversary with another good quarter, with both skin care and cosmetics delivering double-digit sales growth in the U.K. Sales of No7 Protect & Perfect Advanced Serum continue to be strong, more than 1 year on from their launch, supported by their continuing marketing program, which highlights the clinically proven product benefits, which I talked about on our last earnings call.  During the quarter, we also launched No7 advanced day and night creams, with a new colored cosmetics campaign. Both of these initiatives were well received by our customers. 
Our U.K. website, boots.com, continued to see strong growth, with orders during the order up more than 65% over the same period last year.  In the beginning of August, we further enhanced the convenience of our order and collect offer, now enabling customers to order by 8:00 p.m. and still collect in-store from 12 noon the following day. In the fourth quarter, nearly 70% of all our online orders in the U.K. were collected in-store.  Outside the U.K., our businesses in Mexico, Thailand and the Republic of Ireland all delivered pro forma constant currency comparable store sales for the quarter, well above the average of the division, as did Boots Opticians in the U.K. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division in the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming constant currency and excluding acquisitions and disposals, on this basis sales increased by 5.0% over the same quarter in the prior year.  Sales growth was particularly strong in Norway, where our wholesale business won a major new contract [indiscernible] hospital pharmacy, which began right on the start of calendar 2015, and 5 other countries, where our businesses each achieved double-digit comparable sales growth in the quarter. This included 2 of our largest wholesale businesses in Turkey and Germany. 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was up $133 million while adjusted operating income was $158 million. Adjusted operating income margin for the quarter was 2.7% compared to 2.9% for the 8 months post-acquisition. This, in part, reflects the seasonal nature of pharmaceutical wholesaling. 
So having covered our divisional performance, I would now like to turn to our synergy program, one of the key drivers of profit growth. The combined net synergies for fiscal 2015 were $799 million, significantly above our target of at least $650 million. This includes $81 million plus Pfizer synergies in the fourth quarter, which relates to activities commencing in prior fiscal years.  Consistent with our prior reporting, these synergies are allocated across each segment. They do not include any benefit from our long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen or the benefits of refinancing the legacy Alliance Boots indebtedness at a lower cost.  For fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect at least -- to reach at least $1 billion in combined net synergies. As time goes on and the combined management team works closely together, there are, of course, a number of other synergies being identified and actioned, but many of them are simply not practical to quantify as they blend into our core operations. 
So moving now to our cost-savings program, which is as you know, is another key area of focus. As previously announced, we have a target of $1.5 billion of cost savings to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. We expect the pretax charges associated with this program, as previously stated, between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, with cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. We continue to make good progress towards this goal and achieve more than half of the program's expected savings as of the end of the fiscal year. 
In the Retail Pharmacy USA division, which is the primary driver of this program, this included closing 75 stores in the quarter, making a total of 84 store closures in fiscal 2015 as part of our plan to close approximately 200 stores in total.  Actions taken during fiscal 2015 have resulted in pretax charges totaling $542 million, including $223 million for asset impairments, $202 million for real estate closures and $117 million for severance and other business transition and exit costs. 
So now I'd now like to look at cash flow and capital deployment. GAAP operating profit cash flow was $5.7 billion for the full fiscal year and $1.5 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the full year and $1.1 billion in the quarter.  As it is hard for you to gauge our cash-generating abilities from today's results, I'd like to give you some insight into our operating cash flow and working capital priorities. We remain intensely focused in driving cash flow across our 3 business segments. Within our Retail Pharmacy USA division, during the year, we improved inventory management in both pharmacy and retail products. We have more opportunities in inventory and have a renewed focus on accounts receivable and accounts payable, all with the aim of driving further working capital savings. We will continue to apply the same discipline in Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Total capital expenditure was $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year and $361 million in the quarter. After the merger, we put in place operational governance procedures to improve capital and ensure that we are prudently maintaining our infrastructure while investing in the right growth initiatives to generate return to shareholders. This process is working well. You will see a step-up in capital spend from the third to fourth quarter, which reflects our renewed drive to invest in key areas and develop our customer proposition, including information technology. 
So moving onto our key financing activities. In line with our philosophy of having an efficient balance sheet, we completed $395 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization, bringing the total purchases under this program to $726 million by fiscal year end. Since then, an existing 10b5-1 program has been completed, in which we acquired an additional $110 million of shares. We now have $2.2 billion of value remaining under our authorized plan.  In addition, as we previously announced, we redeemed the $1.75 billion of legacy Walgreens debt in August. As we've said before, we remain committed to a long-term dividend payout rate -- payout target between 30% and 35% of adjusted net earnings. 
Now before I finish and hand back to Stefano, let me just spend a few minutes on the impact of our agreement to acquire Rite Aid and on fiscal 2016 guidance. As you know, the agreed price per share for Rite Aid is $9, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt. The consideration for the shares will be paid in cash from existing new resource. The transaction is, as you would expect, subject to approval by Rite Aid shareholders, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. We have done significant analysis on how we can bring the 2 companies together, including antitrust analysis and we'll work closely with the regulators to bring the transaction to completion as soon as possible. That said, we anticipate the transaction closing in the second half of calendar 2016. The exact timing of this will clearly determine the impact on our financial results. 
Clearly, we are very confident in taking everything into account, the transaction will be suitably accretive for us. We have been prudent in our assumptions for the business and have been realistic about our expectations for the markets in which we operate. That said, we expect the transaction to be accretive during the first full year after completion on our usual adjusted basis.  In addition to timing, there are a number of other factors that will impact us. We've identified in excess $1 billion of gross synergy that we must -- that we will start working to capture as soon as completion takes place. But we must recognize that while some of these are relatively easy to identify, others will require investment and will take time to deliver. 
As we are paying cash for the acquisition, we have taken the decision to suspend our share repurchase program and intend to redeploy that cash to partly fund the transaction. This means that in 2016, we will not enjoy the earnings accretion of the buybacks we originally planned. In fact, we'll be running a relatively inefficient balance sheet for a short period of time.  The transaction will also cause a temporary increase in leverage, but this does not represent an underlying change in financial policy. We'll put in place a glide path to deliver metrics consistent with our commitment to solid investment grade. 
So with all that said, let me conclude by talking about our outlook for fiscal year 2016. As you know, we previously had a stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.60. We committed at our Analyst meeting in April, that on completion of our budgeting process, we would come back to you to give an updated view of 2016.  Based on our budget and further evaluation of both risks and opportunity, we factored in our currency headwind of around $0.13 since the previous Walgreens management initially provided our FY '16 adjusted EPS goal back in August 2014. We're issuing new guidance for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.55. This change is primarily to reflect the impact of suspending our share buyback program, to apply these funds towards the consideration for the transaction. This guidance assumes no material accretion from the planned acquisition of Rite Aid, which is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016. 
Please also remember that we have currency translational exposure primarily based on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause particularly volatility in the sales, gross margin and SG&A items as it did this quarter.  As Stefano indicated, we anticipate to publish numerical synergy targets from the merger between Walgreens and Alliance Boots to be met during 2016, and we'll advise you after we have achieved that target. The synergies and benefits from the transaction with Rite Aid will be almost entirely within our U.S. Retail Pharmacy division, and so will be reflected in these figures rather than separately itemized programs.  Clearly, we will continue to drive hard efficiencies, costs and procurement, but we see this as normal working practice rather than unique and discrete projects. And so going further beyond 2016, we would expect our earnings growth to return to a more normal fiscal challenging low double-digit growth. 
In terms of the shape of the quarters, please remember that both our first and second quarters of fiscal year '16 are non-comparable given that we closed the merger on the 31st of December 2014. Seasonality is most prominent in our retail pharmacy segments, with the first quarter is typically the weakest. Our second quarter picks up most of the holiday season, which will be more prominent going forward as we will consolidate December results for Retail Pharmacy International. This will include Boots performance in December, which is typically its most important trading month. We also expect the shape of the second half of the fiscal year to be generally consistent with what we saw in fiscal 2015, with adjusted earnings per share in Q3 and Q4 stepping down sequentially from Q2. 
So with that, I will turn the call back to Stefano."

So another good year, but a year of transition that has brought many challenges but also with many successes, including our announcement with Rite Aid. It has been particularly gratifying to have been able to keep our team on track and maintain our momentum in our businesses, both in the U.S. and around the world, while at the same time be able to study and understand our new markets and deliver corporate expansion as we are doing with Rite Aid. 
As CEO, I very much recognize my role is both to support my team in achieving also partly their goals but also in creating the opportunities and direction for them to outperform and identify sources of growth and value enhancement while helping mark the route for sustained growth to secure the future for the company well beyond my tenure. As we stand today, we have potential opportunities in many businesses, in many geographies. We continue to review all the opportunities open to us to assess where best to deploy our capital to provide the best return of our investors. 
The health care market is extraordinarily dynamic with many moving parts, and these dynamics create new opportunities and new ideas all the time. A key part of my role is to make sure that we pursue these opportunities where they are desirable to do so and not waste time and resources to where it is now and also to ensure that we do that without distracting our teams on delivering on our long- and short-term plans of our existing businesses. Over time, you can expect to see us complement the development of our existing businesses with further additions that will help us better define and differentiate our business. 
As we look at our opportunities around the globe, given the unique dynamic of the U.S. market, it is not surprising that the best opportunity we have found this year has been here, while elsewhere our expansion has been through the selective purchase event and a small bolt-on acquisitions to our original business.  The global health care market and perhaps the U.S. markets, more than any, are ready for change and openness to new ideas and new approaches while it provides care. As a leading global health care company, we have the potential to play a tiny role in this evolution. We have always married prudence with a willingness to find innovative solutions and think about things in new ways and these are qualities I am glad to be spreading across the group and I believe will form the foundation for the success of the business going forward. 
Now let's open up for questions. Gerald, please?"

We're really pleased with what's happened. Customers have signed into this program. We have, I think, about 27 million of customers signed into it and they have quite a few points. And more importantly, as we analyze how they're redeeming the points, we're seeing encouraging behavior where people are actually selecting more and more own-brand products and bigger baskets and products they may not otherwise have bought. So it's really early days. I mean, the program has been out there for only a matter of months, but the behavior we're seeing in these customers are encouraging and it is exactly the type of behavior we've seen in other loyalty programs that we know of well in the group. So that's where we are, and of course, we intend, as we have done progressively since we launched the program just over 3 years ago now, to invest wisely and carefully to ensure we get a return of that investment, and we're seeing the same here where can invest more in this program and will do so in the years ahead."

We have done this because we believe that we can extract a lot of synergies, rationalizing the combined company. So I would say from internal sources and the harmonization of prices in terms of harmonization and not improvement, the harmonization of our know-how something in software, something, of course, in the combination of the stores as we were discussing before. There's something from our product lines. Well, we are not thinking of really improving our position with the payers because at the end of the day, we are in an environment where the margins are decreasing. So it was decreasing. We are in an environment where there is a lot of competition and the fact that we put together 2 companies would not reduce the competition. Not just the competition among pharmacies, think of the other tandem, think of the mail order, think of the people who are specialized in certain categories, like the specialty, for instance. So there are many people working in this area. I don't believe that this will really give us an additional power. But we have not accounted on that when we have put together our numbers. We have put together our numbers very, very carefully and very prudently."

So I do appreciate that's made the segmental analysis a little tougher for you to follow. But by doing it on this basis of procurement, we really are therefore reflecting where the volume is, where the activity is. Another result, obviously, with the Retail Pharmacy USA being, by far, our biggest segment, then you should think of the synergies being heavily, heavily weighted towards the U.S. segment. It's the basis that I would always think about. I think as we annualized through as we get to the third quarter, which I guess will be our first sort of clean year-on-year quarter, it will be a little bit easier for you to see. And of course, it's the hard synergies, which are the ones that we're quantifying. But really a lot of the -- of what are, in effect, synergies, but they're not the ones that we can quantify. These are the ones that are really coming through, as we know. Increasingly, an integrated combined management team are working very much together on many of the programs, sharing best practice, and that's very much business as usual now rather than run through each synergy work stream."
